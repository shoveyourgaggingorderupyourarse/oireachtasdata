    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030900002#A00400"><p>I welcome everyone to this online meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, Members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I ask that committee members confirm their locations before contributing to ensure they are adhering to this constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.</p> <p>  Before we begin our public engagement, we considered the minutes of our meetings of 18, 23 and 25 February and 2 March at our private meeting last week.  Standing Order 107(3) requires that the minutes are agreed in public session.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee&rsquo;s webpage.</p> <p>  Today we are engaging with officials from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to examine its financial statements for 2019.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from SBCI: Mr. Ian Black, interim CEO, Ms Suzanne Sweeney, head of lending, and Mr. Ray Mangan, head of risk, finance and operations.  I welcome them to the meeting and thank them and their staff for the briefing material they have prepared for the committee.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask that members and witnesses mute themselves when not contributing in order that we will not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off or on silent mode. </p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  If, therefore, their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister, or of the objectives of such policies.  They are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask the witnesses to state their names the first time they contribute.</p> <p>  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030900002#A00500"><p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, was established in September 2014 to address difficulties that small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs, were perceived to be experiencing in accessing funding from Irish credit institutions, due to lingering effects of the 2008 banking crisis.  Since 2017, SBCI has been tasked to provide assistance to SMEs where access to credit is constrained by specific sectoral or economic market failures, including risks arising due to Brexit.  To the best of my recollection, this is the first occasion on which representatives of SBCI have appeared before the committee.</p> <p>  SBCI&rsquo;s operations are financed through a combination of State and European funding.  Its borrowings are guaranteed by the Minster for Finance, as provided for under the governing legislation.  The initial business model adopted by SBCI was based on providing wholesale finance to intermediate financial institutions that act as on-lenders to deliver low-cost funding to SMEs and to introduce competition to the market.  The on-lenders include both mainstream banks and non-bank specialist lenders.</p> <p>  SBCI now delivers services in three ways.  It continues to offer long-term, low-cost liquidity facilities to intermediate financial institutions that in turn extend finance to SMEs, provides guarantee and risk-sharing facilities to improve the ability of SMEs to access finance and acts as a service provider to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in respect of the credit guarantee schemes.</p> <p>  The risk-sharing model is designed to provide partial credit guarantees to lenders in order to facilitate the advancement of credit to SMEs.  SBCI added to its risk-sharing portfolio in June 2019 when it launched the future growth loan scheme.  This scheme is designed to assist SMEs in making long-term investments in their businesses by providing loans over terms of eight to ten years.  This followed the introduction of other risk-sharing schemes such as the Brexit loan scheme in 2018 and the agriculture cash flow support loan scheme in 2017.  Operationally, all potential on-lenders are required to demonstrate to SBCI that they have the necessary financial strength and capability to provide the required level of service to SMEs.  SBCI carries out reviews on a cyclical basis to gain assurance that on-lenders continue to operate within the accepted risk parameters.</p> <p>  During the 2019 financial year, SBCI used credit facilities from two international and two national funders to provide funding products to SMEs through six on-lending partners, namely, three bank and three non-bank on-lenders.  At the end of the year, SBCI had lending of more than &euro;555 million in issue to its six on-lenders.  This represented a net reduction of 11.5% in the level of lending over the year when compared with end 2018 lending of &euro;627 million.  SBCI&rsquo;s operating expenses in the year amounted to &euro;9.4 million.  This included &euro;2.7 million in respect of salaries paid to SBCI staff.  Members may wish to note that the staff are employees of the National Treasury Management Agency seconded to the SBCI.  The agency also provides administration supports to SBCI, including premises, HR functions, procurement and financial management services.  Costs incurred by the National Treasury Management Agency are recovered from SBCI.  Salary costs incurred by SBCI in 2019 include performance-related payments of &euro;103,000 that were awarded to seven SBCI staff members in respect of 2019.  The then CEO of SBCI received performance-related pay of &euro;25,000 for that year.</p><p>Income earned by SBCI in 2019 amounted to &euro;9.3 million.  This included net interest of just under &euro;5 million and operating expenses recovered from Departments that fund SBCI's various schemes.  For 2019, SBCI incurred a loss of nearly &euro;500,000.  I issued an unqualified audit opinion on the 2019 financial statements. </p><p> Finally, during 2019, SBCI commissioned an external consultancy firm to perform a strategic review of its operations in the context of the State's range of supports for SMEs.  The review noted that the original purpose of SBCI had abated because the SME market no longer faced the same challenges of credit availability as was the case when SBCI was established.  Nevertheless, the review found that there remained challenges to be addressed, including ensuring access for SMEs to appropriate credit products promoting competitive credit terms and supporting specific SME sectors.  The report went on to make a number of recommendations to be considered as part of SBCI's future strategy, including undertaking more detailed appraisal of the specific market challenges within the SME credit sector in order to assess SBCI's methods of intervention.  The subsequent market disruption brought about as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic will need to be considered as part of such appraisals.  </p><p> The chief executive officer of SBCI will be able to provide an update on the progress achieved in regard to the recommendations made in the external review.</p></speech>

I now invite the CEO of SBCI, Mr. Black, to make his opening statement.  I hope he will appreciate that our time is limited and I ask that he keep his statement to five minutes.  I will give him a reminder after approximately four minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Black" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030900002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to appear before the committee today.  I am joined by Ms Suzanne Sweeney, head of lending, and Ray Mangan, head of risk, finance and operations.  SBCI is Ireland's promotional financial institution for SMEs and has been in business for a little over six years.  In that time, we have provided more than &euro;2.3 billion in low-cost, flexible funding and more than 35,000 individual facilities to Irish SMEs and farmers.  More than &euro;1.9 billion of SBCI-supported facilities have been drawn down by SMEs to date.  We serve SMEs of all sizes and our individual loan facilities have ranged in size from &euro;5,000 to &euro;4 million.  The launch of the Government's Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme has provided an additional &euro;2 billion in guarantee capacity to support the SME finance market.  To date, the credit guarantee scheme has provided more than 4,000 SMEs with funding of &euro;264 million.</p> <p>  At the outset, I would like to ask members of the committee who are aware of any constituent who owns or works for an SME and is looking for funding, to please refer them to us.  We will point them in the right direction as to the facilities that are most appropriate for them and where they can access those facilities through our on-lending partners.  While SME awareness of the supports we offer through our lending partners is relatively high, we would welcome members' help in bringing our services to the attention of their constituents  wherever possible.</p> <p>  To date, we have teamed up with 33 on-lenders, comprising the five retail banks operating in Ireland, nine non-bank institutions and 19 credit unions.  Those credit unions are located throughout the country.  In our early days, we sourced low-cost funding which we lent to partners to allow them to lend to their SME customers at a discount on the prevailing market rate.  This gave SMEs access to lower-cost funding that provided both cost savings and cash flow benefits to them.  In recent years, our role has evolved to reflect changing market conditions.  We began offering risk-sharing schemes through partner on-lenders and we now support SME borrowers through five separate risk-sharing schemes tailored to meet specific challenges facing SMEs.  Risk sharing allows lending partners to provide loans without taking all of the credit risk, which facilitates easier access for SMEs to these loans through more attractive security requirements, lending criteria or loan pricing.</p> <p>  SBCI's countercyclical model has allowed it to respond quickly to emerging challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit.  The value of SBCI as a ready-made conduit for State support was clearly evidenced by the delivery of the Covid-19 working capital scheme and the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme as timely responses to the crisis.  The provision of risk-sharing schemes was made possible by SBCI acting as Ireland's conduit for Government funding and European SME support schemes, initiated by institutions including the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund.  These schemes aim to make it easier for SMEs to access finance for working capital and investment purposes.  We also operate the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, launched last year, on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We have operated a similar credit guarantee scheme to enhance SME access to finance since 2016.</p> <p>  I would like to brief the committee on the scheduled strategic review undertaken by  SBCI, which concluded last year and resulted in the development of a new strategy for the period 2020 to 2025.  This review was informed by an external analysis undertaken by EY and was conducted in accordance with the requirement in the legislation establishing SBCI for a periodic review to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.  The key elements of SBCI's strategy for the period 2020 to 2025 include our plans to launch a range of new SME funding options during the period, to be Ireland's conduit for major European SME funding programmes, to explore the potential for supporting new SME energy retrofit schemes, and to explore the potential for supporting new loans to higher-risk, higher-growth SMEs, together with new forms of finance such as mezzanine and junior debt.</p> <p>  I would like to conclude my opening remarks by acknowledging the contribution to SBCI's development over the past six years of Nick Ashmore, who served as CEO from its inception until last month.  I was appointed interim CEO by the SBCI board pending the recruitment of a permanent CEO.  I will step down when that appointment is made and return to my role as chief financial and operating officer at the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  As members are aware, the NTMA provides staffing and infrastructure supports for SBCI.  While SBCI is a separate entity with its own board, all SBCI staff are employees of the NTMA.  I hope that my opening remarks and the slide presentation we circulated separately have given the committee a better understanding of the work of SBCI.  Ms Sweeney, Mr. Mangan and I will do our best to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030900002#B00400"><p>I thank Mr. Black for his statement.  The lead committee member today is Deputy Sean Sherlock, who has 15 minutes, followed by Deputy Catherine Murphy, who has ten minutes.  I will give Deputy Sherlock a reminder after 12 minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030900002#B00500"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I thank Mr. Black and his colleagues for attending before the committee today.  I want to start with the situation of Ulster Bank, which is a key lender in the SME food sector.  In my analysis, it has been seen as the key bank to go to for small to medium-sized food companies seeking to access lending for productive purposes.  I want to get a sense from Mr. Black as to, first, whether there is now a high level of exposure for that sector, given the decision of Ulster Bank to pull out of the market, and, second, whether SBCI is aware of this and if it is something that is on its agenda.  If we take the two challenges of Covid and Brexit, as well as the importance of the food sector and the recognition of Ulster Bank as being a go-to bank for small to medium-sized food companies that are export driven, is there a consciousness within SBCI of the need to plug that gap in lending?  Is this a conversation that is taking place at present?  I would like to get that perspective from Mr. Black, if I may.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Black" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030900002#B00600"><p>We very much regret the phased departure of Ulster Bank from Ireland.  That would be my opening comment.  In terms of competition, it is not helpful.  In regard to our dealings with Ulster Bank, the bank has confirmed that it continues to offer the full range of services to SMEs, including SBCI and Government-backed schemes.</p><p>There will be no change for the time being.  As reported in the media, we are aware of Ulster Bank's discussions and the memorandum of understanding, MOU, signed with AIB, and discussions with Permanent TSB in terms of its commercial and micro-SME loan books.  Ulster Bank will require the consent of the SBCI in advance of any transfer of any and all SBCI-supported products or assets.  I note that Ulster Bank has capacity under the Covid-19 capital loan and credit guarantee schemes and this will be made available to SME's.  It will be there in the short term and will continue to provide those services to SMEs, including those in the food sector.  Obviously, the situation will become clearer over the next period in terms of its discussions with AIB and Permanent TSB.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030900002#C00200"><p>Is my perception right and is my research solid in saying that there is a strong relationship between food companies and Ulster Bank in particular?  I accept that there are strong relationships with other banks.  Ulster Bank is, however, the go-to bank for certain entities in the food sector.  I refer, for example, to small, mainly family-run start-ups or, perhaps, high potential start-up companies that are scaling up and exporting.</p> <p>  I am seeking comfort from the SBCI on what Mr. Black said about the MOU.  Is that Mr. Black's view, insofar as he can speak for Ulster Bank and insofar as we are still going through a process here?  I do not want to see a chunk of lending potential slipping off the radar and a chunk of a sector that is vital to Ireland's economic interests finding itself in a position where it has no go-to bank for the type of funding the SBCI provides to the on-lenders.  Can Mr. Black give me some level of comfort in that regard?  A signal from the SBCI in respect of that matter would give some assurances to people who live, breathe and work in this sector every day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Black" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030900002#C00300"><p>I believe the chief executive of Ulster Bank said its preference is that these assets would be transferred to a full-service retail bank.  That is my expectation at this point.  Again, it is positive to see those negotiations and discussions are ongoing at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030900002#C00400"><p>I understand that the agriculture fund set up by the SBCI was oversubscribed.  Is it the view of the SBCI that there is potential for a new funding facility in that sector?  Again, this is a vital sector.  It is export-driven and faces the headwinds of Covid-19.  Obviously, Brexit still hangs above many companies and producers like the sword of Damocles.  Is it the intention of the SBCI to look at potential funding in the agriculture sector?  It is lending for productive purposes.  The fund in question was oversubscribed in the previous round.  Mr. Black might also give us his perspective on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Black" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030900002#C00500"><p>That was one of the first schemes.  It was a facility with &euro;150 million in funding.  It is correct that it was fully subscribed.  A number of other schemes have been launched, including the Brexit and Covid-19 working capital schemes that are available to parts of the agriculture sector; not farmers, but other parts.  There are also the Covid-19 credit guarantee and future growth loan schemes.  All those schemes are available to farmers and non-farmers.  We are also looking at future schemes, however.  We have set out both schemes that are available in our slide presentation.  We are also discussing another scheme, that is, a European guarantee fund, with the European Investment Fund.  Again, however, that is planned for later this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030900002#C00600"><p>Can Mr. Black talk me through the strategic review for the period 2020 to 2025?  He referred to new SME funding for the energy retrofit sector.  How advanced is that conversation at present?  When does Mr. Black see the SBCI moving into that sector for productive lending?  How does he propose that those moneys will be disbursed?</p> <p>  Reference was made to the credit unions.  To what extent does Mr. Black see credit unions as a viable option for funding into this sector?  It very much filters down to the local economy.  Where stands the conversation in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Black" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030900002#C00700"><p>Funding in respect of the energy retrofit sector is broken into two parts.  One is to do with residential retrofit and the other with SME-related retrofit projects.  We are working with the Department to assist it in designing a scheme for residential energy retrofit projects.  Obviously, funding is only one part of a residential retrofit project.  It is looking at a one-stop shop.  Given the number of residential homes to be retrofitted, it will be a major undertaking.  Those discussions are at the preliminary stage.  It is more likely that something might happen next year rather than this year in respect of the residential energy retrofit scheme.</p> <p>  I believe some of the existing and future schemes will be available for the SME retrofit schemes.  As the Senator can understand, because of Covid-19 and Brexit, SMEs have paused some of that investment in light of the fact that the priority is to conserve cash and, perhaps, survive.  I expect, however, that investment by SMEs in those kinds of schemes will increase once the restrictions are lifted over time.</p></speech>

We are very much focused on the financing work stream, however.  There are many other work streams.  Again, the design of the financing will depend on other elements to the whole retrofit scheme and how much of it will be grant-funded rather than a loan fund and if there will be tax breaks, etc.  There are many elements involved.</p> <p>  In terms of the "how", as we have done before, we will be working as an on-lender to intermediaries.  We are, under our legislative functions, there to encourage competition and increase the diversity of the supply of funding.  We would, therefore, absolutely welcome credit unions as well as other funders.</p></speech>

The pay rates were set by the SBCI but the employment contracts are with NTMA.  All the staff of the SBCI are employees of the NTMA working for the SBCI.  The pay rates are determined by the SBCI and, ultimately, by its board.</p></speech>

They are, therefore, individually negotiated contracts.  Every employee has a contract with the NMTA.  The remuneration is a fixed basic salary and there is a possibility of performance-related pay.</p><p>Performance is the word and it depends on the economic environment.  Given the economic environment we have experienced over the past 12 months, no performance-related pay has been awarded in the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, in respect of last year because of the difficult economic times.</p></speech>

The company made a loss but SBCI's mandate is not to maximise profits.  It is very much to deliver on its objectives.  The reason it made a small loss was because of a reduction in, what the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to as, net interest income.  As a result of quantitative easing, the level of funding required by the banks has reduced.  There is much cash available, meaning, therefore, the funding is not required.  Accordingly, our funding from those sources was reduced and, in turn, our income was reduced.</p> <p>  We have a choice.  We have charted our services back to the where we design and assist in the design of schemes.  We cover that on a cost basis with the relevant lending department.</p></speech>

We could do that by charging more and not giving the benefit.  All of the benefit we derive on our products is passed on to the SMEs.  It is really about cost recovery.  To the extent that we made a small loss, perhaps we should have charged more to the relevant lending departments or the cost we would charge to the guarantee should be somewhat higher.  One has to look at it over the longer term.  I think one year would not probably be fair.</p></speech>

Given Covid and Brexit, it is more than justified.  It has been great for the country to have the SBCI in place because we have been able to deliver on the Covid working capital schemes, the Covid credit guarantee schemes, etc.  The fact the entity exists enabled us to deliver on those schemes.  It is countercyclical.  One does more when the economy is suffering and maybe less when there is not so much of a need to do so and the market is working well.</p></speech>

The Act specified that the finances were to be used for the Irish SME sector and for the benefit of the Irish economy.</p> <p>  I want to focus attention on Bibby Financial Services and whether the moneys are exclusively used for the benefit of Irish entities.  Bibby paid its parent company &euro;479,000 in interest in 2014.  By 2019, it received almost &euro;300,000 from England which was a substantial swing.  Looking at those kinds of numbers, how confident is Mr. Black that the money is exclusively spent in Ireland and that we are not benefiting entities outside of the State?  What controls in respect of this does SBCI have in place?</p></speech>

Details of those loans have to be provided by the on-lender to SBCI to ensure that happens.  In addition, we also have third party on-lender reviews.  We have an external party, in this case KPMG, doing external reviews of the on-lenders to ensure their loan reporting is correct and agrees with the online records, as well as complying with any covenants or conditions attached to those loans.  We are happy and satisfied that the loans are being used only for eligible purposes.</p> <p>  We are not focused on the on-lenders.  We are very much focused on delivering benefits to the SMEs and making sure that the benefit in terms of the lower interest rate is being passed on to them.</p></speech>

Davy Corporate Finance was an adviser to this sale.  There was a particular individual who was director of both companies.  The same signing audit partner was used for both.  Would that not be a conflict of interest?  That person was KPMG.  Would SBCI look for those kind of conflicts?  How would they show up if SBCI has the same internal auditor?  I know it is a small island, we have the same companies being asked to do work and there are Chinese walls and all the rest of it.

The &euro;70 million is a little like an overdraft limit.  It is the total that the company has been approved for in terms of facilities from SBCI.  The amount drawn goes up and down as a result of how much invoice discounting, factoring or funding it is providing to its SME clients.  That amount has not been fully drawn down.  Due to the nature of the product, we have slightly changed it from an operations point of view to allow the company, the on-lender, once a month to repay or draw down additional funding, in line with the level of business it is writing.  The reason is that to the extent it has too much funding the money might be left in a bank account, and with negative interest rates it does not make sense for Bibby Financial Services Ireland or any on-lender to have large funds earning negative rates.</p></speech>

As the CEO said, not all of that has been drawn.  To date, Bibby Financial Services Ireland has provided working capital facilities of up to &euro;135 million using that funding.  We are happy the funding is going through to the end SME.  As mentioned earlier, we get loan-by-loan details so we can be satisfied that the funding is going to the SMEs.  Overall, in the liquidity we provided through the banks and our non-bank on-lenders, the average loan size we would have seen through liquidity was typically about &euro;40,000.  Obviously, it differs depending on the type of product each on-lender is giving.  For example, some of our non-bank on-lenders provide asset finance on equipment, Bibby Financial Services Ireland provides working capital limits, so they would typically be higher, and the banks at the time were providing term loans.</p></speech>

I am about to go over time and the Chairman will cut me off.  What I am getting from Ms Sweeney is that the SBCI did not carry out an aged debt analysis.  That is a very specific term in its business.  Unfortunately, my position is that the SBCI was not set up for this purpose.  It is bailing out Sir John Bibby and his shipping company.  An aged debt analysis was not carried out in respect of that company.  What is more, I would question the solvency of Bibby and the fact that the SBCI promoted it and supported it to the tune of &euro;60 million it has drawn down from an approved sum of &euro;70 million.  In basic, ordinary day-to-day terms for politicians who vote on legislation to set up things like SBCI, that funding is to support employment and it equates to approximately &euro;2.5 million per job.</p></speech>

I will do so by making a proposal that the committee consider, under section 748 of the Companies Act, asking the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to examine the support that was given to Bibby and whether the money was used for its intended purpose.  Although I am no expert, my reading on this matter recently leads me to believe that Irish taxpayers have dished out &euro;60 million to support Sir John Bibby's commercial enterprises in the UK.</p></speech>

The bank has gone from profit to loss at a rate of &euro;1 million over two years, so how could it justify bonuses or pay-related bonuses?</p></speech>

Some of my colleague have raised the issue of Bibby Financial Services Ireland.  My understanding is that the SBCI is involved in providing and supporting lending to Irish companies.  However, with regard to Bibby Financial Services Ireland, my understanding is that its accounts in 2019 show &euro;299,000 lent to Bibby Line Group, a British shipping and finance company.  How does that arise if this funding is mainly aimed at Irish companies?</p></speech>

Our funding is only used for eligible purposes, that is, to lend to Irish SMEs.  In a sense, if the company has other resources, they are not our resources.  We are stating clearly that the funding provided by the SBCI can only be used for eligible purposes, which are lending to SMEs and passing on the benefit of this lower-cost lending to those SME businesses.</p></speech>

As I stated, we regret the departure of Ulster Bank.  One of the functions of the Act to encourage and promote new entrants into the Irish market for competition.  We encourage that.

First, is this company that the SBCI is dealing with the only non-bank on-lending partner that provides an invoice financing facility on behalf of SBCI?  Second, how does SBCI choose its co-lending partners?  What is the process?  Is there a procurement process?  Is the process open to all financial service providers?</p></speech>

At the moment the banks are providing invoice financing to their customers but in terms of the non-banks, Bibby currently is the only non-bank on-lender providing that service.</p> <p>  In terms of the process of being an on-lender, it is open to all and it is fair and transparent.  In the slide presentation we provided to the committee we set out that process.  What we want to ensure is that the process is fair but also that taxpayers' moneys, and the money of our European partners also, are protected.  The most important point is that the benefit of this funding goes to the SMEs.  Slides 19 and 20 set out the process for establishing an on-lender partner.  As I said, it is open to all.  We have a due diligence process in place designed to protect taxpayers' moneys.  We have to be happy with the structure proposed, the financial capabilities of the company, its experience in terms of credit and underwriting and also its operational capability to ensure that the benefit goes to the SMEs.</p></speech>

What does the SBCI do with an organisation like that where its own bank is now reluctant to give it additional funding?  It needs to keep its 80 employees to keep the operation going.  It will have to wait until the market opens up.  Can Mr. Black outline what it can do at this stage?</p></speech>

There is also the Credit Review Office to ensure that the decision is a fair decision.  Obviously, people should shop around, etc.  One of the legislative functions is that we have to provide additional credit in a prudent manner.  We need to be mindful of that but the Deputy is right.  With an 80% guarantee there is or should be a huge incentive to provide that funding.</p></speech>

One of the attractions of that scheme was that it had a very attractive interest rate.  I believe it was 2.95%, which was very attractive at the time.  That is why it was so over subscribed.  We are constantly looking at our existing schemes and looking for new schemes.  We are working towards a new scheme later in the year.  Again, they are in the slide presentation but the schemes are shown in order of term so there is a working capital facility, which is typically three years; the Covid credit guarantee scheme, which is five and a half years; and the future growth loan scheme, which is seven to ten years.

I would argue that the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme seemed to be very appropriate to that cohort of farmers, perhaps moreso than some of the other schemes.  Mr. Black mentioned the potential for new schemes.  Will they be based on the same type of model as the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme or will they be more reflective of the future growth loan scheme and others like that?</p></speech>

I thank them for their presentation and the slides they provided in advance of today's meeting.  I have a few questions on foot of that.  Based on when SBCI was initially established I understand that a loss of more than &euro;5.2 million has been incurred up to 2019.  Is there a bad debt provision for the SBCI and if not, why not?</p></speech>

The loss to date reflected the set-up costs and in terms of the establishment costs of getting the company up and running before the schemes were put in place so we had the staffing systems in place.  In terms of the question about a bad debts provision, the accounts are prepared in accordance with accounting standards, in this case FRS 102.  One is required, under that accounting standard, to carry out an impairment review at least once a year.  In terms of what we have, we have loans to banks, loans to non-banks and the risk sharing schemes.</p><p>In 2019, an impairment review was carried out and there was not a need to make a bad debt provision or an impairment provision at that time.  There was no objective evidence of impairment.  We lend our money to the banks and they lend on to the SMEs.  I do not expect to get a bad debt.  For that to happen the banks would have to fail.  That is unlikely.</p></speech>

Surely the costs being incurred are quite minimal unless the SBCI is being billed for those <i>pro rata</i>.</p><p>In his opening remarks, Mr. Black mentioned he used intermediaries to get lending out to market but I note that the SBCI also spent &euro;1 million on advertising.  Given the link between the intermediaries and their promotion of the SBCI, why is there a need to spend so much money?</p></speech>

A criticism might be that the deployment speed could be faster.  The advertising spend is about creating awareness within SMEs of the various schemes and how to apply for them to ensure they get the benefit of the funding.  This funding is provided by Government and European partners so if it is not used it is not a good thing from an SME point of view.  We are trying to ensure that awareness is increased.</p></speech>

I will focus on the feedback I am getting from businesses about the availability of SBCI funding during the Covid period.  I am hearing clearly that SBCI is not the problem.  SBCI is processing the applications diligently and being helpful but the difficulty is getting funding, particularly from the pillar banks.  Where somebody approaches the pillar banks, even having been through the SBCI, it is not "flying" with the relationship manager.  That significantly impedes businesses which need credit getting the credit that is available.  It is suggested that some banks identify preferred accounts to give extra liquidity or finance to.  We hear that enough to warrant me asking if the SBCI has any concerns of that sort, which I relay on behalf of businesses in my area.</p></speech>

We have heard that demand for some of the Covid and Brexit schemes has been muted as a result of the Covid pandemic.  People are drawing down on other grant supports rather than loan supports first.  It is a credit decision.  The State provides an 80% guarantee, which is considerable.  The banks are at risk for the 20%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030900002#H02000"><p>Exactly.  There are circumstances where they are not minded to take on that 20% risk, even where the State has put all that credit behind providing the additional liquidity to businesses which need it.  That sense is coming back strongly.  Perhaps this is the first time Mr. Black has heard it but it is something I hear consistently from small and medium enterprises.  I also hear that the process the banks are going through is so long after the SBCI.  I am talking six, seven or eight months to give a slow "Yes" or a slow "No", which can be as damaging to the SME as a quick, initial decision.</p> <p>  I will go back to the KfW model and go into a bit of detail about that.  When did KfW exit the Irish market?</p></speech>

It provided funding, which was provided initially to the banks and then to the non-banks.  During 2018, that facility was repaid.  There was cheaper funding from other parties and it was not required.  We still have a relationship with KfW so, if required, we can go back to KfW.  We have funding lines in place with the European Investment Bank, EIB, the Council of Europe Development Bank, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and the NTMA.  That is purely from a cost point of view, but the relationship with KfW still exists.</p></speech>

In our slideshow, slide 3 sets out our legislative functions, and one of our functions is to promote competition through promoting diversity of funding.  This was a source of funding that SMEs were not getting, in that all SMEs were not getting funding to fund their invoices or customer debtor books.  It is a new source of funding and it made sense for us to partner with Bibby Financial Services to provide this funding.</p></speech>

Indeed, credit unions and banks do not have SPVs, so we lend to counter-parties - to on-lenders - and we have to satisfy ourselves with the financial structure.  Structures are different, and the Deputy is correct that we need to ensure we protect the taxpayers and our European funders' interests.  At the same time, we need to deliver the benefit to SMEs and be happy that the on-lender has the capability to do what it said it can do.  That is the due diligence process.</p></speech>

However, we look at credit enhancement in terms of whether there is equity or other credit enhancement, or, potentially, a parent guarantee as well.

It is trying to ensure that risk is minimal but, at the same time, it is trying to make credit available, and I accept that is a difficult situation.  Mr. Black said there are ongoing reviews and we have spoken a lot about Bibby today.  Is he concerned that the net value of the Bibby line group has dropped between 2013 and 2019?  Does that pose a risk to the Irish taxpayer?</p></speech>

We are mindful of it but we are focused on the Irish operation and ensuring that the Irish operation is delivering benefit to SMEs, and that, from an Irish taxpayer's point of view, the structure is appropriate.  We were satisfied and, having reviewed it, we are still satisfied with that from an Irish perspective.</p></speech>

In other words, the money may not be used for anything other than small businesses but the benefit of having access to that is that it allows them to leverage and make other financial changes to their model.  In the case of Bibby, the concern might be that SBCI money is bolstering the Irish arm and it allows the overall group to make changes which may have a risk to us.</p></speech>

The second point, as I think I said earlier, is that we looked at that structure, which operated more like a term loan, and we have revised it for invoiced financing to allow repayments once a month, so that as the level of loans to SMEs reduces, the loan from the SBCI can reduce and, vice versa, as the level of drawing from SMEs increases, the loan from the SBCI can increase.  The loan has been restructured.</p></speech>

I will try to be quick because I know many Deputies want to speak after me.  I have a question about the First Citizen Finance account.  It received a &euro;40 million facility in May 2016 that was repaid in October 2018.  The cost of that was originally &euro;35,000.  Was the cost of the early repayment &euro;35,000 and were the legal and assessment costs incurred more than that?  If so, were those costs recovered?  On a similar matter, Merrion Fleet finance was repaid early in 2017.  The original assessment was for &euro;15,000.  Was it &euro;15,000 or were the legal and assessment costs higher?  If they were, were those costs recovered from First Citizen Finance?</p> <p>  In my short time here this morning, there has been a discussion about due diligence.  Will the witnesses outline what would trigger a fresh due diligence process for a lender?  It is proposed that Permanent TSB will buy a large portion of Ulster Bank loans, possibly doubling its current size.  Is this a situation where fresh due diligence would have to be carried out to ensure its continued stability as a lender?</p></speech>

That was positive because it was able to raise a wider range of funding to fund a wider range of products.  We were a catalyst to enable it to get up and running with that.  With all our on-lenders, we incur due diligence and legal costs.  We recoup those from the on-lenders once they get through that process.</p></speech>

We will always act in the best interest of the SMEs.  In the case of Ulster Bank transferring its loans to another financial institution, it depends on how that would take place.  Under the Central Bank Act 1971, which related to banks amalgamating, one bank can transfer loans to another bank with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  We have the interest of the SMEs at heart and would be guided by that.  People would like for these SME customers to end up with a full service banking offer.</p></speech>

On the Brexit loan scheme, the take-up seems to be very low.  Some &euro;58 million in loans has been approved.  I know that the interest rates are up to 4.5%, which is quite high.  It is the same with the Covid-19 working capital loan and credit guarantee schemes, and the loans.  In the case of the Covid schemes, a facility of up to &euro;2 billion is available but, as I understand it, only &euro;264 million has been approved.  Again, the interest rates are quite high.  When the schemes were put together, many SMEs and companies, particularly those in economic difficulty, said that the last thing they needed was more finance.  Is the interest rate a problem?  Also, what interest rate is the SBCI paying for that money?</p></speech>

That 4% is for anything up to three years, and loans of up to &euro;0.5 million are unsecured.  In my view, getting unsecured money, without providing any personal guarantees, at an interest rate of 4% for up to three years, is an attractive rate.  The reason for the slow uptake has been uncertainty with regard to Brexit, and Covid has meant that there has been limited demand.  People are conserving their cash and taking grant supports such as the employee wage subsidy scheme and the tax warehouse scheme, etc.  I think we will see-----</p></speech>

I have an example of an SME that is operating in the tourism, leisure and outdoor sector.  The owner made approaches to Close Brothers and KBCI in respect of SBCI funding.  When he contacted KBCI, he was informed that it was using the SBCI future growth loan scheme fund, but it was, and I quote from the email, &quot;only offering loans to businesses registered with a professional body&quot;.  I ask the SBCI to carry out an examination of that interaction internally.  I can give the witnesses the name of the company following the meeting.  None of us wants to see unnecessary impediments being put in the way of SMEs if they happen to be seeking funding in a sector of the economy that might not pass muster with &quot;banking types&quot;.  I might be a little unkind in my use of language.  The application is somewhat left field, but nonetheless, it is worth further examination.  The owner seems to have to jump through hoops with the SBCI in order to pass muster.  The main point that I am making is that certain sectors of the economy should not be discounted on the basis that they are not deemed to be fashionable or <i>de rigueur</i>.</p></speech>

The review confirmed that and made a number of suggestions.  One related to the model, which is an on-lender model, whereby we do not lend directly to SMEs.  That was considered in the review, and it was decided that the model was the appropriate one to continue with.  The focus is more on SME innovation.  SME first is the core of this.  We are looking at doing more in respect of innovation products and climate action.  Recommendations were made in those two areas.</p></speech>

It was recommended that we look at that.  In respect of product development, it was recommended that we do more in-house research into what SMEs really require.  Rather than just launching schemes, we must ensure that those schemes are fit for purpose.  That is what we have taken on board.</p></speech>

However, EY also had client companies for whom it acted as auditor.  In respect of independence, how can it be assured that the review is independent?  EY's reputation precedes it, because it was the auditor to  Anglo Irish Bank and we know how that worked out.  Does SBCI consider looking to companies outside of the State when it is seeking to conduct an independent review, so that there are not those conflicts of interest, in the same way, for example, that Sport Ireland had to look outside of the State when it commissioned KOSI to do some work on the FAI?</p><p>How confident can the SBCI be that it is independent when it has a dual arrangement?</p></speech>

In terms of the EY review, it worked with its colleagues in Scotland who had carried out a similar review to leverage the expertise and knowledge from that review in our review.</p></speech>

Like other Deputies, I have been receiving comments that the approval process with the pillar banks has been very slow.  There is also the communications element.  People or small businesses that do not have a relationship are dealing with call centre staff, some of whom do not have the professional diploma in financial advice qualifications, and they are simply not being advised that the SBCI is available.  That is either a deliberate action on the part of the banks to avoid it, or it is being done because there is not the correct structure.  Will Mr. Black comment on that?</p> <p>  Second, there are the arrangement fees that are being applied to the loans by Ulster Bank and AIB.  Has there been any guidance or discussion on that?  It appears to add additional cost to a Government-backed loan.</p></speech>

Out of curiosity, is SBCI involved in any conversations regarding the distribution of the Brexit adjustment reserve fund or is it involved in that?</p> <p>  My other question relates to the German bank, KfW, that has left SBCI.  My understanding is the KfW charges an interest rate of 1.2% for SME loans, as opposed to the SBCI interest rate of 4%.  Is there anything that would preclude SBCI from offering interest rates similar to KfW's rates?</p></speech>

The money has been turned around.  To fund &euro;30 million in invoices per year, &euro;5 million is needed every 60 days.  Some &euro;1 million goes out and &euro;1 million comes in, for example.  If the &euro;60 million we have provided was to fund discounted invoices, it should have funded somewhere in the region of &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.5 billion.  This further bears out my point that it was only every using for discount invoicing &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million of the &euro;60 million we provided of the &euro;70 million approved.  The rest was for Sir John over in England.</p></speech>

It funds debtor books.  It gives a commitment to an SME of a limit for a two-year period.  An SME can draw up to that limit and draw up and down.  That is how this facility works.  The lender must have funding to fund such facilities because of the way invoices come in and out on debtor books.  It is not funding on an individual invoice basis.</p></speech>

When the SBCI was established, it was needed and there was a role for it because SMEs could not access finance in the years after the crash.  I am looking for a brief answer, although I know it will be unfair to make him reply so quickly.  Could there be a role for the SBCI as a publicly owned bank in future?  We are unusual in Europe.  German banks have been referenced at this meeting.  In Germany, many banks are publicly owned.  As a publicly owned bank, could the SBCI become a major player, perhaps even a third force, in Irish banking?</p></speech>

I remind members that in the context of current Covid-19 restrictions, only the Chairman and staff are present in the committee room and all other members must join remotely from elsewhere in the parliamentary precinct.  The secretariat can issue an invitation to join the meeting on Microsoft Teams.  Members may not participate in the meeting from outside the parliamentary precinct.  I ask members to mute their microphones when not making a contribution and to use the "raise hand" function to indicate.  Please note that messages sent to the meeting chat are visible to all participants.  Speaking slots will be prioritised for members of the committee.</p> <p>  The topic of today's meeting is eradication of bovine tuberculosis and comprises two parts.  The first is engagement with representatives from the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, the Irish Cattle &amp;amp; Sheep Farmers' Association, ICSA, and Macra na Feirme.  The second is engagement with officials from the Department of Agriculture and the Marine.  The TB forum met today under the chairmanship of Sean Brady.  The eradication of tuberculosis has been in the news for the past couple of months and it is imperative the committee listens to the stakeholders and the views on this.  Then we can go back to the Minister on how best to move towards the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.</p> <p>  I welcome, from the Irish Farmers' Association, Mr. Tim Cullinan, president, and Mr. Thomas Burke, animal health executive.  From the Irish Creamery Milk Supplies Association, I welcome Mr. Lorcan McCabe, deputy president, and Mr. Paul Smyth, executive secretary of the dairy and farm business committee.  From Macra na Feirme, I welcome Mr. Thomas Duffy, president, and Mr. Derrie Dillon, head of policy.  From the Irish Cattle &amp;amp; Sheep Farmers' Association, I welcome Mr. Eddie Punch, general secretary, and Mr. Hugh Farrell, chairman of the animal health and welfare committee.  They are all appearing remotely and they are all welcome to this meeting.</p> <p>  We have received the witnesses' opening statements, which have already been circulated to members.  We are limited in our time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions and the committee has agreed the opening statements will be taken as read so we can use the full session for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.</p> <p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Participants in a location outside the parliamentary precinct are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precinct do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on the extent to which participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I invite questions from members.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the time and will be brief.  This is known as the tuberculosis eradication strategy.  We have talked about eradicating tuberculosis for almost 70 years.  As a farmer myself, I am beginning to think what we are at is more identification or location.  Eradication is not something we seem to be mastering.  I would like if the different farm representative bodies would comment.  I am aware the implementation group met today and I would like the witnesses' feedback from that.  I saw a press release from the Minister.  Will the witnesses inform the committee of how they felt that went and whether progress is being made?</p> <p>  I was on the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine during the previous D&aacute;il.  We dealt with this in late 2017 or early 2018.  We got positive feedback and the numbers were relatively good at that stage, but there has been a decline since 2016.  Will the witnesses tell us, in their opinion, what has caused that decline?  We seemed to be going in the right direction but it has taken a nosedive since 2016.</p> <p>  As a farmer, this seems to be a firefighting regime.  The debate is always about financial compensation and issues post having a breakdown in a herd.  Macra na Feirme's submission in particular highlights that.  We are good at the follow-up supports.  What more can we do for preventive management?  How can we get to a situation where we are actually doing what we say we want to do and working towards eradication as opposed to identification?</p></speech>

To get to a fundamental aspect of it without getting into the nitty-gritty, over the past five years, farms have got bigger with quotas gone.  Herds have got bigger.  Farmers have been pushed into increasing sizes to stay viable or into leasing their land.  There are substantial amounts of cattle together, though not necessarily dairy.  If there are 100 cows, tuberculosis might pass by, but if there are 500 cows in a herd, it adds to the problem.  That is the starting point of what is happening.  There needs to be something to keep the small farmer, both small dairy farmers and small beef farmers, viable rather than being pushed into larger herds.</p> <p>  The ICMSA fundamentally agrees with the new strategy.  There are a few things we would like to tweak but we fundamentally agree.  Financial support has to be put in place.  Tighter measures will be put in place for farmers regarding testing etc.  We need financial measures to back that up.  The Department will say it can eradicate tuberculosis by 2030.  If so, why not front-load the finance now and target this so that we will not need it in 2028, 2029 and 2030?</p> <p>  The Department is doing a reasonably good job with badgers but I am hearing it needs more staff with better knowledge to track and trace the badgers and to cull or vaccinate them in certain bad areas.  There is another problem with wildlife.  Our members tell us deer are a significant problem, especially in the Wicklow area, and the Department says they are not.  Who does the committee believe?  We need a study to state once and for all whether they are a problem.  That would be helpful.</p> <p>  With all the measures that are in place, with extra testing on chronic herds etc., the principal issue is we need the finance to be put in place.  In the past, we have been told it is a matter of vets against farmers and farmers against the Department, and people say there is an industry there.  We are all in this together.  I fundamentally believe farmers, the Department and vets want this disease to be eradicated.  There is no point in me blaming the Department, the Department blaming vets etc.  We have to get on with it with none of this bickering.  Another area where farmers need help is if there is a breakdown in extra stock.  There needs to be a feedlot system to get calves and such out of the way.</p><p>I will answer more questions but I believe that covers this for the moment.</p></speech>

I appreciate the comments in the reference to our submission on this issue because Macra na Feirme feels very strongly that while the focus has been primarily on what to do once herds break down, we have seen that the increase in 2016 has been caused in a major and primary way through the spread to new herds or to new areas.  Some of the key areas that we would like to see focused upon are, first, to address TB and to differentiate it.  In some areas such as in Cavan, Monaghan and Wicklow there have been ongoing blackspots.  Even at the point of 2016, unfortunately, those communities were never fully free of TB.  These were localised issues but were never fully addressed.  We welcome in the new strategy a more localised approach with increased help and support for those farmers to address the issue.</p> <p>  The challenge in those areas is very often to identify what the source may be.  In some cases it may be wildlife.  An exclusion of wildlife from feed bunkers and water sources may prove effective.  I have visited farms, however, where despite all of the best efforts, which were in very well-contained and controlled farms, there was still, unfortunately, an ongoing issue with TB.  </p> <p>  We also have to keep up to date with the modern technology and indeed with the advancements in genetics.  This is something that is referred to briefly in the strategy.  There has, however, been extensive work by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation in collaboration with Teagasc to identify genetic resistance to tuberculosis.  At the moment those breed lists of AI bulls are available but are not being promoted in those areas.  We have to adopt, therefore, a multifaceted strategy in terms of both the prevention on the outskirts of areas which have an ongoing TB issue, but also to take a much more targeted approach within those blackspot areas.  In addition to that, as Mr. McCabe and has rightly commented upon, we need to support financially some of those areas.  We have seen, in particular, over the years with areas that have never been able to become clear of TB that many farmers have lost income as a direct result of farmers being less willing to purchase livestock from those areas.  This is on top of the constant pressure of ongoing tests and herd breakdowns, and the emotional and mental stress which this brings on farmers.  </p> <p>  These are some of the items on which we have worked with the Department.  We have also highlighted, however, that there are specific issues for young farmers in the financial risk.  Young farmers are more likely to have taken on additional loans for expenditure on infrastructure but equally they are less likely to have the infrastructure in place in the case of a herd breakdown.  We have to be very clear in differentiating that the impact of TB may be very different depending on the enterprise one is operating in.  To a dairy farmer, the impact of TB come the month of January, when they will have to hold onto dozens of calves, raises both a welfare issue but equally raises a deep concern in labour, stress and the infrastructure available.  Young farmers are more likely to be expanding their herds and increasing their investment which also puts them at a much greater financial risk should those sorts of herd breakdowns occur.  These are some of the items that we would raise on this issue.</p></speech>

I will continue by referring back to Senator Daly's question on today&rsquo;s implementation group meeting.  It was intense enough for two hours or more.  We found that we were at a big disadvantage in one sense because we were limited in where we were.  There is a three-way division here with the implementation, finance and the science aspect of it.  As far as we are concerned, the implementation or programme as far as disease has been brought forward more than has the finance.  This happened in the last 18 months or so.  Until the finance comes up on a par we cannot be pushing forward with new levels of introduction, like the discussion today about the inconclusive areas.  Yes, we want to see inconclusives sorted out but the discussion there about taking 2,000 of them out and the locking up of herds to that extent without compensation is not practical.  We have to look at a different regime.</p> <p>  Furthermore, there is a derogation where there is change in April which is going to have a big impact on these things that we were not led to believe would happen prior to this at the meetings.  I think it has been difficult for the new chairman and he has done a great job to bring this forward.  There was a kind of hindrance there.  We need more crossflow or interaction between the two to come forward on this issue.  </p> <p>  As to moving forward on TB, we want to see the removal of reactors as an urgent matter.  The question of having animals left on a farm for anything from two to five weeks is an issue.  There has been talk of bio-security and this is surely the worst type of this.</p> <p>  We see farms then, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, where there are both badger and deer and mention of having a roadmap down the country for the badger and for their setts.  We need background detail on where these badgers are being snared or caught and we also need to know what the test results are.  As we know, they are not being tested or this is happening with a very small number of them.</p> <p>  The same applies to vaccinating.  We can see that there is a big programme in Monaghan.  Has this led to findings of sick badgers or ones that have turned positive that were not tested prior to vaccination, as one moves in on the Cavan, Meath and Louth border?  Are we pushing this further ourselves by not spending more money, doing the testing and carrying out the programme appropriately?</p> <p>  We want to see this dealt with as urgently as we can because of the number of people that are hit and badly affected by this.  Furthermore, there is a big issue with the herd test, where there is a variation both in blood, the gamma and the skin test.  Farmers are constantly contacting us and are frustrated with this.  This is happening where herds are being depopulated where they never had problems and in areas where there are no other problems.  These are some of the issues that we wish to see addressed.  </p> <p>  To move forward then the issues are that wildlife is at crisis, the removal of reactors needs to be addressed, and there is a need for much more understanding and co-operation with partners instead of this severe approach.  We have to start managing this in a completely different way and bringing it forward on a faster note.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

This situation has been going on for years now, for well over 50 years and we are probably no further on now than we were 50 years ago.  There is an opportunity now, the Minister has put a group together, and it is important that we move this forward.  This has a direct financial impact on farmers as well as an impact on running the business.  There is an indirect cost of &euro;55 million to farmers annually in TB testing.  Some &euro;27 million is the cost of the actual TB testing, where &euro;7 million is charged in disease levies at factory and processing level.  If one includes farmers own labour where a great amount of time is spent in the process of testing, there is a further cost of &euro;20 million.  The total amount then is over &euro;50 million.  There were 23,000 reactors last year.  That is the highest number of reactors we have had since 2009.  Over 4,500 herds have been dealing with restrictions as well.  When we look at the cost where we are putting the money in, if we look across the Border in Northern Ireland and the UK, there is no direct cost to farmers.  That, in itself, needs to be ironed out.  Farmers need to be compensated for both the time and the effort that they are putting in.</p><p>How do we deal with this in order to move it forward?  It is absolutely essential that farmers and farm representative bodies are involved in the design and implementation of the programme that will deal with this.  We have had many false dawns.  As I said already, we want to get it right this time in recognition of the labour and contribution of farmers to the programme.</p><p> A letter was sent out to farmers last year.  We need to revisit that herd risk letter in which herds were being categorised.  We need to look at that again and, obviously, we will need to look at this idea of bringing in a pre-movement test and what that will do.</p><p> One of the key fundamentals, however, is that we need a proper meaningful wildlife programme.  If we are not going to tackle the source of the problem then how will we resolve the issue?  It is absolutely essential that everybody gets serious around the table and comes up with a proper programme around wildlife.</p><p> We also need proper investigation when there is an outbreak in an area, and people from the Department should be out on the ground working in conjunction with farmers to see and identify where the problem is coming from.  I will leave it at that for the moment.</p></speech>

This is a timely and important debate.  If the definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results then the epitome of madness is the Irish tuberculosis, TB, eradication programme.  We are now at a point where having spent &euro;97.3 million directly last year, which was a substantial increase on previous years, we had, as Mr. Cullinan said, 23,000 cattle directly removed as reactors to TB.  More than 4,000 farms were affected.  If anything, the problem seems to be getting worse.  It is crucially important that our committee keeps a close eye on that.</p> <p>  Senator Daly asked the big question.  To me, the programme is not working.  Do the guests get a sense from the new TB strategy that there will be a fundamental shift in terms of our approach to this issue and our holistic view of how this happens?  Do people have a sense of why the numbers have increased as dramatically as they have in recent years, considering the level of investment that has been spent on the matter?  I am interested in hearing that.</p> <p>  A number of the opening statements raised concerns, and it was mentioned again, about the TB letters that were sent last year.  We all recall the furore and the anxiety and anger it created among many farmers.  Can the stakeholders outline what they believe happened there?  Why were those letters considered to be appropriate?  Is there is a better way of communicating with farmers?  Have they any views on that?</p> <p>  Scotland has some similarities.  I will not say it operates in the same environment because it does not.  It has essentially eradicated TB, however.  Is there anything our guests feel we can learn from the Scottish experience?</p> <p>  Finally, the farmers' contributions to TB have been mentioned a couple of times.  This will probably become more focused because EU funding will continue to decline.  I must say, I can hardly blame the EU.  If one examines our figures and is then asking the EU to fund a programme that is clearly not working, one can understand why it will be reluctant to do so.  My fear, however, is that the Department will seek to try to recoup some of that over time by increased penalties or contributions coming from farmers.  Can our guests see a way in which the money already collected and expended, which, as I mentioned, amounts to upwards of &euro;100 million per year, could be better spent in a more targeted way that will actually deliver tangible results that we have not seen through the existing programmes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021030900002#C00400"><p>First, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, Macra na Feirme and the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, representatives are very welcome.  I will ask each of the presidents to answer this specific question first.  Have the three farming organisations got common ground and a common approach in eradicating TB, specifically around the ongoing negotiations with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  Have the three farming organisations met together to try to come up with common ground?</p> <p>  We all know the stress and strain this has brought on many farmers over many years.  I really feel sorry for younger farmers who have built up a dairy or beef herd over the last while.  The hassle they get from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, if they are unlucky enough to be caught out with TB, impacts on the entire holding, the whole farm and herd and so forth.</p> <p>  Mr. Cullinan outlined the TB costs, which I also read in the IFA statement.  It was very interesting to read that the Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales - the UK - do not pay for the annual TB test.  At the same time, however, they do not get a similar package to what the Irish farmers get in the hardship scheme that is available.  The IFA mentioned this in its statement.  I am interested in what the ICMSA and Macra na Feirme feel on that issue.</p> <p>  On the management of the control of wildlife, I believe someone from the ICMSA mentioned deer.  I come from Enniscorthy, and deer are a particularly serious issue in County Wicklow.  I have been contacted and had plenty of correspondence back and forth with the Department in recent years.  It started with the deer problem in the Gorey area of north Wexford.  Something is seriously wrong when a person comes down to Enniscorthy and sees a deer in front of him or her on the motorway .  The only time we ever saw deer in Enniscorthy was hanging up on somebody's wall.  Now, however, it is a common practice to see them on some of the landholdings right across the middle of County Wexford.  I met with the IFA in Wexford on this issue, in particular.  Many farmers have contacted me directly about this.  We must get serious about the management of wildlife, that is, deer and badgers, if we are to eradicate TB.  I have asked the Department in the past to do some form of research into the deer problem and it repeated what I believe it said to the ICMSA, that is, it feels it is not a problem.  It is a problem.  The farmers on the ground are saying it is a problem and an issue.  I will be raising this at the next session with the Department.</p> <p>  I read in the ICMSA statement about Coillte not fencing off its holdings.  That is another problem.  Financial investment in science is also definitely needed if we are to eradicate TB.  I therefore ask the three presidents of the organisations to answer my original question.  Is there common ground between the three farming organisations?  If we are to try to eradicate TB, we need to have common ground between the farming organisations.</p></speech>

Obviously, the farm organisations have common ground on this.  It is critical that we are striving together on this.  I will come back to Deputy Kehoe first.  Last year, we strove for bilateral discussions with the farming organisations on their own because there are many actors in this grouping.</p><p>It is most important that farmers can negotiate on their own, because they are the people who are dealing with this on a daily basis.  </p><p> Deputy Kehoe mentioned funding and the hardship scheme.  It is hardship.  There is much hardship here for farmers.  Before this moves forward, we must see the colour of the Department's eyes on this issue.  The removal of infected animals as soon as possible is critical, but there must be proper funding for farmers. </p><p> Deputy Carthy's point that the definition of madness is doing the same thing repeatedly is a fair one.  If one keeps doing the same thing, one will get the same result.  That is why there is an opportunity here now.  There is a plan to eradicate TB in the next ten years, but everyone must work together to do it.  There is an absolute responsibility on the Department to engage properly, as I outlined earlier in our proposals.</p><p> The issue of the TB letters was raised earlier, and whether it was appropriate for the Department to send them out.  I am certain that it was not appropriate.  We had a campaign and actually burnt those letters last summer.  The letters essentially categorised farmers.  For example, if there is an outbreak of TB on a farm and the farmer goes through the restrictive period, before then resuming operations, he does not want everyone knowing about the situation on his own farm.  If he has been restricted, he has been restricted, and that is why.</p><p> A good point was made that EU funding is declining.  No wonder it is, because this has been going on for 50 years.  However, at the end of the day, the Department must work with farmers on this issue.  We are not going to accept less funding to address this issue until we are on the road to eradicating TB.  As I highlighted at the outset, farmers have already put more than &euro;50 million into this programme.  That is more than adequate.  Not only are the farmers putting in the funding, but they are also suffering with loss of dairy cows in particular in the spring.  That also impacts upon suckler herds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.402" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thomas Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021030900002#D00200"><p>I might address the points made by members in reverse.</p> <p>  On Deputy Kehoe's comment on deer density, it has been a long-standing issue.  There has been a failure to address the question of the potential movement of TB from deer as a wildlife source.  It is quite well established at this point that badgers can act as a reserve, and can spread TB through contaminated material or shared feeding and bodies.  Certainly, this has been long stated.  We welcome the fact that in the updated strategy there is an awareness of deer density in Wicklow in particular, where deer density would be at its highest, and a more concerted effort to align hunters who are licensed to remove stags and does at certain times of the year to relieve the pressure and the ingress into farmers' land.  Overall, there is a bigger question to be addressed on the population of deer and the impact that is having on farmers alongside the effect of TB and, as the Deputy has said, the abnormal behaviour of veering out into roads.  </p> <p>  The impact that the disease can have on young farmers was mentioned.  The strain that it places on young farmers is astronomical.  Without the reserves that are often built up over years of farming, although that is not always the case, it can be a massive negative.  I know several young farmers who aimed to set up their businesses, and when they were hit with TB several times they abandoned them and decided to leave the industry.  It is very devastating.</p> <p>  The common approach of all farming organisations is that the farmer must be at the centre of this.  It speaks to Deputy Carthy's question about the new strategy.  Again, the definition of madness is certainly repeating the same thing.  It is very difficult for us to predict the future, but there are elements of the new strategy that we welcome, in respect of putting farmers front and centre.</p> <p>  On the question of wildlife, the mapping of TB and the use of local knowledge, which we addressed in our opening statement, in the investigation ahead of the report being published it was found that unfortunately, TB is essentially viewed by some farmers as simply being something that happens to them and they are passive in the chain.  Unfortunately, this has been fostered by a lack of engagement, active management and encouragement by farmers to address these issues directly and the financial supports that are necessary for that.  </p> <p>  On Deputy Carthy's reference to Scotland, we were most interested in exploring how a country with an almost identical climate, although at a slightly higher elevation, seems not to have this problem, especially given that the same wildlife factor is present.  The answer that we were offered is that there seems to be a difference in Scottish badgers.  I am not entirely sure why that might be, but it is established in the scientific literature.  Again, unless we are going import some of those TB-resistant Sottish badgers, I am not sure how much more can be learned.</p> <p>  On the question of letters, certainly there was a lack of communication around that entire process.  One of the issues that came up from our membership, which is deeply concerning, is that the categorisation was based on the number of years since a TB-free test.  If a farm has just been established, a farmer will not have any TB-free years.  Therefore, young farmers were being placed under the C1 category, and other low C categories, with only an asterisk to indicate that no TB test has been taken into account.  We engaged with the Department on this issue, and sought to make it more plain and clear, potentially working on where the animals might have been tested previously.  </p> <p>  I am open to any further questions on the matter.  It certainly would be our hope that as long as the strategy follows through on its stated ambition of putting farmers front and centre in this, using their local knowledge and their own intuitive ability to understand their farms better than anyone, the strategy might become successful and overcome the declining trends we have seen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.403" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lorcan McCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021030900002#D00300"><p>I will start with Deputy Carthy's question.  There is a shift in the right direction, and if everyone follows the direction in which we are going, things will change.  There are many things on which we have to improve.  Fundamentally, finance must be used to tackle farms with chronic problems and herd outbreaks occurring over 300 to 400 days.  If that is brought in, those farms are targeted and rigorous testing is done, it will have an impact.  I believe there has been a shift in the last five or six years because of the intensity of herds and the larger numbers congregating together.  As I said before, the Government should support farmers so that they do not have to expand drastically.</p> <p>  On the issue of the letters, I think they were ill-timed, albeit well-intended to indicate risk to the farmers.  However, it did not go down well and was ill-timed.  As a member of the TB forum, we did not know that letters were going to be issued.  As Mr. Duffy stated, farmers were categorised and it left a bad taste in their mouths.  It will be difficult to regain their trust.  On the Department side, far better communication is required all round.</p> <p>  On Deputy Kehoe's question, we have not met individual organisations such as the IFA, the ICMSA and Macra na Feirme.  We have not sat down and talked together.  However, fundamentally, we are all singing off the same hymn sheet.  We have seen today that there is common ground on issues such as inconclusives.  We want them removed - end of story.  Farmers should be paid at the going rate on the day.  Most grounds are common between the organisations, albeit with a bit of tweaking.  </p> <p>  On Deputy Kehoe's point on the issue of deer, the Department is claiming that deer density is not a huge problem.  Our members are screaming to us that it is a huge problem in specific large forests.</p><p>In other parts of the country with only 40 or 50 acres, there is not a huge problem.  In the specific areas it is incredible.  Depending on who we speak about, there are 150,000 to 250,000 badgers in the Wicklow mountains.  Farmers are being tortured by this.</p><p> There is much more we can do.  Deputy Carthy asked a question and more money and staff are required on the wildlife side.  The Department told me specifically that it needs more staff to target the badgers.  Going back to what was said about the badgers in Scotland, there is not as high a level of badgers in Scotland as here.  More money must be put in here.  There should be communication with farmers so that where there are badgers, they know to close doors and keep obstacles 3 ft high to keep out those badgers.  No one action will solve the problem and it will instead be about 1,000 small actions, including keeping badgers out.  That message must be got across in a friendly way.  There are far too many legalistic letters arriving on farmers' doorsteps.  They contain legal clauses, etc.  Communication is crucial.</p><p> All these actions should be implemented but the Department must realise they have to be funded.  There are other considerations, including reactors hanging around too long.  There are proposals that could be sped up so a reactor could go the next day, with a farmer taking the average cost.  There are slight problems but we must keep at the financial implementation and science groups.  The committee should use whatever influence it has to keep this pushed as hard as we can.</p><p> On the question of deer, I thank the Minister, as after our influence he visited a member of ours in Wicklow who has a major problem with deer.  I know in his heart the Minister wants this problem solved.  The committee should use whatever influence it has on the forum, the implementation group and everything else.  I firmly believe we can sort it but upfront finance is crucial.  My ambition is for no farmer to need compensation in 2030 because there would be no TB.  We must front-load it now.</p></speech>

I have some quick questions.  There was some gobbledegook that went to farmers last year about herds.  Are the witnesses saying there was no consultation with the groups and it was done as a solo run by the Department, which would seem like it was done in very bad spirit?</p> <p>  I have seen the zero grazing process around my own part of the country and it is puzzling when TB has shown up in cattle that were not out on grass and there are gates one would imagine a snipe would not get through.  Animals have gone down nonetheless.  What is the conclusion of the witnesses about that?</p> <p>  The Minister has stated there is a basically a new agreement and the farmer organisations have bought into that.  Is that a fact and have the organisations bought into the new way forward on compensation?</p> <p>  I have seen cases where the Department gives a choice of valuers and they come out.  The Department might disagree and another valuer might have to come out.  If that valuer provides a higher valuation, the Department will go to the first value and the only other option is arbitration, which is currently non-existent.  Have the witnesses found many cases like this?</p> <p>  Many farmers, particularly those in the beef sector, have small farms and they must work elsewhere.  There is no point in saying these people would live off the farm.  If an animal goes down on such farmers, the income from the job would pay the mortgage and bits and pieces so they would not get a hardship grant.  Has any headway been made on this?  The figures are there for anybody to look at when it comes to beef farming.</p> <p>  Appeals are not going ahead currently.  Are the witnesses concerned by this?  With the best will in the world and no more than what we are at this evening, it is better to eyeball somebody than have a Zoom call where he or she cannot be tackled head-on.</p></speech>

On my side of the country there are many beef farmers and there has been major difficulties in testing cattle.  I am a farmer but I have helped many others through the years.  We all do that with our neighbours, including older neighbours in difficulty.  They often swore inside a yard what a bloody racket this whole process is.  It has never ended.  Thirty years ago people would have called it a racket in a yard and 30 years later people are telling me the same thing.  It has never been eradicated.</p> <p>  Are farm representative bodies confident we are on the right track to eradicating TB?  Deputy Fitzmaurice has mentioned that there are many farmers working off-farm and they experience difficulty, especially if the animals have TB.  There is testing and retesting, and cattle are in smaller holdings here and there, with difficulty in bringing them all together.  It is a tough time for farmers and the compensation is not the best.  I got an earful from a farmer in Castletownbere last week because he did not get what he felt was the value of his cattle.  No matter what appeal he made, he still did not get the value of his cattle.  He felt that as he had a rare breed, there was a set price.  He gave up everything to come home to run the family farm but he now regrets it as the biggest mistake of his life.</p> <p>  The farmers are under much pressure and cannot take all the rules and regulations, with letters telling them this and that.  I plead with the farmer organisations to stand up for these farmers.  In fairness, I know they are doing this now but the organisations must be strong.  The farmers will appreciate it.  Testing is a tough racket and it has never eradicated the disease, as it was meant to.</p> <p>  Many questions have been asked that I wanted to ask so there is no need to repeat them.</p></speech>

Unless the four organisations work together, this problem will not be resolved and every couple of years we will be coming back to talk about it.  The EU will get fed up funding it in the end.</p> <p>  I have some questions for each of the associations.  Some have been asked already and if they have, they can just be ignored.  In a statement the Department indicates 2020 saw the highest rates of TB in a decade.  It set out ten points and indicates that the strategy must continue to evolve.  This raises the question of what should come with a redefined roadmap.  It is what farmers we contacted are crying out for.</p> <p>  We are told comprehensive measures must be put in place to stop the spread of the disease but the farmers do not see such measures applied to either deer or badgers.  Will the Department admit we are still far from getting a comprehensive approach to dealing with such factors?  There is no mention of deer in the opening statement but in the TB eradication strategy, in referring to the risk posed by deer, the Department speaks of improved communications.</p><p>In addition, no real action is being taken to deal with the problem of the danger posed by the deer.</p><p> My next questions are for the Department.  When the forestry felling licences are being issued, does the Department give advice on the implications this may have on the movement of deer?  Having spoken to some of the farmers' groups they suggest that the &euro;35 million contribution the Department says the farmers make falls way short in reality.  With testing happening so frequently some of them are subject to gathering herds and housing them.  That can cost the farmers days at work and also in terms of the expense of housing the cattle.  Farmers do not believe there is this roadmap that people are talking about.  Will the Department seek the support of the farmers when it is implementing this roadmap?</p><p> I have a couple of questions for the IFA that Mr. Cullinan might answer.  In terms of finances, does the meat industry have a potential part to play here given the importance of health and the availability to the sector?  In other words, how are they being allowed to get away with not contributing to the TB eradication programme so far?  I would like a response also on the increase in cases in Tipperary.  There were 1,154 in south Tipperary and 1,390 in north Tipperary in 2020.</p><p> My next question is for the ICMSA.  The role of the deer in terms of TB is an inescapable problem.  Someone said it is just as much of a problem as the badger.  That comes back to the failure of Coillte to properly fence land to ensure that deer do not encroach on the adjacent lands.  Could the witnesses expand on their concerns about the alignment of compensation with undertaking risk mitigation measures?  I will leave it at that as the other questions I had have been answered at this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.411" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eddie Punch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021030900002#F00200"><p>The first thing to say with regard to the deer is that it is a big problem and we are very concerned that the Department has adopted a bury its head in the sand approach to deer.  The limited research it has shows that the positivity rate in deer is equivalent to that in cattle.  Obviously, it is a problem in the cattle herd but with the same positivity rate the Department does not see deer as a problem.  That is an unsustainable position and it will have to be tackled.  Unless that is tackled we will not make progress.</p> <p>  We met Coillte a few years ago about the particular situation that pertains to deer encroaching onto farmland from their properties in Wicklow, in particular.  I have to say we were disappointed that it did not seem to have the good neighbour attitude that would be expected of farmers.  A company that is making in excess of &euro;100 million in earnings not having the price of being able to fence its lands is just not acceptable.</p> <p>  It is important to state that we have had several strategies in a row now, which are about expansion of the national herd and the expansion of the national herd has led to significant increases in State revenues.  It is not possible, therefore, to have the kind of expansion and indeed disruption of herds.  Where someone sells a long-established suckler herd and then buys in a dairy herd from multiple different sources, we are going to have problems with a whole array of diseases in terms of immunity in the early stages.  In particular, if we have very large herds it is clear-cut that an outbreak of TB will lead to many more reactors.  All of these things explain the reason we have had an increase in reactors in the past couple of years.</p> <p>  On the matter of finances, we have been asking repeatedly, and we would urge Members of the Oireachtas to do this also, for a breakdown of the way the Department explains the &euro;35 million it says it is spending on the programme.  We have not got it yet.  I believe the issue here is what one might call relevant costs.  Yes, the Department can link a large number of staff to the TB programme and say that the cost of those staff adds up to &euro;35 million.  The real question is if there was no TB would all of that &euro;35 million cost disappear.  I do not believe it would.  In other words, we would have a big question mark about the way the Department is spending the &euro;35 million.  What does that consist of and if there was no TB, would that cost disappear overnight?  I think not.  It is important to say that farmers are contributing that amount of money also, which is much more than the compensation they get out of it.  It is important to note that farmers contribute a lot of free labour to the TB eradication programme by the amount of effort they put in to herd testing on an annual basis.</p> <p>  As an overall comment, there is a question mark in my head anyway about the way in which the focus needs to be on black spots - on deer and on wildlife - but we continue to spend a lot of money testing.  We would be aware of members who have not had any TB reactors in 40 years but they are subject to the same cost national focus as black spots.  There is a question mark about whether that money is being well allocated.  </p> <p>  Overall, it is extraordinary to think that we could have a massive dairy expansion programme, not just expansion but a switch in enterprise, where many farms have had to sell out entire herds and buy in completely new herds to switch to dairying, and then expect that we would have no impact on TB and disease in general.</p> <p>  In terms of some of the questions Deputy Fitzmaurice asked, the letter was certainly a solo run.  That was not agreed with the farm organisations.  </p> <p>  With regard to the new agreement, it is agreed in the sense that we want to continue to try to find solutions to this problem.  We have put in a detailed critique of much of the existing strategy but, overall, we have agreed to continue to work with the process to try to find a resolution.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice is 100% right.  We have repeatedly raised the issue of how it is unfair that hardship grants are not available to low income beef farmers who are forced to find income from elsewhere.  That is one of the issues we want resolved in the finance committee.</p></speech>

There are a number of common themes in all the Deputies' questions, which started with Deputy Pa Daly.  In terms of whether we have confidence in the new approach, let us bear in mind what that new approach is.  There is a strategy set out with a framework for working through the proposals of the TB forum.  We have had the implementation working group meeting this morning.  We had a finance working group meeting last week but time will tell.  There are objectives set out in that strategy.  There are commitments given that there will be a farmer-centred approach but time will tell if that is delivered on because for too long we have had the issue of the top-down approach where measures were implemented but there was no cognisance of the direct impact on farmers and their livelihood or how they managed their farms.  Deputy Daly is right.  That moved then to a fire fighting action to try to resolve the issues caused on farms by poorly thought out programme proposals.  That is what we would hope the implementation group structure will bring to the scientific advice and proposals from the TB forum in terms of how best they can be implemented to minimise the impact, but time will tell.  It is a new approach.  We have only had one meeting of each of those groups and success will be judged on how those groups perform and whether they function under the remit they were set up to do.</p> <p>  With regard to finances, the EU levels are reducing.  Farmers are significant contributors to the programme, as is the State, but it is very interesting to look at the membership of the TB forum.  Farmers are a low number of seat holders at the TB forum yet only farmers and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine contribute to the TB programme.</p><p>In establishing the TB forum, a large number of beneficiaries and interested parties have been identified by the State.  It will be interesting to see now are they also identified by the State in terms of funding for the programme going forward.  This is the substantive issue that must be addressed before we develop a programme because if we do not have the resources to implement the likes of the effective wildlife programme that is necessary then we are going to fail yet again, and it is back to Deputy Carthy's point that we need resources in place.</p><p> It has been asked what caused the deterioration in the levels of TB.  We would not accept the fundamental principle that farmers are to blame because of herd expansion.  There was clearly a reduction in the activity of the wildlife control programme for the last eight to ten years.  There was less than effective wildlife control programmes being implemented throughout the country that allowed the badger population to increase and obviously spread disease in areas.  In the last four to six months the Department has agreed to remap the areas.  We have found a significant number of setts that were previously unidentified yet part of capture areas.  That points to a very ineffective and inefficient wildlife control programme being implemented and has clearly contributed to the deterioration in the levels of TB.</p><p> There should be no ambiguity about the role played by deer.  The Department has its own study from Wicklow in which we were actively involved and showed a 16% TB prevalence in the deer tested by the Department.  Deer are a significant contributor to TB spread and ongoing TB outbreaks where their density is at a particular level.  The TB strategy requires two components to deal with deer.  One is a programme similar to the wildlife programme for badgers around TB outbreaks where the density of deer is reduced.  Significantly, what we need is the re-establishment of the national deer management forum, which was set up a number of years ago to put in place a strategy to manage the density nationally before it became a problem in every other county like it currently is in Wicklow.  That group needs to be re-established.  The chairperson of that group stood down a number of years ago and the group has not convened since, so its output has been non-existent.  As part of the preventive measures, which Senator Paul Daly has identified, this is critical.  We cannot allow the deer population to continue to increase in every other county like it has in Wicklow and bring the TB problem with it.  For the past ten years we have sent numerous submissions to the Department seeking preventive actions to be taken in advance of major infrastructural works and deforestation for all wildlife because it is clearly evident where the disturbance of wildlife takes place that TB follows shortly afterwards.  It stands to reason that populations of wildlife that are susceptible to TB are being stressed and moved on so bring the disease with them.  If we are serious about eradicating TB then we must stop new outbreaks and a proactive preventive approach is required in terms of wildlife.</p><p> On the compensation schemes, as Mr. McCabe has already said, our objective is that there would be no need for a compensation scheme because no farmer would have TB in his or her herd.  Unfortunately, even with the best will in the world, we are going to have TB for a significant period going forward.  There are going to be farmers who through no fault of their own, which must be borne in mind, have a TB restriction or breakdown that results in an enormous disturbance on farms for a minimum of six months.  That is why the compensation schemes and the support structures must be aligned with the measures on-farm to treat farmers fairly.</p><p> Deputy Carthy raised the issue of Scotland and Deputy Kehoe asked about the different levels of support in the UK compared with what we have.  It is important to put this in context.  On the different levels of compensatory support, we have an additional income supplement depopulation or hardship grant compensation scheme that pays out &euro;4 million a year for the extra &euro;35 million a year we put into the programme compared with what our counterparts in Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales contribute to their programmes.  So for &euro;35 million in direct funding we get back an additional &euro;4 million.  That has been a narrative that has been set continually, and grossly misrepresents the high level of funding that we put into the programme.</p><p> On the Scottish experience, and Deputy Carthy rightly raised it, we engaged directly with some senior veterinary practitioners and farm leaders in Scotland a number of years ago.  We discussed the actual programmes and measures for cattle in this country obviously to identify what they did and what we could do to replicate eradication.  A significant difference between us and Scotland is that TB did not get into the badger population.  Therefore, the message that we clearly took from the engagement is that additional testing of cattle and tighter controls on farms will not eradicate TB.  The source of TB is primarily in wildlife and until we address it in wildlife we are only imposing extra costs and hardship on farmers with additional tests and controls.</p></speech>

We received their opening statement, which has been circulated to members.  We are limited in our time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions.  The committee has agreed that the opening statement will be taken as read so that we can use the full session for questions and answers as we did with the first half of this meeting.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I draw attention to the fact that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants at the committee meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which their participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I invite questions from the members and will begin with one from myself.  For the first hour of this meeting we spoke to the stakeholders, that is, representatives of the four farming organisations.  Clearly, farmers are worried about the design of the new strategy and that not enough focus will be placed on the part played by wildlife in the incidence of TB in the bovine herd.  We have heard figures about the level of TB in the deer population in Wicklow and heard requests for more staff to be provided to vaccinate badgers.  Will the new strategy focus on wildlife and the part it plays in the incidence of TB?  The deer and badger are the two animals in the spotlight.</p><p>If the Department could address those issues, we will then go to further questions from members.  I invite one of the Department officials to answer that question.</p></speech>

I am a senior superintending veterinary inspector in charge of TB policy in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I work with Mr. Colm Forde and Ms Paula Barry Walsh.</p> <p>  Regarding the Chairman's specific question on what is the focus on wildlife in the strategy, he is right that wildlife is a key part of the solution to reduce TB.  There is a major focus on badger mediated TB.  Badgers have been shown to be a source of TB in cattle for many years.  Much research has been carried out in the field in Ireland which has shown that.  For that reason, a programme was instituted in the early 2000s of culling badgers when there was a link between those badgers and outbreaks of TB in cattle.  That culling programme is one reason TB levels decreased very significantly from the levels they were 20 years ago to the levels attained in the last decade.</p> <p>  However, culling badgers is not in itself sustainable, either ecologically or in disease terms.  Considerable research was carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, University College Dublin, UCD, and many other institutions in Ireland, which showed that vaccinating badgers is as effective as culling once one gets those severe TB outbreaks under control.  Since 2018, vaccinating badgers has been part of our strategy and it is, in fact, a key element of the programme for Government relating to TB.  It is a programme for Government commitment to increase badger vaccination.  We have a major focus on vaccinating badgers to prevent spillover into cattle and, where necessary, we will continue to cull badgers where a serious outbreak has occurred in cattle which is linked to the local badger population.  This is a much more sustainable approach.</p> <p> Regarding the resources issue, the wildlife activity is very resource driven.  There are additional resources being put into it.  I will quote a few figures.  For instance, in 2018 we vaccinated about 1,000 badgers and in 2019, we vaccinated more than 1,600, while we continued to carry out culling where necessary.  It is not just a job for the Department but a joint partnership with farmers.  The committee is aware that we have put major effort into communicating how farmers can co-operate with the Department but also protect themselves.  For instance, we sent out a short message service, SMS, text with a link to a video entitled, How You Can Reduce Your Risk to Wildlife, to all farmers last year and again a few months ago.  We got a tremendous response to that.  Many farmers notified us where setts were and there was much positive co-operation at local level enabling us to be more jointly effective.</p> <p>  There are also things farmers can do themselves, such as securing feed stores.  In fact, we have leaflets and videos on that.  We get thousands of hits on our YouTube videos about making sure feed stores are badger proof and preventing badgers getting into the main silage and feed bins.  This is an important thing that farmers can do.  I agree with the Chairman that closing off that risk of transmission from badgers to cattle is critical.  It is something the Department puts many resources into and is committed to more.  It is also something in which farmers themselves can play a role.  Our important job is to communicate the practical steps each farmer can take that are practical and reasonable on the ground.  I am happy to go into more detail on badgers if the Chairman wants.  I will move on to deer but am happy to come back to badgers if anybody wants.</p> <p>  On deer, the Chairman is right.  We have heard the contributions from the farm organisations.  There is no doubt at all that there is much concern about deer.  Deer are part of the strategy, which is based on discussions with the farm organisations and other stakeholders at the TB forum.  Those discussions informed what is in the strategy agreed with stakeholders.  There was a TB forum meeting only a few weeks ago, again re-emphasising how we move forward with stakeholders.</p> <p>  As far as deer is concerned, where there are local concerns the Department is happy to test those deer for free and we do so.  To cite a few figures, in 2019 we tested 233 deer submitted to our regional veterinary laboratories.  These are not random deer, but ones specifically shot in an area where farmers are concerned those deer are transmitting TB to cattle.  Of the 233 deer, only two tested positive.  In 2020, 87 deer were submitted, fewer than previously, possibly due to Covid-19.  Again, these were deer submitted specifically from areas where there were concerns they could be transmitting TB and only three were positive.  In 2020, 40 deer were submitted from Offaly alone.  There was quite a bit of concern that, in the Birr Castle area, deer could be responsible for TB outbreaks.  Some 40 deer were submitted and none had TB.  We are happy to continue with that because, there is no doubt about it, deer can and do get infected with bovine TB and infected deer can infect cattle.</p> <p>  As referred to earlier, a study carried out in Wicklow by the Department and UCD, with the co-operation of local stakeholders and the local IFA, found that 8.3% of deer on farmland, or ten out of 121, tested positive for TB.  Zero deer out of 32 shot in the national parks had TB.  However, the isolates from those deer were compared to isolates from cattle and badgers and they were essentially the same strains.  I am summarising a very in-depth paper in the public domain which people can look into, but the same strain of TB was circulating in cattle, deer and badgers in this particular area of Wicklow.  Many studies over the years have consistently shown a level of TB that is usually around 10% to 12%.</p> <p>  In areas outside Wicklow, we do not find that level of TB in deer.  That is certainly not to say, of course, that it never happens.  However, we know what causes bovine TB to spread and the principal factors responsible for it.  The most important are cattle-to-cattle spread of TB, badger mediated TB and indirect transmission through contamination and so on.  If, for instance, there is an area where people are concerned that deer are spreading TB to their cattle, the Department will continue to test those deer for free and communicate those results to local farmers.  Where there are concerns, farmers can have those deer culled by applying for a section 42 licence from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p> <p>  That is what we are doing on deer.  When we say communication is a critical part of it, that means working locally with farmers where there is a concern and saying how we will go about testing, how we will give them the results back and how we will work together on that.  That works so, for instance, in Kerry in 2019, 120 deer were tested for TB and none was positive.  Of course, who is to say in a few months' time whether there will be some other area of concern and there will be positives.  Where that happens, we can make sure that information is spread back.</p></speech>

TB testing was meant to eradicate TB and we have been testing for decades now.  It has failed, and failed miserably.  This has caused frustration and difficulties for farmers, especially those on their own or older farmers trying to test cattle.  Can the Department officials explain why it has failed?  Many farmers believe, and I said it to the leaders of the farming organisations, that it is a money-making racket.  We know it is costing &euro;35 million.  Where is the &euro;35 million being spent?  Can anyone give an explanation or answer those questions?</p></speech>

Mr. Ryan has said TB goes from cattle to cattle.  Has the Department done any test whereby it puts five cattle with TB into a shed with 45 clean animals?  Has it done scientific analysis and does it have proof that cattle spread it in this situation?  When an animal is put down, the farmer goes to the factory.  Is a scientific sample taken from each animal?  Does it go to England or somewhere?  Does it come back showing the animal did or did not have TB even if the animal was put down?  If no TB is found, what steps are taken?  Is the farmer clear?</p> <p>  The farm organisations expressed their dismay at the letter that went out earlier this year.  They said it was a solo run.  Is it in the spirit of partnership to go on a solo run in the way that was done earlier this year?</p> <p>  When an animal goes down, there is the option of three valuers.  I have seen many instances lately where the Department refused the first figure, and when the second person priced the animal higher, the Department went back to the first figure.  Why is the Department judge and executioner of the whole situation?  Why are the appeals so slow?</p> <p>  Obviously the Department understands that small beef farmers and suckler farmers are struggling.  They have off-farm jobs to keep a mortgage paid and to keep the family going.  For whatever reason, when an animal goes down, they are not entitled to the hardship fund.  Why is this?  A small farm does not get a monstrous payment.</p> <p>  Mr. Ryan might have looked at this next point.  I have seen herds go down where there was zero grazing and the gates would not let in badgers.  Is it that manure from the badger is on the fresh grass?  Is there a concern about this?  Has the Department done analysis on this?</p></speech>

We should remember what the TB programme set out to do back in 1956.  Fundamentally, the purpose of the programme was to have the necessary national herd health status to allow us to trade so we could start to export and continue to export.  In this sense, the TB programme plays an important role.  Clearly, it has failed to eradicate it but the strategy drawn up through discussion and consultation sets a path forward or a roadmap whereby we can drive towards eradication over the next ten years.  This will require extra actions.</p> <p>  As has been mentioned already with regard to where we are going, doing the same things will not necessarily get there.  What we do need to do is look at what other countries have achieved.  We know the policy frameworks they had.  They are available to us.  What we need to do now, and when I say "we" I mean all the stakeholders, including the farmers and the Department together with the farm organisations, is to look at the extent and bandwidth of the toolkit and policies that are out there.  We need to be able to apply them as appropriate to drive us towards eradication.  This is really the way forward for the scheme.  I will hand over to my colleague to respond to the questions on the samples from reactors in factories and the various other issues.</p></speech>

Well before Covid 19, we had a lot of public meetings and meetings with farm organisations.  We were in village halls and spoke to co-ops and local authorities.  We speak to anybody who seeks a meeting and we try to provide as much information as we can.  We have a range of leaflets which, of course, we do not physically give out now due to the pandemic but they are on the website.  We have videos on the Department's channel on YouTube.  We have a list of frequently asked questions.  Many of these questions come up again and again and we try to provide information because it is confusing for farmers when suddenly they are hit with all of this stuff coming from all sides.</p> <p>  To answer the specific questions, cattle to cattle spread of TB has been conclusively shown.  It has been shown many times over the years.</p></speech>

Has a simple test like this been done?  If so, where is it available?</p></speech>

This was established in the first part of the 20th century and it has been shown in recent years through whole genome sequencing, which we are now all familiar with from Covid-19.  There is no doubt at all about it.  I would be happy to have my team supply with Deputy Fitzmaurice with a scientific review of this.  I believe Professor Simon More from UCD appeared before the committee last year or in 2019 and outlined much of this.</p></speech>

We will be happy to go into as much detail and provide further detail if the Deputy would like.  In any case, there is no doubt that cattle to cattle spread of TB happens.</p> <p>  With regard to samples when animals go to a factory, when animals that are not thought to have TB go to a factory and a suspect lesion is discovered, that lesion is sent to our central veterinary research laboratory in Backweston, which is the national reference laboratory for TB.  It is tested to see whether it is something else or TB.  Where it is TB, the herd is restricted, and where it is not TB, it is derestricted.</p> <p>  Approximately one third of reactors have lesions.  This is a continuing issue on which we need to communicate better.  It is something we try to communicate better on.  Collectively, the veterinary profession has done a poor job in the past 100 years of conveying to farmers that just because they cannot see the bacteria does not mean they are not there.  We all know there are bacteria on our hands but we cannot see them.  Cattle can be infected with TB without it being visible.  With one third of them the disease has progressed to the stage where we can see the rotten tubercular flesh, such as we can see in pictures of people back in the day when TB was tragically too common.  One of the problems we have is that when we say an animal had lesions, people infer that animals that do not have lesions do not have TB, but actually they do.  It is just that in most cases, because we do annual testing, we catch the animal before the flesh has started putrefying and rotting.  Back in the old days, in the 1940s or 1950s when 27% of cows were TB positive, it was very common to have visible lesions.  We regularly get comments on this.</p> <p>  On the zero grazing issue, there are a number of reasons a farm that does zero grazing can get infected.  The Deputy touched on several of them and I agree with him.  For instance, even if the herd and the yard is badger proofed, if the silage is collected and there is contamination by badger latrines in the field from which the grass is taken, and if those badgers have TB - not all badgers have TB but if it is an area where the badgers do - it can bring it in.  Sometimes also a dead badger might be caught in a feeder wagon.  There can also be residual infection.  If an animal in the herd was infected with TB six or seven years ago in a previous herd and since then was sold into this herd, or if the herd last had a breakdown five or six years ago, unfortunately, one of the failings of the skin test, because it relies on a functioning immune system, is that an animal can be infected and some of them will not test positive.  In fact, the skin test misses on average approximately 20% of infected cattle.  This is one of the reasons we have this residual population.</p> <p> It is the same as some people getting infected with TB as children and then years later they developed the disease.  Some cattle can become infected at a younger stage in their lives and then, two, three, four, five or six years later, the disease recrudesces and they spread it to their comrades.  It is only then that it is discovered.  It could be residual infection.  It could also be bought in.  In Ireland there are 2.8 million cattle movements a year and there is no doubt a small proportion of these are likely to include infected cattle, particularly those coming from herds with a history of TB for the reason I have just outlined.</p><p>Having two clear tests means the herd is free to trade but it is not a guarantee that none of those animals has TB because, unfortunately, the test is not perfect. </p></speech>

The letter was based on a recommendation of the TB forum.  I will read out a sentence to demonstrate that this was recommended in the TB forum report.  Page 6 of the report states, "Provision of biosecurity advice to farmers ... should include detailed biosecurity advice to assist farmers in reducing the potential risk posed by introduced cattle ..."  It also states we should "develop revised risk categories which are simple, clear, and convey sufficient information", which should be printed on bTB related correspondence to farmers and would "include a summary of their bTB history and of inward movements into their herd in the previous five years."  The letter is based on a clear recommendation of the TB forum.  One of the things we are doing is taking on board the feedback from the farming organisations.  There is a clear commitment in the new strategy that communications like this, which would enable farmers to reduce their own risk and protect their own herd, will be agreed with the TB forum.</p></speech>

One of the key fundamentals of a national farmed animal health strategy is that prevention is better than a cure.  Senator Paul Daly asked how we can help more farmers prevent TB instances in their herds.  It has been a constant criticism of the programme over many decades.  Providing additional information to herd owners to help them inform their own risk is a fundamental part of the programme.  We have also commissioned the ESRI to do a behavioural study on how we can influence farmers to help them make positive behaviour changes to reduce risk.  We have all seen with Covid the different changes we are asked to make to try to limit disease transmission.  The concepts are quite similar.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy Fitzmaurice's specific question, the on-farm market valuation system we have in place allows for a live valuation on a farm of a reactor animal, which is carried out by an independent valuer.  At that point the herd owner or the Department can appeal the valuation and ask for a second valuation.  I do not have the most recent statistics to hand but the last time I looked, 97% of first valuations were accepted by herd owners.  By any fair measure that would indicate a broad level of positive acceptance of the scheme by farmers. </p></speech>

I have seen this on a number of occasions, where the Department then did not agree with the second one because it was higher than the first one and it decided to go back to the first one.  The farmer cannot do that.</p></speech>

Both parties have the ability to reject either the first or second valuation.  A farmer can also reject the second valuation and request that it go to arbitration.  Out of the 23,000 reactors we had last year, a very small number went to arbitration.  We are talking about a very small number of cases.  The Deputy said earlier that those arbitration hearings are not happening.  I can confirm that they are occurring virtually so they have gone ahead.</p></speech>

One of the things that came out of the TB stakeholder forum was that farm bodies had some concerns with the on-farm market valuation system.  With their input we agreed terms of reference for an independent review of the system.  That was carried out by Grant Thornton and was the subject of discussion at last week's finance group meeting with the forum members.  We have a number of recommendations that we can work through.  Grant Thornton's overall review basically said that the on-farm market valuation system, as it currently stands, is broadly a good model and that its recommendations are relative tweaks to it.  One of the points a number of the farm bodies touched on earlier was the level of frustration about getting reactor cattle off the farm as quickly as possible.  That is something we are very keen to work on.  When Grant Thornton looked at this scheme it said that the cause of the significant delay is the fact that we have a live valuation.  Someone physically goes out onto a farm, the farmer has a number of days to accept the recommendation and there is post over and back.  If we really want to make progress on that, it would be through an automated valuation.  We will talk through that with the farm organisations.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions which I will try to condense as much as possible.  I thank the witnesses for the information relating to deer and badgers because that answers my first two questions.  I ask Mr. Ryan to circulate in writing the figures he gave on testing, particularly of deer.  That would be very useful to the committee.</p> <p>  Was there a bit of complacency within the Department?  I was reading through previous meetings this committee had with the Department when numbers were reducing and I got a sense that there was a level of optimism about the figures that, in hindsight, was not warranted.  I do not know whether the witnesses heard Mr. Lorcan McCabe's contribution from the previous session.  He spelled out what the elephant in the room is.  We are asking ourselves what the differences are between Ireland and Scotland as regards the intensification that has taken place, particularly since the abolition of quotas and if there is a particular issue with intensification.  Does Mr. Ryan's section within the Department collaborate with other sections in order to come up with the responses to that?  Clearly, any intensification that takes place occurs because farmers need to intensify in order to deliver better prices and margins on their farms, or at least feel that they need to do so.  Is there collaboration or discussions around pricing, how CAP support is distributed through supports for diversification on farms and whether diversification could play a role?</p> <p>  We touched on EU funding earlier.  I note that the Department's opening statement essentially says that EU funding is reducing because of other animal health pressures.  Is the truth not that the European Union has come to the opinion that the money is not being well spent because the Irish programme is not actually delivering a reduction?  Have there been discussions at an EU level to try to secure additional funding for the new strategy moving forward, with increased funding if we deliver a better outcomes with our own programme?  I would be interested in that.</p> <p>  I note that there are subcommittees within the steering group and that one of them is a financial working group.  Is there a timeframe for that group to report and if so, what is it?  What framework is it operating within and will it be charged with carrying out a cost-benefit analysis of the TB programme?  As we mentioned earlier, we are talking about substantial amounts of money being spent annually.  We are touching &euro;100 million, a large part of which is being paid directly by farmers with the rest coming increasingly from the Exchequer.  We all have an obligation to make sure that money is being well spent.  Will a cost-benefit analysis form part of that group's work?  If so, I ask that this committee be provided with that analysis at the same time it is provided to the forum.</p> <p>  I understand that the other two working groups relate to science and implementation.  I ask for a brief synopsis of the specific role the Department sees those working groups carrying out.  In what timeframe will they be expected to bring forward any recommendations or proposals?</p></speech>

I have three brief questions.  Something I come across quite regularly, and which the farming organisations have brought up, is the financial burden on younger farmers.  Younger farmers have left the agricultural industry because of being locked up with TB and the consequences of same.</p><p> I am from County Wexford and one of the main issues I bring to witnesses attention this evening is the deer issue in County Wicklow.  There is estimated to be in excess of 150,000 deer in the Wicklow Mountains and across the county.  They stray into other counties and it is now a big issue in County Wexford.  I brought this to the attention of Department several years ago when it started off in the Gorey area of north County Wexford.  In recent years deer have come right down into the Enniscorthy area.  It causes a huge amount of hardship for farmers.  There is no doubt there is a TB issue around deer carrying the disease as well.  It annoys me that the Department has people on the ground but they are not from the locality.  They do not know the locality or the geography of the area.  Why does the Department not employ additional staff who know the area, the ground and where the deer are coming in and the problems are?</p><p> I know the witnesses have been asked by farming organisations to carry out specific research.  Mr. Ryan mentioned he has carried out research previously in County Wicklow.  That is not sufficient given the research that is required because the deer issue is a serious one.  This is coming from the farmers as to the extent of the disease.  Can the witnesses comment on the management of wildlife control of badgers and specifically deer?</p></speech>

I will cover several of the them and then I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Forde, for the others.  Deputy Carthy requested that the deer figures be circulated.  That is fine.  Members should note that those figures were presented to the TB forum at a recent meeting and they will be in the minutes on the website.  We publish all of this in our annual reports on our website but it can be difficult to find as it is not the easiest thing to navigate.  Members should note that all of this is in the public domain and that the minutes of the TB forum meetings are published but we will certainly circulate these figures through the clerk.</p> <p>  As far as the question about Lorcan McCabe is concerned, I missed some of what he was doing.  I was tied up with a few domestic arrangements prior to this meeting.  On the point of Scotland and intensification, we have very good relationships with our colleagues in Northern Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland.  We discuss this a lot because the Northern Irish, Welsh and English have similar challenged to us.  The Scots do not, of course, because they eradicated TB.  We had a meeting with them a few months ago and asked them whether they could tell us specifically what their programme involves.  For instance, it involves things like every farmer in Scotland getting a letter which informs them of their risk status, categorises them and gives them advice on how to reduce their TB risk.  They provide farmers with information to enable them to make decisions.  Farmers get a frequency of testing, based on their TB history.  They have risk-based trading and, as has been discussed, they have no wildlife programme for whatever reason.  I caught somebody saying Scottish badgers are different.  We have no particular indication of that but for whatever reason, whether it be density or something else, TB is not an issue with badgers in Scotland.</p> <p>  As far as the intensification issue is concerned, we think there is evidence that the increase in TB is linked to increased intensification.  We have carried out scientific research on this, most recently a series of studies in 2020.  The most important factor in increasing TB risk is the increase in herd size.  Dairy herds, for instance, are at a higher risk of TB.  It has always been disproportionate that a higher number of dairy herds are restricted at any given time compared to suckler or beef herds.  The figure of 55% of all reactors in 2020 came from dairy herds.  Our analysis indicates that while there are factors, such as the number of contiguous herds, the number of farm fragments and intensity, overall it is herd size.  This is combined with the fact that there are 2.8 million cattle movements each year, so that plays a role.  That is not to criticise intensification but it is just an observation.</p> <p>  There was a question on whether we link in with other parts of the Department.  Yes, we have much horizontal interaction where we work with and communicate regularly with other sections of the Department to discuss these issues.</p> <p>  On EU funding reduction, there are other animal diseases that it has been allocated to.  The countries that get TB co-funding are Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy and France because they have certain areas that have TB, although not nearly as serious as us.  Until recently, the UK got co-funding but, of course, it is out of the EU now.  African swine fever, which I am sure everyone on this committee is aware of, avian influenza and an eastern European rabies are considered to be more important for Europe generally than TB is.  A decision has been made to phase out TB funding.  We have had specific meetings.  Mr. Forde and I have been to Brussels several times trying to secure additional funding and trying to delay the winding down of it.  There have been discussions at EU level.  It is not specifically due to Irish factors, although I will let Mr. Forde comment on the figures because we have had funding penalties imposed.  I will let Mr. Forde talk about the financial working group as that is his area.</p> <p>  We would be happy to give a synopsis on the other working groups - the scientific working group and the implementation group.  It is outlined in the TB strategy.  To put it simply, the strategy states what we, the farm organisations, ourselves, and other stakeholders, have collectively agreed to do.  There are no easy decisions left to make.  We know there is a hard road ahead but what are the things that we have agreed collectively to do?  The implementation group is asking how will we do those things.  We have agreed to take actions on certain things.  How will this work at farm level?  It is a way for farm organisations and stakeholders to ask how this will work in practice and to nuance that because it is an important point.</p> <p>  The scientific working group is a group of experts on TB who have very generously agreed to provide their time.  They are under the chairmanship of Dr. John Griffin and provide scientific input into some of these questions.  TB is a changing disease in which the risks change, the context changes and there are new developments.  It is critical that what we do is based on science, that our policy is based on science and that the advice we give to farmers is based on science.  Under all of this, there has to be a basis of evidence.  That is the purpose of the scientific working group.</p> <p>  To give members a snapshot, the implementation group might discuss how a policy would be implemented on the group, how a farmer is told about something and how something will work.  The scientific working group is asking whether our policies are based on science and whether there are changes we need to be aware of that are being developed.  For instance, are there new tests or new risks that need to be closed off?  It will make recommendations, for example, on what advice we should give farmers on how to reduce their risk of TB.  Farmers deserve to have robust scientific advice.  How can a farmer protect himself or herself?  Deputy Kehoe made the point that many young farmers, in particular, are taking out loans, building up their herds and buying in stock.  What can they do to reduce that risk because it is devastating?  We have to make sure the advice we give them is based on evidence.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that the deer issue in Wicklow is a significant one.  Consistently, studies have shown that approximately 10% to 12% of deer, when studied in Wicklow, have TB.  I will include those figures in the summary of those studies in the note, which I will circulate.</p> <p>  As far as employing local staff is concerned, we use local contractors for our wildlife work and it is very successful.  It is one of the reasons we work closely with local farmers and our contractors are locally based.  There are often personal relationships there that go back many years.  That is one of the reasons farmers feel comfortable talking to fellas they know locally.</p> <p>  The Deputy made points on research with which I agree.  We are supporting research on the ecological role of wildlife and TB.  We are working on a project on that with the UCD school of biology.  We continue to carry out whole genome sequencing on isolates from deer when we get them.  As I noted earlier, while I completely accept there are areas, north Wexford, for instance, where farmers have very strong concerns about deer and TB, in other areas, such as Offaly, we cannot sequence TB from deer because they are all testing negative.  They do not have any TB to sequence.</p> <p>  On the issue of management of wildlife control, we put much effort into actively managing our wildlife programme.  We make sure we find badgers, vaccinate them and check how things are working.  Where necessary, we cull them in the wake of an outbreak.  We prevent TB in cattle by vaccinating badgers in advance.  I am happy to give more details, if necessary.</p><p>I am conscious of time so I will ask my colleague, Mr. Colm Forde, to take some of the financial questions that were raised, if that is okay.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.453" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1500" speakername="Michael Ring" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021030900002#M00700"><p>I will be very brief and will just ask two questions.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, is in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Is there good co-operation between the service and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  I do not expect the officials to answer this but I will put the question anyway: should that service really be under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  There is major conflict between the two Departments.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine wants to do one thing and the NPWS wants to do something else.  I have had experience of the NPWS, as have other Members, in relation to the way it operates.  The NPWS has a different agenda from that of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As a few people have said here this evening, &euro;25 million is a lot of taxpayers' money.  It is taxpayers' money because Ireland is now a net contributor to the EU so there is no funding coming from the European Union.  It is the Irish taxpayer who pays for this, along with the farmers.  It is the taxpayer at the end of the day who is paying for it.</p> <p>  I am a long time in this Oireachtas and for 25 years we have talked about TB.  We have had Covid now for one year and there is already a vaccination for it.  Why can we not do something with TB?  Why is there not something there that can get rid of it?  Is there a vested interest?  There are so many groups that get money out of TB, why would they ever want it to be gone?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.454" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021030900002#M00800"><p>I had some technical issues here between the two meetings so I missed the start.  If I am repeating any point perhaps the Chairman will inform me that a topic was already dealt with.</p> <p>  I heard Deputy Fitzmaurice's contribution, including his question on a person having an off-farm job that might affect hardship payments.  I did not hear an answer on that and I would like to hear such an answer.  I believe it is very unfair and I want to know what the Department's position on it is.  What drives the Department's strategy there?</p> <p>  The EU animal health regulations that will come in during April will impose pre-movement testing on herds that have not been tested in a previous six-month period.  What was Ireland's position on the formation of that EU law?  How does the Department see a draconian rule such as this helping the situation we have?  We are trying to minimise the cost to the maximum effect.  With blanket testing and including the lowest risk herds, if an historically clear herd is just going to be tested for the sake of testing or because one wants to sell some cattle, this will be an additional cost.  I believe it is certainly not going to improve our chances of eradicating the disease.  Based on Mr. Ryan's comments on the expansion of the dairy herd and the increase in herd size, which I would question but he did say it, there is a total contradiction in bringing in pre-movement tests from smaller suckler herds that may have their herd test in January or February if they want to sell off their weanling calves in October or November.  That is more than a six-month gap so they are going to have to test a second time, with an additional cost.  These are low-risk herds.  It is nonsensical.  Where were the Department and Ireland's veterinary representatives in Brussels on the formation of that new EU law that is coming in next month?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021030900002#M00900"><p>Deputy Ring raised one of the points I was going to talk about.  We have the Covid situation and there is a mad rush on all of these vaccines coming in.  We are told that comprehensive measures are being put in place to stop the spread of TB.  Farmers, however, do not see that method being applied to deal with badgers.  Since we started this evening the consensus is that deer are part of the overall problem, but it is interesting that in the Department's opening statement there was no mention of deer at all.  I believe it was Mr. Ryan who referred to farmers cutting down the risk to their own herd.  Surely the likes of Coillte should be pulled up when they do not properly fence around their lands to ensure deer do not encroach onto neighbouring farmland.  What can be done with Coillte to force this?  When a farmer is being asked to take all the measures to cut down the risk on his or her farm, surely agencies or State bodies such as Coillte should be made to do the same thing.</p></speech>

It was said earlier that 20% of reactors are left behind with the skin test.  I was surprised with that figure but I am not doubting its accuracy.  Do the officials have the figures for how many false positives are taken out with the skin test and how many false positives are taken out with the blood test?  Where there is a severe breakout the Department comes in with a blood test.  A farmer was on to me lately who lost 61 animals in the skin test.  The Department came in then with the blood tests.  He very much feared that.  It was spring and his cows were calving down.  It was a huge financial loss to him to go through the blood test process.  The view of farmers out there on the ground is that the blood test is taking more false positives than the skin test.  Has the Department figures for how many false positives are taken on the skin tests and how many false positives are taken on the blood tests?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.457" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021030900002#M01100"><p>I will proceed with some of these issues and then hand over to my colleagues for some of the other points.  On Deputy Ring's question about the NPWS, I will not express an opinion on what Department it should be in but I can say that we have good co-operation.  The NPWS licenses our badger activities.  It is the branch of the State with responsibility for protecting wildlife and all of our activities must comply with the EU wildlife convention as it pertains to the Burren.  Of course, badgers are a native Irish species and nobody wants to eradicate the badger population.  We report to the NPWS, which licenses us.  We provide the service with a lot of information.  That is the relationship.  The NPWS is the regulator and we comply with the licence conditions and provide details to it.  This is one of the things that has enabled us to vaccinate badgers sustainably and prevent cattle from getting TB and, unfortunately, where necessary to cull badgers in response to an outbreak.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a great point on the vaccination for TB, which comes up all of the time.  There is, of course, a vaccine for TB that we all got when we were kids, the BCG vaccine, which has been used since the early 1920s.  This is the vaccine that is used in badgers.  Just like its use on people, it is not a perfect vaccine in badgers, but it is good enough.  It provides sufficient protection to prevent the spread through the badger population just as it does with people.  The reason it is not used in cattle is because if we vaccinate bovines with BCG they may test positive to the skin test.  One then has the problem of not knowing if they were positive due to vaccination or because they became infected.  If the vaccine is not perfect, unfortunately a proportion of vaccinated cattle could still get infected.  There is good news on that front.  Our colleagues in the UK are putting a significant amount of funding into researching this and we are co-operating with them on it.  They have developed a possible way of differentiating between vaccinated and infected cattle.  We have co-operated on them with this.  A scientific paper was published recently that was co-authored with UK colleagues and Department officials.  If these things work out, in five to ten years it may be possible to vaccinate high-risk cattle and to differentiate those from infected cattle.  We are working closely with UK colleagues and supporting them on that.</p> <p>  On the question about EU animal health regulations and the Irish position, the EU animal health law covers a whole range of diseases.  Like all of these things, there are 26 member states trying to discuss it with us.  There is the Commission's opinion, there are the MEPs' opinions and it is difficult to get everything we want.  I believe we negotiated very hard.  We spent a lot of time over there and our representation in Brussels also does a great job, as members will be aware.  It is true that we did not get everything we wanted.  It is also true that the research we carried out in the mid-2000s showed that while across the board pre-movement testing does not deliver that much, targeted pre-movement testing at high-risk herds would deliver something.  One of the difficulties is that all the other countries with TB carry out pre-movement or post-movement testing as standard.</p><p>It is the norm.  The Scots, French, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish do it and we argue that in an Irish context we prefer risk-based testing and to look at herds or animals that are higher risk.  All these things come out as a compromise and representations are made by a range of political representatives on this.  </p><p> On dairy, doubts were expressed about the role of the sector where there was TB.  We had just over 4,700 herds restricted in 2020, of which 1,491 were dairy.  The number of dairy herds restricted is disproportionate and 55% of all reactors last year were in dairy herds.  We have to base what we do on evidence and science and we have to be blunt and say let us address and tackle the risk.  That is one of the things we are doing.</p><p> Deputy Browne commented that the measures are not applied to deer or badgers.  Measures certainly are applied to badgers.  We have put a huge effort into the wildlife programme for the past 20 years and continue to put additional resources into it.  It is having an effect.  We are culling badgers where necessary and vaccinating badgers to prevent outbreaks.  That is part of the programme for Government and most sectors welcome the sustainable benefit we can deliver protecting farmers and cattle while also protecting badger populations.</p><p> The point about Coillte was well-made.  Coillte is a member of the TB forum for the reasons Deputy Browne outlined.  The farm organisations suggested Coillte be invited to take part in the forum.  Coillte joined, is a member and attends the forum.  It co-operates with the Department and University College Dublin on research into the ecological-epidemiological issues around where forestry is.  </p><p> Deputy Cahill commented about the earlier question on the tests.  These are specific questions that we have videos, leaflets and all sorts on.  They are frequently asked questions.  I will circulate those to the committee.  The figure can be higher or lower but the skin test, on average, will pull out eight out of ten infected cattle.  The two that are missed cause the problem.  There are false positives with every test but they are not our problem; false negatives are our problem.  We are all more aware of this with Covid.  This is in our eradication programme.  False positives are unfortunate but false negatives are really the issue.  False negatives in the skin test are approximately one in 5,000.  That is not zero but it is pretty low.  People say they had a reactor and ask if it could have been a false positive.  Of course it could, but the chance is one in 5,000.  There are 4,999 chances that it is not a false positive.  It is like the chance of winning the lotto in the GAA club on a Saturday night.  Somebody wins but it is probably not you.</p><p> The gamma test is more sensitive and detects infection earlier, which is why we use it in infected populations, such as in the case of the constituent Deputy Cahill mentioned with the unfortunate breakdown.  When we know TB is present, we need to find the infected cattle and get them out of there earlier so they cannot spread infection.  If it is spread by badgers, we need to address that and other issues.  We use the gamma test for that but the Deputy is right that the specificity of the gamma interferon blood test is lower, at 97%.  On average, approximately three out of 100 gamma interferon positives are not infected.  Given that we use it in infected cattle, that is not the biggest problem.  The problem is the infected cattle we miss, not the uninfected cattle which rarely get taken out.  I sympathise with and understand the Deputy's constituent's concerns and it is something I hear regularly.  I agree we have a big job of communication to do there.  If we were doing our communications job the way we want to do it, the big concern for farmers would be, when the reactors have been taken out, what the chances are that there are other infected cattle in the herd that did not react to the test and will cause more trouble.  It is our job to communicate that better and we are trying to do more on that with leaflets, videos and so on, as well as talking to people and doing public and local meetings to explain this.  The gamma test takes out infected cattle who are not yet long enough in the infection process to respond to the skin test.  If someone loses ten cattle to the blood test, one may be a false positive but the other nine will spread infection if they are left.  We are about removing infected cattle, getting the herd back trading, derestricting the farmer and getting him or her back in business in a safe way without spreading the disease to neighbours or trading partners.</p><p> I hope that answers the questions and I will include that other information in the information we circulate on deer.  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Forde, for some of the financial questions, if that is okay.</p></speech>

Deputies Carthy and Ring have referred to the fact we are spending a large amount.  Last year, we had 440 animals taken off farms every week.  We spent more than &euro;2 million per week and 90 herds per week were restricted.  Those numbers are a deep regret but we have a significant responsibility on behalf of farmers, taxpayers and everyone who funds the programme to spend the money as prudently as possible to help drive down TB rates.  Those sort of recommendations have been made for decades and were a fundamental part of the Committee of Public Accounts report in 1994.</p> <p>  On eligibility for the hardship grant, the policy rationale for that grant is to support farmers who do not have much means to help them maintain cattle over winter months that they otherwise did not plan on maintaining.  That is why off-farm income is taken into account.  I just wanted to explain the policy rationale behind the eligibility for the hardship grant.  I think those were the questions on the financial side in that group.</p></speech>

Regarding small farmers with no choice but to work off-farm to keep the farm going, what is the rationale for not giving them the hardship grant?  It is the cattle that will suffer.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.473" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021030900002#A00200"><p>I thank members and witnesses for participating in this committee meeting in line with the exceptional circumstances due to Covid-19.  I remind everyone that, apart from me and the members of the committee secretariat, members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and members are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Stanton and Duffy.</p> <p>  We will continue our consideration of the general scheme of the Employment Permits (Consolidation and Amendment) Bill 2019, which has been submitted to the committee by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for pre-legislative scrutiny.  At the previous meeting we received a briefing from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  To discuss the matter today, I am pleased to welcome from the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, Dr. Kara McGann and Ms Joanne Redmond, and from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, Mr. Liam Berney.</p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain to the witnesses some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding reference that may be made to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are to give evidence remotely from a location outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Opening statements have already been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration of this matter I now invite Dr. McGann from IBEC to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

IBEC was delighted to contribute to the review of economic migration policy which served to inform many elements of this Bill.  The Bill seeks to build upon the existing employment permits system which has provided a strong framework to supplement skills and labour needs in the State in recent years, and ensure it is future-proof, agile and responsive to the dynamic Irish labour market.  It gives priority, correctly in our view, to the ability of the system to adapt to rapid changes of a positive or negative nature in the needs of the labour market of the future.  This will support the competitiveness of business in Ireland while still prioritising the Irish and EEA labour pool, continuing to safeguard the labour market, and supporting the employment rights of permit holders.  However, its success will be ultimately judged by how it delivers.  This is a complex area that requires collaboration from all stakeholders, including business, if we are to respond to the changing needs of our economy and its citizens.  It is essential that business is supported to remain competitive and agile against a backdrop of the pandemic, Brexit, globalisation, changing demographics and consumer preferences and that we ensure the capacity of business not only to meet existing demands but to grow with the needs of the market.  This will require a combination of workers, including those requiring employment permits.</p> <p>  Industry remains committed to enhancing our indigenous skills supply to meet labour market needs through a combination of upskilling and reskilling programmes.  This has been demonstrated through collaborations between industry and education on various Skillnet, Springboard and apprenticeship programmes and the ICT skills action plans aimed at building the domestic supply of high-level ICT graduates.  Employers will also engage fully in the labour market activation measures proposed for the pandemic recovery effort.  Despite this, we know that given the fast-paced, changing global business model, education and training cannot meet all demands in real time.  Developments in infrastructure, increased capacity, innovation and changing skills needs take time.  However, some sectors are simultaneously experiencing levels of growth that are seeing demand far outweigh supply.</p> <p>  The general scheme has identified several areas where flexibility and responsiveness can be built into the system.  These include reforming the operational features of the labour market needs test to align with the appropriate job advertising practices used by employers today.  This will also have the effect of being more targeted and focused in reaching Irish and European jobseekers first.  Introducing a seasonal employment permit will bring us in line with other jurisdictions and help alleviate labour market demands during peak production or delivery times in specific sectors.  The introduction of a special circumstances employment permit to deal with occasional exceptional circumstances where an employment permit may be granted for an unusual but important skill set and streamlining the processes for trusted partner and renewal applications.</p> <p>  The Bill also retains sensible rules such as the 50:50 rule.  However, there remains an issue with how that rule is administered and this is hampering job growth for some employers that operate multiple businesses in Ireland and results in the loss of jobs and projects to other international jurisdictions.</p><p>Due to their group legal structure, they must adhere to the 50:50 rule at multiple levels despite acting as a group in terms of their growth of jobs and employment and contribution to the economy.  Many find a disproportionate number of critical skills vacancies arising in specific teams leading to an imbalance in 50:50 levels despite the overall group being within the requirements.  This issue arises from the administrative decision to use the Revenue Commissioners employer registration number as the identifier for tracking compliance.  To prevent the Irish economy losing out, it is essential that a solution to this be found to help to grow the critical skills roles and the associated jobs in the Irish labour market.  </p><p> Despite its many strengths, the general scheme, unfortunately, does not directly tackle the issue of the low-skilled and unskilled workers who are also needed to support the maintenance and growth of industry in certain sectors.  Shortages among lower-skilled workers and subsequent pressure on wages have the potential to be as harmful to the Irish economy as a shortage of skilled labour.  This is particularly the case for indigenous businesses that are predominantly based in sectors that use a high proportion of low-skill labour, such as the care, manufacturing and agrifood sectors.  The absence of this category of worker is not being addressed by the pool of resident workers, and these sectors are not in a position to compete with higher-paying sectors owing to their low margins.  Failing to resolve this crisis is likely to endanger existing business and limit the ability of organisations to take on new business opportunities internationally.  In the longer term, this will also impact their ability to meet Department targets set for certain sectors &ndash; for example, targets under Food Wise 2025.</p><p> Many of the impacted workers in the care and food processing sectors remain on the ineligible list, thus stunting the ability of businesses to meet existing needs, let alone grow.  This is also impacting workforce development because some employers struggle to staff a shift, let alone release people for learning and development.  Given our commitments to lifelong learning as a way to remain competitive, this is a worrying trend.  </p><p> IBEC believes a model such as the lower-skilled occupations visa used in Canada or the essential skills work visa in New Zealand could offer opportunities and parameters that could suit Ireland's need for lower-skilled general operatives beyond what the general employment permit offers.  The eligibility requirements are for the equivalent of a high-school diploma or two years' job-specific training, and such visas define the duration, wages and conditions for the workers' stay in the country.</p><p> One of the challenges in the provision of low-skilled workers that arose during the review of economic migration policy concerned how greater access to low-skilled immigrant workers may stifle innovation and the automation of certain roles.  However, many of the sectors in question are sectors where future automation is not possible or where a transition to automation away from labour will be slow and costly, such as in social care and healthcare.  These jobs require unpredictable, non-routine work involving personal interaction and emotional intelligence rather than artificial intelligence and are not easily replaced by automation.  As such, the repeated reference to conditionality around knowledge transfer and process innovation to be prescribed in regulations is one that many employers may struggle with.</p><p> In an increasingly uncertain global environment, policy must continue to innovate and challenge boundaries.  New ways to attract migrants must be adopted to meet the labour market needs that extend beyond our capacity.  Failure to meet the skills and labour market demands will do untold, long-term damage to elements of our economy.</p><p> The general scheme reflects a welcome Bill that aims to provide a more responsive and agile employment permit system for Ireland.  In doing so, it will support the economy and its ambitions for growth while future-proofing the system for the expected ebbs and flows of the labour market.  I thank members of the joint committee for the opportunity to present IBEC's views on this important Bill.</p></speech>

The proposed legislation was considered by this committee in 2019 and, as part of that process, Congress made a written submission.  While much has changed since 2019, the concerns raised in that submission form the basis of my remarks today.  If members would like a copy of the submission of 2019, we can provide it to them later.<br/><br/>Before commenting specifically on the proposed legislation, we would question whether this is the appropriate time to be making the proposed changes.  When this legislation was first proposed in 2019, there were very low levels of unemployment.  However, because of the pandemic and the associated public health restrictions, around 500,000 people are in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  This is on top of the number receiving the jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.  While it is likely that a substantial number of these workers will return to employment following the pandemic, nobody can predict with any certainty how many jobs will be permanently lost.  In our view, it would be prudent not to proceed with this legislation until the end of the pandemic, when a clearer picture will have emerged on the numbers of workers who are unemployed.  <br/><br/><b></b>Turning to the specific proposals in the proposed legislation, it is important to note that migrant workers have played and continue to play a key role in the Irish economy.  The key issue for Congress and our affiliated unions concerns the rights migrants have when they come to work in Ireland and how these rights can be vindicated.  We have reviewed the proposed legislation from this perspective and we are concerned that some of the proposed changes will further undermine the position of migrant workers in Ireland.<br/><br/>As Dr. McGann stated, the legislation proposes to introduce a seasonal work permit.  We regard this as particularly problematic.  The problem that arises is ensuring that workers employed on such permits have the appropriate terms and conditions of employment.  However, because the work permit will be issued for a short period, the difficulties with enforcement will multiply and the difficulties for workers in securing redress will increase exponentially.  It has been argued by some that Ireland is an outlier in the EU by not having seasonal work permits.  If alignment with other European countries is to take place, it must be genuine.  This involves aligning all labour standards, including the right to collective bargaining.<br/><br/>It is proposed to restructure the labour market test so that it is easier for employers to demonstrate they have sought to fill vacancies within the EU and EEA.  It is a fundamental plank of our labour market policy that where employment vacancies arise, they should be advertised domestically in the first instance and then in the EU and EEA.  It is only when vacancies cannot be filled from these sources that a work permit can be sought.  The changes proposed have the potential to severely undermine this important labour market regulation.  It is also proposed that the rules would be no longer prescribed in primary legislation but in regulations and statutory instruments.  Providing that primary legislation may be replaced by regulations has the potential to undermine the role of the Oireachtas and, in turn, frustrate public scrutiny.  <br/><br/>The introduction of a special circumstances work permit is also proposed.  We understand that this new type of work permit would be available in circumstances where a specific niche need has been identified and the normal conditions attaching to the granting of a work permit cannot be fulfilled.  It is proposed that the rules for the granting of such work permits be provided for in regulations.  We suggest that further scrutiny is required to determine the extent to which there is a need for this type of work permit.  If it has been established that there is a genuine need for this, the rules applying to the operation of the scheme should be prescribed in primary legislation.<br/><br/>Congress recognises the valuable role that migrant workers play in our country.  They play a crucial role in providing many important public services.  During the pandemic, they have been crucial to the functioning of the health service.  We are concerned that the proposed legislation seems to be addressing the needs of employers only and is aimed at making it easier for employers to obtain work permits.  There are no proposals in the draft legislation to enhance and protect migrant workers or to ensure they are guaranteed their employment rights while working here.<br/><br/>Leaving aside the shortcomings in the proposed Bill and the balancing measures that might be put in place, we question whether it is appropriate to make such fundamental changes to the work permits regime when there is great uncertainty over the state of the labour market and the rates of unemployment we will face when the pandemic is over.<br/><br/>I am happy to take questions.  I apologise for the notifications that could be heard on my laptop as I was speaking.  I do not know how to turn them off.</p></speech>

I invite members to discuss this issue with the witnesses.  First is Deputy Louise O'Reilly.  The Sinn F&eacute;in group has 14 minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021030900002#B00500"><p>I thank the witnesses. I want to address the issue of the seasonal employment permits in the first instance because I find them to comprise the most troubling aspect of this legislation.  I want to put some questions to the representatives of IBEC.  By way of context, I want to refer to answers that were sent to us by the Department in response to questions I asked last week.</p><p>Regarding initiatives undertaken in respect of the meat processing sector, the Department stated that the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, had been active in the sector for a number of years carrying out inspections.  I will not read all of the replies, but the important figure is the 46% of inspections that detected breaches of employment law to some extent, for example, adequate records, working time, pay issues and employment permit issues.  The WRC recovered almost &euro;184,000 in outstanding wages.  It is shocking that we are not just discussing bringing more workers into that environment but also shortening the time they are in Ireland.  As ICTU pointed out in its submission, this greatly hinders workers' ability to vindicate their legal rights because it is not possible for people to get organised or become familiar with their legal entitlements if they are only in Ireland for a couple of months.  We see from this information that, in some instances, we cannot trust employers in this regard.  As we found out, 46% of employers were not adhering to the requirements.  In light of this, do the representatives from IBEC believe it is fair to bring workers into that environment?  Clearly, the issues in question have not been addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.481" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kara McGann" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021030900002#C00200"><p>Regardless of whether a worker is on a permit, the fundamental position that all employees, including those on permits, have the protection of employment rights legislation is not impacted.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned seasonal work permits specifically.  The Department decides on durations, protection of employment rights, remuneration and the conditions attached to those permits.  We know from across the range of industries that need seasonal workers that this is a pressing need, one that cannot be met locally.  We are continuing to look locally, though.  For example, Teagasc and the Department of Social Protection initiated the help to harvest programme last year.  It was not very successful, but employers are keen to engage again this year, take the lessons from last year and, it is hoped, increase the number of local workers who join the programme.</p> <p>  Regarding breaches of the legislation, from talking to colleagues in other sectors, they welcome the announced and unannounced inspections and those breaches being addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.482" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021030900002#C00300"><p>Dr. McGann referred to the lessons of last year.  As some of those present might be aware, Senator Gavan and I are former trade union organisers.  I do not want to put words into my colleagues' mouths, but we learned that nothing encouraged workers like decent pay and fair terms and conditions.  It is regrettable that some employers have not learned this lesson.</p> <p>  In the ten years the critical skills list has been in existence, it has only been updated once, in 2015.  Is it IBEC's view that the list could and should be reviewed regularly and that more could be done to train workers in advance instead of adding to or removing critical skills from the list?  I will also ask Mr. Berney for his view on this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.483" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kara McGann" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021030900002#C00400"><p>Two issues arise in terms of the critical skills list.  First, we are seeing a rapid expansion in certain sectors that would allow for skills to remain on the list for some time.  For example, companies in the ICT sector are using the apprenticeship model but are still growing so rapidly that, as they worked out last year, even if every leaving certificate student did a computer science course, it would still not be enough to meet demand in four years' time.  The demand outweighs what the system can produce.  In some cases, skill needs cannot be met by the Irish population due to language issues.  Companies need native speakers plus cloud computing skills or so on.  Thus, languages remain on the critical skills list.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.484" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021030900002#C00500"><p>I am sorry for cutting across Dr. McGann, but last week I raised with the Department the issue of people with language skills who were already in Ireland.  I know this from my own constituency.  All they need is a small amount of training in the additional skills they would need, but no one seems to be considering this space.  Instead, language skills are placed on the critical skills list and companies are not looking to people who may have an interest in some of these jobs, particularly in technology where they could get training in Ireland.  No one seems to be examining the list or pushing to have it examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.485" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kara McGann" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021030900002#C00600"><p>From our conversations with employers, they are considering all aspects and trying to be innovative in how they approach this issue, for example, through upskilling and reskilling programmes, including various Skillnet Ireland and Springboard programmes, to capture what is already in Ireland.  Upskilling or reskilling someone in Ireland who has the native skills required would be much more convenient than going through a permit process.  It would be great to see that happening, and many of our employers are looking at every case to encourage it.</p></speech>

The Department's name is too long to say.  At the webinar, the Minister launched his Department's strategy statement for the next three years.  A large emphasis was placed on reskilling and upskilling workers in the economy.  There was a particular emphasis on apprenticeships and ensuring they could address the economy's skills needs.  The statement included an ambitious target of increasing the number of apprenticeships.  That is an initiative I hope will address some of the issues that the Deputy has referenced as well as some of the gaps in employers' workforces.</p> <p>  Those present may know that I am a member of the WRC's board.  I imagine what Deputy O'Reilly has pointed out is merely the tip of the iceberg.  In the early 2000s, an agreement was reached between ICTU and the Government to have 90 labour inspectors in the WRC.  That figure has never been reached.  Currently, the WRC has 47 inspectors.  Imagine what would be uncovered if it had its full complement of inspectors.  The Deputy's point is a valid one and there is a great deal of exploitation in some parts of the economy, although not in all.  The statistic would be much more shocking if the WRC had its full complement of inspectors available to it to carry out this work.  Perhaps this is an issue the committee can consider in its consideration of this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.490" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021030900002#D00100"><p>It is a very important issue which I hope the committee will consider.  It is an area which we do not often get to shine a light on.  I shudder to think of what happens to those workers when the spotlight goes off them and the inspectors pack their bags and go home.  We have been told repeatedly that this is an issue because we are dealing with companies that operate with a low margin but when we are talking about meat processing, we are talking about companies such as the Goodman Group making &euro;170 million profit in 2018 with assets of more than &euro;3.45 billion.  We are certainly talking about low pay; I am not convinced that we are talking about low margins because it does not seem to me that the profits are not being made.  The push is on to increase the numbers here but it is clear that exploitation is rife in this sector.  Every report that is conducted points to that.  Mr. Berney, by way of his own experience, has advised us of that.  We know if there were more inspectors, they would be uncovering more breaches which should give us pause for thought.</p> <p>  I want to reflect for a moment on the submission from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, with regard to the timing of this.  There is a huge amount of uncertainty for workers at the moment.  When and how the economy will restart is somewhat unknowable.  Do the representatives from IBEC have an opinion about the timing of this particular legislation and the call for alignment which in some respects might be welcomed, but it is never alignment when it comes to outlawing low-hour contracts, recognition for trade unions or the right to collective bargaining.  If we are going to talk about alignment, would the representatives from IBEC be happy if we were to align on all fronts with the others and not just pick the minimum or race down to the bottom but that we would actually have the type of alignment that would also benefit workers?</p></speech>

Even with the current conditions, we still see sectors with significant growth which are looking for skilled workers that are just not available here at this time.  While the upskilling and reskilling programmes that Mr. Berney referred to are in place with a view to the long term, we are still seeing a need for workers and for employment permits to come through as well.  It is part of a long-term plan, and being cognisant of the situation around labour market activation which we know employers will get behind, there is still a place for this.  I will ask Ms Redmond to speak on alignment.</p></speech>

That is in place regardless of the status of their work permit.  Where an employer recognises a trade union, they will be subject to any collective bargaining agreement in place.  Where there is not a union, those workers will have the same engagement with the organisation as all other employees, Irish and European.  IBEC is aware of the increasing desire for collectivism and is conscious of all stakeholders in all businesses, particularly employees.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have asked through the Labour Employer Economic Forum to review social dialogue and how that can be strengthened.</p></speech>

They are given a work permit which has information in English on the back, directing them to a website with multilingual information.  They are not the same and to pretend they are is doing them a grave disservice because it pretends that they do not need the additional supports which they absolutely do.  Of course they have a right to join a trade union, and I would encourage every single person to do exactly that, because in the absence of a Government willing to legislate, it is a worker's best protection.  However, it is unfair and disingenuous to claim that they are the same as other workers; they are clearly not.</p></speech>

Overall, the Bill will make a significant impact by allowing greater flexibility for employment permits and modernising the existing legislation.  Pre-Covid, there was significant feedback from sectors including agriculture about how challenging it was for operators to fill certain positions.  The introduction of seasonal work permits will go some way to addressing this.</p> <p>  I take ICTU's point about the uncertainty around what the economy will look like after Covid.  However, my clear understanding is that in all countries which have seasonal work permits, including all our fellow EU member states, there has been a constant need for the permit regardless of the economy.  The most stark example is probably in Greece.  At the height of its crisis, despite extremely high levels of unemployment, evidence shows there was still a need for the seasonal work permit.  I also appreciate ICTU's concerns around enforcement regarding any exploitation of the scheme and the terms and conditions for these workers.  The Department has said workers on a seasonal work permit will have their entitlements upheld which is welcome.  We need to ensure this is the case.  If not, severe penalties should be put in place to deter the minority who may consider exploiting workers on such a scheme, including substantial financial penalties, and that any such exploitation will bar companies from future participation in the scheme.  That would be vital. </p> <p>  I have two questions for Dr. McGann.  She outlined valid concerns around the implementation of the 50:50 rule.  Is there any obvious solution to that or is it simply a case that Revenue needs to adjust how it carries out its oversight role?  Will Dr. McGann explain more about IBEC's proposal for Ireland to introduce a programme such as the lower skills occupations visa in Canada or the essential skills work visa in New Zealand?  My knowledge is limited enough but friends have used the essential skills visa in New Zealand, and built up very successful careers and lives there and speak very highly of it.  Will Dr. McGann outline what they offer that the general employment permit does not?  Is IBEC aware of challenges or issues such programmes have presented in Canada or New Zealand?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.495" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kara McGann" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021030900002#D00600"><p>The 50:50 rule seems to be down to the decision to use that particular identifier number.  If a cluster identifier number was used instead, then the 50:50 rule as a group would overcome that particular challenge.  What is happening is, say, a company which has four entities in Ireland and, for intellectual property reasons, one is grouped around certain stills, they can find that a particular need for those critical skills falls into one or other of the four entities.</p><p>Whereas as a group it is meeting the 50:50 needs completely, one entity may fall out of line.  We are seeing that it is leading to the loss of jobs and substantial projects to other international jurisdictions.  As it is a kind of technical administrative issue, it could totally be overcome by the use of a different identifier, such as a cluster identifier.</p><p> On the low-skills occupation visa in Canada and the essential skills work visa in New Zealand, the eligibility around particular visas is around a high-skills diploma or two years of specific training.  People can stay in the country from six to 24 months, with all of this set by the state.  As such, it would fill immediate labour shortage where gaps exist.  The visas would define the duration, wages and the conditions for stay.  What would be different to how we stand currently is that there are still roles on the ineligible lists because they do not meet the criteria around the general permits that would fit within this cohort of permits and allow that flexibility within the system.  In particular, in the care sector, for example, there may be particular needs at a particular time not meeting the criteria but there may be grave demand for them.  What we have heard is that in those countries they can lead a pathway to meeting needs locally and potentially transferring to others if there was a desire to keep them in the country.  There is a capacity to do that if desired.</p></speech>

I know Dr. McGann, Mr. Berney and Ms Redmond and my first experience in politics was an industrial closure when Mr. Berney was representing the workers and it is great to see him here.</p><p>What is the evidence of what has happened during the Covid pandemic to people with work permits?  Have we seen people with work permits returning?  Will there be an expectation of many renewals coming up?  We know that areas in the caring sector are under very severe pressure but what is happening in other areas of the economy where there is a higher density of low-skill, as opposed to high-skill, personnel?  We know about the story in the high-skills sectors.  As Mr. Berney indicates, there are concerns about high unemployment.  We must also be fair to people who have expectations and so on and we must have a system that works.</p><p>A second point concerns apprenticeships and upskilling.  To what extent do IBEC or ICTU have evidence that sectors which are big users of the permit scheme are running apprenticeships and have they stepped up their performance with such apprenticeships?  What is the blockage?  There is a CAO process for going to third level but there is no equivalent clearing house for people who want to opt into apprenticeships.  Has either IBEC or ICTU thoughts on how to develop an easier way of getting in?  Currently it is about getting individual employment contracts and it is very much who one knows.  It can be tricky.</p><p>I take the point made about the meat industry and it seems there are problems.  Equally, it would not be fair to pick one sector, looking at all the potential offences and say it represents all employers using these schemes.  We should not visit on those who work in a legitimate way the failings of those who abuse the processes.  I am interested in the comments of both ICTU and IBEC on something mentioned by the previous speaker; should there be a clearer way that if the mechanism is abused, it will be closed to a party for a certain period.  Do we need to see some sort of <i>quid pro quo</i>in this regard?</p><p>Mr. Berney has said there are no legislative changes here for migrant workers.  What is he suggesting?  In general we have tended to say the same labour law applies to everybody.  Should we be considering, for example, the referral of some of these matters to the Low Pay Commission, which has expertise on both sides of industry?  It can look at some of these areas and potential failings in how law is either designed or executed.</p></speech>

He asked about permits during Covid-19 and we have seen a real impact with the Department trying to be as engaged as it can with individuals on work permits and support them.  We have seen changes to various parts of the process to try to push it out during the time to ensure people are looked after.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about apprenticeships and upskilling and we are seeing much engagement on this.  In the information and communications technology sector, for example, there is an apprenticeship model that is being used and we have seen others engage in the apprenticeship model.  As the Deputy says, it can be challenging.  In the past there has been a perception of third level versus apprenticeships and we really need to change that perception.  In some cases it is with the parents of Ireland and broadening our understanding of further and higher education, including the opportunities offered by apprenticeships to earn and learn in a way that is very attractive.  People can look at the opportunities this offers but there is a perception issue we must address.  It is work we are absolutely engaging in at this time.</p> <p>  There was also a question on abuses in the area and there are fines, court appearances and engagement with the Workplace Relations Commission.  Employers are precluded from the permit system for five years if found in breach of the process.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.499" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Berney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021030900002#E00400"><p>That incident in Tallaght referred to by Deputy Bruton was a long time ago and it shows how none of us is getting any younger.</p> <p>  The current position is very difficult for migrant workers, particularly as the height of the pandemic occurred at times of the year like Christmas.  I do not have any sense that there has been a massive reduction in the number of migrant numbers in the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is in fact self-evident that if we did not have the migrant workers in the health service, we would have been in much deeper trouble.  The migrant workers in the health service by and large work for the HSE and get the same treatment,  and terms and conditions of employment.  I could not absolutely say the same for the private healthcare institutions such as private nursing homes etc.  Establishing a joint labour committee for migrant workers in private nursing homes would improve their position.</p><p>It would make a significant difference.  I know a report was done on the private nursing home sector recently which recommended that very thing.  That report directed that activity towards the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to look at.  Again, that is perhaps something the committee could consider.</p><p> The number of apprenticeships in Ireland is increasing but from a very low level.  Colleagues from IBEC and Deputy Bruton have pointed to some of the barriers to apprenticeships, one of which is that in the first year, certainly of the traditional craft apprenticeships, a person must first find a sponsoring employer.  Sometimes, if a person cannot find a sponsoring employer, the apprenticeship is closed off to him or her.  Perhaps a structural change whereby apprentices spend the first eight or nine months of their training in the training college, as opposed to having to find an apprentice sponsor, might be a way of making a significant difference to the number of apprenticeships.</p><p> The State and public sector employers have a very important role to play here because predominantly, apprentices are hired by private sector employers.  If the State were to up its game in terms of making apprenticeships available to young people and also adult learners, I believe that would make a significant difference.</p><p> On the question of asking the Low Pay Commission for its views on the treatment of migrant workers, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, might be a better place to start.  Ask it to give the committee a view as to its experience with carrying out inspections in places where migrant workers are employed to actually see what their experience is.</p><p> As I said in a previous contribution, I am on the board.  We do not get the full range of information, however.  I cannot, therefore, really comment in any great detail except to say there is a problem with exploitation in some parts of the economy.  To be clear with everybody here, from an ICTU perspective, migrant workers are not the problem.  The problem is the treatment migrant workers get when they arrive here.  Unfortunately, they fall into the hands of some terrible, unscrupulous employers.  That is the difficulty.  If we could be guaranteed that a migrant worker coming here would have the exact same treatment as any other worker in the economy, then perhaps this kind of discussion would not be necessary.  Unfortunately, however, that is not the lived experience of all migrant workers.</p><p> I hope that deals with the questions asked by Deputy Bruton.</p></speech>

I have two quick follow-up questions.  The perception of apprenticeships is largely dictated by the opportunities that exist.  It is not that the mammies of Ireland do not want people to be in a skilled work force or skilled trades or whatever.  It is the lack of opportunities.  It is a person not having a CAO place or, as Mr. Berney said, needing an individual sponsor.  I absolutely agree with him.  We need to see the State in there as a player and as an employer, not just as provider of the skills.  We need to see IBEC putting the screws on its members, who want work permit schemes and so on, to become big players in the apprenticeship world.  Even in the areas where new apprenticeships in the new economy have come forward, the take-up by employers is lamentably low.</p> <p>  Has the five-year exclusion rule been used much?  Do we see rogue employers taken out under that scheme?  Can the WRC trigger it from its work?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming in.  It is good to hear from different perspectives.  I will make a couple of comments and ask a couple of questions.</p> <p>  First, I have spoken to the head of Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board, ETB, and to guidance counsellors about apprenticeships.  One of the issues seems to be that apprenticeships often start in January.  I also raised this in the Seanad.  It is hard for a young person leaving school in June to twiddle his or her thumbs until the following January when most of his or her equals are going to have a laugh for the summer and then go to college in September.  We really need to look at that.</p> <p> It is prohibitive that a person must be on social welfare for at least six months before he or she can take up many of these apprenticeships.  We really need to change that.  Why tell people to stay on social welfare for six months to take up an apprenticeship?  Why is starting in January so common among apprenticeships?  I would really like to hear some information on that one simple issue.  Can we change that in some way?  I know from speaking with many of my guidance counsellor friends who work in secondary schools that when their students seek to take up apprenticeships, in many cases they must wait until January.  I would like information on that.  In addition, it would perhaps save the State money if we are not asking them all to go on the dole for six months.  The sooner they get stuck into something else, the better it is for them.  It is never good for anybody to stay on social welfare if he or she does not want to do so.</p> <p>  I will raise a couple of other issues.  I know from talking to the heads of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, that when they carry out training, it is uncertified.  That means they are upskilling many of the small employees but not similarly qualifying them.  A huge issue in the SME sector, which accounts for a big portion of our employees and employers, is that when they carry out training, it is not certified.  I know from teaching in the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, and Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, that it is not that hard to reach the specific learning outcomes for modules to get certification in education.</p> <p>  I would love to see the LEOs working with the education and training board, ETB, and IBEC perhaps getting involved in some way to encourage that by looking at the apprenticeships and skills needed and seeing how they can fit into some kind of FETAC level 5, 6, 7 or 8 module, depending on what skills they are bringing to it.</p> <p>  Where are the 90 WRC inspectors?  What we are doing about getting more of them.  Everybody here wants every employee and employer to be treated well.  Therefore, if we do not have enough WRC inspectors, can we as a committee ask when we are getting the rest of them?  If we only have 47 inspectors out of 90, what is the plan for getting a few more?  What happens with those inspections?  What is the follow-up?</p> <p>  I have been a migrant worker.  I emigrated to America and Germany in my time and encountered language barrier and bad payment issues.  Luckily, an Irish lad, who is now actually a millionaire, set up a support company for getting tax back for people.  At the time, we could go to him and he could stand up for us.  It is, however, very hard for a young migrant to be empowered to stand up for himself or herself.  Therefore, the thought of meat factory workers getting mistreated is terrible.  The meat factory workers and their employers, who are in the minority, are not the benchmark we should be working off for the employers or employees.  It is one small section of the whole issue around workers' rights.</p> <p>  It is great that the Government has agreed to 10,000 apprenticeships overall.  The will is there from Government; we now need to figure out the "how" of it all.  At least the will is there, which is great; 10,000 per year is a good figure to aim towards.  We now need to figure out how to do it.  I know the Ministers, Deputies McEntee and O'Gorman, are working on the direct provision centre issue.  It occurs to me that we have more than 5,000 asylum seekers.</p><p>Many of them are extremely well qualified.  If we are stuck for qualified people in the workforce, let us see what we can do about speeding up the process relating to asylum seekers.  It would be madness to bring people in from other countries if we already have them in our direct provision centres.  I think the Ministers, Deputies McEntee and O'Gorman, might finally be beginning to bring about an end to all that madness.  One meets doctors, labourers, brain surgeons and carpenters in direct provision centres, so that is something to consider.</p><p> The twice-yearly skills needs assessment is brilliant.  It will be interesting to see where the gaps exist.  They should maybe become part of the committee's focus.  If there are glaringly obvious skill shortages in certain areas, based on that twice-yearly assessment, let us find out what they are and what we can do about shifting it.</p></speech>

Reform in the area of apprenticeships would be welcome.  It is something to encourage.  I have colleagues in IBEC who work in this area with a view to engaging further and increasing the number of employers coming into the area.  We have looked at it with our Reboot and Reimagine campaign with regard to Generation Apprenticeship and the focus on that as a clear and active option both for activation and for skills generally.</p> <p>  Uncertified training and upskilling are important.  Micro-credentials which we can build on, leading to bigger awards, are important.  We need to make that as user-friendly as possible so that we can see greater uptake and engagement because as the Senator says, it is possible to create a learning pathway, so we should increase that, especially when we have an ethos of lifelong learning to keep ourselves competitive.  It seems nonsensical not to address that to encourage and grow the level of qualification that people are gaining when upskilling.</p> <p>  On asylum seekers in direct provision, IBEC has a long history of diversity and inclusion work.  We would like to see greater access.  Where there is access to work, I understand that there are difficulties with bank accounts, driving licences and so on.  We need to look at that system to see how we can tap in to often very talented people in the direct provision system and how we can connect that better.  We welcome the work in that area and look to support it in future.  I ask Ms Redmond to comment on the WRC.</p></speech>

I have three questions and one comment, which are directed primarily to Dr. McGann and Ms Redmond.  There can be no doubting the labour demand in the sectors that the witnesses have identified, including care, manufacturing and agrifood, over the coming years.  I want to focus on care.  In the witnesses' submission, there is a depiction of care as low-skilled labour.  It is important to acknowledge at this committee that there has been a significant push in recent years to professionalise care, especially by SIPTU with regard to healthcare assistants, and all those coming into that role would have FETAC level 5 qualifications.</p> <p>  In the context of the lower-skilled occupations visa used in Canada and the essential skills work visa in New Zealand to which our guests refer, the only requirements are effectively the equivalent of the leaving certificate or two years' specific experience.  What is IBEC's attitude or position with regard to the professionalisation of care and those working in the care sector?  Does IBEC believe that it is acceptable to have people working in the sector with skills below the level currently required of those coming in as healthcare assistants in what it is proposing here?</p></speech>

We previously saw that in the childcare sector.  It is welcome to see it in the care sector.  We need to see that grandfathering approach where there are people in the sector who will upskill to ensure that we achieve professionalisation.  This is a growing area that we will have a greater need for if we are to achieve the objectives of keeping people in their homes for longer and accessing the type of care that they wish to have as individuals, whether with long-term care needs or general ageing needs in view of the fact that we have an ageing population.  We would be supportive of professionalisation.</p></speech>

On my second question, I thank Dr. McGann for the detailed document which complemented today's presentation.  She talks about a competition between the construction industry and the manufacturing and food processing industries for workers.  Will she go into more detail about what she means by that?  As we understand it, those coming into the construction sector would have a set of skills acquired in their own country and they would have to meet a specific standard coming into construction in Ireland.  Will Dr. McGann talk about how she sees the competition where people are drawn away from manufacturing and food processing and into construction?</p></speech>

We saw it happen prior to the last recession whereby workers were drawn into the construction industry.</p><p>Those indigenous businesses were not all still there after the crash and, as a result, workers were no longer in the construction sector.  We have to learn from what has happened in the past and look at how to address those issues, going forward, with the expectation that there is going to be pent-up demand for both domestic and commercial construction when restrictions are lifted.</p></speech>

Our guests talked about allowing more third country workers to come to Ireland and take up employment, particularly in the low-margin industries, which I take to mean jobs in which workers earn the minimum wage or barely above it.  Do our guests have any comments to make about the challenge of housing those workers?  How will they find affordable housing in the context of the high cost of housing in the country?</p></speech>

Addressing those concerns has been built into the system, in particular for people coming into the country with certain permits.

To make a general remark, this conversation has reinforced concerns I expressed at the most recent meeting a couple of weeks ago relating to the problems with the current heads of the Bill, the diminution of democratic oversight and public scrutiny by moving this issue to be dealt with by ministerial order.  We are not dealing with the issue of a second tier of guest workers with employment permits tied to the employer.</p> <p>  I will direct a question to Dr. McGann.  IBEC's position is that this Bill does not go far enough and that a model such as the lower skilled occupations visa used in Canada or the essential skills work visa in New Zealand should, effectively, be used here.  The argument given for that approach, as Dr. McGann said in her opening statement, is that "shortages among lower-skilled workers and subsequent pressure on wages have the potential to be as harmful to the Irish economy as a shortage of skilled labour".  Is it fair to summarise IBEC's position as wanting to have this new form of permits to bring in supposedly low-skilled workers and keep wages in large parts of the economy low because it is worried that wages may rise?</p></speech>

We are talking about different sectors of the economy, some of which are low-margin and highly competitive sectors.  Those sectors are competing at European and international levels while accommodating a minimum wage that is the second highest in Europe.  If we adjust the minimum wage according to purchasing power standards, Ireland is ranked sixth in the European ratings.  For those industries to remain competitive, to be able to meet existing business needs and grow, given the demands of Brexit and so on and the challenges of Covid-19, the proposal is that something like the types of permits in Canada or New Zealand could offer an opportunity here.</p></speech>

Dr. McGann said that "shortages among lower-skilled workers and subsequent pressure on wages have the potential to be as harmful to the Irish economy as a shortage of skilled labour".  The logic of IBEC's position is that it wants to be able to keep wages low, although it may not describe those wages as such.  It does not want wages to rise and that is the reason for its proposals in these areas.  Is that not a fair summary of IBEC's position?</p></speech>

It is fair enough if she does not accept that.  People can listen to what she has said and read the transcript.</p> <p>  I will address a question to Mr. Berney.  One thing that struck me in looking over the heads of the Bill was that the penalties for employers breaching the rules seem relatively low.  The penalties for employers not having an employment permit, for example, are a fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000 on indictment.  That is the same amount of money as was the case in the 2003 Act, despite 18 years of inflation.  Similarly, the fines for major fraud, forgery, etc., are also relatively low and the maximum fine is &euro;50,000.  Circumstances could arise where a company such as Gama Construction could be involved in substantial abuse of the scheme and only face a maximum fine of &euro;50,000.</p><p>Is that something ICTU has looked at?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.541" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Berney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021030900002#J00200"><p>Our view is that it is not particularly appropriate to change this legislation as things currently stand.  However, if there is a proposal to move the legislation, certainly we would be interested in the areas of fines and what employers would face if they were found to be in breach of the conditions applying to work permits.</p> <p>  A common methodology used is three strikes and one is out, that is, an employer is sanctioned after three offences.  If an employer commits an offence in this area once, it should be precluded from having access to work permit schemes because it is just unacceptable.  That would dissuade employers from abusing people, providing, of course, they can be caught.  That comes back to the question of the availability of workplace inspectors and the Workplace Relations Commission.</p> <p>  I was encouraged to hear some committee members talking about making use of the power of the committee to ensure the correct number of inspectors are deployed to the Workplace Relations Commission.</p></speech>

In ICTU's opinion, is 45 sufficient for the amount of work to be done?</p></speech>

That never happened, however.  It would be instructive for the committee to ask the Workplace Relations Commission the appropriate number of inspectors.  I think it would say in excess of 90.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, in my experience when I worked on the front line in the meat sector for a number of years, if one told colleagues that one had joined a trade union or tried to organise colleagues in a trade union, one would be summarily fired.  This happened not just once but several times consistently because that is what the meat industry does.</p> <p>  How can it be appropriate to offer work permits in a sector that treats workers so poorly and refuses to allow collective bargaining in large parts of it?</p></speech>

There are many strong employers as well in that same sector.  Colleagues in Meat Industry Ireland are certainly looking at this whole area.  Those places where there have been problems can also impact everybody else who is actually playing by the rules.</p></speech>

However, I want to focus on the meat industry.  These are the work permits that pay just &euro;22,000 a year.  Everyone around this table would be on multiples of that salary.  It is backbreaking work.  There was a tremendous report done by the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, Working to the Bone, which showed in great detail the levels of exploitation in the sector.</p> <p>  Given the meat industry sector's anti-union, union-busting attitude, along with poor rates of pay, how can we possibly justify, now of all times with a 25% unemployment rate, issuing work permits to that sector?</p></speech>

In the case of a knifeman, for example, there is a particular permit around training.  With the general operative permits, it is around English language training and assistance, along with sourcing accommodation, if desired, and so on.  Work is being done to address these issues.</p> <p>  It is a matter of striking a balance in terms of trying to look at what we need to put in place.  It is also being supportive of inspections, announced or not, with the Health and Safety Authority and the Workplace Relations Commission.</p></speech>

We know from the data we received this morning that there have been ten inspections per year for the past six years.  In that small number of inspections, effectively one in two inspections found wrongdoing.  Even the limited evidence from the Workplace Relations Commission shows there is a massive problem in this sector.  How can one justify work permits for a sector that is clearly dysfunctional and clearly does not pay its workers enough?  These are front-line workers.  At the very least - hopefully Dr. McGann agrees with this question &ndash; is it not the case that these essential workers deserve a living wage?</p></speech>

These are workers we need to have in our economy.  In terms of the permits coming in, all of those are based on detailed evidence-based submissions.  Otherwise, they would not be in a position to get those permits.  That is absolutely key.</p> <p>  It is not a sector based on minimum wage.  Many may come into the company on a minimum wage, the same as anybody else, but the opportunity to move to the next pay level is available after a period of months.  It can also include bonuses, shift premiums and so on.  This is what we are hearing from employers within the sector.  I cannot talk across a whole sector because of where there have been breaches.  It is a different part of the piece.</p></speech>

The MRCI declares that typically &euro;10.85 an hour which matches the disgracefully low figure of &euro;22,000.  It goes up for the very skilled boners to &euro;13.56, again an incredibly low rate of pay.  As my colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly said, this is a hugely profitable sector.  We are not talking about a low-margin sector.  Meat factories made &euro;170 million profit for the Goodman Group alone.  We do not know the profits of other operators in the sector because they are private unlimited companies which have been offshored.  How can Dr. McGann justify work permits in that situation?  Is there not a far better solution that we just pay workers decent wages?  God knows the meat sector can afford to pay them.</p></speech>

If there was a joint labour committee in the meat processing sector, it would involve wages being made through a process of negotiation between employers and unions.</p><p>Wage levels, once approved by the Labour Court and the Oireachtas, would become the minimum wages in the sector.  The difficulty with the joint labour committee, JLC, system is that, as my colleagues in IBEC are aware, employers refused to attend or participate in them.  The structure has collapsed because of that. </p><p> Colleagues from IBEC referenced the fact that they have suddenly seen the light and accepted that collectivism is the way forward.  It is to be hoped that over the coming period in discussions in the labour economic forum, ideas around collectivism, increased collective bargaining coverage and sectoral wage-making mechanisms like JLCs can become more common and employers will stop refusing to participate in them.  That could raise wage levels in the sectors we are discussing.  </p><p> Migrant workers who come here because their minimum rates of pay are legally enforceable will be entitled to those rates.  Crucially, they will only be entitled to them if employers know that if they do not pay them, they will be caught not doing so.  Increasing the number of inspectors in the WRC is crucial to all of this, as is including increasing collective bargaining coverage and making it easier for trade unions to do their work.  This is an important suite of measures that need to be adopted.</p><p> All of these problems can be resolved but there needs to be a change in approach in the employer class.</p></speech>

It is an important issue.  The witnesses before the committee today are not here to represent meat factory workers and employers.  Perhaps, if the issue is so important to some people in the committee, we need to bring their representatives in separately because it feels somewhat unfair that IBEC is being required to defend what they are doing at this time.  I do not know if that is what its role is.  It is an important issue to me but I am not sure if that is the purpose of today's meeting.  IBEC covers many different strands.  It is good that the issue has been raised.  Perhaps we need to examine the issue as a committee and bring other people in specifically to discuss those issues.  While there may be a small cohort of people who are mistreating workers in some ways, trying to sort it out today with IBEC is not going to happen.</p> <p>  What is the issue?  I want to solve problems instead of just talking about them.  What is stopping builders, tradesmen and employers in general from taking on apprentices if there is a shortage?  Is the issue insurance?  Are they not getting enough guidance?  What can we do to increase the numbers?  We want 10,000 apprenticeships.  Why are there are grey sites?  What is stopping builders and tradesmen from taking apprentices on?  We need to examine the delay and what we can do.  Do we need to provide an incentive?  Does the Government need to get involved to say that employers will not be liable for apprenticeships?  I am sure most builders have on-site insurance, for example.  What is the problem?  What can we do to solve it?  I would like to discuss how we get to 10,000 apprenticeships.  I would love to hear the witnesses' input on that.</p></speech>

There is ongoing public consultation around the apprenticeship action plan from 2020 to 2025.  All of the questions the Senator has asked are being addressed in that.  The consultation is not closed and the action plan has not been published.  Perhaps it would be useful for her to express her concerns to her colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harris, who is developing the action plan.  In our submission to the Departments on their action plan, we raised some of the same questions the Senator has mentioned.</p> <p>  She referred to construction.  It is a complex sector.  There are a couple of things that are important to say about construction.  First, construction is one area where there are advanced systems of social dialogue, collective bargaining and all of the rest of that.  That has resulted in sectoral wage making mechanisms in construction in order that people are properly paid and so on.  I do not want people to have the impression, however, that construction is perfect because it is far from it.  A large proportion of workers in construction are classified as being self-employed when they are actually employees.  It is a disincentive for people to work in construction because there is a growing practice of misclassification of workers in the sector.</p> <p>  My colleagues from IBEC are very reluctant to get into this area because they do not represent construction employers in general.  The Construction Industry Federation is the representative body.  The problem with apprenticeships at the moment is that there are structural barriers in their way.  One thing that would make a world of difference tomorrow would be for new apprentices to do the first eight months of their apprenticeships in training colleges, as opposed to getting have to get employers to sponsor them.  They could use that time to get the support of State agencies to find an employer or the State itself could take them on.  There are things that can be done to make apprenticeships more attractive.</p></speech>

What is stopping tradesmen from taking on apprentices?  I do not know if it is because people are being classified as self-employed or unemployed.</p></speech>

I had not heard the term &quot;greying sector&quot; before.  In terms of other sectors and apprenticeships generally, we are looking for increased investment in a generation of apprentices to encourage enterprise engagement, reduce on-the-job training costs and examine strategic innovation in that space.  We have a number of apprenticeships connected to sectors we work with, such as pharmaceutical, financial services and so on.  It is a case of trying to encourage uptake in those sectors.  It is something of which we are very aware and we need to keep the encouragement going.  Sometimes I think it is about awareness raising.  If we have not done something before we need to learn what is involved and how we go about it.  Greater awareness is being raised in those areas.<br/><br/><b></b>A figure of 10,000 is a significant number to get to.  We need to see it.  It is a vital part of the infrastructure of how we work and a way of connecting education and skills to the labour market.</p><p>It is really important that we see that.

A number of statements were made on the rationale for the appeal to extend the employment permits system, which has been made on the basis of low-margin sectors, the need to maintain competitiveness and, by extension, low wages within particular sectors.  We need to see more evidence from IBEC on this.  I note, in particular, the reliance on the CSO regarding the claim that the red meat sector is a low-margin sector.  I am looking at the CSO and the NACE Rev. 2 classification and I am highly dubious that the red meat sector can be pulled out from the CSO data currently available, both privately and publicly.</p> <p>  I am aware that some of the Dr. McGann's colleagues in IBEC have a strong tradition of proper use of statistics, and data, from the CSO.  We are at risk of misleading the committee by repeatedly saying that red meat sector is a low-margin sector because know the red meat sector is one defined by a small number of very large operators.  It is akin to an oligopoly and there are, as said previously, very significant profits in that sector.  I would like IBEC to come back and provide more evidence as to the low-margin nature of the sectors it has spoken about.</p> <p>  Much has been said about the enforcement regime and the clear need both for additional inspectors in the labour inspectorate and to up the game on enforcement.  A clear message has to go out from the committee, and, indeed, to IBEC, that if we want a more permissive permit system then we need to have very strong confidence in the enforcement system.  That confidence does not exist at the moment.  It is incumbent on IBEC, if it wants a more permissive permit system, which I do not believe in, to ensure there is a stronger enforcement system and a stronger degree of confidence that misdemeanours will be picked up.</p> <p>  There is a necessary conversation to be had on fines, deterrents and one strike and people should be out.  Mr. Berney referred earlier to three misdemeanours followed by more serious consequences.  I do not believe that is acceptable.  It is incumbent, particularly on the largest employers' representative group in the country, to very much add its voice to the need for stronger enforcement.  We can then have the conversation about a more permissive permit system, but I do not think the permit system can come before the enforcement.</p></speech>

Congress recently published a report on the meat processing sector, which deals with some of these issues.  I can make it available to members of the committee if they do not have it.  It highlights some of the practices in the meat sector, which, unfortunately, are not great.  Senator Garvey talked about meat processing being singled out at this meeting.  Meat processing is not the only sector where there are problems; there are particular problems in agriculture and horticulture.</p> <p>  There are significant problems for people who come to this country on work permits.  The issue around the short-term work permit is hugely problematic for colleagues in Congress.  It would be, in our view, systematically abused because if somebody comes here on a work permit for two months and they find out after three weeks they are being paid less than the minimum wage, it will take them at least six to eight weeks to have that processed through the WRC.  By that time, they will have gone back to their home country.  Why would an employer not do that, if it was minded to?  The points made by Senators Sherlock and Gavan and Deputies O'Reilly and Bruton on the importance of enforcement are a very significant message that should come out of this meeting.</p></speech>

We also have to remember that the vast majority of employers are going into this in good faith and are treating their employees correctly.  Tarring everybody with the same brush is not useful in this particular conversation.  Many employers are looking to increase the number of employees they are taking from Ireland and the EEA before they go into the permit system at all but also to adhere to all the principles set within it.  From an enforcement perspective that makes sense, but we cannot tar everybody with the same brush.</p></speech>

To level the playing field for good employers, I make a particular appeal to IBEC to throw its weight behind ensuring there is a much more robust and better functioning enforcement system.</p></speech>

We know there is exploitation going on, whether it is a majority or minority of employers.  I suspect it is a minority, but I imagine for those workers to whom it is happening, it is not of massive interest whether it is happening to many other workers because it is happening to them.  There are serious issues.  This has been a useful meeting because it is clear the introduction of a seasonal employment permit, as described, will only serve to exacerbate the situation.  We, therefore, need more enforcement, more personnel to do that enforcement and more employers to come on board, because clearly some are not.  Let us be frank: the workers are not exploiting themselves.</p> <p>  I am interested in the views of the IBEC representatives on mechanisms that exist such as a joint labour committee, JLC.  That is proposed for one of the sectors.  We have highlighted four: meat processing, horticulture, agriculture and the delivery of private healthcare.  Regarding those sectors and the need to improve the situation of workers in them, there is work to be done.</p><p>It would be appropriate to pause this legislation until the requisite number of inspectors have been appointed and the JLC for the care sector has been established.  Is there an urgent need for this legislation to go through now in the middle of a global pandemic?  With respect, this has not been addressed by any of the witnesses before the committee.  It seems as if people are thinking, "Let's not waste a good crisis."  The landscape of the labour market will have changed when we get to the end of this, if we ever get to the end of it.  Do the witnesses share the view that now might not be the best time for this legislation given that much other work needs to be done?</p><p> Nobody at this meeting has an interest in doing anything other than protecting these workers.  I know that the representatives from IBEC did not come here today to do the bidding of rogue employers.  I also know that it wants the workers to be treated decently.  We know they are not being treated decently and there is no point in us pretending that they are.  We know they are not and we have seen the evidence.  In the absence of mechanisms being in place, would it be a good idea to pause what we are doing now and put the necessary mechanisms in place for those workers to ensure their terms and conditions can be protected?  I am talking about basic stuff such as using language that people can understand on the employment permit outlining where they can go to access information about their minimum rights and entitlements.  Those basic things need to be done first.</p><p> Clearly, there is bigger stuff involved, including in the context of the JLC.  Employers can repeatedly offend and can repeatedly abuse them.  There is nothing to stop them simply moving on to the next worker when they get caught out.  Many protections need to be put in place before we consider expanding a scheme like this which, I think we have established, is open to wholesale abuse.  I do not suggest that the witnesses have come in here to represent the employers that abuse it.  However, it would be silly to say they do not abuse it when they do.  We need to have mechanisms in place to protect those workers before we push ahead.</p></speech>

I do not know if it will go from 47 to 90 which is where it needs to go but it is certainly recruiting at the moment.  The use of a JLC is one mechanism.  I am sure we are all aware of the potential challenges over sectoral employment orders in the Supreme Court at the moment, but that is obviously one mechanism.  I do not think it is a one-size-fits-all fix because as we have discussed already today many sectors are at play and many roles are unique.  I do not know that it is one-size-fits-all or quick fix, but it is certainly one mechanism.</p> <p>  In the absence of that, the State has set remuneration rates, as I understand it, in consultation with economic migration interdepartmental group and the Low Pay Commission.  It is fair to say that several protections are already in place.  I think there is consensus that the enforcement mechanism needs to be improved.</p></speech>

I do not think it is fair to say that protections are in place based on what the figures from the Department regarding one sector suggest.  We know that people are making out like bandits in this one sector with the money they are earning.  Nearly 50% have detected breaches of employment law.  It is not as if everybody is having their rights protected but it would be nice if they had a little bit of enhancement.  It has been established that the minimum rights of workers in this sector are not being respected.</p> <p>  It is operating with half the personnel necessary.  That level of personnel was deemed necessary.  Mr. Berney reminded me of the days when I used to have to work for a living back in 2006 when Towards 2016 was negotiated.  We had a very different labour landscape in 2006 from the one we are in now.  One could argue that the 90 that were needed in 2006 could stand to be doubled or more and it would be useful for us to have that conversation with the WRC.</p> <p>  I do not think we can say that workers' rights are being upheld because they are clearly not.  In a fractured situation that is not working for workers and in a labour market that is not delivering for them, bringing in more workers and expanding a group that we suspect is being exploited is probably not a very good idea now.  I ask Mr. Berney to give his view on that.</p></speech>

I do not think it is the appropriate time to proceed with this legislation.  It would be more responsible to wait until we see the state of the labour market when we emerge from the pandemic.  I shuddered when Deputy O'Reilly made her comment to the effect of if we ever get to the end of this thing.  I certainly hope we do sooner rather than later.</p> <p>  I know I am repeating the point.  Equipping the WRC to do its job properly is crucial to this.  I tend to agree with the Deputy that 90 is probably insufficient for the current labour market.  The numbers in employment have increased exponentially.  Even leaving the pandemic aside, the numbers in employment have increased exponentially since that figure of 90 was fixed upon.  It would be useful and informative for the committee to invite representatives of the WRC to appear before it.  I am sure Mr. Liam Kelly and his colleagues in the WRC would be happy to appear before the committee to give their view on that question.</p></speech>

I welcome Dr. Brian Caulfield, Trinity College Dublin, Dr. Diarmuid Torney, Dublin City University, and Ms Anne Graham and Mr. Hugh Creegan, chief executive officer and deputy chief executive officer, respectively, of the National Transport Authority, NTA.  On behalf of the committee I welcome them all to today's meeting.  I thank them for coming before it to share their expertise.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chair, and the necessary staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask that everyone bears with us should any further technical issues arise.</p> <p>  I call Dr. Caulfield to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I have been researching this topic for almost 20 years.  I am a member of research committees at the Transportation Research Board in Washington D.C. and at the OECD, and I have published more than 75 papers on this topic.  I was the lead author on a recent working paper for the Climate Change Advisory Council and I am also currently a member of the steering group on the review of the greater Dublin transport strategy with the National Transport Authority, NTA.</p> <p>  In 2020, in the midst of lockdowns, transport emissions dropped by just 17%.  This gives a clear indication of the scale of the challenge we face to get a 51% reduction.  It also needs to be considered against the backdrop of the following: population and employment growth predictions for the greater Dublin area, GDA, expect an increase in trips of almost 30%, 75% of our trips in Ireland are made by car, and the car population is expected to surpass 2.3 million by 2030.  Decades of poor integration between transportation and land use planning have resulted in it being difficult to serve low density areas with public transport.  This, coupled with an extensive motorway network, has almost locked us into car usage.</p> <p>  When we consider how to reduce our transport emissions there are two options: we can improve sustainable modes or change how they are fuelled.  In 2019 the climate action plan saw electric vehicles, EVs, as the main way of reducing transport emissions.  While I agree EVs will play a part in the overall strategy of reducing emissions, I would urge caution in over-reliance on this policy.  There is a lot of uncertainty as to when price parity between electric vehicles and traditional vehicles will be reached.  To reach our 2030 targets, assuming this price parity does not happen in the next nine years, it could require a State subvention of up to &euro;10 billion.  My research has shown the electric vehicles purchased to date tend to be in affluent, urban areas where there are alternative modes of public transport available.  Equity and just transition need to be considered in this space.</p> <p>  Over the past 20 years, several large rail infrastructure projects have been discussed in the greater Dublin area.  Projects such as metro and light rail expansion in Dublin will reduce our emissions profile. However, they may not do so before the 2030 deadline.  These projects will be longer term in curbing our emissions, but their planning and construction needs to happen now if we are to stand a reasonable chance of reducing our emissions into the future.</p> <p>  When we evaluate these transport projects, we typically use cost-benefit analysis tools.  However, this does not look at the opportunity cost of not doing the project.  For example, metro initially saw a delivery date of 2007.  The emissions that have been forgone in this example should be considered when making decisions on future infrastructure projects.</p> <p>  As I stated at the beginning, there is no silver bullet to this solution.  A mixture of the following needs to be considered: the need to increase our public transport capacity, investment in active modes, the need to consider demand management measures, the role shared mobility has to play in this space, changing how we fuel our fleets, and looking at technology solutions.  The target of a 51% decrease in emissions is a very daunting task for the transport sector and is happening against a background of increasing demand for transport.</p> <p>  I again thank the committee for the invite to talk today and I welcome any questions.</p></speech>

I am an associate professor in the school of law and government at Dublin City University, DCU, specialising in climate change governance.  In my opening remarks, I will focus in particular on how the transport sector in Ireland is governed and how this shapes our approach to decarbonisation.</p> <p>  Governance institutions are key enabling factors for decarbonisation across economy and society, but they can also serve as barriers to progress.  The international literature on governance of low carbon transition points to the importance of top-down direction from government, but also, and importantly, mechanisms to facilitate bottom-up innovation and experimentation.  The enactment of a strengthened climate action and low carbon development (amendment) Bill promises to significantly enhance Ireland&rsquo;s climate change governance arrangements, but its focus is predominantly at an economy and society-wide level.  It is also important to unpack how specific sectors of the economy and society are governed and how those arrangements help or hinder the transition to a net zero carbon future.</p> <p>  In research commissioned by the National Economic and Social Council that I undertook with my former DCU colleague, Dr. Laura Devaney, we sought to understand better how governance structures enable or constrain decarbonisation of the transport sector in Ireland.  We identified three key sets of challenges facing the transport sector in pursuing a pathway to zero carbon and set out ways to overcome each of these challenges.</p> <p>  The first challenge concerns how the transport system operates.  This system is inherently complex, characterised by tensions between public and private, rural and urban, and the role of special interests.  There are also complex external interactions with broader policy objectives and systems, including planning, health and education.  To overcome these challenges, transport governance should be built upon the following principles.  We need to adopt collaborative, adaptive and reflexive approaches to policymaking that enable input from a diverse range of public, private, and civil society actors whose voices are not sufficiently heard at present.</p><p>We should support bottom-up approaches to decarbonising transport that take into account geographical and technical variations, including different requirements in rural and urban settings.  Furthermore, transport should be understood as a social practice.  This means going beyond a technical view of transport as an infrastructural problem to be solved and taking account of social, cultural, and governance forces that shape our mobility choices.</p><p> The second challenge we identified is that climate action as a priority is not yet sufficiently embedded in transport policy and planning.  Contestation between different players has shaped the development of a carbon-intensive transport system to date.  To address this, the following steps should be prioritised.  Transport policymaking should be aligned with international sustainable mobility thinking that promotes an avoid&ndash;shift&ndash;improve framework for both passenger and freight transport.  I welcome the fact that the committee's work is guided by this framework.  The Government needs to do more to provide a clear and unambiguous commitment to decarbonisation.  The forthcoming Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill is a significant step in this direction, but we should not fall into the trap of thinking that one Bill can do all the heavy lifting.  In this regard, the mandates of transport governance institutions could be revised to include a statutory commitment to prioritise decarbonisation as their central goal, and the public sector should do more to lead by example.</p><p> The third key challenge we identified is that our system of transport decision-making is deeply fragmented, with authority spread widely among multiple institutions.  A variety of institutional remedies could help to advance decarbonisation.  Focused task forces can combine insights from public, private, academic, and civil society actors around specific transport challenges to unblock policy barriers.  Forums for peer learning can enable villages, towns and cities across Ireland to learn from each other to scale up innovative decarbonised transport solutions.  Deliberative forums for stakeholder and citizen participation can enhance transparency and moderate the impact of lobbying by special interests.</p><p> None of these solutions by itself is a silver bullet, but together they can provide a governance framework for the transport sector that adequately addresses the climate crisis.  I thank the members again for the opportunity to contribute to the discussion today.  I am happy to answer any questions they might have.</p></speech>

The following sections address those areas within the ambit of the NTA.  On reducing or avoiding the need to travel, Project 2040 is an important step in establishing the principle of integrating land use and transport planning to reduce travel demand.  The plan places a key emphasis on enabling people to live closer to where they work, moving away from the current unsustainable trends of increased commuting, securing more compact forms of urban development in all types of settlements and regenerating rural Ireland by promoting environmentally sustainable growth patterns.  Consolidation of development and the reduction of unsustainable car-based commuting are critical if a reduction in transport-related emissions is to be achieved.</p> <p>  The NTA's Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016&ndash;2035, while it predated Project 2040, has the same objective and sets out a detailed plan for transport infrastructural development and complementary measures to support a shift to sustainable modes.  The NTA is obliged to review this strategy every six years, and the first review is under way.  This review must take into account any new policy and Government objectives, such as the targets set for the reduction in carbon emissions.  The NTA will have a draft strategy developed and public consultation on it commenced by quarter 3 of this year.</p> <p>  The NTA has also developed a transport strategy for Galway city and the Cork metropolitan area in association with the city and county councils for those areas.  We are working with the regional cities of Limerick and Waterford to produce integrated transport strategies, all with the objective of supporting the consolidation of development close to existing and proposed public transport links, and improving the public transport and walking and cycling infrastructure to encourage modal shift.</p> <p>  On shifting to sustainable travel, the work of the NTA has many facets that together aim to improve the offer and attractiveness of walking, cycling and using public transport to effect modal change and enable the transport system to operate more effectively.  We recognise, however, that the quality of our public transport services has to take a significant leap forward to meet the demand for travel in the future and support the economic growth of the country.</p> <p>  Under the national development plan, &euro;8.6 billion has been allocated towards sustainable transport measures.  The three largest projects are MetroLink, the DART+ programme and BusConnects.  Strategies are also in place to deliver much-improved cycling infrastructure in our cities.  The investment is now being made by the Government.  It will see an acceleration in the delivery of that vital infrastructure by local authorities.</p> <p>  All three of the major programmes - MetroLink, DART+ and BusConnects Dublin - have been progressed to the extent that, subject to Government approval, the railway order planning process will be commenced later this year for MetroLink and for the electrification of the first DART+ line.  The planning process for BusConnects Dublin bus corridors will also commence later this year, if approved by the Government.</p> <p>  Galway City Council has commenced many of the projects that make up BusConnects Galway.  The NTA has appointed specialist teams to redesign the bus network in Cork and to commence the designs for bus priority measures.  The NTA is also working with Transport Infrastructure Ireland on the identification of an alignment for the proposed Luas for Cork, which could be developed if the densification of development in Cork city occurs.</p> <p>  On improving the bus fleet, the NTA is committed to a transition of the urban bus fleet to low- and zero-emission vehicles.  The NTA has a framework contract in place for diesel electric hybrid double deck buses and has ordered 280 of these buses to be operated by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The first 100 of these vehicles have been delivered and are being commissioned, and they will be operating in Dublin and Galway shortly.  The authority is completing the procurement of single-deck, fully electric vehicles and has published the tender for fully electric double-deck vehicles.  The authority has also purchased three hydrogen-fuelled electric buses, which Bus &Eacute;ireann will operate to trial this technology.  While the battery technology has advanced significantly in recent years to enable longer bus trips in an urban context without requiring a recharge in service, the future fuelling of long-distance coach travel in an environmentally sustainable way is challenging because of the distances involved.</p> <p>  On the rail fleet, electrification substantially reduces the use of fossil fuels in public transport.  There has been significant progress with the introduction of the DART and Luas, and the national development plan provides for further such public investment in the greater Dublin area.  We are working with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the DART+ programme.  We are prioritising the purchase of fleet in this programme, which will add much-needed capacity to commuter rail services.  It is proposed to purchase battery electric hybrid train carriages as part of the initial order.  They can operate without the electrification of the lines and can then switch over to fully electric vehicles when line electrification has been delivered.  It is planned, subject to Government approval, to place the first order in quarter 2 of this year.</p> <p>  With regard to other improvements, while the focus on this statement has been on meeting travel demand in the cities, because this is where the investment could return the largest modal shift, the authority continues to work on improving the Local Link rural bus services and the supporting infrastructure across the State.  Connecting Ireland is the NTA's programme to address the gaps in connections to local and regional centres in rural areas and to allow for the possibility of access to local services without the need for a car.  It is proposed to finalise the network of services on a county-by-county basis in consultation with local authorities and to undertake a full public consultation on the proposals commencing in quarter 3 this year.  As resources allow, we will implement the final proposals.  It is also planned to transition to low- and zero-emission fleet wherever practicable in these areas.  The pilot operation of an electric bus on routes in Dingle will assist us in the development of those plans.</p> <p>  Transformation of the transport sector is vital to enable Ireland's transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy.  This must be achieved notwithstanding the context of a recovering economy after the pandemic, with an increasing number of transport trips being generated every year.  To achieve this aim, significant investment is needed in our public transport infrastructure and services, in addition to sustainable transport measures to promote walking and cycling as carbon-neutral ways of travelling.  The NTA will continue to work towards promoting mode shift to public transport, walking and cycling and investing in the infrastructure and services necessary to achieve this.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Caulfield and Torney for their opening statements and for participating.  We are interested in their expertise in how we can achieve a modal shift away from the dominant private car and towards healthier and sustainable modes of active travel, public transport and multimodal options such as bike-rail-bike, as used in the Netherlands.</p><p>As this meeting is confined to a maximum of two hours, I propose that each member be given two minutes to address their questions to the witnesses in order to ensure that all members get an opportunity to contribute.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> I will start the questions while the clerk is noting the order of hands raised.  My first question is for Dr. Caulfield, who outlined the urgent need to roll out sustainable transport infrastructure.  Is the proposed infrastructure sufficient to shift people from the private car?  Do we need to look at other measures in parallel to push people towards the use of more sustainable transport modes on the demand side?</p><p> I will go through my questions for Dr. Torney and Ms Graham and the witnesses can answer one after the other.  Dr. Torney indicated the need to revise the mandates of the transport institutions.  Is he suggesting to the committee that the legislation that governs the NTA and TII should be amended to prioritise decarbonisation explicitly as their central goal?  Does he see more structural reform being required for these institutions?</p><p> This modal shift requires reallocation of road space.  The NTA is involved in BusConnects and the roll-out of active travel networks, including providing direction and standards for local authorities.  Does the NTA need to be far more explicit in its approach to modal shift by ensuring this road space reallocation is the basic starting point in transport planning and design?  Does the NTA accept that to alleviate congestion the public and active travel networks need to be the most convenient modes of transport and the road space reallocated accordingly?</p><p> How does the NTA calculate where best to target transport emissions reductions outside of the electrification of the fleet?  Specifically, is the NTA assessing to which parts of the country it is best to direct resources to achieve a modal shift that has the biggest impact on transport emissions?  How is that calculated or assessed?</p></speech>

There are extensive plans to increase the volume of public transport not only in the greater Dublin area but also around the rest of the country.  When that investment has been put in place and there is the capacity in the public transport network then of course we will have to look at demand management measures and road pricing.  We will also have to look at the level of parking we provide in cities.  The two will have to go hand in hand and it is the traditional approach of carrot and stick.  We just need to line up more carrots before we start to take out the stick.</p></speech>

The governance context in which Ireland and other European countries operate is one whereby for more than 30 or 40 years we have essentially hived off policymaking functions from central government Departments to State agencies.  Ireland is by no means unique in this regard.  This comes to the question about structured reform.  Ms Graham might have different views to me on this.  Suggestions have been made in the past about a potential merger between the NTA and TII to bring more coherence between the roads and public transport.<br/><br/>In terms of the mandates, the challenge is that we have a legacy of governance institutions that were set up in a period before climate change was the central priority in policymaking that it is now.  There are good reasons for setting up governance bodies at arm's length from government.  However, when we then fundamentally or significantly change the goals of policymaking it makes it harder for central government to steer the various governance bodies.  In this context, consideration could be given to revising the legal mandates of the governance actors in the transport sector.  It would need to be done with caution, with a view to avoiding unintended consequences.  I would not recommend simply taking a red pen and striking out or adding new language in an <i>ad hoc</i>way but revising these legal mandates would be a useful step to consider.</p></speech>

We have demonstrated that as part of the consultation we carried out in terms of the bus corridor proposals and the priority measures we are proposing for BusConnects in Dublin, which will also feature in the BusConnects programmes in other cities.</p> <p>  As a country, we have to look at how we allocate our valuable road space and whether, or what, priority should be given to that road space for walking, cycling and public transport ahead of the car mode but still recognising there needs to be space for the car mode for business and social activity.  In the BusConnects programme in Dublin in order to get priority and space for walking, cycling and buses the proposal we are bringing forward is to introduce one-way systems on key radial routes into the city.  This shows where we have demonstrated that where the reallocation of road space is available it should be prioritised for those modes.</p></speech>

Obviously, particularly as we are looking at connecting Ireland, we have a list of locations in which we want to deliver additional new or improved services and they come at a cost.  At present, we are in the process of trying to allocate priority given that we cannot provide additional services everywhere.  This would be on the basis of getting the best return in terms of the number of people who would use the transport service, while also recognising that we have to spread the services throughout rural Ireland in particular, where we may not get the best return but where a social benefit will accrue associated with the delivery of services.  This social benefit methodology is being developed so we can put some priority in terms of delivery of services.</p></speech>

I will pick up the point on which Ms Graham ended, namely, that relating to the social benefit.  In terms of the social and environmental benefit, it is the question of push and pull again.  Given the extent of the scale-up we need in terms of new transport and sustainable transport, does Ms Graham agree that we cannot wait for it to be market demand led but that it needs to be something whereby, to paraphrase Mr. Caulfield, we look at the pull as well as the push and that we are creating it?</p> <p>  Has it been the experience, as it seems to be in the cases of which I know, that where public transport is provided, the demand follows when the offer is made?  In this regard, I would like the witnesses to comment on two specific parts of the infrastructure.  Is there vision or scope for looking at new rail infrastructure additional to what we have, particularly given the concerns with regard to electrification and longer runs for bus transport?  What steps are being taken to include greater integration between rail and bus services, for example, more use of feeder buses to rail points and rail networks and more bicycles on those buses and rail services?  This is the interlocking piece in the context of transport.  Specifically, I am thinking of the west of Ireland where we have a lot of forced car usage.</p> <p>  The other item of infrastructure I would like the witnesses to comment on relates to what Mr. Torney said about the social cultural governance forces.</p><p>What of those parts that are not just about new allocation of the road but around creating new pedestrian and cycle infrastructure and perhaps making more use, for example, of rights of way powers that are there at local level in terms of creating pathways and routes that make towns permeable and which are not necessarily only on the road?</p><p> Finally, a technical question for Ms Graham.  I am aware there are a number of active travel jobs planned in local authorities but is there a question there of what kind of terms of reference they will have?  Specifically on the regional design offices, the new 18 posts, how much seniority will they have?  Will the national cycling manual be something they are really empowered to insist on being implemented in local planning?  Is there a danger that rail gets lost when we look at a county-by-county consultation rather than a joined-up approach?</p></speech>

I should say at this point that we have asked and allowed witnesses to send in written submissions to supplement the answers they give us here.  If the witnesses wish to follow on any of those questions with a written submission we would certainly appreciate it.</p></speech>

Obviously, where we have the greatest population we have the largest benefit or potential for using public transport and moving more people to sustainable transport.  However, we are very conscious we must be careful to focus not just on the areas of high population but that we also need to provide, as I said, the social benefit associated with public transport.  We therefore need to balance it between where the cost is lower because we can get some return in the form of fare revenue, but also ensure we have, through our Local Link services, the widest spread possible of delivery of services for rural Ireland.  Thus, it is about balancing the cost associated with it as well as the social benefit we can get and it is about putting some kind of formula across that that will allow us to prioritise.  It is not easy to do because obviously our ambition is to get services all around the country but we must continue to prioritise.<br/><br/>On new rail infrastructure, we as an authority fund the infrastructure associated with the greater Dublin area only.  We do transport strategies, statutorily for the Dublin region but on a non-statutory basis with the local authorities for the regional cities.  We can therefore comment on what is required in the metropolitan areas where infrastructure is concerned.  The infrastructure that is there can be built on and can be built to deliver better services in terms of the existing infrastructure, with some small interventions particularly in the metropolitan area.<br/><br/>On better integration between rail and bus services, that is the core of the work we do, by means of ensuring any new bus services we are providing feed into rail services and <i>vice versa</i>.  We are involved in looking not just at the bus services but also, because we contract the rail services as well, we work with the different operators to ensure we get better integration between those.<br/><br/>I will pass over to Mr. Creegan for a comment on the active travel jobs.</p></speech>

The key focus is the city regions, for the obvious reason that there is more network to develop but also covering every single other county.  For some of the rural counties the intention is that the regional design office is operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland and that its resources are augmented so it can also provide the service to deliver these cycling and active travel projects.  The Senator asked how much seniority they will have and will they be fully empowered to deliver the national cycle manual.  There seniority level will be a case-by-case thing but overall there will be a proper team in place to deliver the projects that are needed in every county across the country.  On getting the standards we need, we are updating our national cycle manual, we will be providing training to all the local authorities starting later on this year and all of those units that are being set up will be tasked with fully applying the quality standard set out in the cycle manual with the projects they deliver.</p></speech>

On the county-by-county piece, while we engage with the local authorities on a county-by-county basis in relation to their bus services it is looked on as a whole.  Therefore, it is about the whole country's bus services and how they integrate with one another and with the rail services as well.  That is the approach being taken but the consultation will be on a county-by-county basis.</p></speech>

I welcome the NTA's approach to the development of rural links which have been very good through Local Link.  I would like to hear her views on some of the more detailed planning that must be done with those routes to ensure we are going to get that modal link, if we can call it that.</p> <p>  An example would be the route from Kilrush to Ennis.  It takes two hours and 30 minutes to get to the train station, even though it goes relatively close by it after about an hour and a half, but because of the routing there is not an opportunity to get to the train station easily.  Therefore, any of the services being rolled out will need more connectivity to the other public transport links.  I know the NTA has been trying to do that but I would like to hear Ms Graham's thoughts and views on how journey times can be reduced.  I ask because the difficulty with some of the rural link stuff is that we want to catch every village along the route between two distinct points but in doing so we then increase the journey time from one larger point to the other.  That is a disincentive in the first instance.  Is there perhaps a greater level of services that can be put in, different days perhaps or whatever, in order to try to get that journey time down and give a better experience?  Quite frankly, people in rural areas are not going to spend two and a half hours to travel what they could drive in 40 minutes and that is an issue.</p> <p>  We must also be careful in our long-term planning of public transport and the transport networks, that we do not disenfranchise to too great an extent people who have already chosen, or are already living in, dispersed rural communities.  They too will need improvements in infrastructure.  There are certain significant pinch points like bridges and river crossings that will need investment.  It cannot all be about providing a public transport solution to their travel needs.</p></speech>

What we are trying to do is ensure the journey times from people's towns and villages are around 30 minutes from their next largest metropolitan centre and then an hour and a half away from a regional centre.  That is the kind of timeframe in which we think it is reasonable for people to make a journey to there and back and that is what is going into Connecting Ireland.  That means changing the services to possibly being more regular services on key routes and then feeding in demand-responsive services, whether it is every day or a number of days per week.  That is the kind of design we are looking at at the moment.</p> <p>  We will certainly be engaged on the Kilrush to Ennis route and be looking at that as part of Connecting Ireland for County Clare.  We must realise that there will be a proportion of people living in very isolated rural areas who obviously will not get a bus to their door but we have to balance it.  If we can provide a demand-responsive service, particularly for those who have no access to transport, that should be part of the delivery of services.  It is not going to be that we will have a regular service to some parts of very rural Ireland but they should be close enough that they can get to a regular service that will bring them to their local centre with reasonable regularity during the week.</p></speech>

Given Dr. Torney's point about the embedded prejudice around change in public bodies, which is very valid, how can the Minister effectively deliver the climate budget, for example, whatever is given to the transport sector?  The Minister is the head of the pile but how does one get it done?  Dr. Torney seems to be suggesting collaborative processes that would start in every village.  It does not sound very swift.</p> <p>  In my experience with the national broadband plan, there is tremendous resistance within the system to any grand project, even though I believe the plan is a no-brainer but maybe that is prejudice.  How do we move from the very tight cost-effectiveness model that is being used in public service project evaluation to something that would take a longer-term perspective where things become possible?  It does not seem to be embedded in the current system.</p> <p>  From where does Dr. Caulfield believe the relative contributions for 2030, the first two climate budgets, from the transport sector can come?  How much, respectively, will be delivered by new public transport infrastructure, switching to shared ownership of vehicles, e-bikes and electrification of our fleet?  Perhaps Dr. Caulfield will write to the committee to explain how he came up with the figure of &euro;10 billion for electric vehicles.  Is he making an assumption about diesel pricing and including that?  The subsidy for electric vehicles of &euro;10,000 has gone and is falling.  That would be for an entire fleet of 2 million vehicles.  I do not know how Dr. Caulfield reached the figure of &euro;10 billion but I am quite happy to learn how he did.</p></speech>

I direct her to some research by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, conducted a couple of years ago, in the area of transport-oriented development.  This is the idea that rather than transport infrastructure following urban development, one does it the other way around by building the transport infrastructure first, with the urban development coming afterwards around the high-quality transport infrastructure.  That work by the NESC built upon a wider international body of research on transport-oriented development.  I encourage the committee to look at that work, which I believe was published in 2019.</p> <p>  Deputy Bruton is right that if we leave it all to a bottom-up process. it will almost certainly be too slow for the kind of transformational change that we need to deliver.  What I was trying to suggest in my opening statement and what we try to suggest in our research in this area is that we need a combination of a top-down and bottom-up process.  The fear I have with the very strong focus on the climate action Bill and the carbon budgets process is that we think that is the end of the story, the carbon budgets are self-enforcing and as soon as we have a system-wide constraint, it will deliver the change.  That is not the case.  We need to think through, sector by sector, what governance arrangements we need to deliver the transformational change that will add up to the targets to be set out in the carbon budgets.  We need an element of bottom-up approaches but we need to infuse those bottom-up initiatives with the scale of ambition set out in the carbon budgets.  It is a question of trying to marry the top-down and bottom-up processes.</p> <p>  On the question around resistance within the system, I agree with Deputy Bruton that we have a legacy of a culture of decision-making that is not very well-equipped for the scale of transformational change.  I do not have a magic bullet to overcome that.  We need strong political leadership but we also need strong leadership within the Civil Service.  We are seeing elements of this emerge but we do not have the luxury of time.  We cannot wait for the next generation of civil servants coming through the system.  We need to find ways to reinvigorate the policy system to deliver this transformational change.</p></speech>

The first was on what percentages the different modes of transport can bring.  It is going to be incremental.  Public transport will bring the majority of the share.  Walking and cycling will have a certain amount also.  It is probably 2% from each of these different modes of transport combined.  To get to the 2030 target of 51%, there will be a large reliance on electric vehicles, if that is achievable by 2030.</p> <p>  On the figure of &euro;10 billion, many of the figures came from a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform report arising from a cost-benefit analysis it did on the policies around electric vehicles.  It found a cost-benefit ratio of 0.144 to pursue the benefits of electric vehicles.  That type of ratio would never get anything funded.  I will be happy to send the figures to the Deputy.  Another point about the electric vehicle is that it is still a car and it still leaves us with a transport problem.  In 2019, Dubliners spent nine extra days of their lives stuck in congestion.  That also needs to be rolled into the whole cost of electric vehicles.</p></speech>

With regard to the scale of the transformational change that is needed, perhaps Dr. Torney will say a word on controversy around planning and the planning system and if he has any comments on the types of approaches.  I note he referred to different deliberative forums for engaging the population on the type of change that is needed on transportation.  Is there a model that might best suit that?</p> <p>  Ms Graham has experience with major transport reform through BusConnects and in other areas.  I ask her to comment on that experience and whether she sees an opportunity to improve the planning process to deliver on the type of reforms that are needed.  Perhaps she could also comment on the National Transport Authority's capacity.  In fairness, there is huge ambition on the part of the Government.  What is the nature of the change for the NTA and how does the future look for the NTA in the context of the organisation and its capacity?</p> <p>  Will Dr. Caulfield address the issue of travel to school and the modal shift?  What are his ideas and suggestions on opportunities to get people to move away from car transport to schools?  Many of the journeys to school by car are comparatively short distances.  Does this offer an opportunity to deliver a modal shift in a significant way?  Does Dr. Caulfield have ideas or recommendations on that?</p></speech>

He raised a really good point.  In undertaking the scale of transformational change that needs to be delivered there is a real challenge and risk of turning local populations against decisions and further against the political system and the Government.  We are living in an era where there is declining trust in public institutions, governments, the media and experts not just in Ireland, but across the world.  We need to be very careful in how we undertake this transformation and make sure that people feel like they have a stake in the decisions because a significant amount of research points to the importance of the procedure of justice.  People are much more likely to accept decisions that disfavour them if they think that the process through which those decisions were taken is fair.</p> <p>  The Deputy referenced deliberative democracy.  Something like a citizens' assembly is probably too big and costly for individual planning decisions but the principle underpinning the citizens' assembly, which gives ordinary members of the public access to relevant information and time to deliberate on it, is a model of decision-making and involving the public that we could usefully consider in other contexts as well.</p></speech>

What we have been involved in is much of the pre-planning work in terms of BusConnects and TII with MetroLink and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann with DART+.  I suppose it follows on from Dr. Torney's points on getting buy-in from the public in terms of planning.  We have put a lot of time and effort into the public consultation around these major transformational programmes, particularly BusConnects.  A really significant amount of effort has gone into that engagement, which we hope will result in a very effective formal planning process.  While it does take time to do that, we think it is of great value and benefit to any transformational programme and it has been highly significant in respect of the BusConnects Dublin project.  We will be applying the same approach in respect of any major infrastructural project in other cities.</p></speech>

We are very thankful that the Government has recognised that we required and require additional resources in order to be able to deliver on the ambitious programme of works that we have.  We have been successful in getting additional posts both last year and this year and we continue to look towards other agencies to assist us in delivery of projects such that we are not just reliant on ourselves as a delivery agency, but also on local authorities.  As was referenced earlier, the Government has approved significant resources for local authorities to deliver on the very ambitious programme for walking, cycling and active travel.  In the context of the response of the Government to the request for additional resources, we have been very successful in getting that approval.</p></speech>

There are a couple of things we can do to improve the situation in respect of travel to school.  In one way, it is where habits start to be made.  For students who use less active modes of travel and do not walk or cycle, that may progress throughout their life.  There is a significant amount of research that looks at the generational consequences of that.  As for the funding that has been earmarked for the active travel side, while it is very important to deliver infrastructure on that, it also needs to deliver social change and these kind of ground-up approaches.  We have seen during lockdown, after lockdown and even before lockdown with the Green-Schools initiative that there are several really good concrete examples from across the country that could be scaled up, such as cycle buses and low-emission zones or no-idling zones around schools.  That is something that could reduce emissions, especially given that these short trips involve cold starts, which mean the engine is burning far more carbon.</p></speech>

My questions are primarily for Ms Graham.  Mr. Creegan mentioned that the national cycle manual was being updated.  When will that be completed?  There is significant funding going into infrastructure and cycleways at the moment and there is a fear that it is being used to create cycleways based on a document that is ten years old.  There are concerns about the designs in that document not being particularly safe for children or new cyclists.  In the context of speaking about a social change, that is really where we need to be focusing.  When will that manual be completed?</p> <p>   Specifically on the issue of plans and the upgrading and expansion of the NTA's existing capacity, has the NTA modelled the expected level of emissions reduction?  Assuming all its plans are in place according to the planned timeframe, what is the modelled reduction in emissions that is expected?  When is it expected to see those reductions coming in?  In the context in particular of the work the NTA is doing, there are long lead-in times to purchase buses or trains, for example, and if we are looking at a target of 2030 that must be borne in mind.  What percentage reduction has been modelled and when is it expected that it will be achieved?  </p> <p>  The fact that &euro;10 billion could be required is particularly interesting.  That amount of money going into subsidising one particular aspect of the jigsaw that we need would certainly focus the mind.  This is a question for all of the witnesses.  If it was within their remit to decide where that &euro;10 billion would be best placed, where would they like to see it spent in order to meet our transport emission reductions?</p></speech>

It is more about improving safety than making unsafe provision safe.</p> <p>  On the issue of the modelling of emissions, the only work on the modelling of emissions that is complete is work that was done on the transport strategy back in 2016.  That showed that with the expenditure at that stage, at the introduction of all the infrastructure and without changing any of the fleet, particularly the bus fleet or car fleet, there would be a reduction in emissions of approximately 3%.  The work that is currently ongoing is updating the transport strategy.  Obviously, we have to take into account whatever decisions the Government makes regarding targets for carbon emissions.  That will certainly be something that has to be considered as a key part of the transport strategy.  There is work ongoing at the moment to do further modelling to ascertain the impact of changes to the transport fleet and car fleet.</p><p>The work is under way and we do not have any results to share with the committee today.  I do not know whether Mr. Creegan wants to add anything on that.</p></speech>

It is different now for the review of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  It will have to be taken into account because it will be Government policy as part of the review of the transport strategy we are drafting and which will be out for consultation later on this year.</p> <p>  We are setting out to reduce our transport fleet's emissions in parallel with that.  We have already purchased a hybrid fleet.  They are considered clean vehicles which will contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions.  We have an ambition to go to a zero fleet in our urban centres as quickly as possible but we are beginning the procurement of that fleet to be introduced in our urban services.</p></speech>

There are long delays and lead in times.  I find it unusual we are not taking that into account.</p></speech>

It is not that we are not doing that work; it is just that I cannot give the Deputy that information now.  We will have it very soon.  The transport strategy drafted and approved in 2016 had an investment in infrastructure such as DART, MetroLink and Luas and the modelling of that showed even with that investment, there would only be a 3% reduction in carbon emissions taking into account the growth in travel demand.</p> <p>  The challenge is quite large in terms of what we can achieve in reducing transport emissions.  Modelling was not carried out on what carbon emissions would be given by changing the bus fleet, or public transport fleet, to being low or no carbon emissions and what would happen with the number of electronic vehicles being introduced in the car fleet.  It all needs to be modelled and we do not have that work done at present.</p></speech>

If our ambition is to reduce transport emissions by more than 50%, and it more than likely has to be more than 50% in transport emissions, the modelling surely has to be aligned with that challenge.  We will need to see some progress on that very soon because the challenge in transport is phenomenal.  If our model is not right, we are off to a bad start.  We will not get there.</p> <p>  Ms Graham said the national cycling manual was safe.  Many people would take issue with her on that.  If we are designing infrastructure for everybody, from a four- or five-year-old child to elderly people and people with disabilities, the existing national cycling manual and its contents are not safe.</p> <p>  Ms Graham or perhaps Dr. Torney or Dr. Caulfield might briefly answer the question on the &euro;10 billion.  Where would they spend it if not on electric vehicles?</p></speech>

There is nothing wrong with the model and a significant amount of work has gone into developing it.  The modelling is taking place.  The work is under way at present but it is a significant piece of work and takes time to deliver.  We do not have the information available for the Chair at present but we can make it available to him when the work is complete.</p> <p>  It will inform the type of questions being asked.  If one has &euro;10 billion, where does one put it to achieve the greatest reduction in carbon emissions?  I want to see as much public transport infrastructure developed as possible.  It is our remit.  Of course, I would say the &euro;10 billion should go into public transport infrastructure but there has to be a consideration of where to get the best reduction in terms of carbon emissions for the investment.  The modelling work we are doing will help to answer those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.636" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Diarmuid Torney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021030900002#K00800"><p>I agree with what Ms Graham has said.  We need another an analytical basis for making that decision.  On the face of it, &euro;10 billion in subsidies for electric vehicles does not seem a prudent investment but it is not a once-off, irreversible decision in the way an investment in a large public transport infrastructure project is.  If I understand Dr. Caulfield's analysis correctly, we could end up spending &euro;10 billion on subsidies over the course of the decade.  However, we can change course at any point in that decade unlike if we decided to build a metro system or something like that, in that we could not change course and we would need to follow through once it is started.</p> <p>  The problem Dr. Caulfield is pointing to is not as severe as the headline figure suggests because we can revisit the level of subsidies at any point during the decade if cost projections do not turn out as expected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.637" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brian Caulfield" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021030900002#K00900"><p>It is a great question and I agree with my two co-witnesses.  Public transport is where we should be putting the lion's share of our money.  Certain public transport projects in the greater Dublin area have made sense for more than 20 years and have been at various stages of planning over that period.  Much of it would go there.</p> <p>  We need to consider how we use public transport in regional cities.  We can consider many good examples from around the world.  We just need to go up the road to look at the glider system in Belfast.  A trial of that type of bus in Cork, Limerick or in any of the cities would go down well and would change how people perceived bus transport in regional cities.</p> <p>  I would then spend money on electric cars.  Recent research, which I conducted in Trinity, considered areas of the country in forced car ownership.  People in those areas are travelling long distances in more polluting vehicles.  The subsidies given to somebody living near high quality public transport should be different from somebody living in rural Ireland.  I would put money into that as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.638" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021030900002#K01000"><p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  Dr. Caulfield made an interesting point about considering different subsidies depending on where a person is.  The call for more roads and bigger roads has been from rural areas and the problems they have been having.  While I take Ms Graham's point that the emphasis is on urban areas, and I am in one of those areas in Galway, the focus on roads is coming from commuter belt and satellite towns experiencing problems.</p> <p>  I ask Ms Graham what is being done there.  People stand in the rain in Spiddal with no bus shelter or real-time information and an infrequent service.</p><p>That then adds not just to the congestion in the area, but to the mindset that we need more roads.  It is, therefore, critical to address that point.</p><p> Dr. Caulfield talked about the two choices facing us, namely, a modal shift and changing fuel.  He did not really speak about the planning implications in that context.  Even if we were to change fuel and rely on that approach, the resulting planning implications will mean that people will have to move farther and farther away from public transport.  I see that as meaning that we must do more on the modal shift element.  Is the NTA also considering and planning for the use of combined modes, such as the multimodal bike-rail-bike approach used in the Netherlands?  How can that approach be used in an Irish context for urban, suburban and rural areas?  It would again address some of the concerns people have about living so far away from a hub of the public transport system.</p><p> My next question is for Dr. Torney.  One of the problems with the roll-out is the local authority aspect, as I see it, which he mentions in his research.  There are specific governance issues which he suggests could address some of the lead-in times, while also ensuring that, importantly, people have their voices heard in the roll-out of initiatives such as BusConnects, for instance.  Moving cars and parking from the roads, for example, is also a decision which is in the hands of local authorities.  The larger roll-out of the infrastructure, however, is in the hands of the NTA, which has more influence in that context.  How would Dr. Torney see those kinds of problems being addressed together?</p></speech>

I think most of those questions are for Ms Graham.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.641" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021030900002#L00300"><p>Regarding looking at public transport services, I want to be clear that we are not just focusing on metropolitan areas.  We are looking at service provision on a national basis, and that approach includes our cities and also our towns which do not now have a public transport system, such as Carlow, Letterkenny and Portlaoise.  Those towns do not have bus services and we have ambitions to provide those services.  We are also looking at the delivery of bus services in rural areas and that is what Connecting Ireland is about.  The initiative is concerned with ensuring there is an appropriate level of service which allows people to make journeys at different times during the day and to access their local and regional centres, including from places like Spiddal.  We are undertaking that assessment and we will be engaging publicly in regard to those proposals later this year.  Our ambition is to ensure that we have greater coverage of bus services especially to serve our rural and urban populations.</p> <p>  A multimodal approach and ensuring good connections from bike to rail and from bike to bus is part of that ambition.  We must ensure we have an integrated system, including providing bike parking at rail and bus hubs.  We will be up for ensuring that investment is put into such improvements, in addition to providing investment for the type of infrastructure  Senator Pauline O'Reilly spoke about in regard to real-time information and the provision of bus shelters.  We know there is an under-provision of such elements across rural Ireland.</p> <p>  Another point made by the Senator concerned the local authorities and the roll-out.  It is important we understand that local authorities are the roads authorities.  In respect of the provision of bus infrastructure and improved cycling infrastructure, it is the local authorities which will be delivering those projects across the country.  We have taken on a role with BusConnects in the Dublin region because we are in a statutory position to do so.  We have those powers in Dublin, but we do not have those powers outside of the greater Dublin area.  That is the reason we are in a position to take on more of the planning role and to lead the planning aspect for BusConnects in Dublin.  We do work closely with our local authority partners to deliver the same level of service across the regional cities and our towns and villages.</p></speech>

On the last question, does Dr. Torney have anything to say regarding the role of the local authorities and governance?</p></speech>

When I talk about local authorities, I am as much as anything talking about public representation as well as the executive and how those aspects work together.  I state that because some of these decisions are made by the councillors who are representing people.  I am referring to how we can make this process flow more easily to ensure we can get things over the line but that people also have their voices heard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.645" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Diarmuid Torney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021030900002#L00700"><p>I thank Senator Pauline O'Reilly for her question.  A few issues are involved when we think about local government and local authorities in an Irish context.  As I think was hinted at, one of the strengths of local government is its connection to the local population.  Local councillors, and local authorities more generally, are in some ways closer to local populations than the national Government.  Structures like the public participation networks, PPNs, provide pathways for tapping into local community groups etc.  It is welcome, as far as I understand it, that one of the strands of the forthcoming consultation on the revision of the climate action plan is tapping into that network of PPNs.  Using such an approach in the context of climate action is to be welcomed.  Those are the elements on the strengths side of the ledger.</p> <p>  Moving to examine the weaknesses in this context, by international standards we have very weak local government.  I refer to the powers and competencies of our local government bodies, their funding and especially their ability to raise their own revenue.  Local government in Ireland is weak by international standards and that is a challenge in this respect.  I do not think there is a one-size-fits-all solution, but in my opening remarks I spoke about the idea of particular institutional forums to solve policy blockages.  It could be that in a particular context it would be possible to bring together the staff of the local authority, the national agencies and central Government to figure out and try to align the different aspects of the decision-making process.  I do not, however, think that there is a one-size-fits-all model that would do that.</p></speech>

Many of the questions I was going to ask have been well covered at this stage, but I do have one query for Dr. Caulfield.  I understand he co-authored a report in 2019 in regard to something called the DiSTRaCT project.  I think it might be very helpful to the committee if Dr. Caulfield could provide us with a copy.  I just read the abstract and the contents appear to be applicable, so I wonder if the report would be something which could be useful to the committee in its deliberations.</p> <p>  I also welcome the statement in regard to EVs and the replacement of cars now on the roads as not being a solution to curbing the nine extra days it was mentioned that Dubliners spend in traffic.  The solution instead is pumping billions of euro into public transport.  I am interested in the paper Dr. Caulfield co-authored in the context of looking at strategies such as carpooling, among other things, and how that might work in the Irish context.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Graham for her contribution.  My question in regard to the modelling referenced earlier was already covered by Deputy Whitmore.</p><p>Is our public transport fleet capable of reducing its carbon emissions by 51% in nine years?  That is critical to the overall discussion.  I appreciate Ms Graham's responses thus far.  I have another question that is not related solely to the fleet.  Are capital projects sufficiently carbon-proofed to provide the reductions we require, notwithstanding the NTA's lack of modelling at this point in time?</p><p> To be very parochial, Dr. Caulfield mentioned the metro as a 20-year project, one that has been in train for 20 years.  In fact, it is 47 years since it was first proposed by Forf&aacute;s in 1974 as a rail link to Dublin Airport.  Ms Graham mentioned it will be important to all Dubliners not only those living on the northside.  The development of that project has taken many years in many different forums, including a more recent one.  I will be very interested to know if it will be big enough to cater for the growth we can expect, particularly with changes in land use.  That might be a difficult question.  However, if we are to build up rather than out, will the metro be large enough at 20,000 persons per direction per hour to serve the corridor proposed and potentially other lines?</p></speech>

That work was funded by the SEAI and the Department of Transport.  We looked at a number of low cost options to reduce emissions.  Several of them were examined.  The first iteration of it happened just before the pandemic.  Working from home and home-shopping were two elements we examined.  We also looked at providing electric vehicle charging points at workplaces.  We considered the issue of tyre pressure in terms of there being a national policy or campaign for motorists to check their tyre pressure to determine how that could reduce emissions.  Working from home and electric vehicle charging points at work turned out to provide the biggest bang for one's buck in terms of a low cost investment.  The final report is with the SEAI and I am very happy to share it with the Deputy.  I stand corrected on metro north.</p></speech>

I would break that down a little.  The Luas is already electric, so that is fine.  The answer in respect of our heavy rail is "Yes"; we are expanding our electrification in Dublin, as the Deputy will be aware.  The Cork commuter service will be electrified and has the potential to go further than that, including the use of battery technology, which was mentioned earlier.  On the rail side, we are equally comfortable that can be achieved.  We will be able to transition the urban bus system to meet those targets over the coming years.  The technology for double that fleet is there or thereabouts to do a large proportion of our routes but not all of them.  The challenge is the long distance regional routes connecting our cities and our towns.  The technology is not available to run it electric at present.  We are trialling some hydrogen vehicles, as was mentioned, so there is a question mark over that.  That is challenging and the answer to that in not yet fully clear.</p> <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s question as to whether our capital projects are sufficiently carbon-proofed, the answer to that in our area is "Yes".  We are building sustainable transport projects, either public transport or active travel projects.  All of them are focused on moving people on to more sustainable modes.  They are carbon-proofed.  </p> <p>  In terms of MetroLink and its sizing, we can only build a tunnel like MetroLink once.  A great deal of effort has gone into trying to predict the land usages and the travel patterns into the future along the corridor.  We and TII, which is intimately involved in it, are satisfied we have sized it appropriately and that it can cater for development in the longer term.  Much work has gone into that.  Time will tell if we are right or not but a great deal of work has gone into trying to size it properly.</p></speech>

Like Deputy Farrell, many of the questions I had have been answered at this stage, but I might expand on them.  There has been much talk about moving away from a cost-benefit analysis and striking a balance right between what the cost, social benefit and emissions will be.  Is a set of criteria or best practice used for those transport projects, or is that already being used by the NTA?  Have we established a set of criteria that helps us to come to those decisions?  For example, building on the figure of &euro;10 billion, what would we do with it and how would we make those decisions?</p> <p>  With respect to getting people out of their cars, BusConnects has done a great deal of work in Dublin on that.  It is not only about connecting bus routes, it involves multimodal connections and getting people to different modes.  Is any work being done on the gendered aspect of shifting people out of cars, particularly on trip chaining, given that women tend to take on more care-giving roles and have to make short trips to school and to care for relatives?  Is the NTA examining that gendered perspective?</p> <p>  On the issue of councillors and their closeness to the public, that is a double-edged sword.  Without a head person driving the strategy, we can have a push and pull in two different areas of the city with one councillor saying his or her constituents do not want it and another saying his or her constituents want it, and we see that repeatedly.  Given we are talking of having directly elected majors, that could be one of the powers that would fall into that role.  It would be a role for a person who has a strategic vision for an urban centre who could bring stakeholders around the table to co-ordinate those decisions.  We have seen the difficulty involved with the pedestrianisation of the College Green area in Dublin due to different stakeholders pulling in different directions.</p></speech>

We are probably coming off under-investment in public transport for a couple of decades.  We need all the projects to go ahead and proceed.  We have a very well developed methodology that assesses projects under a number of different headings, including the environment, climate change and the benefit-cost ratio.  While the benefit-cost ratio is important, it is not the bee all and end all.  It is worth mentioning also that all our projects assess carbon reductions as part of them and our modelling work for each of those projects brings that to bear on them.  The tools to choose between projects are pretty well established.  There is a particular set of and key headings used across the transport spectrum, which have been set by the Department of Transport and have been in place for a number of years.  We use those to assist with the choices between projects.  After that, the policy around them sometimes gets built into the various national development plans and that in a way sets the prioritisation also but the two things come together to determine the running order of the projects.</p></speech>

Rather than it being about infrastructure, it is more about how we choose to provide new services where there are no services currently.  We are trying to develop a methodology to give us some means of prioritising the service provision side.  That work is under way currently but it will very much have a social aspect in terms of assessment and not only a cost aspect and the number of passengers that may be derived from that service.</p><p>We are very much focused in particular on those areas that would require access to public transport to improve their economic activity as being a core part of the delivery of public transport services, especially when State money is subsidising those services.  That would be a core part of that analysis.  It is really updating the methodology we have, which is a social-benefit methodology that we used more in the bad times when we were looking at reducing services.  We hope we will not be in that position again.  We now want to use it in terms of a growth scenario where we want to grow services across the country.  We will use a similar type of methodology to prioritise service delivery.</p><p> In terms of the gender aspect of service planning, it is something that is included, in particular in bus services planning where a key part of BusConnects was ensuring that people get to more places more easily.  Even though there was a bit of a negative response to this, part of that was about integrating the bus services so that one could ensure that one could make those shorter trips a lot easier by introducing more orbital routes so that one could get to more places quicker.  That certainly benefits those shorter trips that women tend to make in their care-giving role.  The gender aspect is very much included as part of the service delivery.  In earlier years in transport planning one focused primarily on the work commute as the driver of in-service planning, but now we look much more across the whole day and at how services are used not just for access to work and education but also for social activity as well because a higher percentage of trips are made for retail and social activity than for access to education and work.</p></speech>

Does Dr. Caulfield wish to address the question on cost-benefit analysis?  I saw his hand go up.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Boylan for some very interesting questions.  I have worked with the NTA model and cost-benefit analysis is something I teach in Trinity.  I can say that the modelling approach that is undertaken by the NTA is world class.  It is what other cities do.</p> <p>  Mr. Creegan rightly said that the benefit-cost ratio is not the be-all and end-all, and that we do need to look at social aspects.  There was some really nice work done on the Limerick strategy where the NTA looked at the number of new public transport services that were going into deprived areas.  When something like that is integrated into this type of analysis it is very effective.</p> <p>  I teach cost-benefit analysis to students in Trinity and one of the things that we did recently was we looked at the cost of carbon as part of a road investment project.  One has to tweak the cost of carbon very high before it makes any difference to the benefit-cost ratio, so that is something that does need to be looked at in terms of transport appraisal.  I suspect the last question on directly elected mayors was for Dr. Torney, but my answer to that is "Yes" if the mayor has power and a budget.</p></speech>

It is important not just that a mayor would be directly elected, but that he or she is given appropriate powers and resources.  Otherwise, we just repeat some of the existing difficulties with local councillors, which is that they are elected, but they do not have the powers to deliver the things that their constituents want.  I am strongly in favour of directly elected mayors at least for the cities, provided that they are granted sufficient authority and resources.</p></speech>

If I could pick up on some of Dr. Caulfield's opening remarks, he referred to equity and just transition.  I heard his responses to some of the questions on electric vehicles and also on car sharing.  Where is the best balance between the two?  The just transition is required but we want people to look at and explore alternative modes of transport, including the targets that we have set for electric vehicles?  Where does he think the best spot is in terms of delivering on our targets?</p></speech>

One of the striking statistics I often use with my students on sharing vehicles is that cars spend 95% of their time parked, so it is an extremely wasteful asset.  On how we would use it for a just transition and shared mobility, I do see that there is a space there whereby cars could be used almost as a public good in the same way as public transport, and that there would be networks of people that could use the vehicles.  On the road I live on, one could ask if the eight cars that are parked there are required all the time - perhaps they are not.  When one looks at just transitioning and the budgets that people will have to pay to transfer to a low-carbon economy, sharing these types of assets will become much more prevalent in the future.  I think it will definitely be a way of reducing the burden on households.</p></speech>

If I may, I will ask a few questions on BusConnects and other issues.  Ms Graham mentioned that there was a review of the transport strategy from 2016.  When is that likely to be concluded?  Will it be this year?</p></speech>

Does that change the model in any way given that people are working from home and changing their patterns?</p></speech>

One version is what we call business as usual, where what we expected to happen in 2019 continues, and then at the other end of the spectrum we have developed a scenario whereby something like 25% of certain categories of worker, work from home; there is a certain movement away from on-street retail to off-street and online; tertiary education is delivered through a hybrid mode and there is less on-campus use, and so on through the various participants that make up the transport arena.  For all of our large projects we are testing our proposals under the two ends of the spectrum and we suspect we will probably end up someplace in the middle.  Each project is being tested that way.</p></speech>

It was always going to be an output of whatever we developed.  The final output will depend on the final scheme design we are currently grappling with.  It is a tiny bit too early for us to be definitive and say this is what it is or this is what it changed by.</p></speech>

One factor affecting the timeline is that there are a large number of corridors, as most people are aware.  All of them will be ready to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the coming months.  Later on this year they will all be ready for submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  After that, the timeline is dictated by what happens then and how quickly the approval process completes at that stage.</p></speech>

In the meantime we are going to deliver the new BusConnects network commencing this year.  We had hoped we would have started phase 1 around now.  Obviously, with the pandemic we have pushed that out until we are in a position to be able to communicate properly with customers about those changes.  That is likely to push it out.  The earliest really would be May but we hope to achieve two phases of delivery of the BusConnects network for Dublin this year.</p></speech>

I have a quick question for Mr. Creegan on the modelling and how the NTA factors health into appraising projects.  Is there a parameter or a formula for assessing the impact of projects on the health of town and village centres and so on?  I am seeking a comment from the NTA on another matter following from Dr. Caulfield's point about factoring in carbon pricing to projects.  To what extent does the National Transport Authority do that in its work?</p></speech>

The pricing used is set by the Department of Transport as a parameter for everyone in the transport arena and obviously we use that.  I concur with Dr. Caulfield's view that on certain projects it takes a large adjustment in the number for it to make a perceptible change.  I wish to repeat that the pricing used is the standard costing provided to us and is used across the public sector.</p> <p>  There is a methodology available to us for the health benefits which we use in particular for active travel projects to ascertain the benefits we get from them.  I declare I am not familiar enough to explain it eloquently in a couple of sentences, but it is a methodology we have imported from elsewhere.  It has been used elsewhere and is applied in the modelling work we do.</p></speech>

We will now allow the witnesses to join the meeting.</p><p>The committee will be engaging with the representatives from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, to discuss the current economic and fiscal situation and the key issues that the medium-term fiscal strategy could consider and address.  I welcome Dr. Kieran McQuinn, research professor, and Dr. Karina Doorley, senior research officer.</p><p>Before we begin, I wish to explain to the witnesses some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference they may make to other persons in their evidence.  Pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, the evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable.  I remind Members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the places in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a Member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any Member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p><p>I ask Dr. McQuinn to give his opening statement.</p></speech>

We are grateful for the opportunity to provide our views on the present economic and fiscal situation and to discuss some key issues and risks which the medium-term fiscal strategy should consider.</p> <p>  Starting with the current economic and fiscal position, the sharp rise in Covid-19 infections through the latter half of quarter 4 of 2020 prompted the Irish authorities to reimpose a series of level 5 restrictions from 30 December 2020 to 5 April 2021, which is the earliest date on which they may cease.  Compared with the measures introduced in September 2020, these measures were quite restrictive with all schools closed and construction, for example, included in the general shutdown.</p> <p>  The significant nature of the restrictions, along with the relatively long length of their duration, will have an adverse impact on the economic recovery, and that had been apparent throughout the latter part of 2020.  The most obvious manifestation of this adverse impact is in the labour market where the unemployment rate, which had declined to less than 17% in quarter 3 of 2020, is now likely to average over 27% in quarter 1 of 2021.  Previous ESRI research has shown that the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, have done much to cushion the incomes of those who have suffered pandemic-related job losses.</p> <p>  Young adults and those working in the hospitality and arts sectors would have experienced particularly steep income losses in the absence of these supports.  We have quoted some of our own research in our written submission as evidence in this regard.  Research has also shown that while the PUP and EWSS represent a significant cost to the Exchequer, much of this cost could have been incurred anyway in the absence of these supports due to automatic stabilisers such as jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's assistance.</p> <p>  The first table in our written submission depicts the monthly costs to the Exchequer of pandemic-related unemployment and of the accompanying supports in income tax forgone and extra welfare payments, including the PUP and the EWSS.  The monthly net Exchequer cost of the pandemic unemployment shock is estimated to be &euro;144 million in the absence of the PUP or the EWSS.  With the PUP and the EWSS in place, the monthly Exchequer cost is higher at &euro;193 million per 100,000 people newly unemployed.</p> <p>  It is notable, however, that much of the estimated Exchequer loss would have been experienced in the absence of these policies.  This is because in the absence of the PUP and EWSS, the existing tax-benefit system would have helped stabilise incomes, through increased jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or assistance payments, for example.  The EWSS, by facilitating job retention, also results in higher income tax if employers who receive the subsidy pay employees their pre-pandemic wage.</p> <p>  In our winter 2020 commentary, released in December, we had envisaged a further series of restrictions in 2021 in response to the easing of the measures prior to Christmas 2020.  However, these restrictions were not assumed to take place until quarter 2 of 2021.  They were also not assumed to be as restrictive as a level 5 lockdown.  Consequently, we are now revising downwards our growth expectations for the Irish economy in 2021.  We still believe the economy will register positive growth of approximately 4% this year.  The expected path for unemployment in 2021 is also revised upward, albeit marginally.  We now expect the unemployment rate to peak in quarter 1 of 2021, before falling consistently thereafter.  The rate is forecast to be just above 10% by the end of the year.  All this assumes vaccines will be rolled out successfully to most of the general population through the latter half of 2021.</p> <p>  The nature of the level 5 restrictions introduced in early 2021 means the fiscal accounts are likely to be in a more adverse state this year than previously thought.  This is because more people are likely to be unemployed for longer than originally forecast.  Consequently, we now believe a deficit of 4.8% or &euro;18.9 billion is likely this year.  That will result in the debt-to-GDP ratio increasing from 58.8% in 2019 to over 62% by the end of 2021.  This comes on top of a sizeable deficit in 2020 of &euro;23 billion or 6.2% of GDP.  Previously, the State had run slight surpluses in 2018 and 2019 of 0.1% and 0.4% respectively. </p> <p>  In general, it is worth noting that the Irish economy performed much better than expected in 2020.  Like most commentators, we had believed at the outset of the pandemic that the economy would contract significantly in 2020.  However, it is now likely, and this was confirmed by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, last week, that the economy grew by approximately 3.5% last year.  While a large part of that growth was due to the performance of a select number of multinational intensive sectors, it does underscore the point the Irish economy is better placed than most to emerge from the pandemic.</p> <p>  Turning now to the medium-term fiscal strategy, the state of the Government finances over the medium term will be significantly affected by developments in the labour market and how quickly the unemployment rate declines as the economy opens up.  Our current forecast for 2022 indicates the unemployment rate is likely to average approximately 8% for the year.  To put this in perspective, when the economy last had an unemployment rate of 8% in 2016, there was a general Government balance of almost 2%.</p><p> This increase in the debt levels associated with the pandemic has inevitably given rise to questions as to whether a contractionary fiscal policy will be required to pay for the additional costs to the Exchequer of Covid-19.  While it is still too early to answer these conclusively, some recent analysis conducted in our winter commentary is informative, in that it assesses the likely implications of different recovery paths for the domestic economy on the sustainability of Irish sovereign debt levels.  Drawing off work done by our colleagues, Dr. Adele Bergin and Dr. Abian Garcia Rodriguez, the analysis shows that if the future average interest rate on Irish debt remains constant over the next ten years, then apart from a delayed recovery scenario, the future higher debt levels will be sustainable.  However, were the average interest rate to increase, then the debt dynamics would not be as reassuring.  The analysis assumes that the State does not run a negative primary balance from 2022 onwards.</p><p> Most of the immediate fiscal pressures from the pandemic are tied in with the support payments provided by the Government.  In that regard, there is much discussion over how long to continue Covid-related policies such as the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.</p><p> Should sufficient employment prospects exist, withdrawing the PUP could improve financial incentives for those seeking work to take up employment.  So, too, would allowing existing recipients to maintain their payments for a period while taking up paid employment.  This could encourage those in non-viable industries to seek employment in other sectors for which they may need additional training.  However, if the labour market has not largely recovered, then the withdrawal of the PUP would disproportionately affect low-income, young, single workers.  One option available to policymakers is a more gradual tapering of the PUP, which could help the groups most at risk of long-term unemployment after the pandemic to maintain a certain standard of living while searching for work.  Existing welfare payments could also be reformed to better target this at-risk group.  Much will depend on the post-Covid recovery and the availability of employment for different age cohorts and in different sectors.</p><p> Similarly, determining the optimal time to close or withdraw the EWSS will be challenging.  In the long run, continuing the subsidy would mean supporting both employment that would exist even if the subsidy was no longer in place, which would be a deadweight cost, and employment that was no longer viable in the long term and where employees should be given the opportunity to retrain in other roles.  However, withdrawing it too early may lead to some firms failing that would otherwise be viable.  While close monitoring of the speed and scale of the recovery by sector might help inform this difficult decision, there is also a case for examining the design of the subsidy for any sector for which it continues.  At present, the sharp cut-off in eligibility imposed by the requirement to be experiencing a 30% reduction in turnover means that some firms might face an incentive to suppress output, therefore inhibiting their recovery.</p><p> More generally, there is set to be considerable debate at European level about the future conduct of fiscal policy over the coming months and years.  The European Commission is set to review the European fiscal framework following the forthcoming German elections.  Recent comments by Dr. Isabel Schnabel, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, ECB, are interesting in that regard.  She calls for unconventional fiscal policies that support the efforts of the ECB when inflation is below its aim.  She points out that, in a European context, increased public investment, for example, has been found to crowd in as opposed to crowd out private investment.</p><p> The new European fiscal framework needs to be framed in such a manner that ensures a return to fiscal discipline among member states in the medium term but also enables governments to invest in key physical and social infrastructure over the same period.  Fiscal rules could be formulated that allow for member state governments to invest in capital expenditure in areas such as social and affordable housing and green technologies on an ongoing basis but also ensure that, post the pandemic, current expenditure is maintained at a sustainable level.</p><p> My colleague, Dr. Doorley, and I will be happy to take members' questions.</p></speech>

We could be here all evening.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. McQuinn for his presentation.  My salutations will be brief to save time, but that was interesting.  I will start at the end because I am excited about the points regarding the fiscal rules.  There was a suggestion in the presentation that, in the context of Ireland if the situation goes well, state aid could be reviewed.  Is that a misreading of the presentation?</p></speech>

Much of the discussion has been more general and relates to the need for greater capital investment to be permitted under them.  Under the existing rules, some form of investment is allowed; it is not that investment is prohibited.  The point has been made that, over the past eight or nine years and reflecting what many people would argue was the flawed policy response to the financial crisis, Europe has suffered from an absence of significant investment across many economies.  This has inhibited the growth performance of European economies during that period.  It is worth remembering that most European economies were averaging approximately 1.5% growth before the pandemic.</p> <p>  There is a recognition among policymakers.  It is interesting to note that, even in the ECB, which previously had a hawkish reputation as far as its stance on these matters was concerned, there is a growing debate about the need for any revision of the fiscal rules to be broader and more comprehensive and, in particular, to allow for greater investment to occur across European economies.  I do not believe that we have yet seen particular details emerging about the likes of state aid being addressed, but the discussion is progressive in terms of more investment being facilitated.</p></speech>

I am glad, given how the EU's response to the crash and, now, its response to the vaccine roll-out, have left us all underwhelmed.  The EU needs to do something symbolic and significant, given that we are all suffering and in this together.</p> <p>  I will ask some quick-fire questions.

For example, unemployment dipped below 5% last January or February just before the pandemic.  Our expectation is that it will be at least 2023 before we get back to that rate of unemployment.  Our forecast is that the unemployment rate will be approximately 10% at the end of this year, falling to approximately 6.5% by the end of 2022.  As such, re-emergence will happen in 2023 in terms of unemployment, but we see there being significant growth in the economy at the end of this year and throughout next year.</p></speech>

This is one of the major issues that we have been trying to consider in examining the performance of SME sectors.  Most concerns are about on the sectors that have been especially hit by the crisis, for example, hospitality, entertainment, retail, etc.  This is particularly the case for SMEs that had reasonable levels of debt going into the crisis.  The danger is that many of them could be overwhelmed by the levels of debt they have incurred over the past year and may incur in the coming months, if not well into the latter half of the year.  Those are the sectors where we would expect to see a significant increase in employment, given that they are almost entirely shut down, but there is a likelihood that there will be a scarring effect among some of them.  The danger, therefore, is that it will take quite some time for their employment levels to return to pre-pandemic levels.</p></speech>

They include sectors such as hospitality, food, entertainment, retail, tourism and so on.  They are the major sectors that have been shut and they will have SMEs potentially carrying levels of debt that may make it difficult for those firms to return to a normal level of economic activity any time soon.  Even after the initial shutdown, there was a strong bounceback in quarter 3 and into early quarter 4.  The danger for us, which is one of the factors we have been trying to assimilate in our forecast, is that the longer the economy and a significant number of sectors are in shutdown mode, the greater will be the risk of scarring effects and the slower the path back to the employment levels of pre-pandemic.</p> <p>  The sectors are easily identifiable.  They are simply those that have been most significantly shut.</p></speech>

My first question might feed in to those asked by other members, so I do not expect him to answer in full now.  One of the consequences we expected from Brexit was that the UK could become very competitive in respect of corporation tax, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, has indicated the opposite.  We talked about the large casualties, which I hope are temporary, arising from the economic impact, but clearly some companies and corporations have thrived during this period and will continue to do so, with profits growing exponentially.  Is there a moral imperative on those companies whereby the State could say, given that they have thrived during the period while everybody else suffered, there is a financial and economic role for them to play in this?</p> <p>  If there are to be scarring effects, what new commerce, businesses or industries does Dr. McQuinn foresee emerging from this period?  Does the ESRI have any information on that?</p></speech>

We all expected to see very adverse numbers, as far as economic performance was concerned, until we saw the trade figures and those for the export sector.  In particular, some of the multinational sectors such as the pharmaceutical sector enjoyed significant increases in export levels.  That caused our GDP figures to be positive for the year, which was quite remarkable when compared with other countries.</p> <p>  As for whether there is a moral imperative for those firms, it would be very difficult to implement such policies.  Our general concern in regard to taxation is that at the moment, the economy is still in a fragile state.  We expect it to emerge from that and to recover strongly, but it is still in a fragile state.  Even to try to impose higher taxes, similar to the UK for example, significant risks are associated with that.  It could slow down the recovery we are expecting.  I would be-----</p></speech>

Our economy would have registered substantial declines but for the fact that a relatively small number of those firms enjoyed a particularly strong performance.  Of course, some of that performance was due to the pandemic, given that they were producing products and services associated with the pandemic.  There are always instances where people can benefit in a commercial sense, even from a crisis such as Covid-19.  We have to be careful and ensure we do everything possible to support the recovery and that it is as broadly-based as possible.</p> <p>  On the question about new business ventures, it is difficult to say.  Anecdotally, one issue that has struck me and others is the ingenuity that can be seen in the form of businesses that have adapted to Covid-19, where possible.  We saw that even through the performance in the latter half of last year.  There was the initial lockdown, followed by a strong recovery, and then there was another series of lockdown measures but they did not seem to have quite the same impact.  While the measures of the second lockdown were not as significant, it seemed to suggest that many businesses were beginning to adjust their business models and to adapt in such a way that they could trade to a certain degree.  It has shown there is remarkable ingenuity among mainly Irish businesses in adapting to the crisis and to the challenges posed.  Hopefully, those businesses will be in a strong position when the economy fully reopens and will carry that forward.</p></speech>

We have consistently talked about the issue in our economic commentary and it is not just mortgage interest rates but also interest rates for SMEs.  The data clearly show that the average rates charged in the Irish market are typically higher than what prevails throughout Europe.  There are a number of reasons for that, one of which relates to the lack of competition in the Irish market.  The proposed exit of Ulster Bank from the market will, unfortunately, compound the difficulty of the relative lack of competition in the domestic market.  The banks would claim that the reason they charge higher rates than those in other countries is that Irish banks have to carry higher levels of capital, which is a legacy of the financial crisis.  There are a number of factors but the lack of competition in the domestic market is one of the major ones.</p></speech>

We clearly need to provide greater levels of supply in the market and we need policies that can facilitate that.  Obviously, there has been a fairly significant increase in capital investment in property in the recent years, certainly in the last budget, but we need more of that as we go forward.  If the fiscal framework, for example, at a European level can be modified to reflect that and to enable investment in an area as crucially important as housing, it would be very beneficial from the economy's point of view as well as for all those people who might wish to get into the property market.</p></speech>

It ties in with the need, at some stage, to taper and reform those policies and they will have to be incorporated within the more general taxation system.  That was one of the points we raised in the document, namely, that there is a significant policy challenge as we move forward in terms of modifying the policies and the schemes in light of the economy opening up.  It is a very difficult question, of that there is no doubt.  There is a balance to be struck between supporting family incomes and making sure people can survive in the current climate but also making sure there are incentives for people in terms of the normal incentives that apply as far as the economy is concerned.  Does Dr. Doorley wish to add a further comment?</p></speech>

Ideally, that would have been done at the time, with the tax being deducted as it was paid, and people would not be surprised with a bill at the end of the year.  In the work we have done, we examined the impact of the pandemic unemployment payment and the employment wage subsidy scheme on families&rsquo; incomes in light of the crisis.  Even with taxation on top of it, we found these payments were significantly cushioning the lowest income groups who had suffered pandemic-related job loss.  The bottom fifth of households in terms of income were still seeing their incomes up on average, completely cushioned, even taking into account the taxation on these payments.  Administratively, the way the taxation was pushed to the end of the year is not ideal but as we move forward, it will be taken out at source or as we go along.  Administratively, that is better from a household perspective.</p></speech>

Obviously there are many other areas and we mentioned the need for investment in green technologies.  That is very important also in facing up to the environmental challenges that exist.  Those are the two most pressing areas we would see as warranting investment.  If we consider it from country to country, from a cross-European perspective, there are different requirements for investment in other jurisdictions.  However, in the Irish case, certainly it is mainly in the housing area and in developing green technologies to address the environmental challenges.</p></speech>

They were disproportionately affected by pandemic-related job loss and in the absence of these supports, they would have seen a much larger loss in disposable income than other groups.  When these supports are withdrawn young people stand to lose a substantial amount of income and a more targeted approach might then be needed to support them while the labour market recovers.  I will cite two examples of areas arose when we examined this.  We know those who are aged 18 to 25 and who live with their parents receive a rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance that is much lower than the rate for those aged 25 and above.  That could be one area to examine because that group of 18 to 25 year olds may suffer from scarring from the pandemic-related unemployment and may find it more difficult than other groups to re-enter the labour market.  That is one rate that could be looked at.  Another factor to consider is that many young people who are currently receiving the pandemic unemployment payment are students and students are not eligible for jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in the first place.  The CSO published statistics last year showing that about a quarter of pandemic unemployment payment recipients aged under 25 were registered as a full-time student.  When this payment is withdrawn eventually and if students find it difficult to re-enter the labour market, a support targeted at them could be considered as well.</p></speech>

A number of issues arise from it on which I have a few questions.  We talked about the withdrawal of pandemic unemployment benefit and the pressures there will be on employers with the withdrawal of the wage support scheme and how that will work out.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on having an employment incentive scheme to help both employers and young people, who will be affected most by the withdrawal of the pandemic unemployment payment, to return to work and to increase our workforce.</p></speech>

That certainly sounds like a good idea on paper.  When these supports are withdrawn if there are not enough job opportunities or enough of the right job opportunities for people given their training, some sort of retraining scheme or incentive for them to rejoin the labour market will be needed.  One example would be tying extended pandemic unemployment payment or wage subsidy payment to training or job activation measures, or something like that, but it could also take the form of jobs incentive scheme.  That kind of thing sounds sensible.</p></speech>

How do they take people in, train them and retain them?  That is part of the process.  If we invest in training people, how do we retain them in their jobs.  That will be a challenge.</p> <p>  Another area about which I have a concern and on which I would like to get the witnesses' thoughts relates to our construction industry, which is closed to an extent.  It is 100% operational in the UK, Northern Ireland and beyond.  We are the only country in which it is this way.  I understand many of those not so much in senior management but in middle management have migrated back to London or elsewhere to work rather than hanging around here.  Post-Covid when we will be seeking resources to help us rebuild the economy, we will have a shortage of skill at management level in the construction industry.  That will have an impact on the cost and pace as which we get projects done.</p> <p>  Another area of concern is that we have pent up savings and people will want to spend that money or to do things with it.  Inflation could pop into the equation.</p><p>How does the ESRI deal with inflation and what effects will inflation have in a recovery?</p></speech>

That is my opinion.  I would welcome Dr. McQuinn's opinion on it.</p></speech>

On the property market, last year, we did a detailed piece of work for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage assessing the impact of Covid-19 on the property market.  The issues we raised are pretty much those suggested by the Deputy.  We felt Covid-19 would have a negative impact on demand for a period of time because of the uncertainty, job losses and so on and that it would more than likely have a bigger impact on supply over the longer term.  Demand in the housing market can recover quickly.  As alluded to earlier, there is a significant build-up of savings which, if they were to come on stream significantly into the property market, could result in a scenario of heightened levels of demand, with supply still being constrained.  In terms of where we are at with regard to supply, we still managed to build 20,000 houses last year, which was a good performance given where we sought to be at the mid point of the year.  However, we are still 13,000 to 14,000 houses short of what we need on a per annum basis.  This year, the danger is that we could end up with a significantly lower level of construction such that the build could be in the region of 13,000 to 15,000 units.  Our main conclusion was that the Covid-19 pandemic could exacerbate the imbalance between supply and demand in the market.  That is a real genuine concern.  Like everybody, we would like to see construction up and running, but there are public health considerations around that.  The supply levels coming out of the construction sector this year will need to be carefully monitored.  This goes back to our general point on the issue of public investment and the need for it, particularly in the housing area.  It is one area where the Government can make a significant contribution in terms of trying to stimulate the supply side of the market.  There is, however, the issue raised by the Deputy, namely, that if we do not have the labour, the danger is we will face higher costs.</p> <p>  On inflation generally, concerns have been expressed in regard to the United States, where there is a large debate about the nature of the stimulus package that the Biden Administration is bringing in and whether it will have inflationary implications.  In the current climate, concerns about inflation are still somewhat misplaced.  It is a concern that is a good way down the list in terms of the other issues and pressing considerations that are there.  The CPI and the rate of inflation in the Irish economy over the past number of years has been running at less than 0.5% and there has been significant disinflation over the last six to nine months because of the crisis.  I do not think we will see a significant build-up of inflation in general inflation in the coming months and years.  I do not see that as being an issue right now, but I would caveat that there is a danger, particularly if the housing supply issue is impacted adversely, that we could see house prices build up sharply and rents start to pick up again.  Those are two real concerns about the post-pandemic situation. </p></speech>

The landscape of employment is changing in terms of remote working.  How do we prepare for that and in what do we need to invest to ensure we have blended working and the proper mix?  The other issue that comes to mind in the context of the opening statement is the need for interest rates to remain constant for the next ten years.  I accept the following is crystal ball gazing, but how confident is Dr. McQuinn that interest rates will remain constant over the next ten years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.737" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021030900002#E00600"><p>In referencing the next ten years, we were looking at the forecast horizon.  In regard to the medium term, a great deal of work has been done on the future of interest rates and where they are likely to go.  Many people have looked at this issue over recent years.  Some of the most interesting work ties it in very closely with issues around demographics.  If one parks the pandemic issue, we have had low interest rates across most western economies for some time now.  The factors behind that, particularly in Europe, are demographic issues as the population becomes more ageing and also the slowdown we have observed generally in western economies in terms of productivity growth.  As long as we have those two forces and trends, it is unlikely there will be any great substantial upper pressure on interest rates over the medium-term.  Evidence of that is the sluggish inflationary figures we have observed across Europe over recent years.</p> <p>  In terms of the long-run factors that determine long-term interest rates, it is hard to see upper pressures in that regard.  That does not mean people should conduct their fiscal policy assuming there will never be an increase in interest rates over the medium or longer term.  It is safe to say that in the short to medium term there is unlikely to be a substantial pick-up in interest rates, certainly at a European level.  The other point to remember, which we stress in the opening statement, is that we are likely to experience sharper and more accelerated growth rates than most European countries coming out of the pandemic.  We entered the pandemic with strong growth rates and I think we will come out of it with strong  growth rates.  On average, growth rates in Europe are probably going to be less than what they are in the Irish economy.  This means that, in general, monetary policy will favour a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>  The other question was on remote working.  It is a very interesting question.  We tried to tease it out a little in our work on the housing issue for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on how the pandemic would impact the housing market.  At this stage, much of our work and thoughts on the issue are governed more by anecdotal evidence than anything else.  There is no tangible evidence of that.  My guess is that going forward - the institute is probably an example of this - there will be growth in blended working arrangements.  There will be some return to offices over the next six to 12 months, particularly as the economy opens up.  I do not think there will be a wholesale movement to remote working, but, equally, there will not be a return to everybody going into the office five days per week.  That will present some challenges for businesses such as retail, particularly in city centres, but it also offers some opportunities in terms of the possibility of people being able to relocate to areas where, for example, housing is cheaper, there is less congestion and from which they do not have to undertake arduous commutes on a day-to-day basis.  There will be opportunities but, equally, there will be challenges in that.  On balance, we are more likely to see a blended style arrangement going forward rather than one extreme or the other.  </p></speech>

Remote working is something we talk about.  I do not like the word "remote" because one can work from any place in Ireland and not be remote if one has the technology.  The challenge is to digitalise the regions such that everybody will have connectivity and the opportunity to work any place they want.  I believe this will be a huge factor in terms of foreign direct investment locating in Ireland into the future.  Foreign direct investment wishing to locate in Ireland will be looking at the ability of people to work in communities such that they do not have to provide huge office spaces or facilities.  They have looked at this previously and will be doing so even more so now because it is more manageable for these companies to have people working from home for a number of days per week as it cuts down on the overall cost of real estate.</p></speech>

I had intended to ask a different question first, but as we discussing labour costs and the medium term, I will follow up on the issue raised by Deputy Canney.</p><p> The ESRI recently published some work on the minimum wage which related to the 2016 change.  It showed that in 3% of firms it led to higher costs, but in around 90% of firms it did not.  The programme for Government sets out a commitment to progress the living wage over the lifetime of the Government.  Has the ESRI considered what impact that will have on labour costs in the medium term?  Has it considered doing any work on the impact on equality and Irish businesses?</p><p> I would like to follow up on some of Deputy Canney's questions on what the future of work will look like post Covid, not just in terms of the living wage or remote working but also perhaps something like a four-day week.</p></speech>

The particular study the Chair referenced was an examination of the 2016 change in the minimum wage, which was the first increase in a long time.  It was a modest increase.  Buckets of international literature show that when there are modest, progressive and successive increases in a minimum wage it does not negatively affect employment and firms are usually able to cope with it.  It is considered a good idea for the minimum wage to at least keep pace with inflation or growth in other wages so that minimum wage workers are not left behind.  This does not seem to have a significant effect on employment either way.  If the minimum wage doubles, that would have an effect on employment.</p> <p>  When we speak about moving to a living wage, it would depend on the level at which that is set.  If it is going to be quite a large increase, the things to consider are whether there will be a negative effect on employment and whether welfare payments will be able to keep pace with the increase.  If we have a living wage that increases the standard of living for low-wage workers, this increases wage growth overall.  We will then find that people in receipt of welfare payments are left behind which may increase income inequality, which is the last thing we want from an increase in the living wage.</p></speech>

That would not be considered a large increase in the minimum wage.  An increase of 20% might be a large increase and an increase of more than 20% would certainly be large.  It really depends on how long it has been since the last increase and what wage growth has been over that period.</p></speech>

Dr. Dooley can correct me if I am wrong, but I am not aware of any work that we have planned on that issue, unless my colleague, Professor Seamus McGuinness, who works on the labour side, is looking at something like that.  I am not aware that he is.  If it is a tangible and real proposal, it is something we would be very interested in assessing.  I am not aware off the top of my head of any plans to address that particular issue.</p> <p>  In one sense, one could look back over the past year.  It would be interesting to quantify, if one could, the difference for those who have been in work over the past year and how much they managed to get through on a given week compared to what they would normally have been able to do before Covid, and whether there was a dramatic improvement in productivity or an increase in people's productivity.  A lot of people were working fewer hours, in particular younger people with families etc.  In terms of a structured assessment of the issue, I am not aware of any plans we have as of yet to examine the issue of the four-day week.</p></speech>

From an environmental perspective, some of the findings were interesting.  One of the main findings was that the results implied that: "[A]lthough lower energy prices will boost energy demand, the impacts of decreased energy demand due to decreased consumption and production will be larger.  As a result, the economy-wide CO2 emissions decline by 9.5% in 2020".</p> <p>  The actual greenhouse gas emissions decline in 2020 was 5.9%.  I am not as interested in the forecasting element because I am well aware that it is a bit of a dark art.  I am not questioning the figures on that basis.  However, I am interested in the factors the ESRI feel led to lower than expected emissions savings.  How can we get better at forecasting energy use, emissions and costs?  Do we have plans for how to integrate this into our medium-term financial forecasting?</p></speech>

We have to put our hands on our hearts and say that forecasting the impact of Covid-19 has been very difficult, in terms of the overall impact on the macroeconomy.  When Covid-19 initially hit the economy in March last year, we had very draconian estimates for what we felt would happen to national output and national income.  We talked about a decline of anywhere in the region of 8%, 9% or 10%.  What we actually saw in the economy last year was growth of 3.5%.  A lot of that was mainly down to the multinational sector and the relatively strong performance of certain exporting sectors of the economy.</p> <p>  It is possibly the case that we overestimated, in particular at the outset, the impact of Covid-19 on the economy.  Equally, one could say that in some of our other forecasts in areas like consumption we were pretty accurate in what we said would happen, namely, the sharp downturn.</p> <p>  Overall, if the Chair is asking me to explain why the effects were more benign or why we did not have the fall-off in emissions that we forecasted at that time, it is probably down to the fact that there was a tendency initially to overestimate the impact of Covid-19 on the economy and, consequently, its impact on issues like carbon emissions or overall emission levels.  It is a very good point.</p> <p>  At some stage we will carry out our next economic outlook.  As the committee knows, we typically provide a quarterly economic commentary, which is a short-term forecast, four times a year.  Every five or six years we carry out a longer term forecast over a ten-year horizon.  We will do that at some point in the near future.  Clearly, the work our teams are doing in the environmental area will be central to that work.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.752" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021030900002#F01300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their very interesting and informative contributions.  I wish to ask about the debt situation.  For a long period during the time of austerity, terror and fear about the debt burden was instilled into the population.  It was given as the reason we needed incredibly draconian fiscal rules and all of the terrible austerity that flowed from that.  We were told we could not possibly sustain a debt which rose to &euro;200 billion and a debt to GDP ratio of a similar amount to the one now under consideration.</p><p>However, now it is all okay, and we have got a debt of &euro;239 billion.  Should we not be identifying the extraordinarily high levels of debt as a real risk to the economy?  I would like the witnesses to give a response to that.  I know there is a very relaxed approach on interest rates, and we think interest rates will stay as they are, but if they go up we are in deep trouble.  The witnesses might comment on that.  Our job on this committee is to identify macroeconomic risks and it seems to me that that is a serious risk.  At the very least we should open up a debate about whether that is the best way to finance the public expenditure that we need.  I would be the first to campaign for many of those expenditures, which I believe are necessary.  The Covid expenditures are critical to sustain people.  The capital expenditure on housing that has been identified by the witnesses is critical because we still have a very severe housing crisis.  Would the witnesses say that we need to have a debate about whether debt financing is the best way to cover the costs of those investments and expenditures or if we need to look at taxation on accumulated wealth?  I ask that question because, to put it bluntly, the borrowing we are doing is essentially from wealthy people.  That is who the Government borrows money from.  The Government sells bonds to wealthy people and they get an interest rate on those bonds.  In crude terms, those who lend money to the State make money from the transaction, whereas the alternative is to tax some of that accumulated wealth, which I would argue is a better deal from the public's point of view but achieves the same end, in particular when it is clear that during Covid the wealth at the top has increased substantially.  I would like the witnesses to comment on this.  The people who have taken the hit have been the tourism workers, the entertainment workers, the retail workers, often women workers, and low-paid workers in areas of low-paid employment, while the people who have done quite well are the big owners of property, some of the big corporate interests and the very wealthy individuals.  Oxfam recently suggested that the wealth of Ireland's billionaires had increased by &euro;3.3 billion.  Would we not be better off taxing those people or should we not at least discuss whether it might be a better deal to tax those people than to borrow money off them at interest?</p></speech>

Rightly or wrongly, we are very heavily governed by what happens at a European level.  Clearly, it is the European fiscal rules which have overseen our fiscal strategy in broad terms in the past ten years.  I am sure we probably discussed this at previous Oireachtas committees.  The Deputy might have seen what we published where we were very critical of the European response to the financial crisis, and the austerity-led response is perhaps the way people would couch it.  From a technical point of view, the way we would have said it is that the idea of governments collectively across Europe pursuing a contractionary fiscal policy, which is what they did after 2010, at a time when nearly every single European country was running very substantial large negative output gaps, which showed that there was huge capacity in those economies, just did not tally and it did not make sense to a lot of commentators.  Fortunately, the debate has moved on quite a bit in the past ten years, in particular among many more senior and more influential policymakers at a European level.  That was why to a certain extent I instanced the comments from the executive board member of the ECB.  It is interesting to note that these comments are now coming from places like the ECB, and even in German policy, which would traditionally have been regarded as very conservative as far as fiscal policy is concerned.</p> <p>  The underlying issue is clearly the low interest rate environment, as Deputy Boyd Barrett correctly pointed out.  That is enabling us, as with most other countries, to borrow quite significantly at present, but the borrowing cost as a fraction of GDP for example or as a fraction of our total revenues is quite low relative to where it was previously when our borrowing was not as substantial but the interest rates were very high.  It is very analogous to the mortgage market.  People can take out large mortgages when the interest rates are very low but when interest rates are at running at 13%, 14% or 15% then clearly the scale of the mortgage one can take out is much more reduced.  That does beg the question, as the Deputy correctly identified, as to where we see interest rates going.  As I indicated to a previous speaker, I think all of the focus in all of the analysis that I have seen that I respect, does suggest that low interest rates are something that will be with us for quite some time.  There is a broader issue here about the growth potential and dynamics within the European economy.  They had been very much reduced in the past ten to 15 years.  Europe is not growing as significantly as it did in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s.  In the absence of the key trends being reversed in areas like demographics, where it is clearly incontrovertible that we are heading for a much older population, in particular in countries like Germany, and in the absence of a major turnaround in productivity, which has been slowing down gradually across western economies, it is hard to see how interest rates are going to escalate over the medium to longer term.  I fully agree that it is something we need to be very careful about and we need to keep an eye on, because if interest rates do start to climb, we are in a lot of trouble.  The only consideration is that an awful lot of other countries will be in similar trouble as well, so policymakers are very much focused on this issue.</p> <p>  On the point Deputy Boyd Barrett made about raising taxes and the need to increase or broaden the tax base in response to the crisis, there are very valid reasons and arguments there in certain areas.  Property tax is one area where one could look to increase the tax burden going forward.  We pointed out that we felt there should have been increases in property tax, in particular given the very sharp rate of house price inflation in recent years.  We are confident about the future prospects of the Irish economy, but as a general point, when one is talking about the scale of this crisis and its impact on the economy, if one were to start increasing taxes in the manner in which they have done in the UK for instance very recently, the danger is that one could choke off the recovery.  That is something we would be concerned about.  Perhaps it is a case of seeing the economy recover over the short to medium term and then one could have a debate or policy discussion on where one might wish to broaden the tax base and where exactly one could do that.  Dr. Doorley might wish to contribute now.</p></speech>

While we would not be saying that raising taxes right now is the right way to go, certainly a date on whether revenue does need to be raised through taxes in the future is a good idea.  It is possible that at some point in the medium to long term the State will have to raise extra revenue, either to pay for the extraordinary Exchequer costs incurred during the pandemic or to finance a larger role for the State going forward, which it seems there may be a public and political appetite for at the moment.  That is something we are currently looking at and are doing some research on.  We are looking at the options for raising revenue.  We are looking at everything from direct tax, indirect tax, corporation tax, property tax, congestion charges and so on.  The research, which is being done by colleagues of mine at the ESRI, is likely to be out in May.  What we will be looking at is what is the likely revenue gain from changing the parameters of each of these types of taxation and, importantly, what are their distributional effects &ndash; who are they going to affect, who are the winners and who are the losers from each of these options.  That is quite important.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned inequality increasing.  We do know that in the absence of the Covid supports last year that income inequality would have increased quite substantially and so would poverty rates.  As it is, with the introduction of the PUP and the wage subsidy scheme, disposable income inequality, after tax and transfers, has been quite stable between the pre and post-pandemic period, but the caveat is there that when these supports are withdrawn it is quite possible that income inequality and poverty will increase if there are not enough labour market opportunities for people.</p><p>High income inequality is linked to many things we would like to avoid, including lower economic growth, lack of social cohesion, worse population health and well-being and higher poverty.  When these supports are withdrawn it will be important to ensure there are adequate labour market opportunities, or adequately targeted supports, to ensure income inequality will not increase.</p></speech>

The figures for savings are clearly showing that some people are not as impacted as others by the pandemic.  Some are really heavily hit, with household income obliterated in many households.  There are almost two different worlds going on there.</p> <p>  When moving towards recovery, have the witnesses any thoughts on making sure there is opportunity for people who have been hit harder to catch up and benefit from that recovery?  If there are people doing well, they will be up and running a lot faster.  However, there are sectors that have been hit harder, whether it is the entertainment, the arts or hospitality sectors or other sectors, that could be focused on.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on how those sectors might have an opportunity to catch up with any recovery?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.760" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021030900002#H00500"><p>The reality is those sectors have been effectively shut down over the last eight or nine months, particularly over the last two to three months, since the level 5 restrictions were brought in.  There are huge numbers of people in those sectors who are out of work and a huge number of businesses that have been temporarily closed.  By definition, when we move into the vaccine period and the economy starts to reopen, we will then see, hopefully, dramatic improvements in employment in those sectors.  We will begin to see the unemployment rate across those sectors begin to fall on a persistent basis.</p> <p>  The evidence last year would suggest that is likely to happen.  We looked at the reaction of the economy when restrictions were eased initially.  There was certainly a fairly quick bounce back and rebound in the sectors most affected, the ones mentioned by the Deputy.  Our expectation is that something similar could happen this time around.  However, the one drawback is the scarring effect.  There is a great likelihood that a number of businesses that were just about able to survive the first lockdown will not be able to survive what happened this time, which is the lockdown last year and the one we have just experienced.  There is that risk.  </p> <p>  However, the point could be made that if we enter a general opening up of the economy due to the vaccines, and if Covid rescinds fairly quickly from the public consciousness, there will be a boost in confidence.  People will feel that maybe they are over Covid now; it was a dreadful episode but it is in the past.  Therefore, confidence can come back across all the different sectors, whether it is investor confidence, consumer sentiment and so on.  That can drive the economy and recovery as well.</p> <p>  There are countervailing forces on whether that will offset the scarring effects or whether the scarring effects will have a large impact on the recovery.  However, as the economy opens, there will certainly be a large increase in employment across the sectors that have been shut down. </p></speech>

However, businesses have been closed down for some time and some businesses will be gone.  Dr. McQuinn calls it a scarring effect.  Does he see the need for a focused intervention or supports for different communities, or does he see a natural return?  Surely there are particular interventions that might be needed for different sectors or cohorts of people.</p></speech>

It monitors the response of the SME sector to issues generally but in particular, at the moment, the pandemic.  It may well be the case that some of that research is looking at targeting or identifying debt levels among SMEs and trying to identify whether something can be done from a policy perspective to alleviate debt levels so that when the opportunity arises, those firms are in a position to bounce back and bounce back fairly aggressively.  That is something that should be considered, in that if there are firm which would have been perfectly viable before Covid-19 but are now saddled with higher levels of debt because of the pandemic and shutdown, can something be done to target those businesses and their debt positions so they can move forward and recover with a great degree of confidence?  That is possibly a policy measure that could be considered.  As I said, my colleagues are looking at those issues and will have research fairly imminently on the likely areas that could be pinpointed.</p></speech>

How do we get to a non-PUP world again?</p></speech>

Withdrawing it on one day is probably to be avoided.  The PUP obviously played a huge role in reducing income losses last year, but the difficulty is balancing safety nets with incentives to work.  For many people the PUP is more generous than the corresponding jobseeker's payment.  There is an inequity between people who lost their jobs before Covid and those who lost their jobs after it.  The first point to make is that addressing that inequity is, at some point, desirable.  Whether that is reducing the PUP to the rate of jobseeker's or increasing jobseeker's supports, it is a decision for policymakers, but addressing the inequity is important for a start.</p> <p>  One option available is the gradual tapering of the PUP over time, which could help groups at risk of long-term unemployment after the pandemic to maintain a certain standard of living while searching for work.  Alternatively, recipients could be allowed keep some of their payment for a period while taking up paid employment.  That is currently the case with the self-employed.  This improves incentives to work.  It could encourage those who are currently in non-viable industries to seek employment in other sectors where they may need some additional training.  Increasing incentives to work as the economy reopens will be important and modifying the PUP, in some way, will be central to that. </p></speech>

I want to ask about people going into other sectors and training up.  Does Dr. Doorley see the PUP, or a variation of it, running in parallel while somebody is training or reskilling to move from one sector to another?</p></speech>

If extended receipt of the PUP is cut off for some individuals but not others, some activation measure could be linked to it that would either help them to retrain for, or get job experience in, another industry.  That would certainly help with recovery.  It will be important, in order to minimise the scarring effects after people have been out of work for so long, to get them back to work, if they want to and are able to.  In order to do that, we need to improve incentives to work which may, given health concerns, need to be higher post-pandemic than they were before.  The incentive to work needs to improve and the job opportunities need to be there.</p><p>Whether they are different job opportunities from what was there before will dictate whether the PUP should be tied to some sort of activation measure or not. </p></speech>

My first question relates to comments made by the Minister for Finance at a recent ESRI event.  He said that to keep the interest bill on the national debt down, Ireland's deficit will need to be reduced.  That assumes that our borrowing rate is a function of our country's debt and deficit.  In 2010, we ran a deficit of approximately &euro;18 billion and, last year, we ran a deficit of &euro;19 billion.  In September 2010, prior to entering the bailout and before Mr. Mario Draghi made his "whatever it takes" speech, we issued a bond at 6.3% whereas, in recent times, we have issued bonds at negative rates.  Many observers say that rather than being a function of our debt and deficit, our borrowing rate is largely a function of what the ECB is willing to backstop in the secondary market.  Does the ESRI share the view that interest rates are a function of debt and deficits or does it see the actions of the ECB as a more determining factor?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.769" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021030900002#J00300"><p>It is clear that the role of the ECB is hugely influential in terms of its policies.  Indeed, the Deputy referred to Mario Draghi.  There is no doubt that his decision-making and policy initiatives have had a massive impact on Ireland's recovery.  For example, it basically reduced substantially the interest payments that we were paying on the debt and made the debt, as a result, more affordable.  It is interesting that the Deputy mentioned this because the whole concept of interest, the servicing of the debt and the interest repayments of the debt as a percentage of GDP, is one measure that has been advocated, particularly in the US literature by very notable economists such as Larry Summers and Jason Furman, who say that this should be a fiscal metric that is used more to determine sustainability rather than some of the metrics that are used, for example, in the fiscal framework that revolves around issues such as debt to GDP and coming along with a 3% deficit limit.  There is no doubt that the ECB has a huge role to play.  The ECB has kept interest rates very low on the market because of its policies over the recent period.  That is very welcome and essential at the present time.  Indeed, it is hoped that will continue over the foreseeable future.</p> <p>  Equally, there is no doubt that as a member state we cannot go on running sizeable deficits of between 5% and 7%.  Over time that is not sustainable.  Particularly for a small open economy like ourselves, it is prudent policy to try to accumulate some fiscal buffers for the rainy day.  One could argue that our decision to run relatively prudent budgetary policy over the past five or six years - and we accumulated surpluses in 2018 and 2019 - led us to be in a position where we could cope with the fiscal challenges that we now cope with.  It is a case of, on the one hand, ensuring that we return to a degree of fiscal normality and fiscal discipline after the crisis has passed.  Equally, in terms of any debate on the fiscal framework, we would certainly call for it to be reformed to allow for greater investment in member state countries.  This view goes back to the point that we made in our opening statement, which is recognised by policymakers across Europe, that it is not just about the policies of the ECB and keeping interest rates low, it is about unconventional, as they are called, fiscal policies as well being required to stimulate growth and economic activity right across the euro area.</p></speech>

However, we do not talk about the deficit in terms of the infrastructure and the health infrastructure, which has naturally impacted and meant that we have been in long lockdowns because our infrastructure simply cannot cope.</p> <p>  My second question is on the shared equity scheme.  I have heard the views that Dr. McQuinn expressed about the scheme but I would like a bit more detail.  Recently, I wrote to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to ask him what risk analysis had been done on the shared equity scheme and to outline the nature of the risk model that he was employing and the assumptions made therein.  I did not get an answer to any of my questions but the Minister, somewhat unreassuringly, said that work on the detailed design of the proposed scheme is ongoing and that the scheme would increase growth in the housing supply by improving confidence.  That has not necessarily been the case over the past while.  Perhaps he means there will be business confidence among those who may benefit from the scheme.  Can Dr. McQuinn tell me how the scheme will inflate prices?</p></speech>

Our view is that some of those measures certainly are constructive or positive.  There is no doubt that they will have a positive impact on supply in the market.  Our comments about the shared equity scheme reflect opinions held about schemes such as that by a number of different commentators that the danger with those schemes, particularly in a market such as the Irish one where our supply is relatively low, as it is, and relatively, as we would say in economic terms, inelastic so it is slow to respond to economic stimuli, is a significant boost to affordability would feed through to higher prices in terms of house price inflation.  That is the general point that most people would feel about a scheme like that.  The Minister said that they are looking at the details, and we will very interested to see the details when they are published, but that is the general point that people have made about the schemes such as that.  Indeed, as the Deputy will know, that is a concern not just ourselves but many others have articulated.</p></speech>

Economists and international experts tell us that GDP in an Irish context is so subject to distortions that it can be quite difficult to use it in any kind of a meaningful sense yet, at the same time, it is frequently used by Government politicians, presumably because it paints a rosier picture than the reality for most people, which they can then take credit for.  I do not expect Dr. McQuinn to comment on that.  Does the ESRI agree with the proposition that when examining Ireland's fiscal and monetary positions in an international comparison that the use of metrics like debt as a percentage of GDP, which Dr. McQuinn has said, is really flying blind from a policy perspective?  What are his views on using GNI* rather than GDP?</p> <p>  Recently, Professor Patrick Honohan had a piece about the actual individual consumption, AIC, but for some reason it is not coming to me.  I am interested in hearing Dr. McQuinn's views on that.  I ask as it would be great to see international comparisons because GDP is simply not a good metric.</p></speech>

Indeed, we have produced quite a few bits of research on the issue.  In fact, a former colleague, Professor John FitzGerald, whom she may remember has written a number of pieces for us.  In our forthcoming commentary, he will update an indicator that he advocated last year - a net national product.  We will have updated estimates of that in our commentary that will be published, I think, on 25 March.</p> <p>  We have long noted the difficulties with GDP.  Going back to last year's performance of the economy, it is clear that not all of it was a GDP issue in the sense that it reflected the very strong performance by a relatively small number of multinational firms in the export sector.  That is why output, as a whole, across the economy actually increased.</p> <p>  Let us consider the subaggregates.  The effect on consumption in the economy was pretty similar to that across most European countries.</p><p>There was a decline in consumption of about 9% last year.  That was in the middle of the range experienced in most European economies.  In that, we were quite similar to other countries.  Ultimately, it was the multinational sector, and a relatively small section of it, that was responsible for Ireland registering a positive growth rate for the economy as a whole.  </p><p> I could not agree more on the Deputy's point about GDP.  When we publish our debt forecast, we always publish both debt to GDP and debt to GNI*.  Debt to GNI* also has its issues; it is not a perfect measure.  In fact, Professor Honohan discussed that in the recent note to which the Deputy referred.  It is about looking at a variety of measures.  The key metric or variable that the ESRI focuses on when we examine the strength and performance of the economy is the labour market because that gives the best indication of how well the economy is performing.</p></speech>

I will try to keep them to four minutes for each question.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is quick off the mark.</p></speech>

Dr. Doorley spoke earlier on education.  We were talking about retraining and reskilling, etc.  We might also throw in the clearly apparent skill shortages in a number of areas.  It has become very evident that we need to train more people in various areas.  Arguably, a lot more teachers are needed to reduce class sizes.  There are many healthcare professions that need more people.  More workers are needed in all aspects of construction.  Then there are the industries that may be in trouble and where many people need to retrain and reskill.  I take it from what Dr. Doorley has said that this is a time when we need to remove barriers to higher and further education and training and apprenticeships, fees being the most obvious.  I think it is such a time, and People Before Profit has a motion on this matter before the D&aacute;il this week.  The very high fees are even higher if a person has previously been in third level.  In graduate entry medicine, for example, the fees are &euro;15,000 a year.  These shockingly high fees are now the highest fees in the European Union since the exit of the UK.  There are many other barriers associated with the cost of pursuing higher and further education, apprenticeships and postgraduate study.  What is the ESRI's view?  Is it time for a radical look at removing barriers to maximise people's potential to retrain and educate themselves to the standards that we need and they need to participate in the employment market post Covid?</p></speech>

The construction sector, which the Deputy mentioned, is a classic example.  When I was presenting at various construction-related conferences and forums, particularly from 2012 to 2015 onwards, and talking to people in the business, it was clear that there had been a near wipeout of people going into the basic trades that are necessary for construction-related activity.  This is the kind of issue we were touching on when we were discussing the overall effects of Covid on the property market, for example.  When there is a very sharp, profound shock such as the one we experienced, it tends to have much more of an impact on the supply side of the market because people are reluctant to go into construction, learn the various skills and take up the basic training programmes that are required to meet the day-to-day requirements of the sector because confidence is essentially wiped out.  The Deputy is correct when he suggests that we need some kind of audit and an appreciation of where the different sectors are at.  That will ultimately have an impact on the potential recovery of the economy overall.  We need to see the ways that policymakers can intervene to reduce the restrictions that are there, including those which may always have been there and those which may have come about because of the pandemic.  I return to my earlier point on the need to look at debt levels among SMEs to see if something can be done to try to get those businesses back up and running.  We need some kind of audit on policy measures that could be undertaken in relation to logjams or rigidities that are there anyway but which have been brought on more by the Covid issue.</p></speech>

Broadly speaking, it seems like education will form a very important part of the recovery from Covid because jobs are changing and have changed already.  Some industries may be less viable than they once were.  I am not sure that the proposition of just knocking out fees will make much of a difference without addressing shortages of teachers and so on.  If everyone goes to further or higher education, we will not have enough places available for them.  I suppose what the Deputy is talking about is a complete overhaul of the education system.  That is worth having a discussion about but I cannot give a great answer.  Other members of the institute would be better placed.</p></speech>

Returning to the shared equity scheme, I am critical of it and share the ESRI's concerns.  We are teasing it out from every angle in my own parliamentary party.  I understand the ESRI's concerns.  I have seen what has happened internationally.  The witnesses will have read the steps the Minister is seeking to take maybe to try to obviate its worst effects.</p> <p>  If there are 30,000 or 40,000 outstanding extant planning permissions available nationally, it has taken a number of years to get to them.  They will wither in a number of years if they are not acted on.  There might be 10,000 to 15,000 of these in Dublin.  I am not trying to be smart when I ask a sincerely motivated question: what other measures could the Government consider to activate those permissions?</p></speech>

The key issue for us is the cost of supplying a house in the economy.  That is the underlying issue.  A lot of work was done in the aftermath of the financial crisis to compare price levels across jurisdictions.  It is always a very fraught exercise to make sure one is comparing apples with apples rather than apples with oranges.  Some detailed work has been done by the European Commission in the last couple of years which has sought to adjust for the different peculiarities of individual markets across the euro area in comparing house prices.  The kind of estimates it has produced are as robust as anyone is going to get in a cross-country setting.  It shows clearly that even adjusting for size, Irish house prices are among the highest in Europe.  That is fairly incontrovertible.  If the fundamental premise is that it is not profitable for developers to supply a house in the Irish market now, we have to ask why that is the case.  What is the underlying problem here?  I do not think there is much more scope for measures which may bid-up house prices, which is sometimes couched as "providing confidence to the market", if we look at it in the context of where Irish house prices are relative to other jurisdictions.  Then it returns to supply and the cost of supplying a house and what the difficulty with that is.  One of the big problems is data.  We have seen people coming out with estimates of what it costs to build an apartment in Dublin.</p><p>The following day there is a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i>explaining why it is wrong, inaccurate and incorrect, etc.  We actually have a difficulty with establishing the cost.  One of the issues we have often raised - it is an issue other people have raised as well - is the whole issue of land costs.  Why are land costs so high in the Irish market?  It comes back inevitably to the issue of speculation.  There is an issue about people hoarding land banks and consequently keeping the price of land banks and land generally at an artificially high level when compared to other jurisdictions.  Those are some of the areas I would pretty vigorously tap.  I know the Government has brought in measures to address some of those points.  I believe that is where we can get a bang for our buck in addressing the underlying issues.<br/><br/>We welcomed other aspects of the Bill.  In general, the origination of the LDA is good in terms of its ability to co-ordinate a supply response across public lands as long as there is a significant commitment to social and affordable housing as part of it.  Several measures there are positive.  As I said, the fundamental issue is the cost of supplying a house and the measures we can bring in to aggressively tackle that.</p></speech>

It is close to home for many people.  It relates to further extensions and expansions of MetroLink.  That would be a major issue for parts of Dublin.  Then everyone would have their project.  There is nothing wrong with these projects.  I will not hold the ESRI to the specific MetroLink I have in mind, but is that the kind of capital investment or project?  Are these the types of capital projects the ESRI is thinking about?</p></speech>

Housing is the one we have always advocated because it is the most pressing one and the one that affects most citizens.  We have done detailed work on how much people are paying for housing and how it compares through time.  That is the main area I see.  There are other areas around other elements of social infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, etc.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to large infrastructural projects.  I was somewhat heartened by the Minister's announcement recently that, in looking at the national development plan, there will be a key emphasis on trying to bring about monitoring of costs.  The one nagging doubt I always have as an economist in advocating capital investment is that there is a danger we could see billions of euro in public funding going into projects without getting the required return.  We have seen costs escalating and go out of control on several projects.  I believe it is important that, whatever we do, we have strict monitoring of the costs and the returns for the investment.  Ultimately, we are talking about substantial amounts.  It is ultimately taxpayers' money so we have to be focused on that.  In anything that is undertaken there has to be a rigorous cost-benefit analysis underpinning it and a rigorous monitoring of the costs to ensure that they do not escalate.  Certainly, housing would be the main one in terms of priorities.  It is important that we begin to invest in green technologies that could help us meet the kind of environmental targets abroad.  Those are the key pressing issues I see.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.786" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021030900002#L00600"><p>I will make comments having listened to the debate.  One relates to capital expenditure and the fact that the north and western regions have been designated as areas in decline by the European Commission.  There is an opportunity because of this new designation.  We have to positively discriminate in terms of investment.  Does the ESRI support that for a region?</p> <p>  The ESRI officials talked about housing.  One of the biggest issues I have come across is that we talk about the LDA and the big-ticket items, yet what I am looking at in my constituency and throughout the west is small towns and villages - settlement centres - where a person cannot build a house or get planning permission to build a house because they do not have a wastewater treatment plant.  The person will not be allowed to build a single septic tank for each unit.  That has been ruled out by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the local authorities.</p> <p>  Now we have a situation where the growth centres around Galway city, including Craughwell, Corofin, Abbeyknockmoy or wherever they may be, are areas where we cannot build a house.  We have areas where the wastewater infrastructure is absent but the way it will be delivered it is not even on anyone's agenda.</p> <p>  We talk about delivering houses, affordable houses, regional development and remote working and how all of this will help the regions.  How do we marry all that up?  Do the officials have any thoughts or comments on that?  I believe it is a major area we have to look at.  For instance, there is considerable debate about whether the western rail corridor should reopen north from Athenry to Claremorris to create a link between Ballina, Westport, Galway and Limerick.  It is small money in the overall context, perhaps costing &euro;150 million.  It seems it is being pushed back.  I believe it would create leverage in a green environment to create public transport and to regenerate the area.  This is not only relevant for cities such as Limerick and Galway.  We need to regenerate the towns like Tuam and the growth centres around there so that they can grow as well.  A person can buy a house in Tuam for &euro;100,000 less than in Galway city.  That is what I call affordability.  People can live there but they need to have that connection, a guarantee of a job and they need to be able to live there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.787" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021030900002#L00700"><p>In general, we very much agree with the need for more balanced growth across the economy.  It is clear that if we stand back and look at the overall economy we see the concentration of economic activity on the eastern seaboard.  It is essential that we have more balanced growth, including along the western corridor, as a way of rivalling the eastern seaboard.  Again, it is about ensuring that whatever investment we make in infrastructure can unleash an area or the growth potential of an area.  Ultimately, the investments made must generate a certain rate of return for the taxpayer.</p> <p>  I fully agree with the Deputy on the property issue.  It is interesting.  Some years ago, we had people into the institute, as we frequently do, to discuss the property sector.  If I have it correct, people from the Construction Industry Federation made a prediction based on changes in financing that have come about as a result of the financial sector and the kind of equity that property developers need to raise.  Ultimately, the federation saw the major shortage being in rural areas, for example, with smaller developments.  These were the kinds of projects property developers were going to have difficulty in raising finance for because they simply would not have the scale to meet the equity requirements that financial institutions were requiring.  That was because of the financial crisis.  There is definitely an issue there in terms of scale and development and it is a difficult one to address.</p> <p>  Let us go back to the whole principle around the LDA.  I am not here to advocate for it one way or the other but it seems that because it is a national organisation or nationally widespread in terms of its scope, it can negotiate with developers in a way that would lead to the likelihood of more regional construction being brought about, if that were required so rather than each local authority having to deal with property developers for construction, if we were able to do this on a national basis it may lead to greater economies of scale and efficiencies.  In turn, that would then see construction in rural areas that would otherwise not materialise.  That may be one possibility.  Certainly, in terms of the broader issue and the need for more balanced growth, the national development plan is addressing those issues and I would certainly very much agree with that.</p></speech>

Going back five years, before the utility was put into place or established, the places I have mentioned were on a list of wastewater treatment plants to be built by the local authorities.  Once Irish Water came into being, however, what happened was that the focus of the company changed to carrying out projects in areas where those responsible see potential large growth.  They are looking at the east coast and the cities.  They are looking at firefighting and pollution into the sea in different places.  That takes up all the money they have and they do not even have enough money to do those things.</p><p>Houses have been built that do not have proper sewerage.  There are two estates in Athenry where the wastewater is not working and they cannot connect to the treatment plant because the network has not yet been built out and will not be there for another four years.  There is something amiss in what we are doing.</p><p> If we continue with our current policies regarding Irish Water and the Land Development Agency, we will create more problems for Dublin, rural areas and the regions because we will actually intensify the lack of balance that is there.  I think Deputy Boyd Barrett said last week that it would cost someone &euro;600,000 to buy a house in Dublin where I could give someone a beautiful house in the regions for &euro;275,000.  It is as much a problem for the people living in Dublin as it is for the people living in the west, south or north.  I have a fear of the Land Development Agency becoming this big body dealing with big stuff and forgetting about the real stuff that would matter to the regions.</p></speech>

We will have time for the Deputy.  I want to go back to the issue of recovery.  In the next 12 to 14 months, this committee in particular will try to get to grips with a very febrile situation when it comes to macroeconomic forecasting.  What do the witnesses think the outlook is for SMEs, particularly domestic SMEs, in terms of performance and accessing credit in the medium term?  I am thinking not just in terms of a recovery or resilience fund but also in the context of Ulster Bank withdrawing from the market and the performance of bodies specifically geared towards accessing credit such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on the structural landscape for SMEs at the moment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.792" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021030900002#M00400"><p>That is a very good question.  Our colleagues have a research programme that explicitly looks at the general issue of access to finance among SMEs.  This was a research programme that was there prior to the pandemic but it is obviously a key question it is addressing given the pandemic and the strains it will place.  Clearly, the Irish banking sector needs more competition, not less.  That is clear and evident from even our discussion about the interest rate a while back.  If we look at the kind of credit conditions in the Irish market, especially focusing on the interest rate, it is clear that interest rates are higher on average in the Irish market, whether it relates to SMEs or mortgage holders, than they are for comparable households and firms across the euro area.  This makes it more difficult for those firms to operate in the Irish market than if they were operating in other jurisdictions.  That is going to be a key issue.</p> <p>  In terms of policy interventions, we discussed the need to look at targeted measures addressing the debt situation of many SMEs that come out of the current situation.  It is a difficult issue because we must try to establish what firms we think are valid and viable and have a successful path in the economy going forward and those we simply feel are not likely to succeed and are not worth providing huge financial assistance to.  It is a difficult question and issue.  There are bound to be a lot of firms among SMEs that are struggling and will struggle when we get into the post-Covid situation.  They will be carrying high levels of debt because of Covid.  These are firms that would have been perfectly viable and valid otherwise.  This is where policy measures need to be targeted to assist those firms to progress into the future.</p> <p>  Looking at it from the aggregate, the macro perspective, we would be fairly confident that most sectors of the economy that have been closed will recover quite strongly over the short to medium term.  Our growth forecasts would reflect that not only in terms of our expectations of things like consumption and investment but also in terms of our future path of unemployment.  I will not say we are optimistic but we are quite positive about how we see the economy opening up in the next six, nine or 12 months and we believe it will grow quite strongly in that period.  Where the policy intervention needs to come is targeting those SMEs that are carrying high levels of debt mainly as a function of the pandemic but, ultimately, are very viable enterprises in terms of their prospects going forward.</p></speech>

I do not know if R. McQuinn looked very closely at the legislation.  He may have, but I will not assume it.  Many people hoped the Land Development Agency would be something that would intervene to reduce the costs of building houses, particularly intervening in a market where prices have gone out of control, as Dr. McQuinn said, and are some of the highest in Europe.  Does it concern him that the legislation specifically prescribes that the housing that will be built will be benchmarked against local market conditions?  As Deputy Canney said, local market conditions in Tuam may be prices that are manageable, but benchmarking the housing we desperately need to build against local market conditions in the areas where the housing crisis is most acute is a recipe for disaster because we are starting at prices that are astronomical and off the wall.  There is very little mention of social housing in the legislation.  The only reference to it is to the 10% figure, so it seems the Land Development Agency is only envisaging a very small proportion of social housing on public land and benchmarking against a distorted private market.  Does that worry Dr. McQuinn?</p></speech>

I have seen and followed some of the commentary around it.  That was one of the points I made to Deputy Canney.  It did strike me that the Land Development Agency would be in a strong position to negotiate at a much larger level in terms of dealing with prospective developers rather than individual local authorities in that there were efficiencies that could be gained in this respect and that may enable development in areas where there may not otherwise have been.  The Deputy is right.  The whole definition of social housing and what constitutes a social house or what is affordable constitute a key part of the equation.</p> <p>  In respect of any definitions that are used, especially the granularity work that is used, we have done a considerable amount of work in that regard, as the Deputy is aware since we probably discussed it with him in previous sessions.  This is fairly detailed work looking at what Irish households pay on average.  The results are very stark in terms of the significant cohorts of our households that are paying relatively large shares of their income on housing.  This is a feature not just of the past two, three or four years.  It has been a feature of the Irish property market going back as far as we have looked at it.  It would be ideal if any definition of social housing and how social housing is couched would be with reference to that kind of analysis in terms of what people are paying, what they can afford to pay and possibly what people pay in other jurisdictions.  We benchmarked Irish affordability against other jurisdictions using norms that are used in terms of whether it is 30% or the 30-40 rule used in other countries.  It would be useful for the definition of social or affordable housing to be couched in that type of work and that kind of granularity of analysis.</p></speech>

I thank the Business Committee for agreeing to this public meeting of the Committee on Public Petitions during the level 5 restrictions.  We have made every effort to mitigate the risk of the new variants of Covid-19 to members, witnesses and staff.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Griffin and Senator Gerard Craughwell.</p> <p>  I must read some formal notices.  Members, witnesses and staff are requested to use the wipes and hand sanitizer provided to clean seats and desks that are shared so as to supplement regular sanitation.  This will help to mitigate the risk of Covid-19 spreading among the parliamentary community.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the places in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  Are all members of the committee within the precincts of Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin?  As the members have indicated in the affirmative, I will proceed.</p> <p>  I wish to explain to the witnesses some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I will now to the discussion on the terms of reference of the committee.  The first witness to address the first meeting of the then Joint Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Petitions on 20 July 2011 was the then Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, who discussed the terms of reference of the committee, including the relationship between the Ombudsman and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Since 2011, many Ombudsmen have appeared before the committee and other committees considering their annual and special reports.  However, ten years later, we are once again reviewing the terms of reference of the committee, including the relationship with the Ombudsman.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee I would like to extend a warm welcome to the following witnesses from the Irish Ombudsman Forum: Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, chair of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission; and Mr. Peter Tyndall, Ombudsman.  The witnesses will have ten minutes to make their opening statements and members will have five minutes each for questions and answers.  We should have enough time to have a second round of questions.  I invite Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring to make her opening statement.  She will be followed by the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.801" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021030900002#A00700"><p>I thank the Chairman and the gentlemen, as I note the committee membership is all male, for this opportunity to appear before them today to discuss a topic that I am returning to for a second, if not a third, time.  I think Mr. Tyndall has a greater historical relationship with the committee.  We have sent in a letter, which I hope all the members have had an opportunity to peruse.  I will talk about the generalities and Mr. Tyndall will then follow me to talk about, in particular, developments since we were last before the committee.</p> <p>  For a historical reference for the members' information, in January of 2016, when the committee was the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions under the then chairmanship of Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, it produced an excellent report on the issue of the role and remit of Ombudsmen and our relationship with the Oireachtas.  Obviously, each of us has a partner, as I would prefer to call it rather not a parent, Department with which we have a relationship.  Clearly, in my case it would be with the Department of Justice and for the Children's Ombudsman, it would be with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  In that regard, we have interested Departments to which we report and engage but as an organisation we have been anxious to have a single commission that looks at the Ombudsmen community.  We have different remits.  We have different audiences so different members of the public interact with the different Ombudsmen and like the members, we have this important role in respect of the public.</p> <p>  The members' role, as the Committee on Public Petitions, allows members of the public to come directly to them with petitions and so it sits nicely in terms of our joint interaction with the public.  It sits nicely with this committee but there is more to it than that.  In particular, the fact that we all have different constituents, so to speak, means that it would be important that somebody is keeping an oversight of the different Ombudsmen, the value that the different Ombudsmen give to the community and, in particular, the use that is made of that by the community, and also issues of governance, transparency, who makes up a commissioner or, in our case, an Ombudsman in other instances.  It is having a committee of the Oireachtas that has that role as distinct from our partner Departments with which we have an ongoing statutory relationship.</p><p>It is for that reason we met seven years ago.  We were anxious to progress this matter and get the issues identified by the previous committee.  In its report, it looked into the area of what is an ombudsman, all of the philosophical issues and then how that all tied together in terms of a practical relationship with the petitions committee.<br/><br/>We are anxious that the public oversight role be restored to the committee's remit.  It provides to the forum an important avenue of interaction as well as elements of governance and transparency.  We are also anxious there would be more oversight of the international community of ombudsmen.  The Venice convention is an important step in that regard.  It is about finding a role in the Oireachtas to take ownership in a communal way, as opposed to an individual way, of the various ombudsmen who provide important roles <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>to the public.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.803" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021030900002#B00200"><p>The most important development in respect of ombudsman institutions worldwide relates to the Venice Principles.  These are the principles on the protection and promotion of the ombudsman institutions.  Some committee members will be familiar with the Paris Principles, which set out the rules governing national human rights institutions.  Up to now, we have not had a global standard by which ombudsman institutions and the legislation which creates them can be judged.</p> <p>  That was redressed when the Venice Principles were prepared by the Venice Commission in 2019 and subsequently adopted by the Council of Europe.  More particular for us is the fact they were adopted by the UN in December of last year in a motion which was co-sponsored by Ireland.  I pay tribute to the Irish representatives at the UN who played an active role in making sure this global standard was put in place.</p> <p>  Ireland was a co-sponsor of the motion that adopted the Venice Principles.  Why does it matter?  It codifies some of the issues we have discussed with this committee and its predecessors.  It sets out the importance of a set of fundamental principles around independence, jurisdiction and powers.  It sets out how those should be delivered in practice.  It does not just say an ombudsman should be independent but it spells out that the appointment process should enhance independence.  It sets out that the status of the post should enhance independence and authority and so on.  It specifies sufficient funding should be in place to enable an ombudsman office to do its job.</p> <p>  It sets out the importance of a broad jurisdiction across public services.  It allows for the kind of arrangement we have in Ireland where one has, for instance, the jurisdiction over the Garda covered by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  It does not require a single ombudsman office covering the whole of the public service.  However, it does require that, of the ombudsman offices that exist, there must be comprehensive coverage across the public service.</p> <p>  It specifies the relationship with the parliament - the Oireachtas in our case - in a way which is different from what our practice has been in the past.  It looks to the parliament having ownership of the legislation which creates ombudsman offices.  As many of the services an ombudsman oversees are delivered by government, it is important the appointment process for an ombudsman should be seen to be independent of government.  In our case, as I am appointed by the President following a vote in both Houses of the Oireachtas, we have some elements of that in place.</p> <p>  It also suggests the oversight of the legislation should sit with the parliament.  Some committee members will be familiar with the fact the legislation governing the Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman was driven by a committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly, not by the Administration in Northern Ireland.  That is the kind of model that is used.</p> <p>  The convention also deals with the role of the Ombudsman in reporting to the Oireachtas and the purpose of that.  The Ombudsman is essentially an officer of the Oireachtas.  The Ombudsman has the role of reporting on public services to the Oireachtas.  It can be done through an annual report which comes before the Oireachtas.  Equally, it can be done with special reports.</p> <p>  There are various reasons for that relationship but I just want to focus on several of them.  In the past and internationally, not every ombudsman recommendation was accepted or, if it was accepted, not every recommendation was implemented.  Ireland actually has one of the best records internationally on that count.  It was the Oireachtas that brought about the report, Lost at Sea, from one of my predecessors, Emily O'Reilly.  It was many years before the recommendations were ultimately accepted.  That is an important role.  It also helps the committee in its job of holding the Government to account, insofar as that is the role of the Oireachtas and its committees.  We give the committee evidence that adds to the picture it has of how well services are being delivered to people in the communities across Ireland.</p> <p>  On reporting in general, if I am reporting on an issue to do with health, I would expect the report to be considered by the health committee.  As Ms Justice Ring said, many of the reports from GSOC would go to the justice committee.  The reality is there are a lot of cross-cutting elements to reports.  The annual report in my office would in fact impact on many committees and Departments.  It is important there should be some locus for the engagement of the ombudsman community with the Oireachtas.  We believe the role played by the committee's predecessor is a good way of doing that.  We think too there is the possibility of developing that role further in order that a committee would look at whether Irish ombudsman legislation is fully compliant with the latest international standards and to propose changes if required.</p> <p>  I hope that sets out why we take our relationship with the committee as fundamental to the ombudsman institution but also to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I am looking forward to working closely with their offices.  It is to be hoped it will be as close as it was with the previous committee.  We are all here for the benefit of the public to improve things.</p><p>We will give people five minutes each if they indicate by raising their hands on their monitors.  Everybody should be able to get back in.  Before bringing other members in, I will ask a few questions.  How do the witnesses find the current arrangements where the sectoral committees have two months to consider the annual or special reports of the Ombudsman?  The Committee on Public Petitions considers reports not considered by the sectoral committee after two months.  Second, there is a provision in Standing Orders whereby the committee may refer a petition to the Ombudsman.  Do the witnesses think that referral could be a useful process?  Third, there is a provision in Standing Orders which says the committee will not accept petitions about the decisions of an ombudsman.  Do the witnesses have any views on this Standing Order?  Does it uphold the independence of the Ombudsman?  Last, what do the witnesses see as the essential difference between the role of the petitions committee and the role of the Ombudsman?  The staff of the Ombudsman and the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas are all civil servants.  It was suggested that the petitions committee usually looks at the general case or the public body while the Ombudsman usually looks at a particular case or cases.  Does Ms Justice Ring or Mr. Tyndall have an opinion on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.806" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021030900002#C00200"><p>I will start the ball rolling.  On the annual report, under the legislation we must have the annual report with the Minister by 31 March so we are working day and night at the moment.  Then it is a matter for the Department and the Minister to move it on.  In the past, we have had delays in that for whatever reason.  The danger is that the information we have put forward is out of date by the time it gets into the public arena.  That, in effect, makes the annual report less impactful.  The sooner the Department - whichever the Department supervising each ombudsman is - releases the report, the sooner it is available for public consumption, critique and information.  In terms of any statutory requirement, I would be anxious that the Department to which the report goes should move quickly.  We have noticed the Department has gotten better in that regard.  If there is a slippage, somebody should be in a position to shortly afterwards question the relevant Department on why it has not published the annual report.  I will let Mr. Tyndall take the question on referral to the Ombudsman and decisions of the Ombudsman.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.807" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr.  Peter Tyndall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021030900002#C00300"><p>The opportunity for the committee to refer cases to the Ombudsman is a helpful one.  Sometimes the cases would sit more easily in an investigative mode where somebody can look into the detail, check the files and so on.  It might be easier for my office, rather than a committee, to deal with such cases.  We have the opportunity, if a complaint is not made directly to us, to use own initiative powers to open a complaint.  That is a useful way of dealing with things.</p> <p>  Whatever has happened that caused an injustice to them, some people reach a point where no resolution is possible so they will come to my office, come to me as Information Commissioner or go to a variety of places.  Sometimes one can well understand why somebody is distressed and why they feel a sense of injustice but one can see that nobody has done anything wrong.  For example, we get a lot of farmers who are unhappy about changes to agricultural grants which cause people who had payments for many years to stop getting them.  It is because of changes to policy that this happens, and not because anybody is guilty of maladministration.  It is a tricky one.  It is helpful to give a sense of finality and the role of an ombudsman is to be the final stage in a complaint process or the petitions committee can fill that role.  It is not helpful to have cases shuttling between us.  We would be unlikely to accept a complaint the committee had considered.  Having the Standing Order is helpful in that way.</p> <p>  A way we could think about moving forward in terms of cases that cut across both of us is by having a memorandum of understanding between the committee and the relevant Ombudsman offices which sets out in some detail who would take which complaints or how we would interact over complaints.  If the committee thinks that is helpful, there are examples elsewhere we could provide to the committee as the basis for progress.  We could work with the clerks on that.</p></speech>

We are doing important work at the moment to finalise our terms of reference.  When we were last in public session, members of the committee sought a clarifying statement from the Chair regarding comments he made on Tipp FM.  We have not had that statement yet and I would like to take it up at the next opportunity when we are in public session but today I will focus on what we are here to do.  I will use my five minutes for a back-and-forth.</p> <p>  In relation to the submission that came in, there was talk of the lack of legal powers meaning that strong links to the Oireachtas were critical.  Will Ms Justice Ring give us an idea of how strong those links are today?  If we exclude 2020 from being an example year for reasons we know, is it correct to say that when Ms Justice Ring engages with the Oireachtas, she makes a formal request to the committee?  If so, has that ever been refused or has she ever encountered delays she considered unacceptable in dealing with the matter at hand?</p></speech>

That is, 2020 aside, a yearly appearance.  My relationship with the Committee on Public Petitions has been less frequent and, in my experience, it has been seeking clarity as to the role of the various ombudsmen <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the petitions committee.  Progress was made, the title was changed and it is moving forward.  I think I speak for all of us when I say we are happy to have a relationship with the petitions committee but we need to work out what the role is, having regard to our various statutory relationships with other committees, how we can bring value to the committee and how it can assist us in our work.</p></speech>

The suggestion of a memorandum of understanding is a good one and I would support that.  I was interested in some of the work we did in advance of this session.  There was a speech Mr. Tyndall made in 2015 in Turkey in which he made a point about "in exercising its role in considering petitions from members of the public the Committee [being our committee] will not accept petitions from members of the public about decisions already made by my Office."  Will Mr. Tyndall elaborate on that?  It suggests that where a citizen had their case dealt with by the ombudsperson and is not satisfied with the outcome, they would not be able to come to this committee, even though this committee would have oversight of the ombudspersons and their offices.</p></speech>

I know he has a particular interest in international matters because my colleague in Poland, Adam Bodnar, frequently mentions the Deputy's engagement with him.</p><p>I wanted to come back to the point I was making earlier about some sense of finality.  The Ombudsman is a quasi-judicial role.  Ordinarily, in a quasi-judicial role, the follow-up, if there is to be one, is about any matters of law that are subject to judicial review.  The sense that people can try to find different routes is not helpful.  There needs to be clarity and finality.  That is the role of this.  The purpose of a memorandum of understanding would be to make sure that appropriate complaints went to the appropriate place.</p></speech>

One of his comments was that the Ombudsman should be heard and respected, beyond party Whips, in the Oireachtas.  What does that mean with regard to oversight of legislation?  I have done much work on Whip reform myself and the strict whip system that we have in the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.814" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021030900002#D00300"><p>That is an interesting question.  It dates back to an issue that my predecessor had with the report that I mentioned, Lost At Sea, when the role of the Oireachtas as an independent body overseeing the Government was seen by the Ombudsman of the day to have been undermined by the use of the Whip system which, in that instance, prevented a debate about the report.  Different ombudsman offices internationally have different levels of access to parliaments.  Some get to speak in the plenary session of the parliament.  Obviously, that is not at all consistent with our tradition and would not be appropriate, but it would be appropriate for there to be some point at which there can be discussion.  In my tenure as Ombudsman, this has not been an issue.  The creation of the committee and its original mandate grew directly out of the Lost At Sea issue, when it was highlighted that there had to be some access.</p> <p>  It is reasonable for a Government, if it so chooses, to reject an Ombudsman's recommendations.  That is not something that happens regularly in Ireland, if at all, but there has to be some capacity for Parliament to scrutinise the Government's decision to ignore or reject the recommendation.  That is what failed before the creation of this committee and why we were a little concerned when the powers of the committee were somewhat reduced.  It was not that there was real and present danger.  The relationship between the various ombudsman offices and the public services in our jurisdiction is good and the Oireachtas has been good in the way that it has supported our recommendations.  I give the example of the Magdalen laundry redress scheme, where the Oireachtas played a critical part in making sure that the scheme was accessible to all those affected by their stays in the Magdalen laundries.  It is working well at present but it does not do to be complacent.  One has to have robust mechanisms if things are not working well.  That is why we were reinforcing these issues.</p></speech>

Regarding the power of the Ombudsman, I was a member of this committee in the previous D&aacute;il and we received petitions which might cross over three Departments.  Sometimes the petition would be referred to the three Departments and we might get one reply, then we do not know what ombudsman we are going to.  Is there a system which we can tweak so that we can be more prudent?  As Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring was saying, it is about producing something similar to the report.  People do not realise how busy this committee can actually be.  Much of it is important.  We need a system where we can join up with the Ombudsman and the Department and convey that urgency so that we can get our replies faster and get them to the petitioners.  Is there anywhere in a memorandum or the rules where we can set out our rules and state how we will do things from now on, which people which then be bound by?  It would make it more efficient for all of us because it can be frustrating.</p> <p>  In this current climate, it is probably even more frustrating because getting information seems to have slowed down, and people outside this House are getting more frustrated and demanding.  They want the answers yesterday but the way the process works makes it difficult.  If we had a set of rules stating what the process is, at least one could go back to a constituent or petitioner and apologise if it is not going fast enough, but say that these are the rules and regulations.  We would cover ourselves as well as everybody else.  It would set out that from now on, things will not get lost on a shelf and have somebody ask where his or her reply is four months later.  Is there some way to have that?</p></speech>

I have a couple of points on that.  One of the things that an ombudsman will try to do is to make sure that where the answer is not going to be helpful to a person, the person should not have to wait a long time for it.  If a complaint has come to us more than a year after the incident, that falls outside our jurisdiction.  We do not want somebody to wait for four months to be told that.  Trying to establish a set of criteria to determine which are acceptable or not and which one can or cannot deal with, and making a decision quickly, is quite important.  That process should be built in to the systems.</p> <p>  Regarding responses from Departments, these are strange times.  In all of the different ombudsman legislation, there are requirements for co-operation from the bodies in our jurisdiction.  The guards, for example, have to respond within a set time.  A Department or local authority needs to respond to me within a set timeframe.  The committee probably needs to find a way to establish a timeframe for itself.  We have had to cut the HSE and the Department of Health some slack.  I was talking to the complaints office at the HSE yesterday in a video call.  It is trying to get an answer from a consultant about what happened in a particular incident.  That consultant is up to their eyes dealing with Covid at present.  If one knows that something is going to take a long time, one needs to tell people early that it will take a long time, and then they will be more prepared.  If people are expecting a reply tomorrow and it does not come until next week, they will be upset, but if one tells them that it is not coming for three months, they will be delighted if it turns up in two months.  One should try to create a sense of expectation.</p><p>The committee members and the committee clerks will know how long it typically takes to deal with things.  Giving advice on that is helpful.  Many of us publish on our websites information about particular kinds of complaints, which says that if they are complicated they take a long time typically.</p><p> I hope these are some helpful suggestions around how the committee perhaps provides information to members of the public who might approach the committee.</p></speech>

That is a challenge.  It is kept under review and it also has to go with the flow.  At the moment the expectations have to be looked at in the light of Covid.  Hopefully in the not too distant future that Covid light will be diminished.  Certainly that is our challenge on a day-to-day basis.  Perhaps something like a memorandum of understanding would help us and the committee to develop that clarity of purpose and expectation, for ourselves in our own interaction and also, ultimately, for the public.</p></speech>

Hopefully, within a short distance over the summer and perhaps into the autumn things will start to speed up.</p></speech>

It is good to have them back with us.  I join with Deputy Murphy in asking that the Chairman would bring clarity to the communication piece that he said he would address prior to our last meeting, which has not yet been done and which I believe he has a duty to do.  As Deputy Murphy has said, we will not do it today because we have very important work.</p><p>In the context of Mr. Tyndall's last remarks on Covid-19, how is the resource situation for ombudspersons with regard to their work?  Given the importance of electronic tools and social media for communication, and notwithstanding that traditional forms of participation are kept open, what is the position with resources?</p><p>Deputy Murphy referred to the paper given by Mr. Tyndall in Turkey in 2015 where he spoke about laying the special report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Mr. Tyndall said that the Ombudsman legislation does not specify what action, if any, the Houses of the Oireachtas may take following receipt of a special report.  In the context of our commentary around a memorandum of understanding what do the witnesses believe would be the appropriate response we should give?  As a former chairman of a committee, is there merit in the ombudspersons appearing before the committee on a quarterly basis, as the HSE chief executive or the Minister do in the health committee?  I am open to having a debate about this.  Should there be an avenue such as a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas where the forum could present its annual report or its special report?  I am aware that the Venice Principles talk of the importance of not damaging the role of the ombudsperson and that there should be no withdrawal of services.  Under the Venice Principles around maladministration and the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, have there been petitions or requests from members of the public<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the temporary restrictions of rights of people in the context of Covid-19?</p></speech>

Ms Justice Ring will probably want to talk about the impact on the work of her office because it has been different for each of our offices.  My office has what are known as "soft" phones, which essentially means that all of our phone lines can work from people's homes and we do not have to have people in the office to take phone calls on any of our numbers.  Equally, we have the capacity to take complaints by email.  We have a very well-used Twitter account where people approach us about complaints.  We tend to direct them either to the phone or to the e-form on our website.  We can take complaints in any number of formats.  That has not changed.</p> <p>  We found there was a dip in complaint numbers initially but it picked up again.  We have been able to deal with complaints more or less as efficiently as we had done when we were in the office.  There are two changes that are important.  One is that a lot of our work was outreach work.  Every month we would have somebody in the citizens information centres in Cork, Galway and Limerick and people used that service.  Some people liked to bring a file to us there or liked to come and talk to someone.  Clearly we also had some business with people just coming into the main office in Dublin.  We also had an extensive outreach programme with direct provision centres.  We were about to introduce a similar programme for nursing homes.  Where we have seen a reduction in complaints it is significant that the reduction in complaints has been in that outreach.  We have had fewer complaints, for example, about direct provision.  We have tried to provide outreach virtually.  We have arranged for a room to be provided in direct provision centres where people can come to talk to us without being overseen by the staff in the centres.  The reality was that a lot of the work we did in those centres was informal.  A lot of the time a person might say "I cannot get a particular meal choice that suits my culture" and so on.  We would just deal with it there and then.  It did not show up in the formal complaints statistics but it was helping to make life better for people.</p> <p>  We have had specific complaints on the post-Covid situation.  People first must complain to the body concerned.  We have complaints at the moment such as visiting rights in nursing homes, as one would expect.  We had a lot of complaints early on about the pandemic unemployment payment, just as it was settling down.  We had very good co-operation with the Department and were able to resolve those quite quickly for people in general.  If they were entitled to payments we made sure that they got them.  There was confusion early on about the appeals mechanism but once that was properly put in place by the Department then the number of complaints coming to us reduced.  We have also had to look at complaints about the leaving certificate calculated grades.</p> <p>  It has been different.  People continue to complain to us.  One of the things I always emphasise at committees is the role of Members of the Oireachtas in bringing complaints to my office.  Many Members are very active in supporting constituents to complain.  That is a very helpful route for us to make sure that things find their way to us that ought to.</p> <p>  In resource terms, not every office was the same.  I am aware, for instance, that some of the offices have had to do things such as going in to listen to messages on answering machines because they were not able to divert their phones to people working at home.  Some of us have had more challenges than others but it seems to me that everyone has risen to the challenge.  They are all continuing to work and continuing to have an impact on improving the services they deal with.  </p></speech>

We were lucky that we were in a position to provide our staff with the means to work from home electronically very quickly.  As a result of having investigative staff, a number of people already had tablets and laptops before Covid hit.  Therefore, we have been able to meet the challenge by working both in the office and remotely.  Our investigators have met with witnesses, complainants and garda&iacute; throughout, in a socially distant and Covid-appropriate way.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the number of complaints and queries made in 2020 increased.  There continued to be complaints about Garda presence because there was perhaps more interaction at check points or queries were made about where people were <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>where their home was but, in fact, the increase was not down to Covid as such.  Perhaps people have the ability and time to go online and discover they can make a complaint to various bodies via electronic means and the Internet.  Therefore, complaints for 2020 increased.  While we were getting complaints about Garda operational events, the complaint increase was not solely due to that.</p></speech>

We have been keeping a running total and I will get my up-to-date numbers.  However, many of the complaints were about the measurement of 5 km.  For example, my idea of 5 km and that of the Senator might be a bit elastic.  Similarly, with essential purposes, what I think is essential might not be the same as the Senator.  Therefore, many complaints were matters which did not necessarily lead to investigations.  I must say that we received many compliments, as well as complaints, in terms of interactions with the Garda, both at checkpoints, but also generally in the community.  We have kept those separate and I will come back to the Senator with the exact numbers for the year, as of yesterday.</p> <p>  We have been able to meet the challenges and move forward but, of course, there have been new matters that would not have been anticipated, even this time last year.  It has been an interesting year.  Obviously, when members of the public feel aggrieved and go to an ombudsman office, delays are challenging, because they feel that they are not being treated well, or heard.  When delays in responding are explained to them, they may understand it, but it still does not necessarily help with their grievance.  Therefore, managing complainants across the ombudsman community over the last year has been a new dimension to the work we do.  </p> <p>  On the issue of quarterly meetings, that is a great idea.  As soon as we can work out our relationship with the committee, that would not be a difficulty.</p></speech>

For me, the Irish Ombudsman Forum is an organisation with which I am newly familiar, so I read with interest the witnesses' correspondence to the committee.</p><p>I have a number of questions.  First and foremost, I am interested in the number of cases that the ombudsman offices are dealing with on an annual basis.  Ms Justice Ring said that 2020 was busier.  Perhaps she could furnish the committee with more up-to-date information after the meeting.</p><p>The Office of the Ombudsman was established in 1984.  Obviously, this committee is new but from 1984, what has the organisation's engagement with the Oireachtas been on annual basis, be it through annual reports or otherwise?  Has engagement been very <i>ad hoc</i>?  I note from Mr. Tyndall's remarks in September 2015 that from around 2002, engagement with the Oireachtas seemed to improve and become more formal.  Today's step is most welcome, and it is great to formalise our relationship with the ombudsman offices.  However, the MOU suggestion made by the witnesses is a very good one.  </p><p>I am thinking about the expansion of this committee and, specifically, public petitions and those coming to us with their concerns, and, equally, others who approach the various ombudsman offices.  How does that aspect fit into it?  Obviously, an MOU is going to have to cover the approach to be taken if the relevant ombudsman office has dealt with a particular issue.  Likewise, if the committee has dealt with an issue, the relevant office will not deal with it.  I understand that.  If we are going to go down that road, perhaps the name of the committee needs to be amended to ensure there is a formal recognition of our relationship with the Irish Ombudsman Forum.  Maybe that is a discussion for another day.  However, I certainly think an MOU is essential because I can think of several different elements to it, where the committee's work could really be blown out of proportion.  How we go about that must be defined.  It is a discussion that we have had as a committee.</p><p>I am going to quote from the correspondence the Irish Ombudsman Forum sent to the committee which states: &quot;The Forum has also consistently argued for a single Committee to have an oversight of Ombudsman activity&quot;.  That is where we are headed today and it is to be welcomed.  Given the new nature of this committee, I ask Mr. Tyndall to describe the engagement of the ombudsman offices with the Oireachtas heretofore.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.832" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021030900002#F00900"><p>The engagement with the Oireachtas in recent years has been good.  By and large, ombudsman offices have had access to committees, as and when we have needed them.  That has varied.  As we outlined, some of the matters are very appropriate to the remit of certain committees.  Generally, whatever the issue, my office has not experienced difficulty in engaging with the relevant committee.  As stated by Ms Justice Ring, it is also the case for GSOC.  Each of the offices, for instance, An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, has a good ongoing relationship with the relevant committee.  The Office of the Children's Ombudsman also has very strong links with the relevant committee.</p> <p>  Access in recent years has been good, so we are not complaining about that.  What we are saying in particular, as I stated in my earlier remarks, is that we need to be cautious that we do not become complacent because previously, when there was no formal basis for the engagement, it eventually went wrong when a committee was put in place with a specific locus to look at things that were not happening.  It is worth saying that while recommendations are generally accepted, I suspect that a committee would also be interested in whether or not those recommendations have actually been implemented, and how well and how quickly they have been implemented.</p><p>It is one thing to say we agree with that, but another entirely to make it happen.  There is a role for a committee in having that oversight.</p><p> To come back to the point I made earlier, there is no locus within the Oireachtas at the moment for oversight of the legislation governing the ombudsman offices.  That was one of the things we were anxious to do, to see how this whole piece is working out.  Are there things we need to do as a country to improve that?  For instance, can we borrow from others who have had more recent experience in upgrading legislation?  Those are some of the issues.</p><p> I emphasise we are not coming from a position where we had great difficulties in gaining access to committees.  That is a historical problem.  However, we want to see enshrined within the committee structure some protection for access, so there is a right of access.  I come back to Senator Buttimer's comments that there is regularity to that access and a regular ongoing engagement.  If it is dull, because everything is going smoothly, then we can keep it fairly brief and everybody can be happy.  If it is not going smoothly, then there is a forum where any issues can be addressed.</p></speech>

That perhaps encompassed the role we are looking for in very succinct terminology.  I urge the committee to look at the report of 21 January 2016 because some of these issues were debated by the then committee.  Many of the recommendations and conclusions, five years down the road, are still good recommendations and conclusions.  Why reinvent the wheel if that work is done?</p></speech>

I thank Ms Justice Ring.  Principle 20 states the Ombudsman shall report to Parliament on the activities of the institution at least once a year.  Is that done via committees the witnesses are linked with currently?  Would it assist them if such a link existed with this committee to discuss the annual report or activities for the year?</p></speech>

Although it is done on an annual basis, life and politics being what they are, it could slip.  It would be nice if somebody was minding us, to make sure that if there was slippage, for whatever reason, a team would come in to remind us and our partner Department that this slippage was occurring.  It would keep us all straight.</p></speech>

The principles are very clear that the reporting arrangement between an ombudsman covering the public services, which includes GSOC, should be to Parliament.  If there is a review of legislation, that is something I suspect will need some scrutiny.  The annual report should, preferably, be laid before Parliament, or the Oireachtas, and then discussed in committee.  It does not have to be in plenary session.  However, it is very important, as Ms Justice Ring said, that reports come out in a timely fashion, because the learning from them is often critical.</p></speech>

I also thank all the Senators and Deputies who contributed.  I am a new committee member and I am learning quite a bit about this space as we go, although I do not think we have not sat publicly.</p> <p>  Ms Justice Ring makes a very important and timely point about the membership and gender of the committee.  That is something we need to reflect on.  If we are to embrace the narrative in this discussion, I support addressing the name of the committee.  It is important that people understand our job and what we are doing, as is agreed among everyone.  It is a question for the committee to ask itself.  However, in the event we are dealing with a report or something not yet dealt with by another committee, would the secretarial assistance or expertise to deal with the substance of those reports be available to us?  One of the issues in getting public time is that we share a secretariat.  These are probably internal issues that the witnesses may or may not want to comment on.</p> <p>  Are there any legacy reports that need to be dealt with?  How far back might we need to go?  Are there any ombudsman offices that do not deal with a particular committee?  Is there a body of work we would naturally have to deal with as a starting point?  We talked about the name of our committee and public understanding of the Ombudsman's office.  I have always wondered, and this is a personal observation and question for the witnesses, if there is any merit in changing the Ombudsman's name to something simpler.  It is an imported, Swedish name.  It is gender neutral in Swedish and gender neutral in English, arguably.  We also have An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  We have precedence for changing the name and I wonder is there any merit in that?  I thank the witnesses.  It has been very informative.  I look forward to working on this committee and to the witnesses' response.</p></speech>

He will have noticed I am the only female who signed the letter; somebody is perhaps taking the Ombudsman's role too literally.  I would obviously like to see how we could deal with that, going forward.  There have been attempts to shorten and neutralise it but, on a serious note, the role of an ombudsman is an important one in a democratic society.  It is important, however, that we look at it, to hold firm on the role of an ombudsman.  Looking at the people who have signed the letter, there is a broad sweep of mandates and it is up to each of them to educate the public, and the committee, as to the scope or limitations of each of their roles.  I am sure that can be done with a more regular relationship with the committee.</p> <p>  It is an area which is fraught in how we all move forward.  For instance, it is not a state secret that there will be legislation, in the next number of uncertain months, on policing.  Part of the matters under review will be the oversight for policing.  If there is a proposal for an ombudsman, it will be important, whether in policing legislation and proposals or in any other proposals for reviewing or introducing an ombudsman, that a committee such as this looks critically at legislative proposals on the issue.</p><p>Is the proposed new ombudsman coming within the terms of the Venice Commission proposals?  Is the new ombudsman being properly resourced, both financially and in terms of personnel?  Will the proposed ombudsman have a clear channel of dialogue and answerability to a particular Department, or Departments, as the case may be?  Where new legislation brings in proposals about an ombudsman and the role of an ombudsman, I could see a committee such as this being able to focus in, look critically at the legislative proposals on those issues and bring forward to their colleagues suggestions, amendments and talking points that would allow for a more consistent approach to the introduction of a revised or new ombudsman.  Mr. Tyndall might want to add to that.</p></speech>

It is important, if we are to develop further offices, that they are consistent with what is now an international set of principles.  It is a way of looking at things from that perspective.</p> <p>  The other point about what there is in terms of legacy is a very interesting one.  I suspect that each of us, were we asked, and even if we do not have recommendations that have not been accepted, could go back and identify recommendations that have never been implemented.  The ones that come to the front of my mind actually pre-date me.  They are to do with disability transport schemes which were the subject of a report by my predecessor and which many of the members will have written to me about in respect of the unhappiness of their constituents.  There are issues.  I am sure, if the committee were to have regular meetings, it would be very helpful if we were to be asked to prepare lists of recommendations that either have not been accepted or have not yet been implemented.  That would provide a useful basis for scrutiny.</p></speech>

Is that something, if there were new legislation, for instance, that should be allowed to continue?  We have a very short list of statutory recommendations we have made since 2005, and despite not having the power, we have made recommendations to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about practice and procedure over the years.  Because it has no statutory force, however, the Garda can, and has, ignored those recommendations.  It is entitled to.  If recommendations are something the committee sees as important, then it should scrutinise any new legislation to see if the proposed legislation has included that right for a new ombudsman or a revised ombudsman.</p></speech>

We take note of that and the committee secretariat might take note of that as well.</p> <p>  The issue of titles would be an issue for the Oireachtas.  Does that mean the forum does not have a formal view in terms of streamlining titles for ombudspeople?  Is that a yes?  There is no formal view.  Do people understand what an ombudsperson does and is it an accessible title?  I obviously wonder about the gender neutral issue.  Primarily, is it an accessible title and do people understand what the office does?  It would help in terms of accessibility if there were a streamlining of the title but that is a personal view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.844" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021030900002#H00500"><p>It is a global brand of course that has been around for more than 200 years so it does have a certain impact.  One of the things we often say is that the important thing is that people know how to find us when they need us.  The critical thing is that bodies dealing with complaints signpost members of the public to our offices.  That is something we put a lot of effort into.  For instance, I have recently agreed revised wording which all local authorities will use in letters when they receive complaints.  In some ways, having a high public profile is helpful.  It obviously attracts people to the office.  Equally, even if we do not have such a profile, either through outreach or through signposting, it is essential people know how to find us.  That is the critically important bit of it.</p> <p>  Coming back to the point about outreach, one thing Covid has taught me is that if a body is going to make itself accessible to groups of people who are less likely to be aware of the brand, the office and the work, then it must get out and talk to people to a much greater extent.  We engage a lot with NGOs and we also provide regular training to staff of Citizens Information centres on the work of the offices so they can help people bring complaints.  I mentioned about the role of Members of the Oireachtas in helping people to bring complaints to the offices.  All of those elements help, but in the case of, for instance, people who are in prison, who are detained in mental health facilities, or who come to the State as asylum seekers and refugees and who may not have English as a first language, for us to sit in our offices and wait for them to come to us does not work.  It comes back to the issue of resources.  We need to rethink the model to the extent we extend our outreach to make sure we reach the groups of people who are often most dependent on public services and who are possibly least likely to be well placed to complain.  That is an answer to a slightly different question but it is an important development we need to build on in the years ahead.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is because they had an engagement in their country of origin, as they sometimes call it, with an ombudsman's office.  Even though their first language may not be English, they recognise the ombudsman from their national experience.  There is a lot to be said about the fact it is an international brand as we become a more international outward-looking country in that regard.</p></speech>

That will only bring so much.  With all the new technologies, the likes of computers, phones and through social media, and this is in the forum report, could they be used and would they speed up things in getting information out to the public, both bringing in petitions and getting replies back out?</p> <p>  On the last point, resources are needed.  I do not know whether it is us or the ombudsman's office that needs to get promotional material in different languages out to the main immigrant communities that have come into the country in recent years.</p><p>What feelings have the witnesses about using the smart technology in the report?  There is mention of greater visibility and closer contact with the citizens.  Could we use that kind of technology?</p></speech>

We could use it more.  Ombudsman offices have all gone online and into social media to a much greater extent in recent years, as I have said.  We try to encourage people to use the web form as the principal means of submitting complaints.  We always need to be aware there are plenty of people out there who prefer to write or speak on the phone, so these processes cannot be used instead of the old methods.  We are working on our web form currently to make it more accessible and to give more interaction with people complaining.  For example, if they are trying to complain about a particular local authority service, it would bring up information about what we can and cannot do with claims about the service or it would signpost people elsewhere.  As I have said, Twitter has been a good platform for us and many people have reached us on that.</p> <p>  Interestingly, in developing countries and certainly in Africa, the ombudsman community relies very heavily on mobile phones because it is one of the few means of communication that is pretty universal.  They use those processes a lot in some countries, and sometimes in a more sophisticated way than we do.  We have been slow and there are challenges in giving people information about the status of a complaint via the website.  We do that via email but it can be helpful for people to be able to log on without needing interaction with us.  It is an area we can certainly improve.  It is very clear the digital native generation we have now will not thank us for sending them forms and asking them to fill them in with pen and paper.  For many of them, the last time they used pen and paper was when they did their leaving certificate.  People expect to be able to interact with us in different ways.</p> <p>  One of the strange outcomes of Covid-19 is that we always thought going paper free would be a great challenge.  We are used to dealing with large paper files, both those generated ourselves and those sent to us by public bodies.  Suddenly nearly everything is online and the challenge turned out to be entirely overcome because of the circumstances.  We see more developments in that direction as we go along.</p></speech>

That is clearly the way forward.  We also have provision for a number of languages available when making a complaint because we have seen an increase in that regard.  It is a challenge.</p> <p>  All ombudsman offices, no more than any public body, need an IT section that is capable of meeting challenges and keeping the organisation ahead of the posse, so to speak.  As Mr. Tyndall has mentioned, the past 12 months have done away with much old practice that we thought we could never eliminate.  It also means we must be able to pivot properly and have the capability to back up changes with an IT section, including, for example, somebody to maintain the Twitter feed or keep the website up to date.  In fairness, not every ombudsman office has that capacity.  Perhaps having a body like the committee where such matters can be discussed and concerns may be relayed to the Departments responsible for justice and children matters, for example, is required so we can have the support of people understanding the importance of all ombudsman offices being able to interact with the public in the new ways we all meet every day.</p></speech>

We try to ensure we are accessible.  We can accept complaints in any language and we have access to translation services if needed to deal with that.</p> <p>  One of the sad casualties of the Covid-19 crisis is we were looking at taking on board two interns from the Polish ombudsman office to work with us in Dublin because the Polish community is clearly one of the largest communities in the State.  Unfortunately, that initiative was a casualty of Covid-19.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.853" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1554" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021030900002#J00600"><p>I thank our two witnesses and I have two quick questions.  It sounds from Ms Justice Ring's comments that we may be getting a request for additional resources for some offices.  We may be a helpful channel in getting those resources where they are needed.  The point is well made, and if people are to interact through online communications, the offices need to have the supports to back up such processes and deal with them correctly.</p> <p>  Throughout the course of this meeting there has been a good case made for us to retake an official direct role and responsibility relating to the various ombudsperson offices.  It was well made before this session but this has clarified why it is necessary.  With the six offices there, just dealing with annual reports would probably be a quarter of our work programme if we decided to take that on.  There is also the role of scrutinising legislation, and it is a good idea for us to do that if we are to do this properly.</p> <p>  Mr. Tyndall has touched on another element and I will ask him to elaborate on it.  He mentioned that more oversight of international ombudspersons is required.  How does he see that being done with regard to this committee?  The accountability of European institutions to this Oireachtas in the past has been quite poor.  I am thinking of the banking inquiry and the refusal of certain persons to attend it.  How would interaction take place with the European Ombudsman, for example, if that is what Mr. Tyndall meant?</p></speech>

I obviously did but I may have misled the Deputy.  My issue was around international standards.  The current European Ombudsman is my predecessor as Ombudsman here in Ireland, Ms Emily O'Reilly.  I am sure the European Ombudsman would be happy to speak about her work to the committee and, of course, some of the matters would be of great interest to people in Ireland.  As the Deputy is probably aware, she is currently scrutinising the EU's response to Covid-19, including the availability of vaccines.  These are of great interest to the Oireachtas and not just to the European Parliament, and it is something the committee might explore.  I am sure there is no way the committee could require the European Ombudsman to attend, but on the other hand I am sure she would be interested in speaking about the work as much of it has a relevant dimension.</p></speech>

Mr. Tyndall indicates there is no legal requirement and we cannot write in such a legal requirement in the Oireachtas.  I apologise if Mr. Tyndall did not say exactly what I thought - I had taken it down - but it would be a welcome intervention for us to have greater scrutiny of the European Ombudsman, for example, and not just on the vaccination roll-out.  It is clearly very important and we care about it in Ireland but there are other issues to consider as well.</p></speech>

From a cursory glance at the @OfficeOmbudsman handle on Twitter, and my poor operation of Twitter, it is difficult to find.  Has he considered changing the name on Twitter?</p> <p>  I join with Ms Justice Ring in commending the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the courtesy they have shown at checkpoints, and I have met them in the course of my work as I travelled to and from Dublin, in particular.  They have been very courteous and understanding in dealing with me and other people for which I thank them.  Let me add that the garda&iacute; have had to work in very inclement weather.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy made a point about the six ombudspersons' offices and annual reports.  I have a view, which I shared at the last committee, that we should be the lead committee to deal with all, collectively and individually, of the ombudsmen's offices and that we should give Mr. Tyndall's office star billing, which is a term I hate to use.  I mean he should be central to our committee's work because we can play a pivotal role with him in promulgating and highlighting his work.  We can also be a voice for the under-represented, which is part of what we should do as the Committee on Public Petitions.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy also mentioned the vaccination programme and the EU ombudsperson.  It would be fantastic if we could have that interaction because it would help us and illuminate a lot of information from this committee into the general public around vaccination and the work of the EU.  Prior to this meeting we got a very interesting paper from Mr. Tiago Tiburcio, who is a researcher in the University of Lisbon, on the role of ombudsmen and petition committees in detecting breaches of EU law.  Leaving the last part aside, I would like if we could meet Mr. Tyndall again on a further date to explore how we can work in terms of EU law and greater visibility.  I thank the delegation for today.  </p></speech>

However, as I say, there will be issues there.</p> <p>  I want to make one point.  Particularly from our perspective, it is the public service ombudsmen who need to have the relationship with the committee so that is five rather than six.  The Financial Services Ombudsman is a proper ombudsman role but the bodies in its jurisdiction are not public bodies.  So probably, if I did not say something, Mr. Deering would be cross with me for not doing so.  I just wanted to point out that specifically.  </p></speech>

I realise that this is very difficult during level 5 restrictions but I would like the committee to be able to accept new petitions as soon as possible while negating the risks of the new variants of Covid-19 to the members, witnesses and staff.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The committee is adjourned until Thursday, 11 March 2021 at 10 a.m. for a virtual private meeting on Microsoft Teams.  If members stay on the line we will try to have a private meeting.</p> <p>  Finally, I again thank Ms Justice Ring and Mr. Peter Tyndall for attending today.  </p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss "Nothing about us without us - achieving equal rights and equity for women with disabilities" and to celebrate women with disabilities in the context of International Women's Day, which took place yesterday.  We recognise that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple forms of discrimination and that positive measures need to be taken to ensure they are protected against multiple forms of discrimination and can enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms on a basis equal with that of other citizens, which is called for by Article 6 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.</p> <p>  The committee recognises the scale of the work ahead and that the rights of women and girls with disabilities must be included in all actions aimed at implementing the UN xonvention.  It has been pointed out over the past 48 hours that 25% of women with disabilities in our country live in poverty.  As a committee, we should strive to do whatever we can to advance the causes of all people with disabilities and in particular women.  One quarter of women with disabilities live in poverty, which is a frightening statistic that we should bear in mind at all times.</p> <p>  On my own behalf and on that of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to Ms Catherine Lane, women in local, community and rural development officer at the National Women's Council of Ireland; and to Ms Maureen McGovern, disability community activist, and Ms Selina Bonnie, vice chairperson of the Independent Living Movement Ireland, who are appearing on behalf of the National Women's Council.  I also welcome Ms Amy Hassett and Ms Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta, co-directors of Disabled Women Ireland.</p> <p>  I remind members that they are allowed to participate in this meeting only if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask that those who are joining us remotely confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making a contribution to the meeting.  A good number of members have joined us for the meeting in the D&aacute;il Chamber and I welcome them.</p> <p>  For the information of anyone watching the meeting online, I point out that witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances, I ask everybody to bear with us should any technical matters arise, which they do from time to time.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I draw the attention of members and witnesses to the issue of parliamentary privilege.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts should note that the constitutional protection afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from other jurisdictions should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise nor make charges against a person or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Lane of the National Women's Council of Ireland to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

We highlight the need for other Oireachtas committees to have dedicated sessions on the impact of Covid-19 on all women.</p> <p>  The National Women's Council is Ireland&rsquo;s leading women&rsquo;s representative organisation.  We seek full equality for all women and draw our mandate from a membership of more than 190 groups and organisations from a diversity of backgrounds, sectors and locations.  We have been working collectively with disabled women since March last year on many equality issues, such as inclusion and the visibility of disabled women and their experiences across the work of our organisation and also within the wider women&rsquo;s movement.  We felt it was important that today, two disabled women from the group and representing our group member the Independent Living Movement Ireland, Maureen McGovern and Selina Bonnie, would address the committee directly.  We also look forward to listening to Amy Hassett and Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta from Disabled Women Ireland.</p> <p>  We look forward to engaging with and further supporting the work of the committee in any way we can and wish all members a happy International Women's Day.</p></speech>

I have been a strong activist for the human rights of disabled people at local level for most of my life.  My work is informed by the issues of concern to me as a disabled woman and member of the local non-governmental organisation, NGO, Disability Action Collective, in the Ballyfermot and Chapelizod area, which has the largest population of disabled people in an urban setting at 20%.</p> <p>  My work is underpinned by an understanding of the social model of disability.  This model indicates that disability is caused by the way society is organised rather than by a person's impairment.  It looks at ways of removing barriers that restrict life choices for disabled people.  I also work from a disability equality perspective.  This is a belief that I, or we as disabled people, should enjoy equal rights and opportunities to participate in economic, social and cultural life, have choice and control over how we live our lives and are enabled to reach our full potential.</p> <p>  As a disabled woman who has experienced sexual violence over a long period, I did not get the same supports that a non-disabled woman would have at that particular time.  We have made a small bit of progress in this area but for all disabled women to live free from violence, more action is urgency required.  After years of working really hard to get an understanding of the issue, I believe the following:</p> <p>  Disabled women are not visible in the wider response to violence against women.  Data on disabled women do not always exist but the following statistics highlight disabled women&rsquo;s increased vulnerability to violence.  The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, in an EU-wide survey in 2014, found 34% of women with a health problem or disability have experienced physical or sexual partner violence, compared with 19% of women who do not have a health problem or disability.  Recent research from NUI Galway found that disabled women are more likely to experience violence, with 40% of disabled female students reporting experience of rape, compared with 27% of non-disabled students.</p> <p>  More resources are needed to ensure access to support for disabled women across the country.  It is vital they know that supports exist and that our safety is paramount, particularly during this public health crisis.  Alongside this, disabled survivors of abuse should be involved in designing better support and accessible awareness raising campaigning.  For example, there should be more visibility of disabled women in the "no more excuses" campaigns.  We know home is not a safe place for many women.</p> <p>  More research is needed to understand the dynamics of domestic abuse and institutional abuse and to ensure legislation adequately protects all women.  Disabled women living in congregated or institutional settings or with families may find accessing specialist support agencies difficult due to a lack of privacy or access to digital devices.  The Second National Strategy on Domestic Sexual and Gender-Based Violence 2016-2021 has no targeted interventions with disabled women and we urgently need consistent and quality data on disabled women&rsquo;s experiences of gender and sexual-based violence.</p> <p>  Disabled women are under-represented across all levels of leadership in public and political life.  We do not have an identified disabled woman representative in the Oireachtas and there is only one disabled woman councillor in local government.  As a disabled woman who is very active in my local community, I often feel my voice is not listened to due to my impairment and gender, which affects my mental health greatly.  I am not the only disabled woman who has been subject to this experience and this affects disabled women across the country fighting for the rights of disabled women to fully participate for change at local level.</p> <p>  We call on the committee and the Government to seek the input of disabled people&rsquo;s organisations, including disabled women&rsquo;s organisations locally and nationally, in all policies that affect disabled people.  As disabled women, we want to see the full realisation of the rights of disabled women, as set out in the UNCRPD.  The State must take the necessary steps to ensure that all disabled women can fully realise their social, cultural, political and economic rights.  I look forward to engaging with the work of the committee further and wish you all a very happy international women&rsquo;s week.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the opportunity to share my experiences and observations regarding reproductive justice, particularly for disabled women in 21st-century Ireland.  I am here not only as a member of the National Women's Council disabled women&rsquo;s group and vice chair of Independent Living Movement Ireland but also as a survivor of Irish assisted human reproductive services and a regional ambassador for the NUIG Centre for Disability Law and Policy Re(al) Productive Justice initiative.  I thank Dr. &Aacute;ine Sperrin from Galway for her support with my statement.</p> <p>  I speak to the committee as a disabled woman and not a woman with a disability.  This fundamental social rights-based definition underpins my statement and my life.  According to the 2016 census, the total number of disabled persons in Ireland was 643,131, or 13.5% of population.  Almost half are disabled women.  However, little attention has been paid to the specific experiences and needs of disabled women in Ireland.  For example, 63.7% of disabled women are mothers and yet disabled women are not mentioned in our current maternity strategy.</p> <p>  I will focus on two key issues of reproductive justice: assisted human reproduction and disabled women&rsquo;s access to essential health services.  Reproductive justice is the ability to make decisions and have choices respected around becoming a parent or not.  This includes fertility, contraception, including assisted human reproduction, abortion, pregnancy, birth and parenting, including fostering and adoption.  The Re(al) Productive Justice project has identified discrimination for disabled people on these issues in many forms.  These include physical infrastructure where reproductive health and parenting services are delivered being inaccessible; historic and contemporary use of long-term contraceptives without informed consent; ableist attitudes across assisted human reproduction, maternity and parenting service staff; a lack of accessible information across all stages of reproductive decision making; a gap in knowledge among health professionals about the support needs of disabled people accessing reproductive services; increased interventions and monitoring of disabled parents that is disproportionate to non-disabled parents; and a lack of uniformity about the use and quality of parental capacity assessments.  There is also a gap in data about the provision of reproductive services to disabled people, particularly with the new framework for abortion services.  Finally, the current legal capacity framework and delay in full realisation of the UNCRPD contributes to violations in this part of disabled persons' lives.</p><p> Disabled people with genetic and-or hereditary impairments, particularly disabled women as the female body is the primary site of most assisted human reproduction treatments, often meet significant resistance from the medical profession when attempting to access assisted fertility services.  I have experienced this discrimination.  Based on my personal experience and as an activist and academic in the area of reproductive justice, I have significant concerns about the general scheme of the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017 and its potential negative impact on the rights of disabled people to access assisted human reproduction services.</p><p> My main areas of concerns are head 7, which deals with the welfare of the child, and head 30, which deals with pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, PGD.  For brevity, rather than detailing my concerns now, I have included them as an appendix to my written statement.  However, my urgent concern is that there is a glaring absence of the voices and experiences of people identifying as disabled in the public meeting list of witnesses and the 31 written submissions to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill.  This situation must be rectified before the Bill progresses. </p><p> Due to accessibility issues and lack of universal design in mainstream services, disabled women often experience poorer access to health and social services.  Disabled women experience barriers to accessing health screening services, resulting in lower uptake of breast and cervical cancer screening.  Qualitative and quantitative data are not collected based on disability and it is essential that this be addressed to enable future planning of services so that they will be more accessible and inclusive.  Qualitative data are particularly essential as often the lived experience can radically demonstrate where services that appear inclusive and accessible on paper are failing.  For example, I have heard countless accounts from fellow disabled women of how the services are failing them.</p><p> Depending on the equipment available in individual surgeries and the location of colposcopy clinics, many disabled women are faced with significant travel to access services that meet their individual support needs.  Often, the ability of disabled women to access these essential services will depend on accessible transport and an allocation of sufficient personal assistance hours or appropriate Irish Sign Language, ISL, interpretation.  In addition to physical and information access issues, attitudes also have a significant impact.  For example, the CervicalCheck women&rsquo;s charter informs disabled service users: &ldquo;If you have special needs and require assistance in accessing the programme, CervicalCheck will support you&rdquo;.  Disabled women do not have special needs; we have specific access needs.</p><p> Regarding disabled women who are wheelchair users, BreastCheck states that some wheelchairs can be used by women using the mammogram machine, depending on the design, size and weight of the chair.  For women whose wheelchairs are not appropriate, a screening chair can be provided to enable access.  It is not mentioned, however, if a hoist will be available.  I have heard many stories concerning disabled wheelchair users who have not been provided with hoist access and who have been made to feel as if they have been in the wrong for needing the access.  In general, there is a significant need for innovation and universal design in the medical field.  Disabled women are not the problem; the responsibility lies with the designers of services and equipment.  If we can put a rover on Mars, surely we can design universally accessible diagnostic or therapeutic equipment.</p><p> We need gender sensitive and accessible health services that are delivered with dignity and are sensitive to the diversity of disabled women&rsquo;s needs, experiences and backgrounds.  Every individual has the power to effect change.  Members, as elected representatives, have greater power and therefore also a greater responsibility to use their power, individually and collectively, to effect change.</p><p> I will conclude with my recommendations on how positive change can be brought about for disabled women regarding reproductive rights.  These are as follows: ensure data collection is disaggregated by disability in essential areas such as BreastCheck, CervicalCheck and all reproductive health services; strongly advocate for innovation of accessible, inclusive services and universal design; meaningfully address the absence of disabled people&rsquo;s voices and experiences from pre-legislative scrutiny of the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017; ensure the ethics committee of the proposed AHR regulatory authority, when established, includes the voices of disabled people; and consider disabled people&rsquo;s access needs in all areas of service provision, not just in the public areas of life such as transport and education.</p><p> Access to the realisation of private rights such as reproductive justice is essential for quality of life.  Disabled women need, and have a right to expect, accessible health and reproductive services that are delivered with dignity and are sensitive to the diversity of our needs, experiences and backgrounds.  This includes race, sexuality, gender identity and disability.  I thank members for their time and I hope they enjoy international women&rsquo;s week.</p></speech>

We welcome the approach of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters in engaging with our representative organisations in a meaningful way.</p> <p>  Disabled Women Ireland is the national disabled persons organisation, DPO, representing disabled self-identified women and non-binary people.  A DPO is an independent membership organisation run by and for disabled people.  DPOs are separate from service providers and exist to serve and represent their members on all issues impacting them.  They have an unrivalled expertise and it is essential to bring this to all conversations about disability matters.  Drawing on our collective lived experience, we can provide an analysis of the systematic barriers that impact us and provide the solutions to these issues.  Too often, we find ourselves spoken about but not spoken to.  DPOs must receive meaningful financial and practical support to cultivate this expertise so that we are enabled to have real input in the decisions impacting our lives.  This necessity has been highlighted most recently during the Covid-19 pandemic when DPOs were overlooked and ignored.  This is particularly jarring given that data on disability deaths, to which other experts should supposedly have access, do not seem to exist.  Historically, women have found themselves marginalised and excluded from decisions that impact their lives.  Indeed, the glass ceiling that women have experienced is double-glazed for disabled women.  </p> <p>  Disabled women are more likely to be subjected to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, yet a significant proportion of gender-based services in Ireland are not accessible to disabled women, including intimate partner violence supports.  Screening tools, such as CervicalCheck and BreastCheck, are not accessible to many disabled women and nor for that matter are a number of sexual and reproductive healthcare services that others take for granted.  Education and employment attainment is lower among disabled people than in the general population and is notably lower again for disabled women.</p> <p>  Disabled people fought for decades for remote learning and employment and were told it was impossible, yet one year ago this week, it was brought in overnight.  For those in employment, there is no guarantee that working from home provisions will be supported as a reasonable accommodation in the aftermath of the pandemic.  Flexible working conditions are particularly important for disabled women, who are more likely to have care responsibilities for children or other family members.  These, among other factors, result in a sizeable portion of disabled women living in consistent poverty.  Ireland is lagging behind the rest of Europe in adequately facing these issues, being one of the five countries with the lowest performance with regard to unemployment rates and the risk of poverty for disabled people.</p></speech>

Individual changes are welcome, but we must also look at the systemic approaches which create this environment.  Currently, the majority of supports available to disabled people are means tested.  The Make Work Pay scheme goes some way to alleviating this issue, but disabled people still risk losing their supports if they want to return to work.  This creates barriers for disabled women in particular in that they will experience the gender pay gap as well as the disability pay gap.</p><p> Poverty restricts our choices.  It undermines our dignity and it has been a root cause of us experiencing institutionalisation.  We are reminded in 2021 of how inherently abusive institutions are in terms of the shambolic mother and baby homes report.  As we fight to reckon fully with our institutional past, we must also end modern institutions, including nursing homes, psychiatric care facilities, long-term residential care facilities and direct provision and homelessness hubs.  Institutionalisation makes disabled women particularly vulnerable.  At their best, institutions continue to segregate disabled people and deny us our agency.  We also must recognise that private homes can be institutionalised settings when no real option for independent living exists.  Disabled women, in particular older disabled women, need to have choice in regard to where and with whom they live.  Moreover, disabled women need autonomy over all decisions concerning their lives, including autonomy over their finances.  Independent living requires appropriate, secure and accessible housing, but it also requires a rights-based approach to services, including personal assistant services.  Disabled people are the only people still denied legal capacity in Ireland.  It is imperative that disabled women's autonomy is respected so that we are supported to make decisions in all aspects of our lives, be that in regard to reproduction, where and with whom we live or medical treatment.</p><p> Today, we task the committee with the following four issues: the allocation of funds to DPOs and women's organisations to ensure the involvement of disabled women in these organisations; to ensure all institutions are relegated to the past where they belong and disabled people are supported to live where and with whom they choose; to ensure all gender-based supports and services are disability-proofed, including gender-based violence supports; and ensure disabled people are not confined to living in poverty through the provision of a non-means-tested disability payment and access to supports and services they need in their lives.</p><p> We are here today at the end of the Disabled is not a Dirty Word campaign.  The campaign is a response to the language and approaches to disability which are patronising and distance us from our rights.  We need to move away from terminology that does not serve disabled people.  There is no issue that concerns disabled people that does not impact us specifically as disabled women and non-binary people.  There is no issue that impacts women that does not impact us specifically as disabled women.  As disabled women, we need to be involved in the conversations at every stage of the policymaking on disability and gender issues.</p></speech>

Good morning to everybody.  I wish a happy international women's week to all of our speakers, female members of the committee and females watching the proceedings.  It is worth noting that this committee is a majority female committee, but that is not true of all of the committees in the Oireachtas, unfortunately.  Some committees have a reasonable number of women.  As members can take up positions on more than one committee, many women take up positions on several committees, but not all committees have female representation.  This is not reflective of the Oireachtas make-up, where 22.5% of Deputies are female.  None of this reflects people with disabilities because the number of disabled people who are elected to the Oireachtas is extremely low, a point made today, including in regard to our councils.  This needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  This committee has an important task.  It was formed to oversee the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  As mentioned, it is relevant across all Departments and so we should be holding all Departments to account.  We must ensure issues that affect women and disabled people are dealt with, which combined add up to a large amount of discrimination.  As mentioned by Ms McGovern and others, it is important there is input into this committee by people with the lived experience of a disability.  We must ensure that happens in the case of individuals and DPOs.  One of my questions is around how best we can do that going forward.  The committee has done some outreach work and received some submissions from people in those positions, but we need to ensure we do that in the best way possible.</p> <p>  The past year has been taken up by Covid, which has adversely affected women more than men and disabled people more than able-bodied people.  It has led to women having additional chores within the household and in terms of childcare, elderly care and home schooling.  As mentioned, women in employment and people with disabilities in employment are frequently employed on a part-time rather than full-time basis and in less secure employment.  Also, the majority of those on the front-line in our health and essential services are women and they have been adversely affected by Covid.  My prediction is there will be a widening of the gender pay gap and this needs to be tackled as we come out of Covid, it is hoped in the next few months with the roll-out of vaccines.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the statistics provided today about gender violence and the statement that disabled people, disabled women and women with a health problem are more susceptible to violence from a partner.  It is very concerning.  It is more concerning that the supports are not as available to women with a disability as they are to other women.  I am concerned also about the witnesses' commentary that screening programmes such as BreastCheck and CervicalCheck are not available, as they should be, to all women.  This also needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  Another issue which I believe is very important is the lack of independent living available, which many of the witnesses referenced.  Our Departments, councils and the HSE have a job to do to ensure all adults have choice in regard to where they live and that the proper supports, including personal assistant hours and so forth, are put in place to ensure that happens.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions, one of which I mentioned earlier in regard to engagement by disabled women, disabled people and DPOs with this committee and how best we can improve that.  Another issue arising out of what many of the witnesses have talked about today is the collection of data and the need to ensure those data are broken down by gender.  If the State does not have sufficient quality data on disabled women, how can that position be measured and responded to effectively?  How can that be improved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.896" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021030900002#E00100"><p>On the issue of disabled persons organisations and ensuring that disabled voices are heard in policymaking, something that has been particularly significant in our community is the longevity and success of those organisations.  There are incredible disabled persons organisations operating at local and national levels that are entirely unsupported by the Government.  Predominantly when we fund civil society, we do not fund disabled persons organisations, or at least not to the same extent.  We prioritise organisations that are often led by service providers which have a direct conflict of interest.  This is probably most notable in the case of the National Platform of Self-Advocates, which is made up of revolutionary advocates who should be celebrated and supported but have spent the last three years fighting from month to month to exist.  The fact that core funding does not exist for them in that circumstance massively disadvantages people with an intellectual disability.  We are missing out on a key voice in policymaking.  Grassroots activism requires access to supports, so one could require interpretation, personal assistant support and so on.  When they do not exist it is hard for disabled people to be involved at every level.</p></speech>

I will also point out another issue.  If one looks at the pre-legislative scrutiny of the assisted human reproduction Bill and goes through the list of witnesses and the 31 written submissions, one sees that process should have been equality-proofed.  Somebody should have looked at that and realised that parts of society that this strongly affects did not have a voice.  Any D&aacute;il or committee work that is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny needs to be equality-proofed to ensure all relevant voices are heard.  If they are absent, go out and find the right people with the lived experience, whether a disabled persons organisation or an LGBTQ organisation.  The process for this type of work must be equality-proofed.</p></speech>

It is notable and important that during international women's week we have the opportunity to speak to women with a disability.  The point was well made in some of the submissions that some women prefer to be called &quot;disabled women&quot;.  Whichever term a person chooses to describe himself or herself is the right way to approach it.</p><p>The theme of this year's International Women's Day is &quot;Choose to Challenge&quot;.  We had a two-hour debate in the Seanad yesterday on how we choose to challenge and what we need to choose to challenge in society, particularly from a gender perspective.  In the opening statements we heard today we were made all the more conscious of the challenges facing women.</p><p>Starting a conversation on what any one of us can do to challenge the <i>status quo</i>and ensure gender balance across all aspects of society is important.  It is also important to celebrate women in their diversity and, today, to place an emphasis on women with disabilities and ensure their voice is heard and their needs are met.  There are many different experiences of being a woman in Ireland and that has to be addressed not just yesterday or this week but throughout the year.  It is time for positive measures for women with disabilities to ensure they and the witnesses, those they represent and their peers have full human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with everybody else.</p><p>As a woman, I believe I must help to make sure the fight against inequality breaks down barriers for all women, not just some.  The slogan &quot;Nothing about us without us&quot;, which informed the approach we took to today and has come up in hearings, has to be at the centre of every discussion about women and disabilities.  On Twitter during the week, it was interesting to see the question put as to why people use the term &quot;disability&quot; and to look at some of the responses.  They included the fact that acknowledging a disability has enabled a particular respondent to transcend her illness.  Another woman realised that to try to hide or to be ashamed of her disability serves to uphold the ableist <i>status quo</i>.  All of that is important.  One lady replied that she was part of a magnificent, unique group of disabled women with a cultural identity to celebrate with pride.</p><p>I will put a few questions to the witnesses.  I was concerned to hear from the National Women's Council of Ireland about barriers that women with disabilities experience in accessing health screening services, resulting in a lower take-up of breast and cervical cancer screenings.  I would like to hear more about that in terms of any data available.</p><p>The incidence of violence against women with disabilities is particularly high.  That is shocking.  Perhaps the witnesses could help the committee with how we need to deal with that.</p><p>Equality budgeting has been expanded across government to broaden the scope to other dimensions of equality, including disability.  The initial report notes that the National Women's Council of Ireland is involved in this work.  Will the witnesses tell us a bit more about that?</p><p>Many disabled women gave testament to significant levels of exclusion and isolation from women's groups and the women's sector as a whole.  That was sad and there must be a way we could help support those women.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.900" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Amy Hassett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021030900002#E00500"><p>To make a follow-up point on the comments, in our experience it has been transformative for disabled women to identify as disabled.  I highlight that because it is powerful to define oneself in the terminology that suits best.  It is most moving for us in Disabled Women Ireland to have a lot of people come forward and say they now feel comfortable identifying as disabled and they can better take up and fight for their rights now that they have this terminology.  I mention that because it is really important.</p> <p>  Also mentioned was the importance of women breaking down barriers for other women.  That is incredibly important.  It is important for us, as disabled women and as women, and also for everyone here to acknowledge that there are many different aspects of identity, including gender, age, whether somebody is LGBTQ, black or from a different ethnic minority, or a Traveller, Roma, transgender or from a different socioeconomic background.  I want to highlight that as disabled persons organisations and other organisations requesting support, we need to make sure we do that in a way that is inclusive of the diversity of experience that people have.  It is important that we are focusing on women with disabilities today but we need to use that as a springboard for including people with other identities and to step up and pull up people behind us as we go.</p> <p>  My final point relates to the involvement of disabled women in women's organisations.  We stated in our submission that this is a resource issue.  Disabled persons organisations are facing a massive resource issue.  Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta spoke about the national platform, which is the most concerning issue we have in the disabled persons organisations.</p><p>Access is difficult because it takes resources to make things accessible.  Sign language interpretation costs money, having a Zoom account that has closed captioning is expensive and so on.  When we go back to doing things in the physical world, more barriers will emerge again.  We have to be empathetic and compassionate and understand that there are limited resources but if there are individuals who feel they are not being included in the broader conversation, we need to see if they are being given the resources and support they need to be included.  We are all trying to do our best with the resources that we have but we should not have to make decisions and choose one or the other.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.902" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maureen McGovern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021030900002#F00200"><p>I wish to respond to the two most recent contributions.  In terms of living locally, as a disabled feminist, it has been really difficult for me and for other disabled women in my local area to participate.  There are many reasons for this, one of which is a lack of resources.  Some people might need transport to get somewhere, even though it might be in their local area.  Personal assistants are also an issue, as are other resources like sign language interpreters.  Public buses, for example, only have room for one disabled person which causes difficulties.  If one is at bus stop number two, one might not get on because there was a disabled person at bus stop number one or a person with a pram.  These issues cause great difficulty for people.</p> <p>  Attitudes are also an issue.  Women are often seen as the ones who take care of disabled people and that is an attitude that we must overcome and negotiate.  In terms of data on violence against disabled women, we do not have enough.  Resources are needed for a research project to be conducted across the length and breadth of Ireland to find out where there is violence and why it is happening.  We do not really know what is happening to disabled women in very rural areas, for example.  Violence might also mean my personal assistant or carer taking away my wheelchair until he or she is ready to bring it back.  We really have to build the capacity of disabled women to identify violence.  Often disabled women are afraid that their services will be taken away if they complain but that is not acceptable any more.  I have a right to services and a right to participate in society at every level.  It is really important that disabled women at a local and national level are resourced to support themselves.</p></speech>

They have given compelling, passionate and personal statements and for me, the lived experience is the best tool when it comes to shaping and updating public policy.  I thank them all for the role they are playing in doing that.  I also wish all of the witnesses and my colleagues a happy international women's week.</p> <p>  I was struck by a comment made by Ms McGovern about feeling under-represented at a political level.  I assure her and all of the witnesses that all of us in this Chamber, from all sides of the political divide, are united in this committee when it comes to progressing issues for disabled people.  I give them that assurance of our support and willingness to build links with them.  </p> <p>  We are pressed for time and I would like to hear more from the witnesses.  I have a number of questions related to specific points they have raised.  Ms Bonnie, with whom I have worked on South Dublin County Council and who is a force to be reckoned with, spoke about the need to expand the assisted human reproduction Bill to cater for disabled people.  I would love to hear a little more about what we could do, in practical terms, in that regard.  She also spoke about the low screening uptake and barriers to accessing screening, for example, the lack of hoists.  Beyond the provision of hoists, which I agree should be a basic requirement, is there anything else we could do to improve screening services for disabled people?</p> <p>  Ms McGovern spoke about violence, including sexual violence, against disabled women and argued that we should have some targeted initiatives to respond to and tackle that issue.  I ask her to outline her ideas on what we should be including in our frameworks going forward.  On a similar theme, Ms Hassett mentioned that not all gender-based services are accessible to people with disabilities and to disabled women in particular.  I ask her to suggest a couple of remedies that would rectify that situation and improve accessibility.  She also spoke about barriers to work.  In December 2020, this committee celebrated the International Day of Persons with Disabilities and part of the theme we chose for that day was ability.  A number of organisations appeared before the committee to share their experience of what it is like for disabled people in the workplace.  This is an issue of which we are all cognisant and on which we really want to make an impact.  In a previous role, before I was elected as a Deputy, I worked in that area on a couple of programmes.  I tried to make sure the company I worked for was a diverse and inclusive employer that gave people of all abilities access to employment opportunities.  </p> <p>  The remote working strategy recently published by the T&aacute;naiste is going to be of huge benefit in terms of equipping people to ask for the opportunity to work from home.  I ask the witnesses to respond to those questions.  Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta made some very interesting points about scholarships and I am pleased to hear they are having an impact.</p></speech>

I am very proud to work for such a wonderful local authority.  On the question of health screening and access to same, the problem is that quantitative data have not been collected.  This is an area that must be addressed so that we really know what we are dealing with.  From a qualitative point of view, the stories I could tell the committee that I have heard from other disabled women are shocking.  Considering the number of cases that have gone through the courts already in this area of life, one would think we would be a bit more careful about including and meeting the needs of women in Ireland, regardless of their ability.</p> <p>  On the Bill, there are key concerns relating to a number of different heads of Bill, particularly the one related to the welfare of the child.  Judging that can be very subjective.  What does one understand by quality of life or welfare?  I had personal experience many years ago of being refused assistance unless the professional could be guaranteed that I would not have a disabled child.  That is just one example of the very broad issues that exist.  The voices of those upon whom legislation impacts need to be included in the process.  </p> <p>  On the issue of remote working, the idea itself is not new.  The disabled community has been promoting remote working as a way of enabling people to access employment for decades but it took a global pandemic to show the world that we know what we are talking about.  If one looks at it from a wider perspective, when we talk about value for money, we need to be learning from the lived experience of the people to whom we want to deliver services.  That is the only way we can be guaranteed that we achieve value for money.  We think we are doing the right thing but we are not using lived experience to shape our decisions.  That is my short answer.</p></speech>

I will speak quickly so that they have as much time as possibly afterwards.  I echo everyone's calls about making this conversation and the work of the committee as inclusive as possible and that it would reflect not only the voices of disabled women or women with disability, but also the diverse community within that, Minc&eacute;ir&iacute;, those in direct provision and those who are transgender.  I have some very specific questions.  We spoke a little about assisted human reproduction Bill.  I am interested in the specific concerns around the review of the termination Act and its impact on women with disability or disabled women in areas such as the three-day waiting period and the possibility that a woman would have to travel twice, for example.  We have just heard how travel and public transport can be a barrier.  The restrictive gestational limits can also require travel.  What are the witnesses views on the review of the Act?</p> <p>  We spoke a little about autonomy and legal capacity today.  The issue is mentioned in some of the submissions to today's meeting, including the issue around parental capacity assessments.  In February, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy was before the Joint Committee on Health to examine adult safeguarding.  That is something that is playing out at the moment.  I am interested in any of the witnesses' comments or thoughts on that scheme as proposed.</p></speech>

On gender-based services, including abortion, the services, laws and policies seem surprised that disabled people exist once they are commenced, despite our having fed in to the legislative process a lot, particularly around the abortion Act.  All these things are designed around the idea that whoever will present for a service will be a non-disabled, likely middle class, likely a white woman.  That is not the demographic of the people who rely on these services.  Services are shocked when someone turns up and requires a hoist or when all these barriers are put in place.  If something is designed with disability and disabled women in mind from the outset, if that approach is at the core and disabled people's voice's are consulted, the result is a system that does not just benefit disabled people but which will be more generally accessible to everyone.  It is particularly clear in the abortion Act.  We were very clear when the termination of pregnancy Bill was going through the D&aacute;il, as were Inclusion Ireland and the Disability Federation and other organisations, that the three-day wait period would create a barrier, as would strong gestational limits and that we did not know how it would interact with legal capacity and that would be a barrier.  Ultimately, the only time disability was mentioned was when it concerned potential foetal screening and selection, completely ignoring the lived reality of disabled women.  The exact same thing happened with the assisted human reproduction Act and absolutely everything that pertained to reproduction, parenting and disability.</p> <p>  On legal capacity and adult safeguarding, safeguarding is important but currently the system completely denies the agency and rights of disabled people and particularly disabled women.  While we need to protect everyone from abuse, the current system ignores the will and preferences of people and will ultimately always resort to substitute decision making.  The Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act is a welcome improvement but it still has a provision that can and will deny disabled people their decision-making rights.  We need to move towards the full supported decision making mechanism.  There is so much talk about choice on International Women's Day but we completely fail to recognise the intricate and invasive ways that disabled women's choices are restricted, including in this really crude legal framework.</p></speech>

It is important.</p> <p>  On barriers to work, we are delighted to see remote working strategies and more flexible working styles are being incorporated.  It is really important that does not become a replacement for making workplaces accessible to disabled people.  There cannot be a system where people are told they are able to work remotely so they should stay at home, so that employers do not have to worry about making workplaces accessible to use.  The same goes for educational systems.  The remote aspect of education in the last year has been problematic for disabled people but also a welcome change.  We would love to see some of that continue.  It would have opened many doors for disabled people had this come in ten years ago.  We worry a little about that.  </p> <p>  There has been a change to the scholarship system so that now students, such as myself, who are recipients of scholarships can still get disability allowance.  It is a really welcome change but it is important that we remember that it is an example of the holes that disabled people can get trapped in.  This is one that has been fixed but we need to bear in mind that there are an awful lot more out there and there should be vigilance on that.  We need to be given space to raise the issues we have.</p></speech>

I know we all welcome the opportunity to have a public hearing from such a great array of witnesses.  It is nice for us this week to have all the witnesses before us be women.  Most of us in the Chamber are women and this committee has a majority of women members but as others have said, unfortunately, that is not the norm across the Oireachtas and the D&aacute;il still has a very low number of women Deputies, 36 Deputies which is 22.5%.  The Seanad is much better with 40%, or 24 out 60, which is a huge improvement but a long way to go.  Ireland still languishes at 101st place in world rankings of women in parliaments.  The message for International Women's Day and this week, "nothing about us without us", is very important for women and, as all the witnesses have said so eloquently, also for women with disabilities or disabled women.  We are very grateful to everyone for coming in and for speaking with us today and sharing such an array of experiences, and providing us with such insights into their own lived experiences and many of those they represent.</p> <p>  As someone who was involved in pro-choice campaigns for a long time, it was brilliant for the repeal the eighth campaign in 2018 to have so many important voices of women with disabilities or disabled women coming to the fore on the pro-repeal side.  It was most interesting to hear their thoughts on the reproductive justice side.  </p> <p>  My questions are on two other issues.  Do any of the witnesses have a view they wish to share with the committee on the institutionalisation of women with disabilities?  Some of the speakers have touched on how Ireland has had a shameful history of incarceration, of populations who are "disruptive" or seen-as disruptive to the State.  We have seen that history with mother and baby homes, Magdalen institutions and so on.  However, I am very conscious that there are complex issues around women's choices.  Last year, I worked closely with some residents in the Sisters of Charity-run home, St. Mary's home in Telford in St. Vincent's, Dublin 4.   Many here will be aware of the situation, which was very public, where the Sisters of Charity were closing the home to the great distress of many of those women within it who had known no other home.</p><p>The complexity of institutionalisation, which means it is not always experienced negatively by those who are institutionalised, is an issue on which I would like the witnesses to comment.</p><p> Finally, I have a question on the new Government policy and the great expansion of the disability remit in its move into the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  What is the witnesses' view on that?  Do they see it as a positive development and how will it impact on their lives and the lives of the women they represent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.913" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021030900002#H00200"><p>The issue of institutionalisation more broadly is incredibly nuanced.  What happened to the women in the St. Mary's home is entirely not okay.  We need to be careful to bear in mind two issues in this regard.  One is ensuring that no one else enters an institution, because the system itself is very exploitative.  However, we also have to be mindful of our duty of care to those who are currently experiencing the system of institutions and the need to ensure that, as we move away from our institutional past, it is done in a way that puts their needs, will and preferences to the fore.  It is crucial that no one is forced into a position with which they are uncomfortable.  It is an incredibly difficult issue for people.  Many of the women in the system experienced institutionalisation their entire lives.  They had no idea what it was to live in a family or community and the idea of doing so at that point in their lives was impossible.  Obviously, their voices are the most important things within the system.  That was not how it played out but it is how it should have been.</p> <p>  That being said, we need to be very careful that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past and that no one else enters an institution.  We have to resist newer forms of institutions.  As the Senator acknowledged, we have seen many different forms of institutions in our history and in our present.  While we continue to default to the institutional model, whether that be in the form of smaller, more nicely named institutions or institutions for other groups, such as those in direct provision or in homelessness hubs, we need to be mindful that full community and independent living is the solution and the goal.</p></speech>

There are quite a lot of younger disabled people involuntarily incarcerated in those situations in the Ireland of today.  That is one issue that needs to be addressed.  Another issue is that there are many people in hospital who are holding hospital beds for, perhaps, five, six or seven months because they will not be released from that hospital until either their home is adapted or they have been allocated personal assistance hours.  It is not just the significant issue of the long-term institutions; in today's Ireland, we also have an issue of almost institutionalising people anew in newer settings.</p></speech>

I wish a happy International Women's Day, or international women's week, to the witnesses, my colleagues and everybody listening.  This meeting in itself is hugely important as a means of recognising the importance of a gender perspective on disability and understanding how the real inequalities for disabled women affect their daily life.  There is a specific piece of work to be done in this regard and actions certainly are long overdue.  It is great to get a real insight and perspective from the witnesses on these matters.</p> <p>  I find it deeply worrying and concerning that women with disabilities in Ireland are more likely to experience violence, as we have talked about here today, and that a significant proportion of gender-based services in Ireland are not accessible to disabled women.  I find it hard to believe in this day and age that such services are not disability-proofed.  More important is the question of how we address that issue.  Many of these services are struggling from year to year on the funding they get.  I wonder whether it is specifically and only about funding.  It is not an excuse but, in reality, if that is the issue, then we need to demand that services are funded sufficiently to ensure they are disability-proofed.  Do any of the witnesses have knowledge of what service providers are saying in that respect?  Is the funding aspect the largest barrier or is there something else in tandem such as training elements that are missing and required for staff?  That is my first question.</p> <p>  The lack of access to transport is something on which I would like to focus.  In my constituency of Clare, many people with disabilities who live in rural areas have relied on a service that was provided by Clare Accessible Transport whereby the disabled person could telephone to request to be picked up at a specific location.  Unfortunately, the service was lost last year as the Covid crisis hit.  I am seeking further information from the Minister for Transport on the matter and as to whether accessibility clauses should be included in tendering processes.  The important point I want to make is that sometimes when services are in place and working well, they are, unfortunately, cut or replaced.  That is not good enough.  Do the witnesses consider that these issues are occurring because people, particularly women, are an afterthought in the bigger plans for transport?  Do they think the Minister needs to be more hands-on in this regard or is it an issue with tendering processes and making sure that accessibility clauses are included?</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their contributions regarding the institutionalisation of women.  A number of people in Clare aged under 65 are in nursing homes.  The witnesses have responded on the broader issue but is there something that can be done about those people who are in nursing homes at the present time to facilitate their move into a more residential setting or whatever option they would choose for themselves?</p> <p>  As we are under a time constraint, I will conclude by asking the opinion of the witnesses on the State's initial draft report on the implementation of the UNCRPD and how it can be improved to ensure account is taken of the rights of women with disabilities.  I finish by noting the words of Maya Angelou: "[W]e may encounter many defeats, but we must not be defeated."</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.916" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Amy Hassett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021030900002#H00500"><p>I will make just a few brief points because the other witnesses are greater experts than I in these areas.  In speaking with our membership and getting feedback on the draft State report, which we have been doing over the past week or two, the first point I would make is that there are massive concerns around things that are missing and absent and also about the way certain things are presented and whether it reflects the lived experience of disabled people.  Shadow reports will be written, in which process we will participate.  We certainly have concerns in this regard.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that women are an afterthought in transport considerations.  This is a global problem.  It is known in every single aspect of transport that women are not considered.  In terms of designing transport for cities, the focus on people working in full-time paid jobs is an example of this.</p><p>They tend to be more male based.  They tend to make transport trips in and out of the city whereas women make more lateral movements around cities.  The majority of transport systems, at least in Dublin, are focused on getting in and out of the city.  That is the exact same for disabled women in that it is an afterthought.</p><p> With regard to support services for women, one comment made by our membership is that the physical services are not accessible but also the lack of disability understanding training for staff is a massive concern.</p></speech>

I will call her after Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor has spoken.</p></speech>

The one thing all of us on this committee have to make sure we do is to listen and make policies to help.  That is our mission.  It is something we need to do.</p> <p>  I wish everyone a happy International Women's Week.  It is important.  The first thing that hit me when I read the statements was the violence against disabled women.  We need to ask Tusla to provide a categorised database to show disabled women's experience.  Funding has a major part to play in that but we need to do that because it is very important.</p> <p>  When we speak about political life we must highlight that there are not enough representatives in elected office.  What can we do to encourage that and engage more?  One of the witnesses might come back to me on that.</p> <p>  All of us are hearing about BreastCheck and CervicalCheck.  It is very important that disabled women do not have to ask for supports such as a hoist.  It should be standard.  Working with the HSE it is very important that there is communication and information.  That should be available.  We do not want women to say that was not available to them and describe how bad they felt.  That is something on which we need to work.  Those are issues we need to address.</p> <p>  I refer to the absence of disabled voices.  We need to include all voices and listen, particularly to what women are saying, but I was sad to hear Ms McGovern say that when people are not listening it can affect mental health.  She might come back to me on mental health and the way that has impacted the witnesses.  I know it has been hard but Covid-19 in particular has been extremely hard on people's mental health.  The witnesses might come back to me on that.</p> <p>  When we are launching programmes we need to get more women involved.  It is very important that with policies and us working as two different groups we learn and make sure that we deliver on policies that will affect women. </p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe it would be helpful to have a disabled person at the decision making level in all local government?  I believe that will be very important and it is something we need to examine.  I was a councillor before I became a Senator and a Deputy and whether it was working through local grants, housing adaptation grants or whatever grants were available, it was payments being means tested.  That was brought up today and I would be very worried about that.  No payments should be means tested.  That is an issue we need to address.</p> <p>  One of the statements that summed everything up was that disabled women can fully realise their social, cultural, political and economic rights.  That is what we have to do here.  All of us have a duty of care and it is something on which I believe we need to deliver.  I again thank the witnesses.  The meeting, and the presentations, were excellent.  They might come back to me with some answers.</p></speech>

I will give the members a mishmash because I am hearing lots of stuff.  I would love to be among them having a cup of tea and a chat because the lived experience of disabled women is very important.</p> <p>  On the question of institutionalisation, please do not forget the disabled women who were institutionalised in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  I was one of those women.  I was institutionalised for 12 years and it was very difficult to come into an open society.  We need to look after those women also.</p> <p>  I would welcome the idea of disabled people being on every single board but it is very important that resources are put in because it is all about money.  We live in a society that rejects us so we need to ensure that funding is put in place.</p> <p>  With regard to mental health, because of attitudinal reasons and our built environment it was very difficult for me as a disabled woman, and for other disabled women, to participate fully in any part of society.  When one cannot participate perhaps due to access or attitudinal reasons, lack of resources or whatever the issue might be, that comes back on one like a mirror.  I felt that I was really not wanted in my society and when that is coming back to one all the time, that is difficult to deal with at times.  It is about ensuring that we build an environment that is fully accessible to every single person within our land.  That is important.  Universal access is very important.</p> <p>  I will make one more point around hoists.  I experienced this issue quite recently.  I was looking for a hoist to attend an appointment.  Although I had telephoned the hospital to say that I needed a hoist there was no hoist to meet me.  I had to leave the hospital to get another appointment when a hoist was available.  I should not have to do that.  No disabled woman should have to do that.</p></speech>

I am very taken by Ms McGovern's contribution.  I come from a background of being a privacy lawyer.  One of the aspects of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, was privacy by design; everything has to be privacy by design.  What I am taking from this morning's meeting is that we should have ability by design.  Everything we do should consider the limitations in how we are providing a service, how we can overcome those limitations and make sure we have people advising who experience the limitations and are in a position to comment on that.</p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses for their contributions and wish all of them a very happy International Women's Week.  I am the Fine Gael spokesperson on disability and I must confess that I have taken the witnesses' opening statements as a to-do list.  I would welcome further engagement on that outside of this meeting by way of follow-up.</p> <p>  To give the witnesses a brief outline of my actions as I have been sitting here listening to them and having read their statements in preparation for today's meeting, I noted that clarification was required from the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on the provisions, the cards and the additional points the witnesses made.  I have sent a request to her office.</p> <p>  Yesterday, for International Women's Day, I raised a Commencement matter in the Seanad on intimate partner violence and the increasing rates of domestic violence because all the January reports show that.  The Minister, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, stated in reply that they were currently conducting an audit of the services and that included an assurance of diversity in the provision of domestic violence supports.  My focus, I confess, was very much on trans and non-binary women.  I have been thinking that it did not occur to me to specifically ask about disability.  As I was sitting here, I emailed the Minister for Justice asking whether she has engaged on this and saying that, if not, she needs to engage directly with those people who are contributing and speaking so passionately this morning.  I asked her to make sure that she hears their perspectives.  Rather than me representing the witnesses they should get to speak for themselves.</p> <p>  My home constituency is Dublin South Central so I am particularly taken by Ms McGovern's statement that Ballyfermot-Chapelizod has the highest proportion of people with disabilities living in an urban setting.  I would like to hear more on that.</p> <p>  I have been advocating with various Ministers in various forms on hidden disabilities and the lack of provision for that also.  I have particularly advocated on the shortcomings in the primary medical certificate, the criteria for entitlement to that and what flows from that with regard to disabled drivers, disabled passengers and how there is a limitation in that respect.  One particular advocate, Gr&aacute;inne Leach, whom I know personally is on to me regularly.  I see one of the witnesses nodding.  Gr&aacute;inne sent me an email this morning saying she had already been on to them to make sure that her position was outlined.  She is without one of her arms but does not qualify under the criteria, yet lives a life that is very limiting and does not have access to any funding that flows from that.</p><p> My statement for International Women's Day yesterday in the Seanad was dedicated to the draft assisted human reproduction Bill.  I am a member of the AHR coalition.  I see significant shortcomings in and have concerns around the draft Bill and I raised a number of them yesterday.  Among these are making sure that persons with a disability have a say in influencing and making sure that the provisions within the Bill also meet their needs because there are other groups where they do not.  I would welcome hearing more from Ms Bonnie and engaging with her; if Ms Bonnie is not already in the coalition, I urge her to make that contact.  I would be happy to do that.</p><p> Lastly, I was taken by the reference to "institutions".  We have a picture in our head of what that looks like, but what we do not have and what did not come home to me was the fact that one's own home can be an institution in how one is treated within it.  I have had much engagement with Colin McAndrew of Global Citizens.  Mr. McAndrew talks about the urban built environment and the experience and accessibility within that.  I would welcome hearing more about what we could do, how we can assist and how, as legislators, we should respond.</p><p> Apologies, there was a great deal there.  I still have an even longer to-do list to go.</p></speech>

We have actually 21% - I made a wrong assumption there, it is actually a bit higher.</p></speech>

I would echo what the Chair said.  There are so many questions and so many issues arising that it would be good if we could even get written input on some of them because we are going theme by theme.  I would welcome that kind of nuanced expertise and experience around the issues of means testing and how it could be removed, and how the costs of disability should be better recognised.  I was struck by the fact that employment opportunities are not only double-glazed but sometimes triple glazed.  On the transfer into remote working, how do we ensure that it is empowering and how do we completely overhaul the approach to reasonable accommodation that we have at present?  I would welcome written input on those issues.  I am signalling those points because I have many questions as well.</p> <p>  We came into this session knowing that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities mandated us as a committee to ask how our approach to disability can be gender proofed but what has come across so strongly from the presentations is that our supports for women in Ireland also need to be disability proofed.</p> <p>  I was stuck by what Ms McGovern said about violence.  Something I care a lot about is coercive control, which was brought in by the Seanad as an offence.  I was wondering about the other more insidious and financial abuse of women with a disability, if Ms McGovern wanted to comment on that, and how we could understand or communicate that better.  I am also struck by the fact that this can happen in the home and that idea that the home can be an institution, and even a place of institutional abuse.</p> <p>  In terms of the choice in living issue, Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta already gave a nuanced piece so that we do not have a blunt tool that is only about the numbers in a building but that looks to how we ensure there is choice around how people are living, be it with a community of like-minded people, with friends, with family or alone.  Will Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta comment further around the issue of personal assistants and the difference, for example, between care supports and personal assistants in terms of empowering people in making those choices, empowering people around cultural and political participation, and particularly around empowering people within their family relationships to have more equal family relationships and that fuller relationship piece?</p> <p>  This brings me to what Ms Bonnie was talking about, which I am really interested in and which others have talked around.  I will be bringing Ms Bonnie's points back to the reproductive rights group in the Oireachtas because they are really important.  Could Ms Bonnie expand further around parental capacity assessments because I have some concern around the way those are applied to women with a disability?</p> <p>  Statistics have been talked about.  Any written input is great, but how could our consultations be better designed so that we get input from people?  That means thinking about the web accessibility directive but maybe also designing consultations in a better way.</p> <p>  Returning to Ms McGovern on the community level, I refer to that aspect of shaping communities.  How do we ensure that it is not only about community supports but about supporting women to shape their communities and culturally participate in them?  I am concerned that in the last recession we saw that community supports were really caught.  Everything was directed towards jobs and nothing else.  How important is it that we build up our community infrastructure from the perspective of women with a disability?</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for everything.  I look forward to a longer conversation over the year to come.</p></speech>

First of all, I included my contact details at the back of my statement.  If anybody wants to engage with me after this morning about any of the issues, he or she is welcome to contact me.</p> <p>  On parental assessments, what has come to the fore is that mothers with a disability are being set up to fail by the way the system is currently designed and much work needs to be done there.  Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta might be able to speak further on that.</p> <p>  Briefly, the difference between a personal assistance service and a carer is that with a personal assistance service, the person with a disability is the boss.  We lead our personal assistant, PA, and the PA works to our direction to do things at the time we choose in the way that we choose whereas with a carer, one does not have that choice and control.</p> <p>  One final point relates to something a few previous speakers raised.  On ensuring that services are accessible, under Part III of the Disability Act 2005, each public agency should have an appointed access officer.  Perhaps it is time for the new Department to engage with and maybe develop a register of all those access officers because I can guarantee there are many agencies that should have them that have not appointed them.  The Department should then engage with the individual access officers across the country to encourage them to make their services accessible.</p></speech>

The way that each one of the witnesses presented to us is truly what this committee is about.  We have to listen but we also have to take on board what people say.</p> <p>  I have probably 100 questions.  Therefore, I will not ask any questions but I will make some comments.  First of all, within the D&aacute;il we talk about legislation.</p><p>I believe that only one current Oireachtas Member is a person with a disability.  That is something we need to change.  How do we change it?  This committee, with the organisations represented today, has to make sure we make disabilities a very political issue and we need to get people involved in it.</p><p> The fact I am a lone ranger sitting here this morning does not discomfort me in any way.  To listen to what the witnesses have to say is very important.  A number of issues that have arisen during Covid have highlighted the lack of services and the lack of engagement we have had, be it in regard to special needs education or the way primary medical certificates are dealt with at the moment, where assessments are non-existent, and there does not seem to be a way of getting these things done.  I like the idea of having access officers within each organisation, and that they do the job they are supposed to be doing and it is not just tokenism, which I sometimes feel these kinds of things can be.</p><p> There is a huge body of issues that we have to sort out and we should tackle them one at a time.  When my students were doing a big project in class, I would ask them how we eat an elephant, and the answer was that we take it one bite at a time.  Today is the one bite at a time that we are all here for.  I reassure the witnesses that this committee, since it was set up, has been very much involved in doing things rather than talking about things.  There are a lot of things that we need to change, with the help of the organisations here today, and maybe they will lead us in that change.  That is what I am offering.  As women but also as people who are living with disabilities, their experience is more important than any report I would get from anybody else.  What I have heard this morning is just the tip of the iceberg.  I look forward to engaging with the witnesses again, whether at the committee or aside from the committee, and I may contact them.  Given all the questions that were asked, we could do with a full week to get the answers.  We need to make sure that we gain as much information as possible from the witnesses on the issues they have.</p><p> I have encountered the issue of means testing and disability supports when people are trying to get a job or trying to improve themselves in my constituency in Galway.  People have contacted me when they have an opportunity because, if they go for it, they will lose their disability allowance or something to this effect, which is shambolic given what we are trying to do.</p><p> The witnesses are all very brave people but they should never feel they are alone.  There is a great committee here to help them.  We have attitudes to change and we have to do that with education.  We have to make sure that every policy is disability-proofed in every Department.  It will take time to do that but a change of attitude is the start of it.  I have no questions.  I wish all of the witnesses well this week, international women's week.  It is important that it is not just about this week and then putting that back up on the shelf again.  We have taken it down and we need to make sure we fix it before we put it back up again.</p></speech>

On representation, there are 220 Oireachtas Members.  The Deputy can tell me there is only one disabled person but I do not believe him.  We comprise 13.5% to 25% of the population, depending on what metric is used, so there are more of them here.</p> <p>  In terms of participation, many very creative solutions are being proposed today but the greatest one that will work is properly resourcing, supporting and engaging with disabled persons' organisations.  In preparing for today, six people helped to write the submission that Ms Hassett and I made earlier, and 12 other people fed into it.  We all have very different disabilities and we come from different areas, and we are able to identify the barriers on that basis.  That is where our expertise comes from.  That is probably the single most effective way to facilitate participation of disabled people in the political process.</p> <p>  In terms of primary medical certificates and supports, Ms Bonnie did a very good job of detailing why personal assistant, PA, support was different because it kept the person concerned in charge - because it gives agency and autonomy.  We also probably need that rights focus in approaching other areas of disability support, and that includes primary medical certificates.  What primary medical certificates do is they say that if someone's body fits in the box exactly, they need this support and that support.  However, none of our bodies fit in any box exactly.  When we are assessing services, it needs to be directed by the disabled person in voicing what they need and what supports they need, and they should be supported from that basis.  No tick-box exercise is going to say exactly what I need, what Ms McGovern needs, what Ms Hassett needs or what Ms Bonnie needs.</p> <p>  In terms of parental capacity assessments, I will try to be brief and try not to be angry.  In a world where we are currently focusing on people being forced to be apart from their children for completely unreasonable things, parental capacity assessments are a tick-box exercise designed to separate disabled people from their children because we do not trust disabled people to be parents.  That is simply it.  We do not have a way to say there is no risk and because we inherently see disabled people as a risk, and we do not actually provide people with the support to parent; that is all parental capacity assessments can see.  To everyone who is a parent on the committee, I guarantee they would fail this.  We do not ask any other parents, when their child is born, how to raise a teenager.  We need to stop looking at disabled parents as a danger and start seeing what measures we can have to support them.</p></speech>

I thank all of the witnesses for sharing their lived experiences with us.  Regrettably, we know that disabled women and girls face multiple and accumulating discriminations.  Most worrying are the examples the witnesses have given around sexual violence and the inability to access domestic violence supports, access to medical screening and healthcare, and dignified independent living conditions.  These public services should be available to all, regardless of gender, age, ethnicity or disability.</p> <p>  To make the best use of the short time we have, I ask the witnesses to tell us one concrete intervention, which would make the biggest difference to the lives of girls and women with disabilities, that they would recommend, so we can do everything to make that happen through this committee and through the relevant Ministers and their officials, who we can pursue consistently until there is progress.  We need this committee to have an impact.  I would love to hear from all of the witnesses what we should be doing most urgently.</p></speech>

I live with an impairment and my disability is my barrier.  I just wanted to mention that first.  I do not want to change in regard to my impairment.</p> <p>  In regard to capacity for disabled women at a local level, we need support and resources in order that we can build the capacity to be leaders within our community, which is very important.  Those resources would obviously be extra funding for PAs and extra funding for equipment in order for disabled women to actually participate.  I will certainly leave my contact details because I would have an awful lot to say about how agencies within local communities can engage better with disabled women.</p></speech>

Please value our lived experience, stop assuming that our needs are special and recognise us as innovators.  Disabled people navigate the world having to constantly problem solve and innovate.  People should utilise that quality, experience and ability.  Stop presuming that we are vulnerable purely because we are disabled people.</p></speech>

I feel blown away and emotional following all of the contributions, which have highlighted why this committee is so important and how it can make issues visible.  Visibility is the problem.  For too long, the needs of people with difference in this country have been invisible.  I have learned so much from all the witnesses this morning.  I feel incredibly hurt and have been upset by some of the comments because of the impact on our guests' basic human rights to be parents, to be women, to have reproductive rights, to have sexual rights and to be who they are.  The theme of today's meeting was equality and equity.  The equity part is really important to me because it is about recognising difference, recognising difference in us all, and appreciating and celebrating differences but putting things in place that make those differences null and void and makes us all achieve what we need to achieve.</p> <p>  Many really good questions have been asked and I will not go back over them but I do not believe the disability allowance issues have been dealt with.  There is clearly a huge issue in the system when 42% of applications are disallowed but 70% of those are granted on appeal.  Why are the applications granted after initially being disallowed?  To me, turning down applications proves that there is a serious lack of procedure and that people are not being listened to.  There is always a margin for error but 70% is a huge error.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their contributions as I have gained so much from them.  It is about getting access, transport, employment, education and healthcare and to have a society where we can all enjoy this country and families to the best of our abilities.    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.943" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Amy Hassett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021030900002#M00300"><p>I am going to do a whistle-stop tour of some of the things about which the last six people have spoken.  I could give a long reply but I will not.  First, we could have a really involved conversation about the disability allowance.  I encourage the committee to engage with us because we have spoken about the allowance a lot recently.  Indeed, the fact that 70% of the appeals go through turns my stomach.  I am one of these people who has been turned down twice for the allowance.  I was successful once on appeal and unsuccessful the second time but for the same reason that Catherine Gallagher has experienced problems.  What I can tell the committee from my own experience is that the application process does not capture the lived experience of disability.  I could give the committee ten more points about the allowance but will simply encourage members to engage with us because we can provide them with systematic analysis on the vagaries of that system.</p> <p>  As we emerge from Covid, we are, if we are being realistic, about to go into an economic downturn.  I want to highlight that to members because those who suffer the most in economic downturns are women and disabled people, plus other individuals of minority backgrounds across the spectrum, but particularly disabled women given the topic of today's debate.  We would be really happy to engage with the many different members of this committee who have asked us to on various different issues because we can give more information.  The means testing of payments is a significant concern for us.</p> <p>  In terms of representation in public office, in the UK there are specific funding resources for disabled candidates when they run for public office but that does not happen here.  That is a major barrier but it is a minor change that we could make.  Indeed, there is a lot more that needs to be done regarding this issue.</p> <p>  On engaging people in local government, I would caution for and against having a single disabled person because it is absolutely impossible for any one disabled person to represent the views of all disabled people and experiences are so diverse.  For me, as a physically disabled person, it is very difficult to explain what it is like to be neurodiverse or know what reasonable accommodations are appropriate.  </p> <p>  My final point is on mental health.  Disabled people have found the pandemic incredibly difficult.  We were the first to go into quarantine and we will be the last to emerge.  In our opening statement, we mentioned our Disabled is not a Dirty Word campaign.  We ran the campaign because we have been absolutely horrified and heartbroken by the language that is being used about disabled people such as that Covid is not dangerous if one does not have an underlying condition or Covid only affects people who have an underlying condition or are disabled.  I wish to point out that Covid will make people disabled.  Covid has disproportionately affected people who are disabled.  We also know that Covid has killed a disproportionate number of disabled people.  So, in terms of mental health, we stress that the mental health system must be overhauled.  I urge the committee to please bear in mind that mental health issues are a massive problem, issue and concern for disabled people, particularly disabled women.</p></speech>

We have had a fantastic meeting because we are physically here and nearly every member has stayed.  Members have busy schedules but they have stayed to listen to the powerful testimony given by the witnesses and heard the challenges.  The witnesses have given asked us to advocate on their behalf on a whole raft of areas such as resources, violence, isolation, issues concerning the primary medical certificate and the disability allowance scheme, and carers as well, which is something that we, as a committee, must consider very closely and talk to the officials concerned.</p> <p>  The witnesses are a powerful inspiration to us.  We will continue to listen to what they are doing and will reflect on what they have advised us to do to get these things made part of Government policy because a massive change is needed.  As Chair of this committee, I firmly believe that societal attitudes really need to change, thus enabling everyone to have the best possible life whatever their abilities or disabilities.</p> <p>  I sincerely thank all the witnesses for their contributions today.  If there are any points that have not been addressed that were raised by the members, I ask the witnesses to be kind enough to email their views to us because we would appreciate their insight and their view would inform us as we go forward.  I sincerely thank the members of the committee for being here this morning and making thought-provoking and excellent contributions.  I am really sorry and frustrated that we must adhere to a two-hour timeframe because I would have loved to have given these matters the attention that they deserve and have a longer meeting of up to four hours.  I thank the members for their insightfulness and consideration.  Most of all, I thank them for allowing a male Chair to chair this meeting this morning.  These issues are powerful and this debate has given us food for thought.  We all know that we have desperate pile of work to do to iron out the inequalities that exist for women with disabilities and we will endeavour to do what we can, as a committee.  I thank everyone for their contributions.</p> <p>  Our public meeting stands adjourned until the next public meeting that, I think, will take place in two weeks' time but we will liaise with members on the matter.</p></speech>

I look forward to our engagement on the topic of the rule of law.  In advance of the meeting, the committee engaged with stakeholders on the topic and sought written submissions on the issue.  I thank all the stakeholders who took the time to respond to that request.  We found all the submissions very helpful.</p> <p>  Before we begin, all witnesses are reminded of the parliamentary practice that we should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with that direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely, that is, outside the precincts of Leinster House, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of legal immunity as witnesses who are physically present in the building.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised to be mindful of their domestic law.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person identifiable outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located in this complex.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams, prior to making their contribution or asking a question, to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  For anybody watching the meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chair, and staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting, I ask everyone to bear with us if technical issues arise.</p> <p>  After all of those technicalities, I invite Commissioner Reynders to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank him for the recall of all the technicalities.  It is interesting for me to listen to the rule of law in a Parliament with such a set of rules.  First, I thank the members for their invitation to present today the Commission's first annual Rule of Law Report, which was published on 30 September last year.</p> <p>  Let me first express my gratitude to the committee and the Irish authorities for their strong commitment to upholding the rule of law and supporting the Commission in this field.  It is important.  Respect for the rule of law is key in the Union, yet we have seen in recent years that it cannot always be taken for granted.  I thank the committee, therefore, for its support.</p> <p>  It is with this concern in mind that the Commission published its first annual Rule of Law Report in September last year.  This report provides a synthesis of significant rule of law developments, both positive and negative, in the EU since the beginning of 2019, as well as country-specific assessments for all 27 member states, including, of course, Ireland.  We are working on the second edition of the report, which we will adopt in July this year.  It has come to be a cycle.  Year after year, we will go further with a new report to try to see what possible improvements can be to the rule of law if that is the reality in the Union.  I hope to be back in Dublin soon, perhaps in person, to present this second report to the Parliament.  When we come out of the pandemic, it will be a pleasure to come back to Dublin in my capacity as Commissioner for Justice and discuss this physically in the Parliament, not only with the Chairman but perhaps with all the members.</p> <p>  For Ireland, like for all the 27 member states, the Commission examined four areas, which are key for the rule of law: the independence, quality and efficiency of the justice systems; the anti-corruption framework; media pluralism and media freedom; and other institutional checks and balances.</p> <p>  As regards the first pillar of the report relating to the justice system, let me start by welcoming the establishment of an independent judicial council at the end of 2019.  On a general note, the perceived independence of courts and judges has been consistently high over the past number of years in Ireland.  The report has also noted the ongoing discussions as regards the reform of the judicial appointment system.  A decrease in the number of candidates to be submitted to the Government for consideration, as well as the application of the procedure to all judicial appointments, could limit political discretion.</p> <p>  Concerns had been raised as regards the previous Bill relating to the composition of the Judicial Appointments Commission.  The report underlined the importance for this reform to take into account the Council of Europe recommendations about, certainly, the composition of the commission.  Again, however, the evolution is in a good way if there is a restriction to the number of candidates submitted to the Government for consideration.</p> <p>  We are aware that the new Government is working on a new Bill and we are following this closely.  On 23 February, the Commission&rsquo;s services discussed this issue with the Irish authorities.  We will, perhaps, say more about the reforms in the second edition of our report and we will continue to see if it is possible to have a correct implementation of the enormous reform by the Government  </p> <p>  A new body in charge of disciplinary proceedings against judges has also been established, that is, the judicial conduct committee.  This could improve the accountability of judges.  Parliament remains in charge of deciding the removal of judges from office, which could, however, raise concerns about the politicisation of the process.  We want to see a decline in the politicisation of the process.</p> <p>  As regards the work on the personal injuries guidelines, the report notes that in the implementation of such guidelines, due regard should be given to the respect of, again, judicial independence, not only from undue influences outside the Judiciary, but also from within.</p> <p>  A review group on civil justice has also looked at access to justice and the cost of litigation.  This could be useful to address the concerns raised as regards the civil legal aid system.  Continuing the work to tackle remaining barriers to enter the legal services market is also important.</p> <p>  We also note that work is still ongoing on establishing a compensation scheme to award damages in the event of protracted court proceedings, as required by a European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, judgment.  The committee will be aware that we take into account standards for our report, not only the treaties and case law from the European Court of Justice, ECJ, in Luxembourg, but also the case law coming from the ECHR in Strasbourg.  Of course, we also try to take into account some decisions from the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.</p><p>On the second pillar of the report, the anti-corruption framework, we note that Ireland has carried out several reforms aimed at strengthening the fight against corruption, in particular through the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018.  This Act included several offences relating to corruption, which is a positive development.  However, it also contains a dual criminality provision, which may limit the scope for prosecuting foreign bribery.  There is a legal and institutional framework in place on asset declarations and interests, as well as codes of conduct and tax clearance obligations, which is under review.  The report noted that the Government committed to reform and consolidate the ethics in public office legislation.  We also underlined that Ireland&rsquo;s defamation laws raise concerns regarding the ability of the press to expose corruption.  We have received some remarks from the press in Ireland about such a situation.  Finally, we noted that a comprehensive review of Ireland&rsquo;s anti-corruption framework is being carried out and that a review of defamation legislation is ongoing.  It will be an important task for the Parliament to see how to have an evolution about that, regarding the criticism coming from some members of the press about its ability to expose corruption in full compliance with Ireland's defamation laws.<br/><br/>Turning to our third pillar, media pluralism, there are constitutional guarantees and solid regulatory structures in Ireland in this regard.  These operate within a political culture that avoids intervention in editorial content of media outlets and prevents conflicts of interests in media ownership.  The media regulator took steps to update and publish information on media ownership on an annual basis, which is to be welcomed because transparency about media ownership is an important element in all member states.  We need a real vision of media ownership and it is important to have such a publication year after year from the media regulator.  Freedom of expression and the right to access official information are well established principles.  However, the frequent use and high costs of defamation cases raise concerns.  <br/><br/>Concerning institutional checks and balances, which is the last pillar of the report, Ireland has an established practice of consultation on draft legislation by the Government and Parliament, as well as impact assessments.  The scrutiny over Private Members' Bills that pass a certain stage of the legislative process is similarly developed.  The independent Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is well equipped to carry out its functions.  We do not have any remarks on the providing of resources to such a commission.<br/><br/>The space for civil society organisations is generally considered open.  Yet, concerns have been raised by some of them as regards constraints on civil society actions in relation to the current interpretation of the Electoral Act, which imposes restrictions on funding possibilities for civil society organisations.<br/><br/>As the committee may know, the General Affairs Council held very constructive political debates on the rule of law report on two occasions last year under the German Presidency, including the first country-specific discussion on five member states, following the alphabetical protocol order.  These discussions will continue in the General Affairs Council in April, where the situation in Ireland will be discussed, together with France, Germany, Greece and Spain.  We will continue in the second part of the year with the Slovenian Presidency and again, we will have a general debate on the second rule of law report, which we will publish in July, and on five other member states.  We will continue semester after semester with a discussion not only in general but country by country.  I have already presented the report before the European Parliament.  It was discussed in the plenary session and in the LIBE committee and I am now bringing the debate before national parliaments.  The Irish Parliament is the 16th I am visiting to exchange on the report.  This month, I will continue with visits planned to Malta, Luxembourg and Lithuania.  Of course, most of those discussions are by video conference but I will try to go physically to Luxembourg if possible because it is not so far.  I will be very pleased to come back to Ireland for the presentation of the second report, maybe with a physical presence in Dublin.<br/><br/>Before concluding, I will say a few words about the directive on the protection of the EU financial interest, or PIF directive, and the European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO.  I understand that the legislative procedure for the transposition of the PIF directive is progressing well and should be finalised very soon.  Members might have more information about the process of this transposition.  I kindly encourage the Government to complete this procedure as soon as possible.  The deadline for transposition was July 2019 and all the other member states have now transposed this directive.  As the committee knows, the PIF directive defines the crimes affecting the Union budget, for which the EPPO is competent.  I know that Ireland does not participate in the EPPO.  However, all member states have an obligation to effectively protect the Union budget and the PIF directive plays a key role in this regard.  In addition, I invite Ireland to smoothly co-operate with the EPPO, in line with the principle of sincere co-operation.  Member states participating in the EPPO will soon notify it as a competent authority for the purpose of judicial co-operation within the EU.  This will open the way for the EPPO to issue decisions based on the principle of mutual recognition, which will also apply also <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Ireland.  I count on the Irish authorities to conclude a working arrangement with the EPPO soon.  It will be very important to have good participation of all participating member states, but the non-participating member states that are not in the EPPO also have to play an important role with such a working arrangement.  In the future, it may be Ireland's choice to join the EPPO.  That is already the case for some common law member states, such as Malta or Cyprus, and we may have an evolution next year with the draft Bill presented to the Swedish Parliament.  I do not know but for the moment the most important element is the working arrangement.  <br/><br/>It is now important to bring forward the reform impetus and further improve respect for the rule of law in Ireland, like everywhere in the Union.  What we want to promote is a stronger European rule of law culture.  This is why a debate like the one we are having today is so important.  Such debates are key steps towards the creation of a new rule of law culture, where national parliaments play an important role.  I therefore hope that the debate will also continue at regional or local level, including within civil society.  On its side, the Commission will continue to play its role as guardian of the treaties, and will use all the tools at its disposal to react to threats to the rule of law, whenever necessary.  The rule of law report is not the only one tool we have at our disposal.  It is also possible to work under the Article 7 procedure or to go to the Court of Justice with infringement proceedings.  From the beginning of this year it may be possible to have a real link between the funding of some policies and the rule of law with a conditionality mechanism.  I thank the committee again for its invitation and its attention.  I am looking forward to hearing members' remarks and questions.  I have tried not to mention any individual in order to be in full compliance with the technicalities mentioned at the beginning of the meeting. </p></speech>

I look forward to seeing him in person in the Irish Parliament as soon as circumstances permit.  I pay tribute to him for the care with which he is carrying out his duties in ensuring that the rule of law is kept up to an adequate standard across the EU.</p><p>I want to mention one or two things which may be of interest to the Commissioner.  As a former Minister for Justice, I started the reform of our defamation law back in the early 2000s.  I agree with the Commissioner that Irish defamation law is a little bit suffocating of investigative journalism.  There is scope for further reform.  I had proposed, for instance, that the presumption that charges against an individual are false should be reversed and that people who want to sue in our courts should undertake the onus of proving that what was said about them is actually false.  However, there was push back from my then partners in government on that issue.  That could be changed.  It is important that the law should permit the media reasonable and fair commentary on matters of public interest, in particular in relation to the discharge of governmental functions by important people within the community without the threat of very expensive litigation.  There is room for improvement there and I thank the Commissioner for his remarks.</p><p>The second issue relates to the question of the upholding of the rule of law across the EU.  I would ask the Commissioner to remember that our system of justice is not the same as many other continental systems.  We do not have a professional Judiciary and, therefore, the question as to who becomes a member of the Judiciary is not simply a matter of allowing the Judiciary to supervise that function by themselves.  Our Constitution requires that our elected Government has the ultimate say in this matter and we are in a hybrid position now between the United States system, which is very politicised, as we saw with the former President, and the other common law countries which provide for a system of vetting, by an independent body, of candidates for the Judiciary.  It is a delicate issue and I would ask the Commissioner to bear that in mind.  We have a system whereby we choose people from the legal professions in their 50s or 60s to become judges for the first time because of their experience, status, learning and knowledge of the law and the European models may not always suit us.</p><p>The third issue I wish to raise is one that many in this Parliament have been asking about.  On money laundering, we find that the enhanced scrutiny of politicians and people deemed to be in politics and their relatives, including people who have very minimal connection with the political process, such as the parent of a person on the administrative body of a political party, is overly complicated.  We would ask that in the context of measures to address corruption, it should not be the case that my son or parent, for example, is subjected to enhanced scrutiny against the possibility that I, somehow, am being corrupt.</p><p>Finally, I have practised before the Court of Justice of the EU on a couple of occasions and believe it could be improved in two respects and will put them to the Commissioner for his consideration.  One is that the single judgment rule, which does not apply in the Strasbourg court where there can be minority and dissenting judgments, should be introduced in the Court of Justice of the EU.  It is unsatisfactory that a collegiate court would just issue one judgment and that a minority view or jurisprudence is never seen and is kept secret.  The second issue I would ask the Commissioner to look at <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the European institutions, is that the Lisbon treaty made provision for the EU to adhere to the European Convention on Human Rights in Strasbourg itself and while I do not want to be unfair in my criticisms of the Court of Justice, it certainly has thrown many trees across the railway line in the context of achieving that goal.  I would like the European Commission to be more proactive in ensuring that the EU as a body adheres to the European Convention on Human Rights in the manner provided for in the Lisbon treaty.</p><p>I reiterate my thanks to the Commissioner for his contribution.  I agree very strongly with some of the points he has made and welcome his independent and objective assessment of Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.955" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Didier Reynders" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021030900002#F00300"><p>I thank Senator McDowell for starting a dialogue on the realities in the different member states.  It is also good to hear proposals coming from the member states and not only from the Commission.  On the issue of defamation law, I thank the Senator for his explanation of the reforms of the past and welcome the opportunity to have a discussion about it.  To be very concrete, the report indicates that frequent defamation legal cases, the high cost of defence and the high damages awarded by the Irish courts are seen as an inducement to self-censorship and a constraint on media freedom.  This works to the detriment of the fight against corruption.  As I said earlier, I have taken note of the fact that the Government has pledged to reform the defamation laws in order to ensure a balance between freedom of expression, the right to the protection of reputation, which is so very important, and the right of access to justice.  In our report, we point out that we have seen many attacks against journalists in many member states but it is important to point out that in some member states, we have seen murders of journalists.  Of course, in all member states there is violence against journalists but sometimes they are attacked or harassed through social media.  I thank the Senator for providing the opportunity to discuss the possibility of further reform of the defamation laws.  We have received correspondence from journalist associations and individual journalists on the current situation.</p> <p>  In terms of upholding the rule of law in the entire EU, we must take due account of the different legal traditions of member states.  I mentioned the European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO, and I know that there are different approaches but we have some common law countries on board and others may follow.  We know that this is a delicate issue and it is important to ensure a sufficient degree of independence in the Judiciary.  If one looks to the appointment of judges, the most important element is to try to be in line with the different proposals of the Council of Europe.  Certainly, there have been many recommendations from the Venice commission on this in terms of how it is possible to organise the Commission's involvement in the process of presenting candidates to the authorities.  That is really the most important element.  As I said on the reforms, we have seen good progress in limiting the number of candidates so we do not have such large discretion for the authorities.</p><p>I fully understand the difficulties with organising the process.  We want to be sure it is possible to take into account the recommendations coming from the Council of Europe.  I note there are some discussions on the revised judicial appointments Bill.  Let me stress it is important that the reform takes into account the Council of Europe recommendations.  It is always possible to contact the Commission on this.  Within the Council of Europe various countries have various systems and legal cultures.</p><p> With regard to money laundering, of course it is a reality that we need to be very active on having controls for civil servants at a certain level and politicians.  We have tried to develop this in the European Parliament.  It has become a tradition to have real scrutiny of the Commissioners.  I know what the Senator is speaking about.  Of course, it is very important that we reflect on the scrutiny of family members.  It is true that the entire family do not become politicians or senior civil servants but it is very important to have some scrutiny of the assets and situation of a person appointed to a specific function.  I have taken note of the Senator's remarks.</p><p> We try to make progress on various elements and I know this is a fact in Ireland.  Through legislation on lobbyists, it is possible to have real verification on contacts between lobbyists and politicians or civil servants.  With regard to how it is possible to verify the declaration of assets, again I take into account the Senator's remarks about the possibility of elements of such verification being too intrusive if we go too far.  I must say we have had the same discussions on stabilising the process in the European institutions as perhaps there are at national level.  We will continue to exchange views on this.</p><p> There are two elements with regard to the European Court of Justice.  The first is reform to have the same kind of approach as there is in Strasbourg.  Perhaps changing some rules will be part of the conference on the future of Europe.  It is also possible simply to discuss it with the members of the Court of Justice and certainly to have a discussion or exchange with the President.  If we need to change some rules of course it will be part of the discussion on the future of the institution.</p><p> With regard to the accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, we have started negotiations on this.  It is very important.  It is a commitment in the Lisbon treaty, as the Senator has said.  It is also a commitment of the Commission.  The President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said that we want to organise the accession.  Of course, it is very important to organise a smooth process between the two courts.  Committee members know the previous discussions were on some requirements put in place by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  In recent years, in other roles, I have had contact with the presidents of the two courts.  I confirm to the committee that we want to make progress on this.  We are seeing whether it is possible to give concrete answers on the various elements put forward by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.</p><p> We will continue to discuss this because it is important that the European Union takes part in the Council of Europe as a real member.  Committee members know we work a lot with the Council of Europe.  I have said that in the preparation of our report we worked with the Venice Commission, GRECO and the entire Council of Europe.  We want to take part in the process.  Perhaps if we are members of the Council of Europe and have accession to the European Convention on Human Rights it will be easier to apply the same rules in the two courts in Luxembourg and Strasbourg.  Again, if it would require modifying the treaties it will be a task for the conference on the future of Europe.  I thank Senator McDowell for the exchange.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.957" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1552" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021030900002#G00200"><p>I thank the Commissioner for taking the time to address us this afternoon.  We listened to the report with regard to Ireland and have taken note of what the Commissioner has had to say.  There is no room for complacency and we appreciate what the Commissioner has to say with regard to this country.</p> <p>  On reform of the judicial appointments system, it would be fair to say that the system has served us very well since the foundation of the State.  There have never been major issues about our judges, the separation of powers and judicial appointments.  However, there is no room for complacency.  We also note what the Commissioner has to say regarding the PIF directive.  As parliamentarians we will act on this.</p> <p>  As the Chair has said, we have received many submissions on the rule of law as part of our investigation of this issue.  I note the Commissioner mentioned four pillars, namely, the independence, quality and efficiency of the judicial system, an anti-corruption framework, media pluralism and media freedom, and other institutional checks and balances.  Is the Commissioner satisfied that the four pillars cover all of the rule of law issues?  In one of our submissions, or perhaps in a few of them, reference was made to the Venice Commission's 2016 checklist.  I want to know that the rule of law report encompasses all the various issues that need to be investigated as far as we are concerned, for example, data collection and monitoring.  This is one example from the Venice Commission's checklist.</p> <p>  Much of our deliberation so far has not been in respect of Ireland but in respect of other EU member states.  In particular, I mention Hungary, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria.  Is the Commissioner satisfied that the tools for monitoring and sanctioning non-compliance are adequate?  In his contribution, the Commissioner listed the various tools at the disposal of the Commission, including Article 7.  Certainly some of the MEPs told us they are not satisfied that the tools at the Commission's disposal are satisfactory.  I am thinking in particular about meetings of the European Council and the issue of qualified majority voting where unanimity is needed.  It has been suggested that there has been backsliding by some EU member states in enforcing the rule of law.  I am interested to know the Commissioner's views on this, if he feels he can comment on it.  I hope he can.  Perhaps this is something that could be looked at in the context of the conference on the future of Europe, with regard to whether qualified majority voting needs to be looked at in the context of this issue, whereby the member states at which the finger is pointed refuse to go along with whatever sanctions are proposed.</p> <p>  With regard to the EU recovery fund being linked to the rule of law, where stands this now?  I know there was a compromise to get it over the line and get the EU recovery fund in place.  Is the drawdown of these funds still a mechanism that can be used in this regard?</p> <p>  I want to mention the question of LGBTI+ free zones in Poland.  This is an issue that is debated regularly in our Parliament and it is something we abhor.  I hope the European Commission is acting on it to do something about it.</p> <p>  My next question is on the future of Europe and the whole question of a multispeed Europe.  The EU is an economic union but it is also a union based on common values.</p><p>If some member states do not adhere to those common values, is there scope for having a multi-speed Europe or for some states breaking away to advance the rule of law situation?  I am interested to know about that because we have a problem with some member states.  Undoubtedly, the Commissioner will be diplomatic in his response, but there is a problem and I wonder if the concept of a multi-speed Europe comes into play if the problem is not resolved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.959" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Didier Reynders" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021030900002#H00200"><p>First, I do not want to repeat what I have said about the judicial appointments.  I know there are different cultures in the different member states, but we must be in full compliance with the standards on which we have agreed, not only in the EU but in the Council of Europe.  There are many difficult discussions about the way forward for the judicial appointments.  A consultation of the Venice Commission is always very interesting.  We took note of some improvement.  Now we are sure that there are some discussions about the composition of the Commission able to propose some candidates.</p> <p>  About the EU financial interest, I am thankful for the intention to go forward with the approval of the transposition of the PIF directive because that is the goal.</p> <p>  I will respond to the Deputy's different questions.  First, of course I will say that I am quite satisfied about the four pillars due to the fact that we have received a very positive reaction in all the member states.  The Deputy mentioned four member states, but I want to insist that in all the member states we have had very good co-operation in the preparation of the report to the end, in the last check of the facts in the final document that we provided to member states.  Of course, the report is the assessment of the Commission.  It is not a joint assessment between the governments and the Commission.  We are working on a very solid methodology.  That is very clear.  We have discussed the methodology with the contact person of the 27 member states and we want to continue to work on the same methodology, on the same four pillars.</p> <p>  However, I wish to add three elements with regard to what the Deputy said.  First, there are other instruments.  This year we will have a report on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  If we discuss minority rights or different other fundamental rights issues, it will be possible to assess that in the report on the charter for fundamental rights.  It is a separate issue with regard to the rule of law report.  We will have more discussions about the European democracy action plan and about democracy.  It is also a specific process.  At the end, we have a discussion on all the elements of Article 2 of the treaty - the rule of law, democracy and the fundamental rights.  However, in the rule of law report, to be honest, the first proposal in my mind, not that of the entire college, was to discuss the justice system first.  If there is a rule of law system, the most important element is to be able to go to an independent, qualified and efficient judge to seek a correct application of the law.  If one is organised by the law, that is the most important element.  We have added the corruption framework, the anti-corruption framework, the media freedom and the checks and balances.  Again, it is possible to discuss other issues.  We have received a positive reaction from all the member states, with some action plans and some reforms to try to improve the situation.  I will go back to that.  We have had, as well, some usual suspects with more hesitation to having a positive reaction on what we brought.</p> <p>  As to the non-compliance, it is not by coincidence that we have two Article 7 procedures at present, regarding Poland on the request of the Commission and Hungary on the request of the European Parliament.  Again, we will try to use all the tools at our disposal to have full compliance in all member states with the rule of law.  The report is a dialogue, and it is a well-performing instrument with many member states.  In the second report, we will explain the response from the member states and what is possible to see as an improvement due to the real dialogue that we have with the member states.</p> <p>  Of course, we are going further and forward with the infringement proceedings under Article 7.  As the Deputy said, Article 7 is a difficult mechanism due to the majority rules, qualified majority or unanimity at the end to take a decision.  It is true that we need to improve the situation.  It is the reason we now have the conditionality.  There is not only the work of referral, it is a conditionality with the MFF and the next generation EU, so the entire budget from the beginning of this year.  The new regulation is in force since 1 January, so we will check the situation in all the member states from 1 January.  We have said that we will provide some guidelines about the way to organise the process.  Certainly, it is an important part of the guidelines to protect the final beneficiaries.  If we want to suspend or to stop the funding of some policies, it is not to organise stopping the financing of, for example, all the farmers in the agricultural policy or the NGOs involved in the protection of the rule of law.  It is nonsense to do that.  We need to see how it is possible to protect the final beneficiaries - not all if there are problems, but the majority of the final beneficiaries.</p> <p>  However, the Deputy is right.  It is possible to think about another kind of majority.  The majority rules are an important element.  We are coming from unanimity to qualified majority in many policies.  Also, on the conditionality now, it will be possible for the Council or on the proposal of the Commission to decide on qualified majority.  In the first proposal of the Commission in 2018, we tried to work with the reverse qualified majority, like in the macroeconomic surveillance.  Perhaps, as the Deputy said, in the conference on the future of Europe it will be possible to discuss again what kind of majority rules in some fields, not only qualified majority but maybe reverse qualified majority, simple majority or absolute majority if it is possible in some fields.  However, it is a very sensitive issue in all member states.  In the minds of many people it is a transfer of sovereignty to the European Union when one changes the majority rules.  It is true that we need to be more efficient about the verification of the rule of law.</p> <p>  I want to insist on the conditionalities of the new instrument.  We will have, perhaps, a decision of the Court of Justice about that on the request of Poland or Hungary in the near future, but it is already possible to stop some funding of different policies.  The Deputy mentioned LGBTI+ free zones in Poland.  It was decided by a European agency to stop the funding of some twinnings between those municipalities and other European municipalities due to the decision to have such a free zone.  It is nonsense to have that.  It is real discrimination.  On the basis of the charter for fundamental rights, we already have the possibility of suspending funding in a specific case.  The town twinning last year was a real issue when those municipalities in Poland decided to organise free zones.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to multi-speed or different formats at European level.  This is not new.  The Deputy knows that some member states take part in Schengen and some non-member states are members of Schengen, but not all the member states are in Schengen.  It is the same for the eurozone.  Of course, there is an evolution to have more members of the eurozone, but there is also some possible opting out.  There are some member states out of the eurozone.  It is the same, as I said, with regard to the EPPO.  We have 22 participating member states.  However, I am not sure it is a good idea to work with multi-speed.  It may be possible to take some member states together in some policies, not in all if it is not the real intention for all the member states.  At the end, the goal must be to have real integration.</p> <p>  Again, in the discussions on the future of Europe, to conclude on the Deputy's remarks, it will be important to think, and it is a personal idea, about how it will be possible to take new members on board the European Union.  The Deputy knows that we have some discussions with candidates, such as in the Western Balkans.  Is it possible to do that for some policies, not maybe a majority for all?  Again, it is not new.  We already have that for Schengen, the eurozone and for some instruments such as the EPPO.  I know that when we are discussing freedom and security it is about opting out for some member states.  The Deputy knows that better than me.  Again, it is a possibility to discuss.</p><p>I thank for the Deputy for his remarks.  Part of those remarks were dedicated to the future of the institutions and the organisation of the EU.  The Irish Parliament can take part in the Conference on the Future of Europe.</p></speech>

The European Union and the Commission are looking at every facility to ensuring maintenance of the rule of law.  I welcome the fact Mr. Reynders spoke about how twinning funding has been removed.  From 1 January with the multi-annual budgeting and all major funding, conditionality will be built in.  How exactly will this process go for a member state which is involved in a major breach of these rule of law issues?</p> <p>  When we had a number of engagements with MEPs, some of them said they welcomed the fact that there were rule of law actions taken against some of these countries involved in brutal breaches of EU law and decency.  They also spoke about some other issues, such as in Spain where Catalonian politicians have been detrimentally impacted in what is seen by many as anti-democratic action.  While I understand the Commissioner might not be able to give the complete answer I am looking for on that, some MEPs have pointed out the law will apply to certain member states which breach rules but not to all.  That is unacceptable if we are talking about a rule of law ethos.</p> <p>  How does one deal with breaches of rule of law by former member states?  Will Mr. Reynders give an update on the infringement proceedings regarding the British Government's unilateral action in the past week?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.962" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Didier Reynders" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021030900002#J00300"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; described different kind of situations concerning rule of law.  Concerning the measures we will take, we will organise the process with the use of all the tools at our disposal.  These are in the treaties.  Article 7 concerning infringement proceedings and the report of conditionality are more tools.  We have had conditionality since 1 January.  There were many concerns that it was not evident we had efficient tools in the case of, as the Deputy said, brutal and severe breaches to the rule of law.</p> <p>  We need to continue to improve our instruments and have better possibilities to act.  We have had success with some infringement proceedings.  We have received positive answers from the European Court of Justice.  For example, we continue to go to the court about the independence of the Polish Judiciary.  We will continue to do that when necessary.  We have asked for interim measures about the disciplinary proceedings against judges in Poland.  We continue to organise such a process.</p> <p>  However, it is true that it is very possible for more efficient tools in the future with other kinds of majority rules when we need to decide about Article 7 or conditionality.  It is a fresh new instrument and we will analyse the situation in other member states.</p> <p>  The Deputy compared the situation in other member states and Spain.  It is an internal constitutional issue with Spain and a discussion between the provinces and the national authority.  If I may make a comparison, we did not see any problem in the UK when it was possible between Scotland and London to agree on a consultation with the population.  It was organised and then we saw the result which was possible to take into account.  One needs to organise that in full compliance with the constitutional rules in the country in question.</p> <p>  Again, in Spain, we have said all the time that it is firstly a constitutional issue.  About sanctions against Spain because of some breaches to the different rules, the Deputy is speaking about Spain and criminal legislation.  I do not have to insist on the fact that it is a very sensitive national issue.  The Deputy knows that because it is one of the reasons there is some opting out in some member states when we discuss criminal issues and when we put into place an institution like the European Public Prosecutor's Office.  I know there are differences.  We try in different ways to harmonise the situation and to put together some elements of criminal law.  For example, we have a list of Euro crimes in which we have proposed to extend the list to hate speech and hate crime.  If one does that, then it is possible to harmonise the situation.  It is a very sensitive situation in many member states.  We need to take into account the situation there.</p> <p>  On the UK and the possible infringement proceedings, we ask the UK to respect all the commitments taken with the European Union in the past several months.  I am thinking first about the respect for the withdrawal agreement.  It is key of course.  We do not want to have any hesitation if it needs to go to action with relations with the UK.  It could be infringement proceedings or the possibility to go to an arbitrator.  It is important to continue to insist on the fact that we ask a very clear and correct application of all the agreements between the European Union and the UK.</p> <p>  We have seen in recent days again some discussion about the extension of the grace on food products decided by the UK.  Again, we have had a reaction and we are very open to taking action when it is needed. It is important to us to be able to act in the withdrawal agreement, in the trade agreement or maybe tomorrow another kind of agreement.  We ask for full respect for what it is signed by the two parties.  If we are concerned about that, we will take action.</p></speech>

On the European Commission and European Union level, they are dealing with the tech firms, such as Facebook and Twitter.  At this time, we are dealing with a huge amount of unchecked conspiracy theories and other such pieces of information that are thrown up without any particular checking.  We are talking about people who are vilely attacked online.  There are people who end up down a rabbit hole because, if they keep liking certain materials on a social platform, they keep getting fed it.  This leads to some of the situations we have here.  What initiatives does the European Commission want to use to deal with this issue?  Online publication is absolutely uncontrolled at this time.  Obviously, there is a responsibility on tech firms to do something about this.</p></speech>

We have a code of conduct with the major platforms to try to remove hate speech from them.  It started with terrorist content.  That was the most important issue at the beginning but we have tried to develop that in a code of conduct.  Now we have adopted at Commission level the Digital Services Act, DSA, to go further with obligations to the platforms.  There are discussions between the co-legislators to put the DSA in place.  It is not just about hate speech.  We will try to go further with an extension of the Eurocrime list.  That has unanimity at Council level and I am sure we will have the support of Ireland on the extension of the list.  Then we need to discuss what sort to reaction is needed against disinformation.  It is different when speaking about illegal content like hate speech as opposed to legal content such as false information going to the public.  We are working in DSA on this and will continue to see how it is possible to take new initiatives on this.  We have seen in Europe and other parts of the world the problems we have.  We want to have rules on this.  We do not want to leave it in the hands of private companies organising their business on social media.  We want rules and the first goal of the Digital Services Act is to organise that.</p></speech>

I will ask a couple of questions as I do not see any other member indicating.  First, I will make a point to the Commissioner.  In our overview of the law in the European Union, an enormous focus of the submissions we have received has been in relation to the perceived impunity of some countries in taking legal actions against their citizens in a way that to us violates the norms and values of the European Union.  I welcome the Commissioner's explanation of how these things will be tackled but I think we need to ensure our own citizenry understands those values will be defended robustly.</p> <p>  On the media platforms, I have a related but different question from Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  We have enacted in Ireland in the last number of months anti-harassment and online bullying legislation.  The debate has focused on the notion that there must be a responsibility on providers of the platforms for such damaging actions.  Maybe that is encompassed in the proposals the Commissioner has spoken about but I would be interested in hearing that the media platforms, similar to any publisher, would be responsible for bullying, harassing or damaging commentary about any individual.  Will there be scope to take action against them?</p> <p>  On the Commissioner's report on our domestic situation, I as Minister introduced the Regulation of Lobbying Act and it is a robust piece of legislation.  The final piece of legislation I introduced in that sphere in 2016 was the ethics in public offices Bill.  It was an amendment Bill which was passed at Second Stage but has never been reintroduced.  The Commission might have a look at raising that with the Irish authorities.  It is an important final stage, learning from everything we can learn from, including commissions of inquiry and so on.</p> <p>  On the European Public Prosecutor's Office, I am interested to hear where that is.  It was to be established in 2017.  The latest date I saw was this month.  Is it to commence operations in Luxembourg this month?  Two impediments were described by our Government to account for our non-participation.  The first was the point the Commissioner made in relation to us being a common law jurisdiction and the difficulties in that regard.  The second was a constitutional difficulty which may require a constitutional amendment here.  I do not know if the Commissioner has had those discussions with the Irish authorities and can enlighten the committee on those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.966" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Didier Reynders" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021030900002#K00300"><p>On the explanation on the different regulations in recent years about lobbying, it is important and it is a difficult and sensitive issue in all institutions including the European institutions, but we are trying to organise a real process.  On ethics, I have seen that the Irish Government has said it will go further forward with reforms of the code of ethics but it is in the Government's hands and in the national discussion.  We will continue to monitor that in the next report.</p> <p>  On the European Public Prosecutor's Office, I am trying to start the operation as soon as possible.  In my mind it was yesterday.  We have appointed a chief prosecutor, Laura K&ouml;vesi, with an agreement between the Council and the Parliament.  After the summer of last year, we appointed the college of prosecutors with prosecutors coming from all member states.  There is a college in Luxembourg.  Now we need implementing legislation in all member states but we have been waiting for that for three years.  We need the appointment of the delegate prosecutors in the member states to work with the college in Luxembourg.  At the moment we are trying to convince the last member states to be in full compliance with their obligations.  We have seen the crisis in Italy so that may be the last participating member state where it will be possible to move.  I am sure it will start in the first semester of this year but not this month because we need to have full compliance of all member states on the implementing legislation and the appointment of the delegate prosecutor.  That is why I said it is important for non-participating member states like Ireland to adopt the implementing legislation to transpose the PIF directive.</p> <p>   There are some common law countries in the EPPO process, such as Malta and Cyprus, so it is possible to see the differences and the different ways to organise a process, but why not Ireland?  If there is a need for constitutional change, it is difficult and takes some time but it is possible.  In Sweden, they decided some years ago to opt out but now they are discussing the possibility of going to the parliament next year with draft legislation to take part in the EPPO.  We are open to explaining and discussing how it is possible for all common law member states to become a member and the process involved.  First, we want Ireland to be a good partner to the EPPO.  I am sure that will be the case.</p> <p>  On media platforms, it is a long process with the code of conduct and with decisions taken at European level.  Due to the Paris attacks it was possible to work with the platforms to rapidly remove any terrorist content.  There are many discussions about doing the same with regard to child sexual abuse.  During the pandemic, we have seen an increase in criminality on the web and we are trying to work more closely on that.  We are doing the same for the safety of products because we have seen more and more sales online.  We are working with the platforms but with the Digital Services Act it will be possible to put an obligation on the platforms to remove illegal content, such as hate speech.  With the level playing field, this will not only be the major platforms, but all platforms.  We are working in the same way with regard to the safety of products and we will have the possibility of imposing financial sanctions for a huge amount of money if they do not deliver.  We will continue to do that with new obligations and maybe with new so-called pledges.</p><p>We may ask some platforms to do more than the legislation and to continue to work with us about the disinformation and illegal content with real effect.  The Vice Chairman spoke about harassment.  It is a difficult issue because sometimes one message on social media is not illegal content, but if there are many different kinds of legal messages together about one person in the same way then we have harassment of one person.  We have seen that happen with some young people and children with very difficult consequences.  It may be possible to then take that into account when discussing it with the platform.  It would be useful for the platform in such a new sort of criminal offence to use artificial intelligence to detect promptly the situation.  It is about working on this.</p><p> On the perceived impunity of some member states, it is the goal of the Rule of Law Report to show that we tried to do the job to deliver in the EU first because it is very important to protect the shared values such as those we put in the treaties.  The Union is a union of values.  I am aware that there are many discussions about the Internal Market and the economic development in the EU but the EU is first of all is a political union with shared values among the member states.  We need to verify the full respect of those values.</p><p> For conditionality we organised a process to verify compliance with the values before the accession, but not so much afterwards.  We are now working more on a mechanism to continue to verify the full compliance with the values, as we would verify the full compliance with the economic criteria from the Maastricht treaty, for example.  This is why we have Article 7, the infringement proceedings, the Rule of Law Report and the new mechanisms about the conditionality.  I must insist that it is also very important to do the job at home in the EU to be credible when we try to say something if we see something odd about the European Union.  If we do not show to our partners in the world that we are delivering our message in the EU about the values, it will become difficult to express some criticism against different kinds of powers.  To be concrete, just before this meeting we had a college meeting with the US envoy on climate, Mr. John Kerry, as a guest.  We discussed the rule of law on both sides of the Atlantic.  If we want to say something about the situation in the US, or about the situation in many places in the world, we need to show that we are able to do the job at home in the European Union.  There is a real problem, however, about such a kind of perceived impunity as the Vice Chairman has said.  It is the reason that discussions such as we are having today, and the presentation of the Rule of Law Report, are so important.</p></speech>

I welcome everybody and acknowledge the logistical challenge with which we are faced, which is testament to the great advance in communications technology.</p> <p>  The purpose of our meeting this afternoon is to hear from witnesses on the current humanitarian situation in Syria.  As we approach the tenth anniversary of a situation that has decimated the country and its people, I and the committee believe it is important we have the opportunity of hearing first hand the effects of what has been a dreadful conflict on the people of Syria, particularly those displaced from their homes and their communities both internally across Syria and internationally across the wider region.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I am very pleased to welcome representatives from Tr&oacute;caire, SAWA for Development and Aid, GOAL, Oxfam, Concern and World Vision.  I particularly welcome Mr. Niall O&rsquo;Keeffe of Tr&oacute;caire, Mr. Nasser Alheraki, Mr. Moutaz Adham and Dr. Rouba Mhaissen who are joining us from Syria, Lebanon and Turkey.</p> <p>  On a housekeeping matter, I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, I would ask witnesses to discontinue their remarks.  It goes without saying that they will comply with such a direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations in respect of parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who may be physically present.  In this regard, witnesses who are participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should always be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence given or tendered.</p> <p>  I thank the members for joining us, albeit remotely.  I remind them of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting by dint of their being physically located in the Leinster House complex, and I know all of them are.  For anybody watching this meeting online, some Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting from a remote perspective.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everybody to bear with us in the event of any technical issue arising that may pose a challenge.</p> <p>  It gives me great pleasure to call on Mr. Niall O'Keeffe to make his opening statement and to introduce us to our panel of speakers.  After hearing from them, members of the committee will have an opportunity to ask questions, make observations and deal with issues accordingly.  Mr. O'Keeffe is very welcome.</p></speech>

Ten years ago this month civil protests escalated quickly into a civil war and since that time Syria has become and remains one of the world's largest, most deadly and most complex humanitarian crisis.  Hundreds of thousands of people, and by some estimates more than half a million, have been killed and more than half the population of 23 million people have been displaced from their homes.  The lives of many Syrians have changed significantly and for the worst.  Our five organisations have prepared a joint briefing document for the committee, which I hope it received and which outlines our priorities.</p> <p>  When we were preparing for this meeting, we thought it would be extremely valuable if the committee could hear first hand from our Syrian colleagues who come with lived experience and significant expertise.  We have provided the committee with a biography of each of three speakers.  To introduce them, the committee will first hear from Mr. Nasser Alheraki, the area co-ordinator for GOAL in north-west Syria, followed by Mr. Moutaz Adham, the country director for Oxfam in Syria, and, lastly, followed by Dr. Rouba Mhaissen, the director of a Syrian organisation called SAWA for Development and Aid, which is a Tr&oacute;caire partner organisation.  Each speaker will provide a short input of approximately five minutes each, following which we look forward to discussion with the committee members.</p> <p>  Before we begin, it is also important for us to highlight that as humanitarian organisations in the course of our discussions with the committee, we may face some challenges in commenting publicly or even in depth on the politics of the current situation.</p><p>The safety of our staff and colleagues is critical for us.  Our primary focus is on the provision of principled humanitarian assistance to those who are affected by the crisis.  With that in mind I will now hand over to Mr. Alheraki.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.978" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nasser Alheraki" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021030900002#B00200"><p>I thank Mr. O'Keeffe for that introduction.  I am an area co-ordinator with GOAL in north-west Syria.  I was born and raised in Aleppo in Syria.  I graduated from Ebla University in banking and financial science.  Before the start of the war I volunteered with the Red Crescent in Aleppo and I continued my humanitarian work in Aleppo during the first two years of the war.  In August 2013, after the arbitrary arrest of my 15-year-old brother Nahel, and continuous pressure on my family from the security forces, we were forced to flee our home and arrived in Turkey.</p> <p>  It was not easy at first to learn a new culture and language, and to start a new life.  We really hoped we could eventually go back to our country.  However, engaging with the community and understanding the local way of life made it less difficult for us in more recent years.  </p> <p>  In my role with GOAL I travel between Turkey and north-west Syria every week to work with our programme beneficiaries, our local staff and our implementing partners.  We work in Idlib and northern Aleppo within an area that is roughly the size of County Galway.  More than 4 million people live in Idlib and northern Aleppo under fear of shelling and bombardments.  Over half of this population was displaced to this area from other areas of the country.  Many had to escape conflict several times.  Women and children make up the largest part of this population.  In each location I visit, I meet people who were forced to leave their homes, and who lost family members, relatives and friends.</p> <p>  Over 500,000 civilians have lost their lives in this war.  More than 400 humanitarian aid workers have been reported killed in the past ten years, but I suspect this number may be much higher.  GOAL lost four of our colleagues: Nihad Alkadi; Zeiad Abdulhay; Hayyan Ramadan; and Mustafa Shoib.  God bless their souls.  </p> <p>  Memories of loss are countless.  Each person is a dictionary of painful stories.  It is not possible to imagine the number of times people I meet were forced to leave different locations to escape attacks and faced the cold in the streets, with no access to shelter or food.</p> <p>  We in GOAL strive to provide humanitarian assistance for the most vulnerable people in this area.  We help to deliver clean piped water.  We supply food, basic needs and emergency relief to these communities who have nothing to fall back on.  These people have had to survive the harsh winter weather and the coronavirus outbreak in unfinished buildings or in crowded camps.  Last year GOAL and its partners reached more than 1.3 million people in Idlib and northern Aleppo with food assistance.  About 1 million of this population also received water from the 66 water stations that GOAL has supported and that supply 123 locations in Idlib.</p> <p>  This situation cannot continue for much longer.  Unless a peaceful solution to the conflict is found, no amount of humanitarian aid will be enough.  The co-ordinated delivery of humanitarian assistance is also at risk now.  Ireland has a unique role to play today in making a difference for millions of people in Syria who have no means of survival other than humanitarian aid.  As a co-penholder of the humanitarian file for Syria on the UN Security Council and as one of the world's foremost peacekeepers, Ireland can stress the importance of an immediate solution to the conflict and work to ensure that aid delivery corridors are kept open.  </p> <p>  Despite the passing of ten years, we still lack any kind of solutions for Syrian families caught in the line of fire.  If the UN Security Council decides to stop mandating the only remaining cross-border humanitarian aid corridor into north-west Syria in July, the timely and efficient delivery of assistance will be very difficult to maintain.  The UN&rsquo;s co-ordinating role will end and international humanitarian funding for north-west Syria, which is already in decline, may decrease further.</p> <p>  Mark Lowcock, the UN emergency relief co-ordinator, recently noted that efforts to establish a cross-line delivery mechanism from Damascus to north-west Syria have failed.  From my experience of humanitarian work in Aleppo in the first two years of the war, this is not surprising.  I also know that the families I meet in north-west Syria will find it difficult to accept assistance that is overseen from Damascus, given how much they have suffered from war planes that come from the same direction.</p> <p>  I am aware that this is only part of the discussion, and that the UN Security Council decision will be debated behind closed doors, between countries that may be diplomatic rivals.  However, as someone who sees the growing hardship on the ground every week, I can only stress that humanitarian access should follow humanitarian need and not politics.  Ireland now has the opportunity to be the voice of humanitarianism in the Security Council - to speak with humanitarians, for humanitarians and for humanity.  Perhaps the voice of compassion alone will not end this crisis, but this voice might help to ensure we can ease the suffering of people who have nowhere to escape.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for its support for GOAL and for giving me the opportunity to speak today.</p></speech>

My remarks today will focus primarily on humanitarian access and approaches, and perhaps build on what has already been shared by my colleague, the previous speaker.</p> <p>  In this context, and to add to what others have said, I again underline the importance of unhindered humanitarian access in Syria for humanitarian actors responding to save lives and build the resilience of people.  Protecting the health, well-being and dignity of those in need is an obligation on all parties in a conflict.</p><p>It is universally accepted under international humanitarian law.  This, of course, applies to the different modality of aid delivery in Syria - cross-border, that is, across international borders or across conflict lines or perhaps within the same areas of control.  In the past, Oxfam has been able to deliver aid across conflict lines in the south of Syria in Dar'a and the north of Syria in Aleppo but we know that certain communities will not be reachable from Damascus.  As such, all modality of operations is still very much needed.  We ask that Ireland continues to be an important voice in promoting humanitarian access, which is complementary in all of its forms as an enabler of our work as aid agencies through the platform of the UN Security Council and beyond.  This has never been more important in the context of collapsed health systems, damaged water and sanitation infrastructure essential to good hygiene practices and crowded displaced persons' camps and the threat of Covid-19.  </p><p> It is important to stress that there are many dimensions of humanitarian access.  In Syria, it is possible to deliver a principled humanitarian response from Damascus, although it is fraught with difficulties that exacerbate human suffering and that we believe there are ways to overcome.  Humanitarian access amidst shifting lines and hostilities involving multiple entities - even entities with changing allegiances and identities - requires constant context analysis and negotiation based on mutual understanding of neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian action.  In our experience, this can take anywhere from one week to several weeks to, in a few instances, months.  In some instances, we have simply not been able to negotiate access at all.  Such complexity and delay means that it is too late for communities and often beyond the patience of short-term emergency funding from donors.  Critical for operational agencies is the important funding we see from donors that provides us with the flexibility to respond to needs on the ground as and when access permits.  Access is not only access of humanitarian actors to vulnerable communities.  It is also the access of vulnerable communities to the aid they deem critical, including aid that supports their early recovery and resilience building, something many donors are still reluctant to support.  As a respected member of the donor community, Ireland can be an important voice for flexible and predictable humanitarian funding enshrined in the principles of good humanitarian donorship, including commitment to provide funding to the third pillar of the Syria humanitarian response plan.  </p><p> These same principles of good humanitarian donorship affirm the role of civil society organisations in providing humanitarian assistance on the basis of need without discrimination, particularly in situations of armed conflict.  To fulfil this role, it should be emphasised that humanitarian access must not be a one-off event but a continuous process of engagement of those we seek to assist.  This provides space to hear their voices and the design of the "who, where, how, what and when" of aid provided and, critically, to understand from their perspective whether this has proven effective.  As mentioned earlier, operating in Syria is possible but it is extremely complex.  There has been much improvement in access through continuous engagement of international NGOs from Damascus with the government of Syria, including with local authorities.  Much more could still be done diplomatically by both the UN system and states and their donor bodies to impress on the government of Syria the necessity of this type of access.  In other contexts, this engagement would be normal.  However, in the Syrian context and due to the positions of non-engagement with the government of Syria by many countries, the burden of much of that is being put on the shoulders of humanitarian actors alone.  We welcome Ireland's support for these diplomatic efforts.  </p><p> I have spoken about humanitarian aid and access.  Justifiable attention here and debate over the preconditions for the safe return of those displaced in and outside of Syria as well as the country's reconstruction have nonetheless deflected attention from alternative approaches.  Approaches such as early recovery and resilience building of vulnerable populations are in other contexts globally part of any humanitarian response.  In the Syrian context, the humanitarian response has been for the most part narrowed to basic life-saving emergency response and early recovery and resilience building of the population has been conflated with the very political subject of reconstruction.  I refer specifically to efforts to reduce dependency on aid and consider more dignified and sustainable solutions.  This includes efforts to ensure vulnerable Syrians have sustainable access to basic services, resume income-generating opportunities, restore their capacity to observe and recover from further shocks and crises and strengthen the social fabric of a country strained by ten years of conflict.  Focus on such an approach, which should accommodate the critical shift in women's roles to primary or sole breadwinners for their families, is now being accelerated by increasing poverty levels estimated at more than 90% of the population and likely to continue to increase through 2021 given the country's and worldwide economic crisis, the decreasing purchasing power of households, the debilitating effects of Covid-19 and the impact of sanctions on the country.  </p><p> Viable livelihood opportunities must be accompanied by a secure environment and the availability of basic social infrastructure and services for which responsibility will ultimately have to be steered by local authorities.  There is a demand for the aid system as a whole to become comfortable with engagement with local government and technical line ministry structures be they in Syria or elsewhere and, specifically, that member states and relevant regulatory bodies ensure that respective measures such as sanctions and counter-terrorism provision do not hinder a more dignified, cost-effective and sustainable response across Syria.  This requires effective exemptions, clear interpretive guidance, guaranteed banking channels for the transfer of funds into Syria and a manageable level of risk sharing with implementing partners.  As a donor, thought leader and respected governor within the international community, Ireland can have a constructive voice in assisting others to avoid conflating support for building the resilience of a people living too long in a crisis with the more politicised questions of the reconstruction of Syria.  I shall conclude my remarks by referring the committee to our recent reports and statements shared prior to this meeting and am happy to answer any further questions it may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.981" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rouba Mhaissen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021030900002#D00100"><p>I will start by thanking Ireland and the Irish people for always taking just stances when it comes to wars and the plights of people such as those in Syria.  I thank the people of Ireland for showing generosity to the various campaigns that we led through Tr&oacute;caire around Christmas time and other times of year.  Tr&oacute;caire and another personal donor are the biggest donors for the efforts we lead with Syrian refugees and the internally displaced.</p> <p>  As my colleagues said, it has been ten years since the people of Syria took to the streets demanding basic rights, justice, dignity and freedom.  However, while a lot of media and politicians would like to say that the war in Syria is over because the shelling has largely stopped, the war is far from over and a difficult situation remains on Syrian soil.  It is true that Syria is not divided today in terms of territory, but it is very fragmented and there are many other division lines, as my colleague mentioned.</p> <p>  At a political level, we are unlikely to see any constitutional reforms before the elections of 2021, and if the current President of Syria is re-elected, we are unlikely to see any such reforms in the next seven years.  We can discuss the reasons for that.  There is stalling in the political process.  We are pushing for a UN security resolution to end the war with a political deal.  However, those efforts are also stalling and it is unlikely to happen because we have not seen any progress in Geneva.</p> <p>  What people do not know is that this has implications for people's lives.  Today the Syrian regime is in need of dollars which is leading it to monetise, for example, the military service.  People can pay a sum to avoid doing military service.  The regime is also pushing non-governmental organisations, NGOs, to have a bigger role as a source of income to overcome the sanctions.  All the political considerations I have mentioned have direct effects on people's lives.  More than half the Syrian population are refugees or are internally displaced, meaning they are living in tents or extremely precarious situations.  More than 80% of Syrians have high debts.  Some 13 million are in need of humanitarian assistance and 80% live under the poverty line in a country where that was unheard of before the war.</p> <p>  In neighbouring countries, for example, Lebanon, a country with already weak infrastructure, two out of three children continue to live without education.  With hyperinflation in Syria and Lebanon, the situation is very difficult and leading to a lot of black market jobs and unstable living.  With the coronavirus, refugees in these countries feel even more isolated.  That is why our interventions, with Tr&oacute;caire and others offering psychosocial support, especially for women and vulnerable categories of people, are still needed.</p> <p>  Inside Syria today, we are doing some pre- and post-return monitoring with Syrians.  Many people who go back are regretting the decision to do so.  That is due to many factors, the first of which is the matter of protection.  As I said, safety is not only about shelter from shelling and bombs.  It is not only a physical matter.  Of course, many of the people who have returned are faced with kidnapping, abduction or imprisonment based on their political leanings.  Many are also forced into military service despite that they do not want to be fighting fellow Syrians.  There is no access to basic services such as education, as my colleague from Oxfam mentioned and I will not repeat that.  Social tensions still exist.  There are housing, land and property, HLP, issues.  Many people cannot access their homes simply because their homes are not there and it takes a lot to revamp these homes because they are occupied or because they have been, unfortunately, closed by the Syrian regime.</p> <p>  All of that leads me to say that we need to continue pushing when we hear the conditions for safe, dignified and voluntary returns are in place.  Those conditions are not yet in place, and whenever we hear any European or neighbouring countries state refugees should be forced to return to Syria, we must continue to stand our ground.  We also need to continue pushing for humanitarian funding for neighbouring countries which are still taking on the majority of the burden.  If that does not happen, we might again see an influx of refugees coming illegally, endangering their lives.  In order not to see these refugees coming in such precarious ways, we need to continue pushing on the issue of resettlement.</p> <p>  As my colleague and friend Nasser said, Ireland is a penholder for humanitarian affairs to continue pushing for cross-border aid to be available.  I am speaking today to very high-level politicians and people who are involved in foreign affairs.  Ireland needs to play a leadership role in putting a political end to the war rather continuing a war that is causing the loss of too many lives.  I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently visited Iran.  I think the negotiations over the Iranian deal and the Iranian role in Syria can be used to guarantee an end to the war and a better life for Syrians, both inside and outside Syria.</p> <p>  I am happy to engage in conversation and answer any questions.  I again thank Tr&oacute;caire and everyone else for this great opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.982" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall O'Keeffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021030900002#D00200"><p>I will conclude on behalf of the whole group.  I again thank the committee members for their time today.  In the briefing document we have shared in advance, we prioritised a number of things, some of which I will briefly mention.  One relates to humanitarian access.  We feel that the key priority for the moment is securing the renewal of UN Resolution 2533 which facilitates the cross-border humanitarian access in the north west.</p> <p>  The return of refugees and internally displaced people must be voluntary, safe and dignified.  While there is a lot to be done, international funding for reconstruction must be dependent on ensuring there is a secure and inclusive environment for all Syrians in Syria.</p> <p>  Ireland pledged &euro;25 million to the humanitarian crisis in 2020, which was very welcome.  It is critical that Ireland continues, or considers increasing, that level of support in 2021, commensurate with the rising needs and vulnerabilities in Syria and among the Syrian population.</p> <p>  The peace process has, by and large, stalled.  However, Ireland, through its seat on the UN Security Council, must spare no efforts in giving voice to those Syrians who are most in need and must advocate for a lasting solution to the conflict.</p></speech>

I will now proceed to questions from members of the committee.  I do not see anybody offering immediately so I will ask Deputy Brady to lead off.  Members might indicate their keenness or desire to pose questions thereafter.  I am conscious of the fact we have a large number of panellists who will wish to elaborate further on some of the questions that will be asked.  It goes without saying that I ask members to be as concise as possible with their questions to our panellists.  I will ask Mr. O'Keeffe to distribute the questions among those he feels are best placed to answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.984" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021030900002#D00400"><p>I thank our guests for this important piece of work relating to a conflict that, unfortunately, has fallen off the political agenda.</p><p>It is not getting the international focus that it deserves.  Unfortunately, it is probably up there with other conflicts, such as Yemen, where the humanitarian crisis is reaching astronomical levels.</p><p> I want to make some comments first and then ask some specific questions.  I reiterate my total support and that of my party for UN Security Council Resolution 2254 (2015).  It is really important, especially the sections demanding that all parties take all appropriate steps to protect civilians, including members of ethnic, religious and confessional communities.  The resolution stresses in this regard that the primary responsibility to protect the population lies with the Syrian authorities and that the only sustainable solution to the current crisis in Syria is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.  It is really important to state that.</p><p> Unfortunately, what is happening in Syria is not good.  As I see it, this has become a geopolitical issue.  I call on all the international players to step back from the conflict and allow the Syrian people to negotiate a peaceful settlement through constitutional change.  In referring to international players it is important to state all of them, including Iran, Russia, Israel, USA, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar.  Through their involvement they have probably added to the duration of this conflict.</p><p> The UN special envoy for Syria has engaged in a gruesome block of work in terms of the constitutional reform committee.  I know the committee met again for the fifth time in January.  Slow progress, if any, is being made in respect of the face-to-face talks between the government and opposition parties on the drafting of a new constitution.  I implore the Government to use its influence to ensure all players engage in that committee fully.  Ultimately, it is the only solution to the conflict.</p><p> Another major ask relates to the continuation of cross-border humanitarian aid and UN Security Council Resolution 2533 (2020).  That needs to be continued.  I know that is up again in July.</p><p> The crisis - what is happening on the ground in Syria - is appalling.  All the figures have been given out.  Some 13 million ordinary people are in need of humanitarian assistance.  The number of people internally displaced and displaced in adjoining countries is terrible.  These people should have the right to return.  This is something that I totally support.</p><p> I congratulate the NGOs on their work on the ground in providing humanitarian assistance.  They are all doing fantastic work that must be supported and I absolutely support it.</p><p> I am keen to hone in on the issue of sanctions, how that is impacting on the distribution of humanitarian aid for people who need it most.  Unfortunately, it is a tool that has been used in other previous conflicts, such as in Iraq.  We know the human cost of sanctions that were imposed.  UNICEF has spoken of how 500,000 children, unfortunately, have died as a result of sanctions.  Some sanctions are targeted.  Unfortunately, what we have seen is the imposition of unilateral sanctions.</p><p> Specific work has been carried out by the UN rapporteurs to examine the sanctions issue.  A report was produced in 2018 by the now-deceased Idriss Jazairy.  He said that unilateral sanctions which restrict nearly any financial transaction or which seek to prevent third countries from engaging in legal trade with a country were an illegal and immoral form of coercion, especially when such actions harm the human rights of people living in targeted countries.  He went on to say in reference to Syria that the complex financial sanctions prevented government and humanitarian actors from buying food, medicine and spare parts for water pumps or electrical generators from western countries, thus imposing further suffering on innocent civilians.  He made a specific call on states to address this issue by creating a UN-led procurement mechanism that would provide for the human rights of civilians.  He went on to talk about other countries in which these unilateral sanctions are imposed.  He has since passed away and the current rapporteur is Alena Douhan.  In a recently published report she said some other humanitarian organisations have complained because their humanitarian work aimed to deliver medicine, medical equipment and food to Syria.  However, during the pandemic, this has been frozen as have the bank accounts of their personnel.  All of this is due to secondary sanctions that are being imposed.  We know how the imposition of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 in July last year will deepen the humanitarian crisis and impact on the rebuilding of Syria.</p><p> Some specific questions stem from this.  We know the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance.  How is the imposition of unilateral sanctions impacting on the excellent work that the NGOs are doing?  Is it impeding their work in terms of some of the issues that have been highlighted by the UN rapporteurs?</p><p> The Caesar Act is relevant.  We know people have been internally displaced and others have been displaced in other countries.  They can come back home.  However, if they end up in a refugee camp it is not an ideal situation.  The Act is aimed at stopping the reconstruction of Syria.  How do the NGO representatives see the Act playing out?  How do they see what has been described as immoral, illegal unilateral?  How are the sanctions impacting on humanitarian work in Syria?</p></speech>

I will call on Deputy Stanton and Deputy Clarke.  We will then go back to our panel to deal with Deputy Brady's questions and the questions I anticipate coming from other members.  Then I will start the next round with Senator Joe O'Reilly.  We will hear from Deputy Stanton followed by Deputy Clarke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.987" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021030900002#E00300"><p>I welcome our guests to the meeting.  I thank them for being here and for the work they are doing.  We should always at this time think of all the people who have died in the past ten years in the conflict and the suffering that has gone on.  It is important that we have this meeting because, as Deputy Brady said, this has gone off the political radar here.  It is important that we refresh the minds of the people in Ireland on what is happening in Syria.</p> <p>  The Chairman and myself in our former roles have met many Syrians who have come here as refugees and settled here.  We set up a committee sponsorship programme last year.  I call on colleagues to look at that again.  People can come here as refugees, settle into communities in Ireland and start a new life.  Many people came from Lebanon.  I know that mention was made of Lebanon and Jordan and those countries were under extraordinary pressure.  However, at least there is no war happening there.</p> <p>  Someone said that the war is not over year in Syria and people are still in terrible danger.  People who go back may not be safe either.  I take note of what was said with respect to returnees and people not being forced back.  They may be interrogated or worse if they do so in certain circumstances.</p> <p>  Can the NGO representatives comment on the role of the Covid-19 virus in northern Syria?  We have been asked to highlight the need for the vaccines to be made available there.</p><p>How might that be done?  What is the role of the virus there?  Has it taken hold?  What has been its impact?  Is it possible to get the various vaccines in there to vaccinate people so that at least there is some protection against that, the other enemy that is out there.  I note the remarks concerning high deaths and 80% below the poverty level.  I hear people in Ireland bandy about words like catastrophic and disastrous, who say things are awful and terrible.  I do not think that people here have even a vague notion of what our fellow human beings are suffering in places like northern Syria.  We have not got a notion, we do not have a clue.  I hear people talk about crisis in Ireland; there is no crisis here.  If anyone wants to see crisis they can go to northern Syria or Lebanon or, as Deputy Brady said, Yemen and other places.  That is where one will find crisis and devastation.  </p><p> I support what the witnesses have sought with regard to the various resolutions.  I think we have a unique place in the United Nations now and I will support anything we can do at UN level to progress and maintain the resolutions, to get the humanitarian aid in there and to try to get a lasting solution to this awful, difficult, almost intractable problem.  I thank everyone here for the work they do and the people on the ground out there who are putting their lives at risk in so many ways and doing so much for these people who had good lives before the war, who were doing very well.  I have met many Syrians here and was really impressed with them.  </p></speech>

It is beyond any humanitarian organisation to be able to really analyse the impact of sanctions and which factor is contributing to what.  As others have noted, multiple factors are at play in this, the ten year conflict, Covid-19, the situation in neighbouring Lebanon and also sanctions.  It is very difficult to assess exactly what is contributing to what outcome.  The Deputy mentioned the Caesar Act.  It is also difficult to assess what its contribution was and what was the contribution of European sanctions.  Globally, we know that sanctions hurt the most vulnerable people and we are concerned about them.</p> <p>  On the impact on the delivery of humanitarian response, a factor which has really impacted the different humanitarian organisations is their ability to receive funds into Syria.  We get our funding from different donors but then we face major difficulties in receiving those funds inside the country to enable us to deliver the humanitarian response.  Recently in Damascus, one of the largest international NGOs was almost forced to downsize because of the difficulty it has been having in receiving funds into Syria.  </p> <p>  We also know that there is an impact when we do have to resort to international tenders.  Those do not get any participation from the private sector outside Syria because of fear of sanctions.  Is it a direct effect of sanctions or a chilling effect, I do not know, it is very complicated.  Another example is where were delivering a life-saving response in Deir ez-Zor right after ISIS was defeated there and after the siege was lifted.  It was through a national partner and we had to transfer funds through our national fund at Deir ez-Zor.  There was only one operational bank there and it was a sanctioned bank.  It took us about four months to negotiate an exemption.  This was the true definition of a life-saving response.  Those are some examples of the impact of sanctions, whether or not it is the chilling effect, on the delivery of the material response.   </p></speech>

It is really important.  In Syria, we are suffering from multiple crises.  The priorities have been around attacks and the conflict inside Syria and the winter crisis, and then Covid came at the end.  The vulnerable families we serve would not think of Covid or that crisis but we think of the health workers who need support, the humanitarian workers who need to deliver efficient assistance for them.  Our teams are going door to door visiting the vulnerable people to make assessments and ensure the efficiency of the delivery of the assistance.  For those people, vaccination should be a priority.  Elderly people are passing away because they do not have easy access to health facilities to support them and to prevent the virus spreading out more across Syria.  Vaccination should be a priority for the humanitarian workers and my colleagues who work in health facilities who we meet day to day.  It is another part of the crisis facing the Syrian people which they are not aware of.  We need support to deal with vaccination, and to prioritise it.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about the incredible human cost of this conflict which will be counted for many, many years to come.  To read that 80% of people are living below the poverty line and more than 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, is a stark reality for these people's lives.  It would be remiss of me, a day after International Women's Day, not to raise the effect of conflict on women but also the effect and meaningful role in gender balance that needs to be played in economic development as Syria enters into a much brighter place than before.</p> <p>  On food insecurity, I read that 37% of mothers are suffering from malnutrition.  The health effects on both mothers and children are profound at that level of malnutrition.  What barriers and obstacles should be addressed immediately so that these people can receive adequate food and nutrition?</p><p>In terms of the conflict and post conflict, has any research been done on the levels of violence against women either as internally displaced persons or in the camps afterwards?  As Syria moves forward, hopefully into a much brighter future, what is the female engagement expected to be at the negotiation table in any peace process?  It is critical that women have a voice in any peace process that may happen.  As the sustainable development and resilience building that are needed to do that take place, what is the role of gender in economic development in terms of access to education?  Any viable livelihood is dependent on a level of education.</p><p> I am very lucky that quite a few women who have come from Syria live in my home town.  They are incredibly engaging and remarkable women.  What role can they play in the development and resilience building of the women back in their home country?  What role can Ireland play in ensuring that the issues of the effect of conflict on women and gender in economic development receive the attention they deserve?</p></speech>

I agree with my colleagues, Deputies Brady and Stanton, that the great thing about today is that we are bringing this horrendous conflict back into focus for those who are observing the meeting and also putting it centre stage for our agenda on the UN Security Council.  That is a great achievement from today.</p> <p>  As Deputy Clarke said, it is an horrendous, shocking and appalling story.  There is not much point in my repeating the statistics.  There is such human tragedy behind each of them, whether it is displaced people, people who have died or people below the poverty line, now at 80%.  It is an horrendous story.  We all understand that access is critical in the delivery of the humanitarian aid.  The witnesses are very welcome here and we admire what they do in that regard.</p> <p>  UN Resolution 2533 is up for renewal.  I presume the witnesses are not too fearful about that.  It is our job to assist aid agencies at UN level and I have no doubt we will.  While the witnesses cite it as crucial, I presume they are not concerned that there will be any diminution of access.  If they are concerned, perhaps they might elaborate on that so that it can inform any report or commentary we might make to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the UN context.  </p> <p>  Dr. Rouba Mhaissen made the stark remark that she thought the peace process was in great jeopardy.  While as Mr. O'Keeffe said at the outset, we do not want to stray too much into the area of politics, I ask her to elaborate on that remark.  Can she offer any direction to us or any hope that we might be able to achieve anything there during our tenure on the UN Security Council?  </p> <p>  At the outset Deputy Brady said there will need to be - we might have a moral leadership role here - a restrained approach from some in the international community not to be unhelpfully involved.  I thank the witnesses and I admire what they do.  This is an horrific story and has been for several years.</p></speech>

The dire humanitarian situation persists in Syria, notwithstanding an element of there being less of a ground conflict in recent times.  I read over the weekend that Damascus is now regarded in certain quarters as being a relatively peaceful city.  If that is the case - I am not sure that it is - it certainly cannot be said of areas in the north-west of the country, in particular Idlib.  Perhaps one of the witnesses could give us an outline of the current situation in Idlib.</p> <p>  I note that once again arrangements are being set in place for a donor conference.  Before the end of the month we will have our fifth Brussels donor conference.  To what extent are donors being influenced by a lack of political process and a lack of political reform?  What is likelihood of an element of donor fatigue given that we have now reached the tenth anniversary?  Many donor conferences have taken place before and the pledges were high.  The situation on the ground probably did not match that.  How might a cycle of construction, deconstruction and reconstruction feed into an element of donor fatigue?  How can that be best dealt with by governments, acknowledging, as many our guests have said, an onus on Ireland, particularly during our membership of the Security Council, to provide a position of leadership on this issue?</p></speech>

I will call on Ms Kennedy from Concern to address the question on adequate nutrition and food.  Following that I will ask Dr. Mhaissen to respond to the questions on the peace process, gender-based violence and the role of women.  Mr. O'Rourke from GOAL will respond to the question on the UN cross-border resolution.  Finally, I will talk about donor fatigue.</p></speech>

We have talked about the major displacements of people over the past ten years.  Traditionally women were the bearers of children and looked after rearing them.  Now women have become breadwinners because many of the men have been injured or killed in the war.  Regarding nutrition, women are going out predominantly trying to find low-paid work.  They are not able to afford food and certainly not nutritious food.  With sanctions and the economic decline, there is a shortage of good quality food and a shortage of clean water.  A combination of the shortage of food and clean water along with very poor living conditions, especially for women and families living in tents in which they have coped with the extreme heat of the summer and the extreme cold and floods of the winter, is contributing to malnutrition at different levels.</p> <p>  In addition, the entire healthcare system has collapsed.  There is a shortage of nurses and doctors because many have fled Syria.  Those who are left working in the country are poorly resourced to treat children with malnutrition and other health conditions that inadvertently lead to malnutrition.</p></speech>

I want to ask a question, however.  If a regime can still support military activities that cost so much, why can the same regime not support the humanitarian needs of its own people?  The sanctions are mainly addressed by private companies.  They are not addressed in the sectors of education or health.  The Caesar Act is very clear on that.  We should always weigh the opportunity costs of a large-scale humanitarian response against the money falling into the wrong hands.  Some of the difficulties mentioned are also with regard to, in general, the banks' counterterrorism legislation, which not only affects Damascus; it affects everywhere.  Even Lebanon is affected by the counterterrorism legislation.  This is just a small bracket.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Clarke for her question.  I wish a happy International Women's Day and big solidarity to all present.  We still have a long way to go as women.  I am hoping we will achieve that collectively.  I am happy to say that sometimes in wars, outside of the structures which used to dominate the country, such as the cultural, political and social structures, we are seeing great changes in gender roles.  I believe this is happening a lot in the Syrian context.  I wanted to start on a positive note.  As the Deputy said, however, there are many challenges.  Of course, many papers have been written about the violence against women.  We can definitely send those around after the meeting.  Women are being trafficked.  They are returning first into Syria and are scapegoated into going there to check on the situation because they are not forced into military service.  They are discriminated against in their own communities.  They are sometimes forced to have sex in return for aid.  Sex is definitely used as a weapon of war by militia factions and people with arms.  Therefore, this is definitely still the case.</p> <p>  Gender roles in politics are really shameful.  Before the war, there was an image of the presence of women but it was not really a meaningful presence.  I am ashamed to say that even when the opposition was in control of so many territories in Syria, the picture was not any better.  Only approximately 2% to 5% of local councils were made up of women.  In terms of the Geneva peace talks, the maximum participation of women that was reached in one of the rounds was 15%.  Everyone who is engaged in funding the talks needs to put that as a main ask.  We need to see 50% participation, or at least 30% working towards 50%, of women in all domains of political life.  Unless we do it that way, we will not see this.  Even in other countries where the distribution is much better, we still see a huge lack of participation of women.</p> <p>  I believe women play a big role in economic development, notably because today in Idlib and Lebanon, the majority of the internally displaced people and refugees are women.  There are many female-headed households, as there are in government-held or regime-held areas inside Syria.  As I said, women today are taking on new roles they were not doing before.  Therefore, we need to push in that direction.</p> <p>  What can Ireland do?  I really believe that despite the fact the political process is not happening and the political peace agreement has not been signed, we need to start to prepare today for when it is.  This is where our real work will begin.  I propose, therefore, that we should start training female community mediators - women who will start working on the infrastructure of the communities in terms of social cohesion, redevelopment and economic development.  We need to start to train these women from today to lead as mediators.  We can talk about politics with a big "P" and start working on pushing women into that sphere.  However, much small "p" politics is going on at a community level and this is where women really have a huge role.  I am happy to discuss this idea further with Tr&oacute;caire and everyone else.</p> <p>  I will make two final comments.  Someone asked about the peace process today.  Russia and the regime are continuing to stall the peace process; first, by not always participating in the Geneva peace talks.  These talks are being held up every single time.  In addition, however, the regime or Government always puts themes on the agenda it knows are problematic.  For example, rather than discussing the role of the constitution, or the real joint issues that present unity among Syrians, it puts on the agenda things like who will be considered a terrorist if he or she does not support the Syrian army, the issue of Arabness, knowing this will be a huge issue for the Kurdish component, or the counterterrorism issue.</p> <p>  I believe there is a huge role for Ireland to play here.  First, Ireland is part of the EU, which is the umbrella for this peace process.  It should, therefore, continue to push Iran, Russia and the regime to engage.  I know the Iranian foreign minister was visiting.  Ireland should, therefore, push Iran to stop supporting the military and push the regime.  I believe Iran has even more power over the regime than Russia.  Therefore, there is a need to push Iran to force it to start talking and having this conversation, which will be Syrian-led.</p> <p>  On the issue of Damascus being peaceful, I believe we should ask, "Peaceful for whom?" and "Peaceful how?"  If we are talking about Abu Rummaneh, Al-Masaneh', Al-Malky and the centre of Damascus being safe for expatriates and international staff to have "happy hour" and such, then the answer is "Yes"; it is safe on that level.  However, if we are talking about a Damascus that is free of kidnapping, taking activists into prison, forcing young men into military service and militia putting arms in the hands of people, or if we talk about protection in the big sense of the word in terms of food, shelter, education and hospitals, then I would say, of course, that Damascus is not a safe place for Syrians.</p></speech>

Before I address Senator O'Reilly's question on the cross-border resolution that is up for renewal, I can also address the Chairman's question on Idlib in terms of security in north-west Syria.  Four days ago, on 5 March, we marked one year of a ceasefire in the north west, which is remarkable and great.  We must understand, however, that the ceasefire in this context does not mean a complete cessation of violence and hostilities.  It means a massive reduction in violence and hostilities, and for that, I say it is great.  We must understand, however, that the front line which separates north-west Syria and Idlib from the Government-held areas is still active.</p> <p>  That brings me on to Senator O'Reilly's question on the cross-border resolution.  I believe the argument of those who say it should not be renewed is based around the fact that there is a viable alternative in cross-line humanitarian aid rather than cross-border aid from Turkey, as we currently have in place, and that the humanitarian aid would come across that active front line I mentioned.  The first barrier is that it is incredibly dangerous and not safe for humanitarian workers to try to deliver aid across an active front line in which there are daily incidents of shelling and sniper fire.  There are landmines.  Improvised explosive devices are lying around.</p><p>Just last December, nine months into the ceasefire, a humanitarian staff member of a partner organisation of GOAL was killed 7 km or 8 km in from that front line by a shell.  It is not safe to do it and this is the first barrier to cross line delivery of humanitarian aid.</p><p> The second barrier is the infrastructure.  We are talking about feeding and providing aid not to hundreds of thousands of people but to millions of people.  This requires significant logistical effort.  It requires a massive supply chain.  The border crossing between Turkey and north-west Syria on which it is operationally done at present is huge.  There are massive loading and unloading areas with hundreds of trucks per day.  There is no infrastructure on that active front line at present.  If the resolution is not to be renewed on 10 July, and the alternative is to be cross line humanitarian aid delivery, then that delivery has to begin on 11 July.  In other words, where is the preparation for the type of infrastructure to deliver aid to millions of people across an active front line that has to be ready four months from now?  We are simply not seeing it.  There is no preparation on the ground for this kind of infrastructure.</p><p> The third barrier to cross line delivery of humanitarian aid is the historical record.  Ten years of conflict is a decent amount of time to be able to establish a trend, and the trend over those ten years has been that cross line aid does not work.  The parties that are required to facilitate cross line aid are not interested in delivering humanitarian aid across front lines in the Syrian conflict at a rate that is necessary to feed those millions of people in, as my colleague, Mr. Alheraki, said, an area the size of County Galway that has a population the size of Ireland squeezed into it and half of them are homeless because it is not where they are from but to where they were displaced.  They are not living in adequate shelter.</p><p> As I mentioned earlier, when I addressed the Cathaoirleach's question on the status of the conflict in the north west, despite the ceasefire there are daily violations and daily conflict incidents and it is not safe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1003" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall O'Keeffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021030900002#J00200"><p>On the final point with regard to support for humanitarian funding and donor fatigue, it is very clear that donor fatigue is taking place.  Ten years of conflict, ten years of humanitarian crisis and ten years of the international community providing funding for humanitarian assistance for people in Syria is a very long time.  What we have seen in recent years is a declining amount of humanitarian funding being provided and, on the other side, over the past year or 18 months we have really seen increasing amounts of humanitarian need.  The situation is getting worse due to the economic decline, Covid, and the stalemate that exists throughout Syria and in the region for Syrian refugees.</p> <p>  The reality is that last year, the UN humanitarian appeal received only 56% of its funding, which is a shockingly poor result for a whole year that such a humanitarian fund would receive such a low amount of funding.  This downward trend has been going on for a number of years.  It is important to say that humanitarian funding is really just a sticking plaster.  It will not resolve the situation.  It will not find a political solution, rebuild Syria or do anything.  All it does is ensure that people who are desperately in need of assistance today can receive that assistance.  Unfortunately for those people, they do not know what will happen tomorrow or next week.  Unfortunately, the humanitarian assistance is really just a sticking plaster for the situation.</p> <p>  What is needed is that at the donor conference that will take place in Brussels at the end of this month, the international community must step up and provide support in a way that is commensurate to the level of need in Syria.  There also needs to be a matching political effort at international level to find a lasting solution to this.  Last year, Ireland pledged &euro;25 million to the crisis, which is fantastic.  Ireland has been quite good in terms of providing humanitarian support to the UN system and to each of our organisations here, and for this we are very thankful, but the needs continue to be there.</p></speech>

Do they make any contribution towards the welfare of their own citizens?</p></speech>

I speak more in hope than expectation.  I just hope the tragic anniversary that is looming of ten years of such a catastrophe will re-energise people and reprioritise this great catastrophe in our time.  I take it from the committee's guests that funding is obviously important as is using the influence that Ireland now has.  We never give up hope.  We owe it to the people to keep hoping.  I see political paralysis and I am trying to be hopeful.  Will the witnesses leave us on a hopeful note?  It is an horrendous human tragedy.</p> <p>  In a nutshell, apart from the many other complicated matters the witnesses have covered so well, and apart from funding and Ireland's influence at the Security Council, are there any other cry out desperate messages they have for us on which we will do our best?  Our Minister for Foreign Affairs is very accessible.  He is up to speed on this.  As an ordinary member of the Green Party and a Senator, we are taking this so seriously today.  Deputy Brian Leddin could not make it today and I am honoured and proud to stand in for him at this very important briefing.  It is so auspicious to have a ten year anniversary of such an incredible tragedy.  I invite the witnesses to try to see whether there is any optimism.  I thank the Chair.</p></speech>

I spent much time in Damascus, Hama and Homs in 2012 and 2018 so I am very familiar with the situation on the ground.  I am also very familiar with the risks the witnesses and their people are taking and the great work they are doing out there.  I thank them for everything they are doing.

With regard to the question on the regime, Mr. Adham is very well placed to speak about this.</p><p>There was a question about psychological issues and their cost.  Dr. Mhaissen is working in that area and will respond to that question.  Ms Van Lieshout from GOAL will respond to the question about hope.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1012" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Moutaz Adham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021030900002#K00200"><p>The question as to whether the regime cares is a political one, but I will address it from the humanitarian perspective in terms of our experience in dealing with the local authorities and technical line ministries, if not the regime itself.  As outlined in our reports on access from Damascus, we have found allies in local authorities and technical ministries.  There are different modalities for international NGOs operating from Damascus, and one of these is that they deal directly with the line ministries, which is very effective in the context of access.  We have found allies in the local authorities and technical line ministries in the delivery of the humanitarian response.  Of course, there is much more to be done and we are not at a point where we are completely satisfied, but we are able, through dialogue with the technical line ministries and local authorities, to achieve more access in Damascus and in Government-controlled areas.</p> <p>  We are not present in the north west or north east of the country, but in Government-controlled areas the biggest provider of basic services is still the public sector, although in the past year this has diminished greatly.  Subsidies have been lifted or partially lifted on items like bread, heating fuel and so on.  Nonetheless, the public sector is still a big provider of public services.  Recently we have seen people queueing for hours and hours to collect a simple loaf of bread.  We have seen drivers queueing outside gas stations for hours, and sometimes overnight, for 20 litres of fuel for their vehicles.  It is becoming more and more difficult and challenging for the public sector to provide services.  As I mentioned, the reasons for this are very complicated and difficult for humanitarian actors to analyse.  It could be the impact of ten years of conflict, the effect of the sanctions or the mismanagement of the public sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1013" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rouba Mhaissen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021030900002#K00300"><p>The question of whether the Syrian regime cares for its own citizens is an oxymoron.  Today we are seeing people who previously supported the regime travelling to Europe to seek asylum, which says a lot.  Even the supporters of the regime are now tired.  As my colleague has said, people are queueing for several hours to get fuel or bread and so on.</p> <p>  In terms of psychosocial supports, we are dealing with layers and layers of trauma.  People had to leave their homes, move to a different city or a different country and some took a boat to yet another country.  Some were raped.  We deal with children who saw their own parents killed and who had to step over their bodies, who saw genocide in their own towns.  Even those who are far away from areas of conflict hear the sound of shelling.  All of that accumulates.  Added to that today is the isolation of Covid and the fear of not being able to live.  We often talk about women and the trauma they suffer, but imagine being a Syrian man who used to provide for his family.  Today he is no longer a hero because he is not fighting inside Syria.  He is a refugee who cannot earn money for his family.  He no longer plays the role of provider and feels totally emasculated.  He cannot cry because he is a man and needs to be strong.  He cannot be intimate with his wife because he lives with ten other people in a tent.  Young people do not see any future.  They do not have qualifications and cannot work in the countries in which they are refugees.  We are talking about multiple layers of trauma.</p> <p>  We are trying to deal with this in Tr&oacute;caire through psychosocial support sessions and also through economic development, which also attempts to address psychosocial trauma.  I am hopeful because Syria is still on the agenda of this committee.  That provides me with hope because, unfortunately, it has fallen off the agenda of too many countries.  I am very grateful and optimistic that members here still care and have so many questions about Syria.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1014" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Van Lieshout" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021030900002#K00400"><p>I thank committee members for their committed questions and their leadership on this issue, which is important to all of us who have been working on the front line for the past ten years.  I want to respond to Senator Martin's question about hope.  It is important to say that the real heroes or stalwarts are the Syrian people and the Syrian NGOs who are on the front line.  They are continuing daily to show up, cross the front lines and take brave decisions.  Our hope lies, first and foremost, in supporting the people of Syria to come to the table and find solutions.  I have 600 Syrian colleagues.  As the committee heard earlier, many humanitarian workers have died over the past ten years and the vast majority of them were Syrian.  They took a pledge to work for a humanitarian agency in this conflict and we should all be hopeful their bravery spills over.</p> <p>  There are other elements of hope too.  I acknowledge the courage and bravery of the Irish Government in seeking a seat on the UN Security Council.  We cannot forget that in the past four to six years, the multilateral system has been under tremendous attack from different political elements around the globe.  It has been one of the most discouraging periods for the multilateral system but it was in that context Irish political representatives said they believe in the UN and in multilateralism.  I never want us to lose faith in the multilateral system, as much in need of reform as it is.  The Irish Government has positioned itself wisely and bravely on the Security Council.  I agree with Dr. Mhaissen that this sends a message of hope.</p> <p>  Let us not forget there are individuals on the front line.  I commend Ms Geraldine Byrne Nason, our ambassador on the Security Council.  She is meeting tirelessly with NGOs to make sure she is bringing on-the-ground information from all of the world's hotspots into her conversations.  I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, on his recent travels to the Middle East.  He travelled to the humanitarian access point in Turkey to see the practical difficulties that would arise if that border crossing closes.  There is the institution of Ireland and there are some individuals who continue to give us hope today.</p> <p>  Let us not forget the bigger picture.  We have seen a shift in the US Administration, a very hopeful and helpful shift.  We can have hope that the first outings of the new Administration have been very positive for multilateralism.  I am deeply hopeful the leadership of the Biden Administration, the leadership of Joe Biden himself during the Ebola crisis will come to the fore on Covid.  His leadership under former President Obama will shine through and multilateralism will be strengthened.  We will be at a table where peace and human rights are part of the conversation again.</p><p>I hope that is all not too ethereal, but I believe there are practical reasons, from the people on the ground to the global leadership we have today, to have hope.  To repeat what Dr. Mhaissen said, I thank the committee members for their attention, for attending this meeting and for standing with all of us on the ground who are working so hard on this.  I thank them for their solidarity.  That is also part of our hope.</p></speech>

It is a highlight of this afternoon for us.  The very least we owe the people is hope.  I have no doubt that the Irish Government will contribute through our access and influence with President Biden, especially in the coming days.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

They are critically important.</p> <p>  As a group of organisations, we highlighted a number of areas that we believe are critical, including the renewal of the UN resolution for cross-border humanitarian assistance, the importance of safe return for refugees and internally displaced people and the importance of having a safe environment to which they can return.  There is also the importance of humanitarian funding, and Ireland can play a role in that.  Then there is the importance of the peace process and ensuring that every effort is made to find a lasting and peaceful solution to the conflict.</p> <p>  On behalf of all the organisations here, we thank the committee members for giving their time today.  Syria is such a humanitarian crisis it is important to be able to get this profile and engagement from so many members of the committee.  I thank them for attending today, listening to our issues, asking us questions and discussing it.  I thank them for their participation.</p> <p>  Second, in terms of the humanitarian funding, we know Ireland has been very generous in its support in this crisis.  We appreciate that it is something that works across the political system in Ireland.  There is strong support for the humanitarian funding which Ireland has been providing in the Syrian conflict and in many other crisis situations.  Our role as humanitarian organisations and as an international community is to provide a humanitarian response in this situation and to support Syrians who are in desperate need of such support at this time.  We all believe that Syrians need to be in the driving seat in terms of finding a solution to this conflict that will last for them, and deciding for themselves what Syria will be like in the future.  Our role is very much to provide some assistance to help them through this horrendous period.  Hopefully, the international community can come together in supporting them, and enabling and empowering them to find a solution that is inclusive and respectful for all Syrians.</p> <p>  Once again, I thank the committee for its time and influence.  We hope the members will take on board the issues we have prioritised and use the committee's influence wherever possible to press these priorities elsewhere.</p></speech>

It is a source of shame for international governments and the international community that the conflict in Syria appears to have faded from the front pages and news headlines.  The exercise this afternoon was most worthwhile in updating us from the front line.  I thank the representatives from SAWA for Development and Aid, GOAL, Oxfam, World Vision Ireland, Concern and Tr&oacute;caire for taking the time to meet us.</p> <p>  I intend to propose to committee members that after this meeting we write to our colleagues in the foreign affairs and defence committees in the European Union and the UK, and also the European Parliament, and inform them of the importance of marking the tenth anniversary by renewing efforts to urge all the actors to seek to achieve political and lasting solutions.  The lasting solutions will be dependent on the leadership of the international community.  We will call, specifically, for support for the further renewal of UN Resolution 2533.  I intend that we will do that today.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the leadership and the tremendous role being played by the NGO community both in Syria and in the neighbourhood, putting its own safety at risk to assist from a humanitarian perspective.  In particular, I thank the speakers who joined us from Syria, Lebanon and Turkey.  I wish you all well and thank you for the work you are doing for and on behalf of the people in Syria.  You are doing that in the most exceptional, difficult and dangerous circumstances and we are very grateful for your efforts.  We look forward to a further engagement in the future when, perhaps, the hope that Senator Martin mentioned is being realised.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the logistical efforts that have been made, very successfully, to make this meeting a reality, notwithstanding the Covid restrictions.  I thank our team and am grateful for the logistical assistance we received in the committee to ensure your voices were heard and that our questions were dealt with in this manner.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1024" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021030900002#A00400"><p>I remind members and those attending to please turn off their mobile phones and to identify themselves when contributing to the meeting.  I am sure everybody is aware of the note on privilege, namely, those in attendance here and in the parliamentary precincts have privilege, but those outside may have limited privilege.</p> <p>  Today, we are engaging with the Central Bank of Ireland on a number of issues.  I welcome Mr. Ed Sibley and Ms Derville Rowland.  We have received an opening statement such that witnesses need only make some general comments on it rather than read it fully.  However, the statement will form part of the record of the meeting.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Rowland to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

In our opening statement, we sought to touch on the issues highlighted as of concern to the committee, including the effects of Covid-19 on borrowers and in insurance, wider developments in the banking sector in Ireland and, of course, the most recent outcome of an enforcement investigation into the Davy Group.  We see our engagement with this committee as very important in informing how we deliver on our mandate and demonstrate accountability for the work we do in the public interest.  We are always open to exploring how we can enhance our engagement with this committee.<br/><br/>In reference to Covid-19, I acknowledge that first and foremost it is a cause of human tragedy which has had a devastating impact on families and individuals.  The necessary measures to address the health emergency have had a negative effect on many businesses and household incomes due to the associated economic disruption.  At national and European levels, as part of the Eurosystem and Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, the Central Bank has taken action seeking to ensure that the financial system absorbs the shock and is better placed to support households and businesses in this crisis.  The work over the last decade has sought to ensure banks and other firms are financially and operationally resilient.  This has been important to allowing those firms to extend financial support and continue to lend when the shock hit.<font color="#2F2F2F"> </font><br/><br/>During 2020, Covid-19 payment breaks supported a significant number of borrowers.  Lenders granted payment breaks to more than 172,000 Irish accounts, representing more than &euro;23 billion of lending.  The majority of those payment breaks have ended, with approximately 90% of borrowers returning to full repayment on either existing or extended terms.  The remaining 10% of borrowers have indicated they need further financial support.  Support to borrowers continues now on a case-by-case basis and through more regular forbearance measures.  Despite the reduction in distressed debt over the past decade, a sizeable number of borrowers were in distress before the onset of the pandemic.  Therefore, distressed debt remains a key priority for us.  Our focus is to ensure lenders have suitable supports in place to help borrowers.  We are supervising lenders to ensure they have appropriate strategies, the necessary financial and operational resources and a suite of appropriate and sustainable solutions to resolve distressed debt, whether it arose before or as a result of the pandemic.  We prioritise effective engagement between lenders and distressed borrowers, noting that such an approach will prevent the build-up of arrears and the successful restructuring of loans where debt-servicing capability has been reduced<font color="#2F2F2F">.</font>In this context, it is important to apply the lessons of the last crisis.  I refer the committee to the further details set out in the statement, to which I do not propose to refer now. <br/><br/>The Central Bank of Ireland has also prioritised the issue of business interruption insurance since the onset of the pandemic.  We have conducted a system-wide examination.  From the outset, we have been clear on expectations of firms that they treat their customers fairly and pay valid claims.  We have been intrusive and assertive in our work for customers and this remains a key area of our focus.  Through the examination, we have focused on identifying all groups of impacted policies where, in our view, the relevant contractual provisions provide cover for Covid-19 related interruption.  Our aim is to drive a system-wide response so that all customers are identified and valid claims are paid.  We have analysed more than 250 different policy types across more than 30 insurers, determined that they will meet their obligations to their customers.  As a result of our supervisory interventions, a number of insurers had already accepted and commenced settling claims.  This occurred before the recent High Court judgment, which is significant and welcome and reinforces our system-wide supervisory action.  We can confirm to the committee that all firms in scope have accepted the outcome of the judgment and we, therefore, expect that all valid claims will be handled and paid by the firms in accordance with their claims handling obligations and in compliance with their legal and regulatory obligations.  Where there is a wider impact of a court judgment to the benefit of customers, the Central Bank has instructed firms to re-review previously declined claims and to identify customers who have insurance policies with cover and who may have a valid claim and those who have not yet made a claim.  We have instructed insurers to communicate with their customers to inform them of the insurer's updated position in relation to claims and to invite their customers to submit a claim if they have suffered losses due to Covid-19 related business interruptions.</p><p>We understand the concerns of customers, staff, committee members and others regarding NatWest Group&rsquo;s decision to close Ulster Bank in the Republic of Ireland.  There are clear implications for the competitiveness of the Irish banking market, particularly for business lending.  We also understand the concerns regarding Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s decision to close bank branches across Ireland, including societal concerns about the impacts and effects on rural communities.  These decisions are being made in an environment of significant change in retail banking across Europe and beyond.  New technology is having an effect, and I am sure these matters will be discussed further.</p><p> Banks will continue to have an important role in the functioning of the economy and the supply of credit and services to businesses and consumers, and that role is changing.  It is important the discussion on the future of banking starts from the basis of the current and future financial services needs of businesses, households and individuals.  In that way, the discussion will allow the role of other financial service providers, from payment institutions to credit unions, in meeting the needs of our community to be considered.</p><p> Decisions relating to the strategic direction and business models of firms are decisions for the boards of those firms.  The Central Bank cannot require firms to keep operating in the State if they do not wish to do so.  However, we can ensure that changes are done in an orderly manner, impact assessments are done in respect of the impact on customers, an appropriate level of care is taken and adherence to the consumer protection code provisions are complied with.</p><p> We have previously provided detailed responses to questions from the committee on bank capital.  I will not detail that information again, but it is important to note that appropriately capitalised banks are fundamental to protecting consumers, maintaining the supply of credit to businesses and households and ensuring financial stability.</p><p> The reprimand and fine imposed on Davy reflect the serious regulatory breaches and aggravating factors in that investigation, including the firm&rsquo;s lack of candour when first reporting the matter to the Central Bank.  As we have detailed in the statement, Davy prioritised facilitating an opportunity for a consortium of 16 employees to make personal financial gain over ensuring it was complying with its regulatory obligations.</p><p> Enforcement action supports and runs alongside our supervisory interventions.  This assists in driving remediation of risk and issues in governance, risk management and control frameworks of the firms we supervise.  When the enforcement actions conclude, we insist on a detailed public statement because we believe sunlight is the best disinfectant and it is important to be transparent where we can.  The Central Bank has a strong enforcement record, having concluded more than 140 enforcement actions and imposed financial penalties in excess of &euro;128 million, with a number of individual disqualifications and prohibitions imposed.</p><p> Notwithstanding our strong enforcement powers, we believe the regulatory framework requires further strengthening with regard to individual accountability.  We regard the individual accountability framework, including the introduction of conduct standards for individuals, and the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, as a necessary enhancement.</p><p> I thank committee members for their attention.  My colleague and I are happy to answer any questions they may have.</p></speech>

I will ask Ms Rowland questions about the Davy transaction and her report.  If possible, can her answers be concise as well as complete?  I am operating under pressure of time, as are my colleagues.</p> <p>  Ms Rowland stated in the report on the Davy transaction that from her first engagement with Davy, it provided vague and misleading details and wilfully withheld information.  In what way did Davy try to mislead the Central Bank?</p></speech>

In early recourse, when the transaction became public, there was contact from Davy that sought, in our view, to minimise the transaction and mischaracterise the seriousness of the events.  That was at the first engagement.  Further information was provided in the course of the early supervisory engagement.  It subsequently transpired, in the aftermath of a very forensic and diligent investigation, that the initial characterisation of the events that occurred lacked the candour the Central Bank of Ireland expects from the regulated firms we supervise.</p></speech>

The matters are referred to there and I cannot go beyond that detail.  I am trying to be as straightforward as possible with the Deputy in telling him that in the early stages of the description of the events that occurred, we formed a view that the information provided mischaracterised the gravity and seriousness of the matter and what had in fact occurred.  It lacked candour, in our view, with respect to the very serious events we excavated in the course of a forensic and detailed enforcement investigation.</p></speech>

I am not looking for names, but what individuals were they trying to present as being more central to the transaction?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1032" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021030900002#B00700"><p>I am confined to the detail that has been put into the public domain with respect to the enforcement investigation.  The contact was to mischaracterise it, in our view.  It subsequently transpired, in the course of a very detailed and forensic investigation, the facts of which are laid bare in more than 4,000 words in the public outcome we published, that Davy did not characterise it as we subsequently detected it to be.  This was, in our view, a transaction that sought to put the profit and gain of senior people in Davy and their staff above their duties which are very explicitly laid down in the requirements for investor protection and market transparency in the markets in financial instruments directive, MiFID, regulations.</p></speech>

She has answered on a number of occasions that she is confined in the answers she gives.  What is confining her?  Is there an agreement between the Central Bank and Davy?</p></speech>

There are two possibilities in making the outcome of these enforcement actions public.  The first possibility is by way of resolving the matter to conclusion against the firm in a settlement agreement.  As part of that, the information put into the public domain is by way of agreement with the firm.  That is the permission under which the detailed public statement is put into the public domain.  We do not, in the normal course, ever conclude a settlement agreement unless there is very detailed information put into the public domain.</p> <p>  The second option is by way of the findings of an inquiry hearing into the matters, if they are fully disputed.  It is only after the conclusion of that hearing that inquiry details can be publicised pursuant to statutory commission.</p></speech>

I can tell the Deputy how the mechanism works for enforcement investigations if he wishes.</p></speech>

I asked specifically whether this was an investigation conducted pursuant to the bank appointing an authorised officer?</p></speech>

Statutory powers of the Central Bank were used in the course of this investigation. This was a very contentious investigation and, because of that, the Central Bank of Ireland had to have recourse to its statutory toolkit for compelled powers to compel large quantities of data and information from the firm.</p><p>In that regard, what I am telling the Deputy is that the teams in enforcement make use of statutory powers and they did so on this occasion.  </p></speech>

I am specifying that these provisions are not designated as criminal provisions in the legislative scheme in Ireland.  They are regulatory obligations imposed on firms and they are designated under schedule 2 of the 1942 Act as actionable matters under the administrative sanctions scheme.  Of course, many provisions are designated as a civil provision as well as a criminal provision; these provisions that form the subject of this investigation are not.</p></speech>

It has confirmed that external parties have reviewed that.  That did not happen by accident.  The Central Bank of Ireland uses the enforcement tool to complement our intrusive supervision.  We have taken very strong action in respect of Davy but, of course, it will be a matter for it to account for its conduct and answer the questions here.  We do not conclude enforcement actions until or unless we are satisfied that the issues complained of have been repaired.  Davy has made a further announcement today where it has confirmed that further external review will be undertaken to resolve any matters.  It appears to have put the trust in the firm in issue and it will have to take the actions to address that.</p></speech>

Some of those legal frameworks are designated as civil matters, some are designated as criminal and some are designated as both.  It depends on which legislation one is looking at whether the statutory designation is civil, criminal or both.  One needs to take a very specific look at that.  The Central Bank has powers to prosecute summarily with respect to some matters but each legislative scheme is slightly different.</p></speech>

The story of Davy is one of personal greed in which 16 employees short-changed their client to the benefit of themselves, including some of the most senior executives within Davy, and in doing so resulted in a record-breaking fine issued against the firm by the Central Bank.  At the heart of this was 16 individuals.  Is it the Central Bank's view that investigations will be opened in respect of those individuals or have any investigations been opened?</p></speech>

It has confirmed that the senior individuals who were associated with this are not working in the firm.  As we speak, the Central Bank is engaged in very dynamic and significant regulatory engagement with Davy.  It is an evolving situation.  These are live regulatory issues.  It is not that I do not wish to be helpful but I cannot be drawn in commenting on future regulatory actions against individuals.  I want to say that we hard fought this enforcement outcome with the firm.  The outcome has caused Davy a moment of reckoning.  It causes it to have questions to answer with respect to its conduct and culture.  It is right that it does.  However, it is also right that the Central Bank of Ireland keeps all its options open and does not prejudice any actions with commentary.</p></speech>

The last thing that we would want to do is prejudice the actions or potential actions of the Central Bank, however, when taxpayers and members of the public see a fine being issued of &euro;4.1 million yet the CEO who was involved was able to continue in his position for many years and individuals profiting as a result of this, we want to know whether the Central Bank has concluded its enforcement action or whether there is potential for individual sanctions in respect of this.  Will Ms Rowland clarify to the committee whether resignation from J&amp;E Davy prevents the Central Bank from pursuing individual accountability in relation to these matters, if it so wished?</p></speech>

He must forgive me, I do not wish to be unhelpful but I will repeat that this is very much a live supervisory matter.  I appreciate and understand the legitimate concern he has about some of these issues but I cannot be drawn on possible regulatory actions.  What I can say is that the administrative sanctions procedure is a punishment-based procedure.  It is about imposing punitive measures on firms where they have broken the rules.  We have taken a case against Davy, the firm, in this enforcement outcome.  They are the penalties that people see and the detail of the course of conduct.  The way the scheme is set up is that the obligations of regulation are obligations that rest on the firm.  Once that is done, one can turn to considering participation cases, which is the route through to individual accountability.  I have said previously in other cases the Central Bank has a track record of going to the High Court and other courts to vindicate our right to take those cases and we have a track record of bringing those cases even in the face of complex information and complex litigation.  We are committed to doing that where possible to do so.<br/><br/>The Central Bank has another option, as the Deputy will be aware, namely, the fitness and probity option.  That is a protective scheme; it is not a punishment-based scheme.  It is about ensuring that those who hold senior roles in financial services have the requisite degree of skill, competence and integrity, etc.  There is a challenge when people are not in the system that they will face when they come back in, or seek to come back into the system, where any information adverse to their integrity, competence, or capability will be used against them or where people are <i>in situ</i>there is an option to remove it.  Another very important option is section 21, the third pillar of that scheme, where the firms themselves are held accountable and responsible for ensuring that the people who work for them are fit and proper.  That is an important part.  We do say that Davy has come out and said that none of the persons associated with this transaction are now working for it.</p></speech>

Did it encourage Davy to enact that third pillar to ensure that nobody who was involved in the consortium of 16 was currently working because following the Central Bank's announcement, the CEO of Davy, Brian McKiernan, was still in his position?</p></speech>

These are firm-specific conversations.  The Deputy will appreciate from our many appearances before this committee and his diligent questioning of us that I cannot be drawn into these details.  What I can say is that I believe the Central Bank of Ireland's resolute pursuit of this action, our diligent investigation, our laying bare of the details, our dealing with very highly able litigious challenges throughout this investigation and our resolute pursuit of it to the end demonstrate our commitment to holding firms to account.  This, associated with our concurrent assertive supervision to demand change that Davy has already publicly cited as having occurred, is part of our ongoing work and we are already focused on these issues in a very live and dynamic environment.</p></speech>

During the course of this investigation, we did not form views that there were criminal reports to be made to other agencies.  Now that the full details of the investigation and the facts upon which they are based are in the public domain, we are very satisfied to engage with other agencies that may see a relevant role for themselves.  We have already had tentative engagements with some and will make sure there is a very fulsome engagement in the near term.</p></speech>

This comment was echoed by the Minister for Finance this morning.  However, Ms Rowland will be aware that a number of individuals involved in this consortium are with other companies within this group.  Brian McKiernan, the former CEO; the deputy chairman, Kyran McLaughlin; and the head of bonds, Barry Nangle, who were all central to this issue, are also directors of White Note Limited, which holds the majority shareholding in J&amp;E Davy Holdings, which is the parent company of J&amp;E Davy; Amber Note Unlimited Company; and Ailmount Investments, which holds voting rights in White Note Limited.  This confers a significant say in and power over the activities of Davy on those individuals involved in the transaction.  This has been mapped out quite excellently by the The Currency News over the past 24 hours.  Does the Central Bank regulate any of those structures, which are located in this State, in the Isle of Man and in Gibraltar?  Ms Rowland spoke about fitness and probity.  Is the Central Bank satisfied that these individuals, who are involved in this transaction, should continue to operate as directors in those holding companies with voting rights and influence in respect of J&amp;E Davy?</p></speech>

What I can tell him in general terms, because, again, I cannot be drawn into specifics, is that the Central Bank of Ireland has very serious rules about authoring firms.  It also has very serious powers with regard to the fitness and probity of individuals who have senior roles in those firms influencing the conduct of those firms and the way they run their business.  We take those obligations very seriously.  As a general comment, we also have roles scrutinising shareholding at certain thresholds against certain specified criteria for regulated entities.  That is the general position.  I cannot be drawn on specifics save to say that we are highly focused on this issue and will look at doing our job effectively and with diligence considering all that.</p></speech>

There are holding companies and companies above that where the key players in this transaction - the deputy chairperson, the head of bonds and the former CEO, all former positions within Davy - are the directors of those companies with voting rights in respect of those companies.  Has the Central Bank looked at the structure?  It cannot satisfy itself that these individuals are no longer in Davy when they are running the mother ship.  Has the Central Bank satisfied itself?  Is there a competence here in terms of the Central Bank with regard to fitness and probity regarding those individuals continuing to participate at that level and within the command structure of that organisation?</p></speech>

That is separate and distinct from shareholdings.  The shareholding structure will be associated with the regulated firm and certain levels and thresholds.  I do not have the details of that to hand but I am undertaking that the Central Bank is looking at all regulatory issues in this regard.</p></speech>

Now we know that at least none of the 16 individuals is in J&amp;E Davy.  I am not suggesting there is anything inappropriate about the individuals who transferred from different places in respect of J&amp;E Davy but the current CEO is now the former CEO of AIB while there have been transfers of people from the Department of Finance to Davy and from Davy to the Department.  People from the NTMA have moved to Davy.  I am not suggesting that any individual who has made those transfers has done anything inappropriate but can Ms Rowland assure us that the 16 individuals, whose names I assume are known to the Central Bank, are not operating in any senior roles in any other regulated entities, for example in banks of which the State has ownership or in the Department of Finance?  Are any of these individuals in the NTMA or other regulatory bodies having moved on from Davy?</p></speech>

If we are not going to get the information, we are not going to get the information.  When did the lack of candour, the frustration and the litigiousness regarding Davy, which was mentioned by Ms Rowland, stop?  Did that occur right up until 2021 or was there co-operation with the investigation at board level after a certain point?</p></speech>

I can speak for the Central Bank in saying that we were preparing to expect this matter to go to a contested hearing at inquiry.</p></speech>

The current CEO of Davy is Bernard Byrne, who was a board member in 2019 and obviously would have some knowledge of the investigation and the interaction with the Central Bank.  Regarding the challenges and frustration experienced by the Central Bank during this period, is there now a question for Mr. Byrne to answer regarding his role in, knowledge of and experience regarding the challenges to the Central Bank in respect of its investigation?</p> <p>  We cannot understand how after what Ms Rowland has said and a six-year investigation, Davy gets a reduction of the fine of 30%.</p><p>The fine was supposed to be &euro;5.9 million but was reduced to &euro;4.13 million in accordance with an early settlement discount scheme that promotes the early resolution of matters.  Six years, challenges, a lack of candour, misleading and threatening to go to court is not an early settlement under the discount scheme in anyone's book and should not be rewarded with a 30% reduction.  Perhaps Ms Rowland will explain this issue to the committee.</p></speech>

There is a well-founded public good in an incentive that sees firms accepting the matter through a settlement procedure, puts a transparent statement into the public domain for reasons of accountability and avoids the need to go to another complex hearing phase, which is part of due process and is the right of firms.  Notwithstanding that, it is a significant public good if the enforcement staff of the Central Bank can better apply their time pursuing other important cases.  It was for this reason the scheme's 30% discount was applied.  That was in line with what criminal courts do with guilty pleas that avoid the need for a trial, which would add another burden.</p></speech>

Some of them are historical, some are evident in our ongoing discussions and what has happened even in the past week.  We have a robust fitness and probity regime under which we expect anyone appointed to a senior position in a significantly sized firm such as Davy Stockbrokers to be assessed on his or her fitness and propriety for that role.  I will not comment on the specifics of the individual, but I would expect anyone being put forward for the CEO role in Davy Stockbrokers to be able to demonstrate that he or she is fit and proper for it.  Where the appointee is coming from within a firm that has had difficulties, that person will have to account for his or her role in those difficulties.</p></speech>

I am happy to follow up on it.  We had enough resources to carry out the investigation.  The line supervisors, who are very active, engaged in Davy Stockbrokers and had a specific team allocated to them.  Issues will arise in supervision.  We take at least a two-handed approach to firms that present issues.  Firm-level engagement by a supervisor involves a great deal of work to ensure that-----</p></speech>

The Davy consortium was formed in November 2014 and was subject to media reports four months later.  In that light, we can only assume that the Central Bank discovered this transaction in March 2015.  We have been waiting six years for this investigation to conclude.  That strikes me as being an extremely long time.  The witnesses spoke about needing extra powers, but do they have sufficient staff to carry out such investigations in future?  Will Ms Rowland provide an explanation for the time this investigation took before we got a finding?</p></speech>

This particular investigation required a multiskilled team of lawyers and investigators and was highly complex.  The fact pattern already involves more than 16 individuals and we had to engage in document acquisition.  Unfortunately, the kind of work we do involves a large volume of data and information-based cases, necessitating the team acquiring information from systems, making repeated statutory requests for data, investigating those and dealing with privilege issues and contentions in the course of that.  It is not just a matter of investigating, acquiring information and using the regulatory framework to map that against breaches and issues that arose.  It is also about dealing with very able legal advisers who are seeking to curtail the requests.  That is their right, but it adds to the time and requirements.  There was very vigorous legal analysis activity in this case.  It meant that we had to be diligent, resolute and precise.  We have to get cases like this right.  If the Central Bank does not get cases right, no one will come out with their hands up and admit the offences.  Instead, we will have to prove them, which is a long slog.  In that light, we have to go slowly in forensically turning the page on enormous volumes of data.  That can take time.  I appreciate that this is not to anyone's satisfaction, but enforcement cases take time because they have to be done right.  In this case, it was done right, given that people will not settle with the Central Bank unless they are caught bang to rights.  We put a seminal fine on Davy Stockbrokers and the enforcement outcome has delivered a day of reckoning for it in terms of answering for its conduct and culture.</p></speech>

The Central Bank has repeatedly made the point, including today, that its powers to hold individuals to account require strengthening.  However, the Central Bank already has certain powers to hold individuals to account, which have been touched on by Deputy O'Callaghan.  They involve the imposition of a reprimand, a fine and a prohibition notice.  If people are seeking extra powers and responsibilities, why have the existing powers not been exercised fully by this point?</p></speech>

Under it, we must first prove the breaches against the firm.  That is a prerequisite in the legal framework and we did it in this case.  I stand behind the enforcement outcome.  We have used our powers and imposed a fine and a reprimand, as the Deputy commended us.  As part of that, one must first prove the breach against the firm.  That is part of the legal framework.  Only if the Central Bank can demonstrate obligation on an individual to have executed that task and participated in it can we move forward.</p><p> A number of years ago, informed by our insights in this investigation and some of the other complex large-scale investigations we have undertaken over the past decade, we observed that there is a very good case for improvements, which is often the position, to our enforcement powers in the form of direct enforceable conduct standards, directly enforceable against individuals, requiring them to have integrity or to operate within the requisite standards expected.  A breach of those would be directly enforceable against the individual.  We would not have to go against the firm.  We have also asked to break the participation link and for a senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, where all of the roles and responsibilities of the firm are specified and ascribed to individuals right across the firm so there will be no ambiguity or gaps.  In large-scale firms with complex numbers and situations this will be very helpful.  I am glad we are working with the Department of Finance to bring those improvements into place.  The Government has supported that in the programme for Government.</p></speech>

The Central Bank issued a press statement announcing the imposition of a fine on Davy.  However, the public impression was that the company was fined but no individual was being held to account.  No individuals have been labelled with fines and, as Ms Rowland said to other Deputies, she cannot go into the detail of any further cases being pursued at this stage.  There was no indication that individuals were being pursued in the initial announcement.  This sent the wrong message to the public, the financial services sector and, indeed, the wider world.</p> <p>  Ms Rowland correctly referred to incoming legislation in regard to SEAR.  We all hope and expect to see the heads of that Bill very soon and will have key discussions on that.  The 2018 report talks about the initial scope of SEAR.  Does she hope there will be no limitation on all sectors of financial services being included in the initial scope?  To what extent does she think SEAR can be fully rolled out once the legislation is enacted?</p></speech>

If we are, I am sure the fault is with me and I apologise.  To be absolutely clear, this is a fine on Davy, the firm.  I perhaps picked the Deputy up wrong in his questioning if he was talking about actions other than that.  I want to be clear and do not want to misrepresent anything.  This is presented as and is action against the firm, and I will make no comment about action against individuals.</p> <p>  Separately, our recommendation for the applicability of SEAR is that it should extend to banks, the insurance sector and customer facing industries, which would cover Davy.  I apologise if the Deputy asked me another question that I have not addressed.  If he repeats it, I would be happy to seek to answer it.</p></speech>

There was and still is an impression that the fine, as Ms Rowland correctly said, is only being applied to Davy.  The concern out there, as detailed by every speaker so far in this committee hearing, is that the initial impression was that no action would be taken against individuals.  As Deputy Doherty laid out in great detail, there are concerns over particulars.  The concern is that the Central Bank, in its initial announcement on this investigation &ndash; we had to wait a considerable amount of time for Davy's response in the form of a statement &ndash; never made it clear that individuals could and would be pursued.  People want to know about because they are concerned.</p> <p>  I will repeat my question regarding SEAR.  She mentioned certain areas she thinks should be covered.  Does she believe it should cover every area of financial services?</p></speech>

SEAR should cover all areas with customer facing financial services with a big impact on customers.  My colleague, Mr. Sibley, may wish to add something to that.</p></speech>

What has happened over the past number of years has come at a significant cost.  One of the sentences that hopped off the page when I read the report was about sunlight acting as a disinfectant against malpractice.  To be honest, I have not seen much sunlight here.  That may not be the responsibility of the Central Bank; it may be the legislation that governs the actions of the Central Bank.</p> <p>  I am struck by the sentence that: "Information made public is in accordance with an agreement with the firm".  I struggle to think of any space in the rest of our society where such a level of malpractice and law-breaking would involve a non-disclosure agreement, to a certain extent.</p></speech>

This is absolutely not the case and could not be further from what is the position.  A non-disclosure agreement-----</p></speech>

Those names are not known.  That has a serious implication for society because those individuals could well be involved in very responsible roles in other organisations.  We do not know the influence they have or whether they work for the State or other banks.  We, the representatives of the people, are blind to the identity of these individuals.  If a young person was caught robbing a toaster from a shop, his or her identity would be known to everybody.  It is very hard for people to understand how the identity of these individuals is not known.</p> <p>  I apologise if I have understood the situation incorrectly.  I am not saying that the Central Bank is in any way acting outside of the law.  We as legislators have to understand the law and make provision in future for what happens in this way.</p></speech>

On a personal level, I set up enforcement in the Central Bank of Ireland and took the very first enforcement case.  As a matter of absolute public interest we, in a post-crisis environment, knew we were charged with a very precious public duty to act in the public interest for the Irish people and to hold wrongdoing to account.</p> <p>  The only way that can be done is through the legal frameworks which require legally compliant investigations, operated to due diligence, that successfully hold firms and individuals to account.  We are only permitted to put information into the public domain through two routes in the administrative sanctions procedure.  The first is through the long, slow slog of an inquiry that could perhaps double the length of time it would take to bring the information into the public domain.  The second is through a challenging and demanding approach, whereby one resolves the case on the absolutely correct basis, does not let anybody off scot free, makes sure people are held to account and puts as much information as possible into the public domain to shine a light on what happened. </p> <p>  In fact, by insisting on transparent detailed statements like this, one makes the information accessible, insofar as financial services can ever be accessible to people.  One seeks to make what is going on understood by the public at large.  Such action shines a light.  We do that because although the fines on firms are punitive, I, like the Deputy, can recognise that they can be seen as something to be paid.  Putting this detailed information into the public domain may not answer all of the Deputy's concerns and needs, which I can appreciate, but it puts the public representatives, public and media in possession of the full facts of the case.  It is not a short statement or inaccessible; it is clear and complete.  It is the most that we can do within the legal permissions.  </p> <p>  In terms of putting people's names in the public domain, those people are entitled to the protections of the law and the Central Bank is obliged to obey that.  We do not shy away from holding individuals or firms to account where it is possible to do so.</p><p>We do not shy away from holding individuals or firms to account where it is possible to do so.  I make that as a general comment.  We have published disqualification information and prohibition notices.  We are committed to doing it because we understand the trust we have been given to act in the public good and we seek to do this.</p></speech>

We will not get the accountability we need unless the legislation is changed to ensure individual accountability for the behaviour of individuals in this type of role.</p> <p>  Is the Central Bank's responsibility for fitness and probity carried out in retrospect?  If some of the 16 are in roles in other banks, institutions or departments will their fitness to work in them be affected by action by the Central Bank?</p></speech>

There are three pillars to that system.  It is a protective system not a punitive one.  By that I mean that it only attaches to people who are applying for jobs in financial services.  If one leaves, one does not have to face fitness and probity challenges.  However, if the Central Bank has information that gives rise to concern, a system in the bank will record that information, we will flag it and it will be waiting for anyone who applies for a role so he or she will be challenged.  My colleague, Mr. Sibley identified this system previously.  Somebody who has a case to answer or issues of concern will be met in a challenge interview and the enforcement lawyers will support the relevant supervisors in taking the decision.  If people hold roles in financial services and they give rise to concern, there is an option to consider that and take a procedure against them in respect of that.</p> <p>  The three pillar concerns a message I would like to get out to everybody so they understand that firms run their own business.  They run their own culture.  Regulators can comment on culture but cannot set culture.  It can only be done by the businesses and firms are totally responsible for ensuring the people who run their business are fit and proper.  It is one of the pillars of the fitness and probity regime.  </p> <p>  I emphasise that responsibility and accountability for operating a business rest with the business.</p></speech>

My question relates to the investigation process.  We have heard much about the administration sanction procedure and how individuals cannot be investigated until the investigation of the firm is completed.  I ask Ms Rowland about her view on the design of the administration sanction procedure.  Why could the fitness and probity regime not be used investigate individuals in parallel with the administration sanction procedure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021030900002#G00800"><p>It is not that the enforcement team cannot investigate an individual at the same time as looking at the firm but the Central Bank of Ireland operates under a number of legal frameworks.  The fitness and probity framework, as we have heard, is a protective framework and it is one set of rules and requirements.  The administrative sanctions framework has another set of rules and requirements.</p> <p>  The team operates by considering the issues and then doing an investigation.  It keeps the options open in terms of avenues to take.  An issue for the Central Bank in litigious or contested issues is when the choice is to use the administrative sanctions procedure, the law sets out the obligations rest with the firm.  In order to pursue individuals, one has to demonstrate that the firm committed a breach.  It is written in the legislation.  One then has to show an individual participated in the breach committed by the firm and demonstrate his or her participation.</p> <p>  The approach in the investigations is to acquire the relevant facts and information, do the data trawl and get the information.  The Senator will appreciate the Central Bank regulates from small firms to highly complex organisations with large scale operations and systems or complicated issues which is time consuming and meticulous.  When I started as a lawyer, quite often the information we had only ran to hundreds of pages and sometimes thousands but it is normal for us to operate at large scale.  It is the scale of the investigation and drilling down through all of those to acquire the relevant facts.  The teams run open consideration-----</p></speech>

Is it not possible to prosecute under the fitness and probity regime until the administration sanction procedure is completed?  It seems there are clear breaches of the fitness and probity regime.  Under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 making a gain or causing a loss by deception is an offence.  That appears to be what is in question with J &amp;amp; E Davy.  Why has there not been a prosecution under that Act?  Why has action not been taken under the fitness and probity regime and the clear standards it sets out?</p></speech>

We have held the firm to account.  The Central Bank of Ireland considered the theft and fraud offences Act.  The public statement referenced an agreement in respect of the underlying bond and the civil ligation about this is in the public domain.  Others can tell the Senator more about the outcome but the background to this lead us not to form that suspicion she considers apparent.  Of course, we considered it.</p> <p>  I have already said that now all the detail is in the public domain we have engaged with relevant authorities and can discuss it with them but it is not a clear cut matter.</p></speech>

We believe they will considerably strengthen the standards of conduct by the participants in financial services which, after all, is exactly what we all want to see.

It took seven years from when the original action took place and five years since the High Court case.  We know that the staff count within the Central Bank has almost doubled over the past ten years.  Is it the case that within the enforcement section, all energies were devoted to the tracker mortgage scandal and investigation over the past number of years, and the Central Bank was almost overwhelmed by that and unable to take on additional investigations such as this important one?  There is real alarm at the length of this investigation and concern over what other breaches may have taken place during the period of time it took before the Central Bank issued its report and announced the fine last week.  I would like our guests to comment on the average length of time that investigations take and, indeed, whether the enforcement section has been overwhelmed by the tracker mortgage scandal.</p></speech>

I am absolutely clear that we are running a number of important and significant investigations.  This Davy investigation is one of those.  It was properly progressed by the team.  The team is also taking serious action right across a portfolio of cases, including in respect of tracker mortgages.  Significant outcomes were delivered last year in the insurance sector and action was taken against individuals.  The team is well able and capable of moving significant cases forward, as its track record demonstrates.  We have taken, as I said, more than 141 cases to date with seminal fines delivered regularly.  The Central Bank of Ireland progressed this complicated and challenging case with diligence, as it does with its enforcement work and the other complex cases it is discharging.</p></speech>

I have just one query about Davy and do not want to go around in circles and ask the same questions again.  I will ask about the level of qualifications required to sit on an Irish board.  As we know, board membership is bound by age.  That seems to be the only great marker for board membership.  Does Ms Rowland feel there should be some minimum standard of corporate governance qualification?  I am sure that there are ongoing reviews and whatever else in certain financial systems.  I would be curious about the qualifications in corporate governance that the guys in Davy were exposed to.  If they were doing a certain amount of corporate governance every year, questions would surely occur to them about whether what they were doing was right and where they were going.</p></speech>

The Central Bank of Ireland has specific criteria about fitness and probity for role holders in specific jobs.

I thought I should be fair to my colleague, who has well-developed and particular views on the matter, and allow the two of us to discuss some of the matters with the Senator.  I am happy to answer the question.  It is important that the skills and capabilities of individuals are looked at when they join a board.  It is an onerous job and it is important that they discharge it well.  There is a specific set of roles and expectations of role holders on boards and, on top of that, I also referenced the need for a firm to be governed well, with appropriate decision-making and with well-developed risk and compliance frameworks commensurate with the complexity of the business.  There is a need for effective and sustainable business models.  Firms need to ensure proper standards of risk governance, particularly with investor protection.  One can see how impactful and wrong the lack of risk management frameworks, proper conflicts of interest management and controls over staff dealing has been in instances such as the Davy case.</p> <p>  Another dimension to the composition of a board is the balance, composition and skill sets of the aggregate group.  I know that if Mr. Sibley's IT was working better at the moment, he would want me to make the point that the Central Bank of Ireland this week issued data on the diversity in the composition of role holders in financial services.  We have not made the kind of progress that we need to make.  One could look at the Davy case or a number of other instances in Irish financial services and make a cultural comment that we are dealing with groupthink because there is not a sufficient diversity of skills, experience, attitude, gender, ethnicity, educational background and socioeconomic background on the boards.  People from different echelons of society with different experiences and educational insights can bring a wide, diverse and challenging set of views to a board.  That would strengthen the governance, decision-making and oversight so that a business is run to the standards expected with competence and capability but also with diversity of thought.  That would mean no cosy groups who are not challenged by diverse compositions of people with the right skill sets.  I hope that gives the Senator some considerations in reply to his question.</p></speech>

Ms Rowland talked about groupthink and if there is groupthink, it applies to a culture of greed and entitlement.</p><p>I think what is displayed is a sense of being untouchable, which is a sense that needs, in my opinion, to be really shaken.  For me, the long arm of the law needs to feel a few white collars here.</p><p> On that, Ms Rowland has indicated fairly clearly that she does not intend to call the garda&iacute; in.  If I heard her correctly, she indicated that should other agencies wish to discuss the report with her that she would be "satisfied" to do so.  She has also indicated that she has "had tentative engagement with some", which implies more than one.  With whom has the Central Bank had these tentative engagements?  Did they include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

That does a disservice to our actions.  I confirm that, in the course of this very meticulous and careful investigation, we did not form suspicion to support reports to other agencies.  We have published a very detailed enforcement outcome only last week and following on that, which put the information into the public domain, we have been in contact with various agencies that I will not name.  They would not wish me to do so and I will not.  I absolutely intend to have a proactive discussion with a number of agencies about this, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, to sit down with them in the full facts of the information so that, from their perspective, they could consider this matter.</p> <p>  I want to make an observation at a general level.  We are in regular and excellent contact, for example, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na right across a number of issues.  We find them proactive and responsive.  I would like them to report of us in the same way.  We are both part of the Hamilton Group, which is a group that has been put in place to make recommendations about the improvement, if I call it in my language, in white-collar crime issues with a number of recommendations about an expert advisory committee.  </p></speech>

Am I correct in that?</p></speech>

So, the 16 individuals have been involved here for a period of seven years since then.  The question arises as to whether this was an exceptional case or whether there might have been other cases in the course of those seven years.  That would seem to me to be a strong argument for opening up the books and for going through the Davy books for the last seven years at least with a fine tooth comb.  Has the Central Bank done that and, if not, why not?</p></speech>

The Central Bank of Ireland cannot usually comment on our actions in supervision but because Davy themselves have publicly confirmed that significant changes have already happened in terms of their own actions, in terms of governance, risk management, addressing these issues, I can tell  for the Deputy that the Central Bank of Ireland it is not by an accident that those issues have occurred.  As is usual in supervision, we demand that these matters are addressed and I cannot get into detail around specifics more than that.  In fact, we have provided a significant amount of detail about this case in the course of this focused series of questions.  I am happy to confirm that this is a high priority for us.  It is a dynamic regulatory context.  We have put out only last week the details and supervision is intrusive.</p></speech>

I merely seek clarification on one point.  The Central Bank has conducted an exhaustive investigation over a whole number of years into a particular deal or case.  Has there been an investigation, not by Davy, but by the Central Bank into the possibility of other such deals perhaps involving those 16 individuals perhaps within the company over the last seven years or has the Central Bank left that to Davy to check into?</p></speech>

That is how that is dealt with and we put that into the public domain.

The staff of the Central Bank will use their own skilfulness to scrutinise those issues and even do things like appoint, for example, external persons to look at those issues, and demand that they are looked at.</p></speech>

Ms Rowland has made it clear in the course of the engagements that she is not prepared to name the 16 individuals and she has kind of indicated that there might be legal issues with her doing so as well.  She has indicated that if, and when, they leave Davy that their new employers have a responsibility in that situation.  Do the clients who are served by such a financial institution not have rights as well?  To bring it down to brass tacks, I have an investment in a pension fund, for argument's sake; that pension fund is with a financial institution and one of these 16 individuals transfer over and gets new employment in that institution.  Should I not have a right to know that that is the person who is managing my pension fund or is it solely a matter for the CEO or board of the company to take care over who they are employing?  Should I not have a right to know who is in charge of my money?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021030900002#J01400"><p>Because people are entrusted to run financial services firms, it really matters.  It matters to the consumers and the investors.  There is a very careful system of pre-approval, under which one is not entitled or permitted to take up a senior role in a financial services company unless the firm itself proposes one but then it has to be approved by the Central Bank of Ireland.  So it is not simply a decision of a firm or chief operations officer, COO.  Of course, it is very important to recognise their obligations that anybody who is running a business must take the responsibility for making sure that the people that they employ are fit to do the work to serve investors and consumers but there are additional safeguards.  Nobody is allowed to take up a position of a senior role in financial services - there is a list of those positions and roles - without approval from the Central Bank precisely because, as the Deputy said, it is very important that the investors are protected from individuals.  So the system is designed with that in mind.</p> <p>  Deputy, we can only name people where the law allows us to do so.  Otherwise we, ourselves, would be breaking the law if we ignored those safeguards that are in place.</p></speech>

It is not in my hands; it is the hands of the Central Bank and the heads of the financial services company.</p><p>These 16 individuals held, and I presume still hold, a large number of shares in Davy - in fact, probably a controlling share.  They may be forced to move on to other companies, but is the Central Bank in a position to compel them to get rid of those shares?  Could it be the case that those 16 individuals will still have a controlling share in this company?  Is that theoretically possible?</p></speech>

We will discharge all of our proper responsibilities.  As a general matter, the Central Bank takes very seriously its responsibilities in regard to ensuring that people who work in firms are fit and proper.  In the authorisation of firms, there are certain criteria we have to consider and certain criteria in respect of shareholding ownership that reach thresholds with specific factors.  All of that is set out in a legislative scheme and the Central Bank will discharge its obligations fully and properly.</p> <p>  There can be cases where firms are part of a wider group structure, some parts of which might not be regulated in financial services.  It might have unregulated business and there may be shareholdings to do with that.  That is outside of our scope, but we will take our obligations seriously, as we do and as we have demonstrated by following through on this action and holding Davy to account in public.</p></speech>

We are very clear about their responsibilities to ensure they run it effectively, in line with our expectations and in compliance with the necessary regulations.  Clearly, there is further strengthening to be done there but, notwithstanding the shareholding, there are very specific obligations on the board and the executive of the firm.</p></speech>

How did it come to pass that executives, junior or senior, of a stockbroking company might feel it possible to engage in the kind of dealing in which they became involved?  I understand there are strict regulations for how employees, executives or shareholders within such companies are allowed to operate.  How did they feel they could operate with impunity?</p></speech>

The investigation uncovered a group of senior people who did not adhere to the serious obligations to manage conflicts of interest.  That is a fundamental obligation in financial services, particularly where investors are served, some of whom will ultimately be consumers as well.  In this case, there was a total disregard for any serious consideration of conflict of interest management.  It seemed to be a conflict-free environment where no consideration was given, no minutes were taken, no oversight was exercised and they absolved themselves from any kind of adherence to the serious obligations.  Even pre-approval for trading appeared to be given to others, even though the others had not been identified.</p> <p>  Moreover, there was an avoidance of the staff personal account dealing framework.  A separate framework was in place in the firm that staff were meant to use for personal accounts that could have been overseen by compliance.  The dealing happened on the firm account, which drove a coach and horses through the protection of having the separate deal framework, and that was absolved as well.  The compliance function could not do its job because it was bypassed in that way.</p> <p>  There are serious questions for Davy to answer.  The details of the public statement have given it that moment of reckoning that it clearly did not recognise it should have recognised.</p></speech>

I think Davy knew about it from the get-go, given that it was its conduct that was complained of to us, and it was known about at senior levels.  The Central Bank of Ireland became aware of it a number of months later, after it entered the public domain.  As we detailed in our statement, our view is there was a lack of candour on the part of those who contacted the Central Bank to try to characterise the deal as something different from what it was.  It was only subsequently, through the diligent digging in the detailed investigation, that the full details that are in the statement came to light.</p></speech>

Was there a disclosure by somebody from inside the firm or was a complaint made by an outside person or entity?  If so, was it acted on?  Seven years have elapsed, although it became public knowledge when the matter was brought to court.  Financial services operate under licence from the Central Bank, and when they depart from the rules, presumably that licence should be withdrawn.  If that is not the case, why?  Did somebody at the Central Bank notify Davy to say it was out the window and it needed to explain what had gone on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1146" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021030900002#K00900"><p>I think Davy was aware of it because the investigation focuses on conduct it was engaged in.  The information came into the public domain a number of months later.  Davy contacted the Central Bank and, in that initial contact, we formed the view that it had a distinct lack of candour and transparency about the real characterisation of the deal.  The Central Bank of Ireland responded to the information it had.  As I set out for some of the Deputy's colleagues, we have taken that issue seriously.  We have been engaged in very assertive supervision with Davy over a number of issues.  As part of that, there was sufficient concern about the issue that an enforcement case was opened alongside that supervision.  The Central Bank of Ireland had contact from Davy, we were very concerned about that, and we have been taking and continue to take assertive supervisory action.  Alongside that, we opened the enforcement investigation precisely because we had a high degree of concern about the set of facts.  We had to dig long, hard and deep to get to the bottom of the matter and uncover this, which we have done.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about licence revocation.  The Central Bank has a number of powers and we have to use them in a proportionate and commensurate way.  We have taken the action against Davy - the firm - and determined that the appropriate course of action is to impose on it a very significant fine in the sum of approximately &euro;4 million.  We also issued a detailed public statement, which is right because where we can do so, we should put the information into the public domain.  The criteria for revoking a licence are specific and need to be applied in a proportionate way.</p><p>It was our judgment that the appropriate course of action here was an enforcement fine to mark the gravity and seriousness of the matter and for the public information to accompany that so that Davy Stockbrokers could be held to account.  That acts as a deterrent against the conduct in the firm.  It sends a message to all other market participants that this kind of conduct will not be tolerated and that we seek to deter them from engaging in this type of conduct.  The third reason is that it seeks to support public accountability in the oversight system through holding individuals to account.</p></speech>

I presume that the captions stating that an organisation has the right to operate under licence from the Central Bank of Ireland are an advertisement to everybody that these are safe organisations with which to do business.  Clients can be absolutely assured that they are dealing with a safe house.  The activities in question went on for seven years and it was not possible for the client to come to that conclusion.  At any stage in the past seven years or before that, did the Central Bank receive a complaint about the activities going on in Davy Stockbrokers?  Did any clients complain?  Did anyone complain about a client?  Was that complaint received in the Central Bank?  My last question is on whether there are any particular groups of shareholders or investors with Davy Stockbrokers who might be particularly affected in one way or another by what went on.  I am referring to being beneficially affected, of course.</p></speech>

It seems from what Ms Rowland is saying that this issue came to light not through the Central Bank, but because people fell out, it became public and then the Central Bank was informed and the investigation ensued.  That seems to be the way it happened.</p> <p>  My second question relates to the individuals to whom the Central Bank has spoken in the course of its investigation.  Ms Rowland referred to the challenges the Central Bank experienced in dealing with these individuals and the culture within the bank and so on.  Does she have confidence in Davy Stockbrokers undertaking what it deems to be an independent investigation or would she prefer the Central Bank to randomly select a number of accounts or transactions that it could examine to ensure that it can verify just what is going on?  The attitude that this is the business of Davy Stockbrokers does not wash any more.  The public are tired and fed up with it and want to see some action in this regard.  Are these characters in Davy Stockbrokers capable of allowing an independent investigation to take place or does Ms Rowland think that in the interests of the State, the Minister or the Central Bank should engage in an investigation wider than that which it has conducted already?</p></speech>

I will answer some of Deputy Durkan's questions first and then perhaps Mr. Sibley will join in.  Deputy Durkan asked a range of specific questions about complaints data in respect of Davy Stockbrokers.  I do not have all of that information to hand but I am happy to follow up in writing if that is acceptable.  I am happy for my colleague, Mr. Sibley, to come in.</p></speech>

I am certainly not aware of any other specific complaints that are in any way similar to the matter with which we are dealing here today.  It is clear that Davy Stockbrokers has a job of work to do to restore trust in its business and performance and what it is doing in terms of the business that it runs.  It has stated that it will do an independent review.  I think it would certainly be welcome if it were to do an independent review where the scope of that review and the findings of that review would be made clear.  If it is serious about restoring that trust, I absolutely think its representatives should appear before the committee, as I think they have been invited to do, to explain what has happened in the firm.  It can speak to what is really-----</p></speech>

The question is about whether the Central Bank has confidence in Davy Stockbrokers in terms of there being no other issues that will come out of the woodwork.  Does it have confidence in these characters who delayed this investigation for so long carrying out Davy's own independent investigation?  I want the representatives of the Central Bank who are present to understand that the Irish public is fed up with insiders looking at themselves.  They are fed up with the insider trading that is going on, the arrangements and the bypassing of regulation.  They are sick to the teeth of it.  They see that the Central Bank, as regulator, is doing a job on this occasion, but I am afraid that there are many other questions that have to be answered in the context of building up trust.  One has to build up the trust of the Irish public as well.  Is the Central Bank confident about Davy Stockbrokers carrying out the independent investigation?  Is it confident that this is the only glitch?</p></speech>

I completely understand and agree with the concerns that have been raised by the Chairman and committee members.  We are doing our job in terms of holding Davy Stockbrokers to account both in terms of the public action through the enforcement notice publication and also what we are doing in an ongoing supervisory perspective.  What we have seen publicly in the past week is that Davy Stockbrokers still has a journey to go on in terms of change; changing the culture and the individuals who are responsible for leading Davy Stockbrokers.  That work is ongoing.  We can see it in the public domain.  I think Davy needs to do further work, including, as I stated, appearing before the committee to explain what it is doing.  It would be helpful if it were to publish the scope of any kind of follow-on report or review it is undertaking as well as discussing it with the committee.</p></speech>

It was originally &euro;5.9 million but Davy got a 30% discount because it had acted in good faith.  Was anything discussed apart from the financial settlement?  Did any negotiations relating to matters other than the financial settlement take place in the context of the settlement?</p></speech>

The approach will be that the Central Bank of Ireland will have an evidence-based procedure, which is a very formal and structured procedure, with the firm where the evidence is laid out in front of it and the allegations of breach are put to it.  The Central Bank of Ireland puts it up to the firm that it can accept a fine set at a level; in this case the fine that was imposed was in excess of &euro;4 million.  The proposals usually made to firms are that, for example, a reprimand, which is one of the penalties in the administrative sanctions procedure, together with a fine, are proposed to the firm.  It is the firm's choice to accept or reject that.</p><p> The Central Bank of Ireland will not enter into a binding settlement agreement without a very detailed public statement.  As a matter of approach, the public statement is often a very serious focus for the firm because it does not want the details of the action to be in the public domain or it does not want too much detail in the public domain.  It is often a very significant part of the argument that happens there.  The public statement that members have before them is the key piece of information containing the penalties.  That is the thrust of that focus.</p><p> If the firm chooses not to accept that approach, that is its right but then the case would move on to the next phase, the inquiry phase, which, as I detailed to the Senator's colleagues earlier, could take a significant length of time and elongate the matter even more.  The discount is applied because there is a significant value.  It is very like the criminal system where discounts are applied for guilty pleas to avoid the necessity, expense, burden and time of a trial because it is a very significant public benefit to the Central Bank of Ireland that our staff can then apply their skills in the pursuit of other cases.  Therefore, that is the approach we follow.</p></speech>

It might be for others to have their own observations.  However, I can tell the Senator what I have shared with other members, which is that a very diligent investigation was done here where the investigation teams looked at the conduct in question and they looked at what breaches have arisen as a result of that conduct.  Clearly MiFID is very significant European legislation for investor protection and transparency on the market.  It is very important that it is adhered to.  We did not formulate the view that there were criminal reports to be made.</p></speech>

Perhaps we have time to go sequentially.</p><p>I have two sets of questions.  One relates to the supervisory work.  Ms Rowland mentioned that is a separate team.  Is that supervision of Davy structures overall or would that supervision, for example, have extended during the period of investigation to supervision of the relevant individuals who were the subject of the investigation?  Ms Rowland mentioned the intrusive supervision.  How detailed is it?</p><p>The Central Bank stated that it was striking how easy it was for individuals involved to circumvent the personal account dealing framework.  Have any further investigations or examinations taken place into these individuals and their actions in respect of the framework?  To the extent that Ms Rowland can indicate, what further investigations or activities have taken place?  I acknowledge the work of Se&aacute;na Cunningham on this investigation.  It is important to understand what has happened in parallel during those seven years.  Was the supervisory work forward looking or did it look backwards to examine those?  </p><p>I share the concern about groupthink.  The Ailmount investment body has 30 equal shareholders, five of whom I believe come from Davy.  This is what <i>thecurrency</i>uncovered about the company structures.  My concern is that the investment limited partnership legislation passed by the Oireachtas makes it much easier when we talk about board responsibility.  It is now possible for somebody to sit on a board, have influence on the decisions of a board and be a limited partner with relatively little liability.  Given those scenarios of groupthink, is it a concern to have a number of members of a board, all of whom are counted as limited partners, working in concert in the way we have seen at Davy?  It seems extraordinary that the limited partnership legislation was rushed through while the senior executive accountability regime seems to be stalled.  Why is that stalled?  Did the Central Bank have concerns over the reduction of board accountability in the investment limited partnership legislation?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee, which is very welcome.</p> <p>  This transaction took place in November 2014.  It has been reported that the bonds were purchased by the consortium for &euro;5.4 million.  The Central Bank enforcement action notice stated that three weeks after the transaction, the consortium sold a large tranche of the bonds to a fund manager.  How much was that tranche sold for?  Cantor Fitzgerald claimed that they could be sold for 30 cent on the euro.  I ask Ms Rowland to confirm that.  Was that then distributed to members of the consortium?  Were the remaining bonds sold and if so, when were they sold and at what value?  </p> <p>  I understand that the Central Bank had to agree with Davy what was put into the public domain.  Had the bank planned at any point to put the detail of the individuals' names into the public domain?  Are any of the individuals involved in this now working in an entity regulated by the Central Bank?  It is extremely important for people to be aware of that.  </p> <p>  Did the Central Bank ask if this was an isolated incident relating to this consortium?  Will it carry out a review to establish if this did not happen to others?  That is a further concern people have.  </p> <p>  I also have a question on business interruption insurance, but I take it we are not asking those kinds of questions today.

That will look at supervision in a number of aspects.  I am thinking about the overall governance of the firm that management controls, the frameworks compliance function, issues such as operational risk, IT risk and, crucially in the case of Davy, client assets.  We need to look at how it separates these to ensure that the assets it is managing for clients are separated from its own balance sheet and its own business dealings and so on.</p><p>That is undertaken by a specific team of supervisors who supervise in an ongoing way, supplemented by inspectors and analysts.  We also use what are known as skilled persons-third parties to do further work, looking at issues form a governance and control perspective.  We also do sample testing in terms of transactions or, in the case of client assets, particular protections.  This covers the full range of the business of the bank.  We do not oversee or overlook every transaction for practical reasons but the work covers the full breadth of the business of the organisation.  We will have to come back to the committee on the limited liability points.  We expect board members to be fully accountable, taking responsibility for the chief direction of the firm and making sure that the risks are understood within the firm and controlled effectively.  Clearly, there were shortcomings in Davy in that respect.  We have been engaged intensively to address those shortcomings over time.  I will ask Ms Rowland to respond to the questions about the specific investigation.</p></speech>

I have sought to answer in a general way our approach to intrusive supervision, where we have gone in and demanded that issues are looked at and addressed.  I cannot be drawn beyond the answers I have previously given and the additional answers that my colleague, Mr. Sibley, has given.  We cannot provide the Deputy with the details around the bond, the value of the bond and when it was distributed, but there was a settlement with a private individual, the details of which have not been made public.  Davy can answer those questions better than I can and share with the committee the details around that.  There is information in the public domain, to which I cannot add.  Equally, the Central Bank could never name individuals or suggest that individuals be named without doing so through a legal power and so there was no prospect of being able to name individuals in the course of an action being-----</p></speech>

I apologise to members that we could not get to the insurance issues, as outlined by Senator Casey, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and others, but we will return to that quickly.   In the interests of members, on the insurance issue we may raise a number of questions for immediate answer and, perhaps, set an early for engagement with the sector on the issues.</p> <p>  In regard to today's meeting, there exists still a cosy group that allows seamless transfer from inside to outside, from Government agencies into banks and other entities.  They seem to be acting as untouchables, based on the culture we have seen exposed here through the Central Bank report.  I would still like the Central Bank to investigate a random sample of transactions to determine what went on in Davy.  Earlier, we agreed that we would invite Davy to come before the committee to explain its position and what it intends to do about it.  I ask Davy to consider this invitation and the transcript of this meeting, which will be sent to them.  If they wish to respond in any way to the questions asked by members or the issues raised, they should do so.  It is time we took down the veil of secrecy around all of these matters and brought them into the public domain.  My remarks are not pointed at the Central Bank, but at all of those involved in banking and in Davy.  </p> <p>  We have gone over time.  I thank the witnesses for attending today.</p></speech>

Up to 7 March, a total of 223,219 cases and 4,422 deaths due to Covid-19 have been recorded in Ireland.  Our 14-day incidence rate is now 172.3 per 100,000, down from almost 1,500 in the middle of January.</p> <p>  We are still actively managing 358 outbreaks in acute hospitals and long-term residential care settings, although the number of new outbreaks is falling.  As of today, I will give the updated numbers from my script, we now have 397 people with Covid-19 in hospital and 101 people receiving ICU care.</p><p>While falling, these numbers are still very high in the context of our experience with this disease and in comparison with other health conditions.  This has an ongoing impact on our acute and community services which are simultaneously responding to usual seasonal pressures and maintaining as many services as possible, accounting for social distancing measures and infection prevention and control, IPC, requirements.</p><p> Thankfully, our winter plan initiatives, such as GP access to diagnostics and additional home care hours, are successfully mitigating demand on hospital services.  We are restarting paused services on an incremental basis and hope to be in a position to restart all services shortly.  However, it must be understood that our staff are still in the midst of responding to the unprecedented Covid-19 surge, from which the recovery will be much more gradual than the escalation.</p><p> On testing and tracing, the third Covid-19 surge placed unprecedented pressure on our test and trace system, with an increase in demand that has been well-documented.  Referrals for testing peaked at 28,000 per day in late December 2020.  Extensive operational planning and demand modelling was undertaken in advance of this period which allowed the agile deployment of many levers and service reconfigurations to cope with prolonged demand.  The decision to reduce close contact testing allowed all testing resources to be directed to finding new cases from symptomatic individuals.  Close contact testing resumed on 29 January.  Retrospective contact tracing is occurring and will increase as case numbers reduce to under 600 consistently.  While testing volumes remain high, current metrics across the test and trace system show that we are operating within target performance levels.  The HSE antigen working group is validating a range of antigen assays, including in acute hospitals, the meat processing sector, community testing sites and outbreak settings.  Antigen testing is now available to all acute hospitals and is being used by three National Ambulance Service mobile teams on a pilot basis.  These will be used as a tool alongside our extensive PCR rapid and batch testing systems.</p><p> On vaccinations, since the roll-out of the vaccination programme began on 29 December 2020, significant achievements have been made by the HSE.  As of 5 March, 363,601 first-dose vaccines and 149,721 second-dose vaccines - a total of 513,322 - have been administered.  We will get updated figures this morning.  I am delighted to report that residents in long-term residential care facilities, front-line healthcare workers, and people over 85 years of age have largely received their first dose, and in many cases, their second dose.</p><p> We are continually adjusting our integrated operational plans to align with the updated allocation sequencing and confirmation of supply schedules.  Despite many challenges, the HSE has adhered to the Government&rsquo;s principle of ensuring all available vaccine supply is administered.  We are currently among the top five countries in the EU for vaccine roll-out.</p><p> Clinical oversight and guidance are at the centre of directing the roll-out of the vaccination programme to ensure vaccines can be administered safely, efficiently and effectively.  We continue to build the appropriate capacity to administer 250,000 vaccines per week, subject to supply.  Our ongoing planning and roll-out includes operating models for GPs, pharmacies and vaccination centres, alongside the corresponding ICT, infrastructure and recruitment mobilisation.  Some 37 HSE vaccination centres have been agreed and the required infrastructure is being finalised, with self-referral processes planned.  To date, over 2,000 recruitment applications have been received and an additional 9,702 healthcare professionals have completed Covid-19 vaccination training.</p><p> In conclusion, we are coming out of a very challenging period, although we are not out of the woods yet.  While we know it has been extremely difficult for everyone, we are asking the public to stick with us over the coming weeks and continue to follow the public health guidance to help suppress the spread of the virus.  The virus and its impact on society remain largely unpredictable and, as such, the need for proactive monitoring and agile planning has always been a feature of our response, and will continue to be so. </p></speech>

I acknowledge the work being done by all of our front-line workers in hospital settings, vaccination centres and GP surgeries.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  The first two will hopefully only require short replies, so I might start with them.  Have all GPs nationwide received at least their first batch of vaccines that were issued up to last week?  Second, last week at the meeting of the committee, I raised with the Minister for Health the case of patients in hospital settings who have not received the first dose of the vaccine, as the policy of the HSE was that vaccinations should take place in the community only.  Can Mr. Reid confirm that this policy has now changed and that hospital patients over the age of 70 will now receive the first dose in hospital?</p></speech>

On the question in respect of GPs, we are engaged with a total of over 1,300 practices throughout the country.  The vast majority of them have received and, indeed, administered first doses to 72,500 people in this age population.  The remaining supplies will be sent this week to 30 GP surgeries which are not in a position to buddy up for various understandable reasons.  They cover a population of between 500 and 750 in total.  That group will be vaccinated this week.  The surgeries will receive their supplies during the course of the week.  Our contact centre has been contacting them from last Friday and contact will be made to confirm deliveries for the rest of this week.</p> <p>  On the Senator's second point, he is quite right that there are other people in that age population that need to be vaccinated during the course of this week.  That group includes people who are housebound.  An arrangement has been put in place in agreement with GPs and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, for them to be vaccinated by the National Ambulance Service.  Third, arrangements are being put in place to vaccinate those who are hospitalised in one of our acute hospitals.  It is a tricky issue because there may be some patients who are in hospital for a very short period, so arrangements need to be made in respect of where they will receive their second dose.  However, our leaning now is that if people are in hospital, they will be vaccinated there and will most likely also receive their second dose in hospital.</p></speech>

It is certainly welcome in respect of those who are resident in our hospitals.</p> <p>  In April, it is hoped that we will receive around 250,000 doses per week.  That is the estimate, all being well, and it amounts to 1 million doses for the month.  We want those doses to be administered.  I ask Mr. Reid to talk us through procedurally how this number of vaccines will be administered in our vaccination centres, GP surgeries, pharmacies and even dental surgeries.  For example, will it be first come, first served in the relevant age groups or will people be individually invited to receive the vaccine or book online?  What sort of logistics does the HSE have planned for that?</p> <p>  My second question concerns interns and the intern doctor cohort.  There are currently around 1,100 interns working in the HSE.  From 12 July 2021, this number will drop to 750.  In effect, the health service will be cutting about 250 junior doctor posts, arguably at a time of huge demand for resources.  To put it into context, in University Hospital Galway, intern numbers will fall from 86 to 71; in Portiuncula Hospital, they will fall from 15 to 11; and in Mayo University Hospital, they will fall from 16 to 11.  Last year, the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, offered all eligible graduates of Irish medical schools an internship role with the HSE.  Considering that there is an even larger budget this year, why is that policy not being continued?</p></speech>

I am conscious of the time limit, so I will be brief.</p> <p>  I will briefly walk the committee through the logistics and the sequencing of the delivery of 250,000 vaccines per week in April, as referred to by the Senator.  Put simply, there are plans in place for 37 vaccination centres to open immediately across the country.  There will be a total of approximately 800 booths across those vaccination centres.  The centres will range in size and will have the capacity to complete different levels of vaccination throughout the country.  Some will have 50 booths, some will have between 30 and 50, some will have between one and 20 and others will have between 20 and 30.  They will be of various sizes and scale.  The centres with 50 booths will administer approximately 5,000 vaccinations per day, with the figure reducing to 3,000, 2,000 or 1,000 based on scale and size.  The resourcing plans for the centres are ongoing.</p><p>There are three different strands to it.  There are now almost 10,000 vaccinators on our register of trained vaccinators throughout the country, being a combination of HSE staff, other healthcare staff and professionals.  Our GPs and pharmacists are key as well and they will obviously be part of the vaccination programme.  Separate to that, the local community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and hospital groups have initiated their own recruitment campaigns and have progressed very well with recruitment for their vaccination centres.  Separate to that again, we have advertised through a national campaign and we have close to 2,200 applicants today, almost 1,100 of whom have already been screened.  All have very strong qualifications and many are already Garda vetted and ready to go.  That is the resourcing model approach to the vaccination centres.</p><p> Vaccination centres will operate on a 12-hour day basis.  That does not mean that vaccinators will be working and on their feet for 12 hours.  Rather, they will be working on a rotational shift basis.  We have determined the resourcing requirement to be approximately 25 staff for every ten booths.  Obviously, there will be a requirement for ten vaccinators for ten booths but other administrative staff will also be needed.  We have seen six of these vaccination centres in operation throughout the country, including in Galway, Sligo and Dublin, which has given us a real indication of how they work and the processes involved.  That is the resourcing model for the vaccination centres.</p><p> In terms of how people will be sequenced to come in to the centres, on a national level we are working towards the national prioritisation programme set out by the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, and the sequencing agreed by Government.  The group we are working on at the moment is quite a challenging one.  Cohort 4 comprises those with medical conditions that put them at high or very high risk.  We are working through the process of determining the best locations for them to have their vaccinations.  We envisage it will be a combination of hospitals, vaccination centres and GP surgeries.  As we move into the wider population in April, the vaccination sequencing will be supported by an ICT portal.  As we move into the next category of prioritisation, we will be advising the relevant people to register on the portal and they will be assigned an appropriate location for their vaccine.  Ultimately, as we move into those larger groups in April, it will be a combination of GP surgeries, pharmacies and vaccination centres in their entirety.  That is a very quick overview of the situation with regard to the centres, the sequencing, the who and the when.  I will ask my colleague, Dr. Henry, to respond to the Senator's question on medical interns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1207" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030900002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for his question.  Normally there are 734 intern posts created as part of our structured intern training scheme which feeds into our basic specialist training, higher specialist training and so on.  Last year, as a once-off, we offered in excess of 1,100 posts because of the prevailing conditions.  We were in the middle of the first surge.  The interns started early, on 25 May, rather than in early July and that overlap was particularly welcomed by the intern networks and the junior doctors themselves.  It was always understood that this was a once-off situation.</p> <p>  The figure is set at 734 because that number of places corresponds to other important interdependent numbers, one of which is the number of CAO applicants for medicine and the number of training places available for doctors who come off the intern year, which is a year they must complete before they get full registration.  Basic specialty training comes after intern year, then higher specialist training and, ultimately, consultant posts.  What we are trying to do is create more posts at senior level so there is proper medical manpower planning and a corresponding number of interns produced by our medical schools.</p> <p>  On the issue of the numbers and any future expansion, work is ongoing in the HSE by the national doctors training and planning unit on the modernisation of the intern year project, involving all of the 734 posts.  One stream of this project involves looking at the numbers of posts, the number of training positions for people after they come off intern schemes and how they will ultimately lead to GP or consultant posts as part of proper, all-round manpower planning.  I hope that answers the question but I am happy to respond to any issues the Senator may have.</p></speech>

We are still in the midst of a pandemic and, in that context, is it right to reduce the numbers this year considering we have an increased budget?  Should we not continue at least for this year?  I understand from discussions this morning that the number of CAO applicants for healthcare and medical courses has increased.</p></speech>

Last year we offered, as a once-off, in excess of 1,100 posts.  A significant number of final year medical students turned them down and ultimately we ended up with 992 interns.  The feedback we received is that the aspect that was of greatest value was the overlap between those interns starting early and those who were already in position.  We heard earlier about the falling numbers of Covid cases in hospital and the roll-out of the vaccination programme, which has seen a significant fall in hospital-acquired Covid and in infection among healthcare workers.  It seems we will not be in the same position in terms of need this July as we were in July of last year.</p></speech>

On the wider point of the pandemic and recruitment, the Senator is correct.  We made a good case to the Government through the Department on resourcing.  In the year to the end of 2020, our total resourcing was up by 7,500.  This includes doctors, consultants, nurses and medics.  This is a very significant increase in resourcing which will carry forward into this year.  This year's budget facilitates an incremental increase in resourcing, based on last year, of 16,500 for the year.  That is a process we are working through in terms of recruitment across various channels.  There are very targeted recruitment campaigns being conducted across all of our medical professional workforce.</p></speech>

I am sure many people will be worried if they see an ambulance at the door of an elderly neighbour so I ask Mr. Reid to explain what is going to happen.</p></speech>

We have worked hard to ascertain the best way to get to housebound patients of GPs and there is no doubt the best approach is through our National Ambulance Service.  Obviously, we do not want this to be a surprise for people, so our teams will make contact in advance, which they already do for swabbing.  National Ambulance Service personnel are well trained and take a professional approach to giving advance notice.  It is the most appropriate way to reach housebound people.  As I said previously, the Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines are very complex vaccines.  In terms of reaching those who are housebound, this is the best approach, involving very well-trained paramedics.</p></speech>

We have very limited time so I want to ask as many questions as possible in the ten minutes available to me.  I will start by thanking again all of those on the front line who are doing a wonderful job in our health services, in testing and tracing and in the roll-out of the vaccine.  I appreciate that a lot of good work is being done by a lot of people in the HSE and I want to put that on the record.</p> <p>  On the vaccine roll-out, who has overall responsibility for or command of the supply and logistical issues?  Who is the person in the HSE that has day-to-day, overall responsibility in those areas?</p></speech>

On supply issues, engagement with various suppliers across Europe is done through the Department.  It is Department led and ultimately, the responsibility of the Minister.</p><p>Supply lines are a function of the engagement between the Department and the various suppliers.  Obviously, we in the HSE are engaged in signing contracts etc., but supply lines are the responsibility of departmental officials through the Minister.</p></speech>

We know we have had several interruptions in supply.  It was reported in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>that there was a target of 1.7 million doses by the end of March.  We were told it was 1.4 million earlier this year when others appeared before this committee.  It dropped down to 1.2 million because of an interruption in supply from Astra Zeneca.  Questions are being asked and I hope Mr. Reid will have the answers today for us.  How many times have we seen an interruption on the supply side?  How many times have been told we are getting X number of vaccines and we end up getting Y which is a lesser amount?  Does Mr. Reid have that information for us this morning?  How many times have we seen those levels of interruptions?</p></speech>

I believe 1.7 million related to what might potentially be delivered from the advance purchase agreements.  Ultimately the Deputy is right.  It became clear to us the second forecast figure of 1.4 million was what was likely to come through.  The further figure is very much out there.  Our expectation is that there would be over 1.2 million, about 1.24 million, of expected delivery for this quarter.  Based on what we have experienced recently, we have certainly said a few times-----</p></speech>

We have seen several interruptions on the supply side.  A number of times Astra Zeneca has left us short, as did Moderna last week.  How many times has that happened?  Are we still on course to reach that target or because of those interruptions, will we now not reach that target of 1.2 million by the end of March?</p></speech>

In answer to the Deputy's question we had expected 1.2 million for this quarter.  Realistically we see that probably drifting into the first week of April.  Some 175,000 of them were to be delivered on the last day or so.  Realistically it will be around 1.1 million, probably going to 1.2 million in the first week of April.  With changes to supply, changes to prioritisation, changes to sequencing and changes in vaccine types to be utilised, we have probably changed our operating plan 15 to 17 times in total.  How many of those have been down to supply issues?  On a regular basis from the start of this we have had to adjust to whatever the issue is, be it a supply chain issue or otherwise.  The delivery of it has not impacted to the end of the quarter from an efficiency or an operational perspective.  The delivery of it, if it is to be impacted, will be impacted by supply.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Reid to provide the committee with a note on how frequently there has been an interruption in supply.  This should outline, for example, that on a particular date we were due to receive X number of doses from a particular company and then we received Y which was a lesser amount or more as the case may be.  We should be given that information so that at least we have the facts as to how frequently we have been left short.  I am concerned that the target will now reduce to 1.1 million.  It was 1.7 million initially; it dropped down to 1.4 million; it was then 1.2 million; and it is now 1.1 million.  Obviously, that erodes confidence in the overall roll-out if we are having problems on the supply side.  If Mr. Reid could provide that detailed note to us, it would be useful.</p> <p>  Who is responsible for the logistical side of getting the vaccines from A to B?  Who has operational responsibility for that area?</p></speech>

We are quite happy, through the high-level task force and the Department, to get him a note on supply issues, which have probably changed four times in the past three weeks.</p> <p>  Logistical issues overall are the responsibility of the HSE in conjunction with our supply-chain cold-storage operator.  That would be the manner in which we arrange the distribution to, in the previous weeks, GPs, or to the acute hospital systems.  Through ourselves, our supply-chain cold-storage operator-----</p></speech>

This is not just anecdotal; it is factual and has been reported by many GPs.  Some did not get their vaccines on time.  Some got their vaccines without proper equipment.  I know one GP who received a box of leaflets as opposed to a box of vaccines and they had patients waiting to be inoculated.  We have had reports of these types of incidents and we still have not been given the data on how frequently there has been a problem on the delivery side.</p> <p>  Mr. Reid spoke earlier about those who have been unable to buddy up.  The Minister also gave us that information.  That is not what we are looking for.  We want to know how many times there has been a problem on the delivery side for GPs.  Given that we are experiencing problems when we are administering the vaccine for the very small number of those aged over 85 - we are told we will see it ratchet up very significantly to 250,000 a week from April onwards - it is our responsibility to ask why these problems have happened.  Who has overall responsibility for getting the vaccines from A to B?  On how many occasions did GPs who were due to receive their vaccines not receive them on time, or receive them and may not have had the proper equipment?</p></speech>

That goes unsaid.  We have been very upfront.  We have never said it is anecdotal evidence.  We went on the record publicly last week to acknowledge that there have been issues in the third week of this delivery programme.  I will briefly give some context of the three weeks.  In the first week of this programme, in 255 practices with 500 GPs, 14,500 vaccinations went quite well across the board.  That information comes from the IMO and the ICGP.  In the second week almost 54,000 people were vaccinated in 500 practices containing over 900 GPs.  In the third week, the Deputy is absolutely correct, we have been working with 542 practices for the delivery of approximately 37,000 vaccines.  We did experience problems with a number of practices.  That involved some practices not receiving the required amount, some practices not receiving their vaccines on the day they were expecting it-----</p></speech>

I hear what Mr. Reid is saying about some practices.  It would be important for us to have that number so that we have a sense of the scale of the problem that emerged.  We need to learn lessons as we ratchet up the roll-out.  We all want this to be a success.  When problems arise, we need to fix the problems which is why I am asking who has overall responsibility for ensuring the data are presented to us and more importantly for ensuring that the vaccines get from A to B and that if there are problems those problems are resolved.  I still do not know who has responsibility for logistics in the HSE.  Who has day-to-day responsibility?</p></speech>

We have a dedicated supply chain SRO, who is Se&aacute;n Breslin.  We have a dedicated SRO for logistics.  It is a joint SRO programme involving Se&aacute;n Breslin and Dr. Lucy Jessop.  That is the structure we have on that.</p> <p>  Coming back to numbers, again I am trying to give the Deputy every bit of information I have available today.  We will certainly follow it up with the rest.  I will give some numbers for that third week.  Initially we needed to get to 65 practices in this week, involving 750 patients out of the total of 72,500.  Between 25 and 40 practices had a range of impacts relating to consumables, as the Deputy said, or reduced supplies across the country.  On those two figures, 65 GPs which reduced to 30 for this week for buddying up and delayed deliveries to those and between 25 and 50, I am happy to get the Deputy a further summary.</p></speech>

We have heard from Britain that there may be a need for a booster shot in the autumn.  Does that need to be considered in this State also?  I welcome that we have now started into category 4 and that those with underlying medical conditions will start to get their vaccines.</p><p>It is important that we get that right.  Do we have a central register of people with chronic illnesses and, if not, will that impact our ability to roll out vaccinations to that cohort of people as quickly as possible?  Will consultants have to go through their systems manually to identify those patients and then feed that information to the HSE?  We are again seeing problems with IT systems and the lack of a proper registration system and databases.  </p><p> Will Mr. Reid confirm whether we have a central register of people with chronic illnesses?  If we do not, will that present challenges in identifying the cohort of people with underlying conditions who we all want to see get their vaccines as quickly as possible?  I ask about that in addition to the issue of the booster jab.  Given we have now seen that may have to be done in some other European countries, is that being considered in this State as well?</p></speech>

On the first issue, it must be borne in mind that in the UK a decision was made to extend the interval between the first and second doses of the vaccine and that may have informed any decision made to administer a booster dose.  In addition, HIQA has surveyed the question of immunity, whether natural or vaccine-induced, and there is evidence of persistent antibodies up to six months, with some waning thereafter.  The question of a booster dose is one that is outstanding for all countries internationally and it has not been answered yet.  We may well be looking at annual booster doses, depending on what the evidence shows in time.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that there is not a single national disease registry for the whole range of conditions described by NIAC in its letter.  It is easier to identify patients with certain conditions.  For example, the national renal office has a good idea of the number of people on dialysis, those who have received organ transplantation and those in the end stages of renal failure through the network of nephrologists.  Similarly, in the area of cancer the oncology network will have a fairly good idea of the types of patients described in the NIAC document.  However, for other conditions there is no such registry and that will require us to mine into the information in hospitals and general practices.</p></speech>

I appreciate the responses from Mr. Reid, but it is important for us to have as much data as possible on the inoculation process and on where problems have arisen with GPs not getting vaccines, consumables and syringes on time and associated delays.  I would like to have those data and not just from some GPs.  We must know in percentage terms and in specific numbers how frequently these problems occurred so that we can learn lessons.  I am concerned that perhaps that information is not being recorded, which would be even more of a problem.  If it is being recorded, it can be presented to us.  I ask that the information be presented to the committee in writing in due course.</p></speech>

I can imagine that there is pressure and more pressure from the beginning of every day to the end.  For our part, I express an appreciation of how Mr. Reid, his team and the wider HSE organisation have operated in this pressurised environment.  There is no indication that pressure is going to let up.  I have a question on the figures.  How many people approximately are there in long-term residential care in Ireland?</p></speech>

I can give him two figures.  The number of residents and staff in long-term nursing homes is just over 75,000 people in total.  On the number of vaccinations in long-term care facilities, which my colleague, Mr. Damien McCallion, can clarify, it is more than 90,000 people, including residents and staff.  That includes nursing homes, as well as mental health, disability and other older care settings.</p></speech>

Mr. Reid might also be able to answer this genuine question on the figures for me.  The number of people referred to in Mr. Reid's previous answer is a huge jump.  The census in 2016 estimated that there were just over 32,000 people aged 65 years old and over in what are called communal establishments, of which almost 23,000 were in nursing homes and the remaining 10,000 people were in other communal establishments.  Has there been a jump in the figure from about 22,000 in 2016, and a total of 32,000 at that time, to the figure given by Mr. Reid of 75,000 people?</p></speech>

The figure given by the Deputy is correct if we look at nursing homes and community hospitals which provide long-term care.  These are public units as opposed to private nursing homes.  The breakdown given by the Deputy is therefore approximately correct.  Bearing in mind the particular risk for older people in congregated settings, whatever setting that might be, we went beyond the literal interpretation of the residential care settings in this vaccination programme for people in category 1 and included any areas where older people were present in congregated settings, including mental health facilities.  The risk for people in those facilities was as great as for people included within a strict definition of those in category 1.  The approximate figures given by Deputy are therefore correct because there are private nursing homes and also community hospitals and long-term residential care facilities in the public sector, which comprise a minority of the provision of care for older people in congregated settings.</p></speech>

It also included the staff as well as residents, and that has brought the number up to this total.  We have that breakdown if the Deputy would like to receive it.</p></speech>

There have been reports about the vaccination programme, and this process has been frustrating for everybody, with peaks and troughs.  Mr. Reid will appreciate that several anticipated game changers to date have fallen short.  The latest good news story relates to an anticipated game changer, namely, the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson one-shot vaccine and its potential.  There was an anticipated supply of about 50 million doses of that vaccine in the United States, but in the short term I think that figure has fallen to 10 million doses because of issues encountered by the subcontractor who produces the vials for the vaccine.  It is not an issue with the production of the vaccine but with the production of the vials.  The expectation being talked about now in the US is of 10 million doses being available in the short term.  What news has there been from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson?  The European Medicines Agency, EMA, still has to approve this vaccine.  The population accepts that from now until early or mid-April, there will be issues with supply that are beyond the control of the HSE.  I think the public accepts that but from mid-April, there is an anticipation of what has been termed an "abundant" supply.  How are things looking generally from the perspective of such abundance?</p></speech>

We do not see that there will be an abundance of vaccine supply from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson.  Our second quarter projections indicate approximately 3.8 million vaccine doses being available from four suppliers, assuming the EMA approves the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine.  The assumption is that the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine will make up about 600,000 doses of the total, and that will primarily-----</p></speech>

There will be smaller numbers in mid-April and then there will be greater supply in the following two months, primarily from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question in the round, our first quarter has been an experience of high levels of frustration with supply issues from the HSE's perspective.  The supply from Pfizer has been more stable, although we did have one change to that supply line as well, while the supply from Moderna of late has been unstable, as has certainly been the supply from AstraZeneca.</p><p>We welcome the country manager being appointed by AstraZeneca.  It has been a very frustrating quarter, overall, in terms of supply lines.  That has been an EU-wide issue.</p><p> We expect, and would assume, based on what is happening worldwide, to have a higher level of predictability in the second quarter.  The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson one is a smaller element of our expected commitments.  Having said that, there may be other vaccine supplies that will come on board.  There may be other current suppliers who will strengthen their capacity for the next quarter.  The next quarter will see some swings and roundabouts between suppliers and some other suppliers coming on board.</p></speech>

We see a stronger delivery in quarter 2.  This an EU-wide and worldwide issue.</p> <p>  I will make a few brief comments on the public's perspective.  We totally understand the frustration of the public.  I want to provide some reassurance.  As we get supply, we are administering it in a very efficient manner.  On average, 95% of the supply is administered within a week and sometimes it is administered within three days.  For example, last Friday week we were due an AstraZeneca supply of 64,000 vaccines.  We are operating at such an efficient level at the moment - I do not say this as self praise for the HSE - that we are administering vaccines very quickly.  What happened on that Friday meant that on Saturday and Sunday we did not have the projected volume to deliver over the weekend.  My point is that impacted us immediately.  We are operating at a higher level than most EU countries in terms of administration.</p></speech>

I and a colleague have chaired a group which is examining the validation of antigen tests in a range of settings in the country, one of which is meat plants.  We have worked with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We have now validated one test that can be used in that setting.  What we must understand about rapid antigen testing is that it is not rapid and it is quite resource intensive.  Twice weekly testing in meat plants would require a dedicated resource.  Alongside that, the performance of these tests is not that good for asymptomatic people when the prevalence of infection starts to fall as is happening now.  We are keeping our overall approach with regard to antigen testing in the sector under review.</p></speech>

I thank him and his colleagues for their ongoing work.  I have a number of questions which will require short answers.</p> <p>  I refer to data generally.  I appeal to Mr. Reid to provide more figures on a regular basis.  It is difficult because every week health spokespersons need to ask the Minister for information, and we repeat the requests here.  I will preface my remarks by saying that everybody understands that there are supply issues and the supply is volatile, but it is important that we get data on the factual situation.  I am talking about the actual number of deliveries that have arrived here.  I am not looking for forecasts or projections, but rather the actual figures.</p> <p>  We now have daily figures for the number of vaccines.  We have sought daily figures for the number of vaccines that arrive in this country.  The Minister agreed last week that there would be weekly updates on the number of vaccines that arrive in this country.  I want to check with Mr. Reid whether those weekly figures will be available on the data hub and that we will not have to plead for them to be made available?  They should be published daily, or at least weekly as a start.  I ask Mr. Reid to clarify that will be the case.</p> <p>  My next question relates to Moderna.  The official figures as of the end of February state 40,800 doses of Moderna have arrived in this country.  As of 28 February, the official figures state that 8,630 doses were administered.  What is the reason for the very substantial gap between the number of vaccines that have arrived and the number administered?</p> <p>  On messaging and what the HSE is intending to do, it is important that it is a bit more specific because my concern is that people's expectations are being raised by the kind of general messaging that is going on.  For example, three weeks ago it was announced that all those aged over 70 would receive the vaccine and that that task was starting.  It was not made clear to people that there were sub-categories within that.  We are now just getting to the point of finishing the over-85 cohort.  It will be a few weeks before people in their early 70s are vaccinated.  It would be better if we were told the HSE was starting with those aged over 85 and then moving onto those aged between 80 and 85.  It would give people some idea of when they could expect to get their vaccines.</p> <p>  The point applies to cohort 4, people at very high risk.  My understanding is that there are about 160,000 people in that category.  It has been stated that this week 10,000 will be vaccinated.  It will be some time before everybody in that category is done.  The message should be clearer in regard to the period of time involved in vaccinating that cohort. </p> <p>  I have a question on the plan for the mass vaccination programme.  At the moment the average daily number of vaccines being administered is 12,500.  If we are to use the full expected supply for the second quarter, that will have to be ramped up to about 40,000 per day, which is a massive increase.   Mr. Reid gave various figures earlier in response to the first questioner.  Does the HSE intend to publish the plan for the mass vaccination programme?  We know there are 37 centres, and have talked about 10,000 people being trained and 2,200 being recruited.  When will we actually see the plan?</p><p>When is it intended to publish it?  </p><p> My final question relates to tracing.  What percentage of people are being back-traced seven or 14 days to find out where the virus is being transmitted?</p></speech>

On the first issue of data and data availability and what the Minister committed to, I will pick up this issue with the high-level task force which has the data.  We are working towards deliveries that we get.  On the production of data, I am more than happy to work with the task force to provide whatever the Minister committed to.</p> <p>  On data overall, the Deputy will note as we progress that one of the work streams has been specifically focused on reporting and data to utilise the data that we have.</p></speech>

As a standard, it should be uploaded to the data hub every week.  I would like to see that done daily, but at least weekly.</p></speech>

We will see more data on the individual cohorts vaccinated, the percentage of the cohorts vaccinated and, as we progress, on effectiveness.  We have a particular workstream in that regard but it is not finalised just yet.   I reassure the Deputy that we now putting all of the data into a single data lake.  All of the data that we have from testing and tracing and the vaccination programme are being recorded in the same data lake and so we will be in a stronger position to produce more data as we go along.</p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was in regard to an update on the Moderna vaccine, the delivery schedule and the difference between the gap.  I will make two points.  I am working off the top of my head but I think the last delivery up to last week was about 42,500.  Of that, 1,800 were used for GPs for the initial vaccination programme, which equates to 3,600 in terms of two doses.  A further 12,500 were immediately distributed to GPs to help them with some of the more difficult clients they had to get to.  They will be utilising that supply.  The difference between the Moderna vaccine and the others is that we have to keep a one-for-one distribution in the fridge in our central cold chain storage.  For every one we distribute for vaccination, we have to keep a second.  That is based on supplier recommendations and guidelines.  It is different because of the buffer in any given week.  By way of description, a buffer in any given week is a combination of the Pfizer-BioNtech supply that we propose to use for vaccination the following week and whatever distribution we have given out in total for Moderna to be vaccinated.  It is slightly different; it is an extra requirement to be held back.</p></speech>

That should be 50% rather than 25%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1275" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030900002#G00600"><p>The difference being that 12,500 were distributed to GPs, which is the equivalent of 25,000 because a further 12,500 has to be kept back.  A further 6,000 were distributed last week to GPs and that requires another 6,000 to be held back in the fridge.  The Moderna vaccines will be administered through GPs, working through the 80 to 84 year olds.</p> <p>  On the question around messaging for the over 70 and 85 year olds, the Deputy is correct that we are aiming to get through first vaccination of all of the over 70s before the middle of April, with the second vaccination to be completed before the middle of May.  We have started doing that on an incremental basis.  I fully accept what the Deputy says in terms of expectation.  We have gone out fairly regularly and announced what group we were doing next and what numbers were in each group.  The figure for the 85 to 90 age group was 72,500.  The figure for the group we are progressing through now, which is the 80 to 84 year olds, is 90,000.  We know there are 72,500 in the 85 plus age group and we have probably done over 96,000 of those aged 70 and over.  GPs are administering some vaccines to the 80 to 85 year olds this week, as they did for some in the previous week, but in the case of a person in the 80 to 84 year old category whose husband, wife or partner is, for example, 87 years old where there are potential extra doses available they have the facility to vaccinate in parallel.  As we move through the other cohorts, that will happen as well.  I take on board the Deputy's comments.</p> <p>  On the question regarding cohort 4, before I ask my colleague, Dr. Henry, to respond, I would like to make two brief points.  The advice from the national immunisation advisory committee remains that age is the priority for vaccination.  We should continue with our vaccination programme until we get through all of those aged 70 years and over. Cohort 4 is in sequencing after we get to all of those.  However, we are very conscious of the medically vulnerable and we are anxious to get to them as soon as we can.  The 10,000 figure is just to start the process this week, while we are analysing the data on which Dr. Henry will elaborate for the Deputy.</p></speech>

I have spoken to Professor Karina Butler about this on many occasions.  They are all of approximate equal risk and so in terms of risk we do not propose to create any internal hierarchy among this group.  What we are doing initially is vaccinating those we can get to quickest.  In parallel with this, we are working up lists of the accessible patients with cancer, kidney disease and those on immunosuppressant medication.  These are the patients we can get to more quickly than others who are more disparate throughout community and hospital services.  In response to the Deputy's question, we expect this to go right through the month of March based on the anticipated numbers, while at the time same ensuring we identify everybody who is intended to be covered from within a group described by NIAC.</p></speech>

I believe the project will go beyond that because there will be patients coming on to these lists, particularly patients with cancer and renal disease.  As people, unfortunately, are acquiring these diseases all of the time, I expect it will be an ongoing project even when we cover the majority of these patients.  Our aim is to get the substantive majority of them vaccinated throughout the month of March, but the Deputy is correct that this process may continue into the month of April.  We must ensure that we cover as many as possible or as are intended according to the NIAC list, which are not always easy to source because they are not accessible within any one registry or specialty.</p></speech>

Identification of this cohort will continue throughout March.  It is a matter of supply.  We also have to use our supply to vaccinate those aged 70 years and over.  It is not simply a case of identifying them; it is a supply issue as well.</p></speech>

This is shown in current data.  As we are now steadily under 600 new cases per day, we intend to introduce a new call for routine cases to go back to the individual with some further questions.</p></speech>

We have started that in Cork, where there has been a review of seven days and reduced the number in relation to community transmission as they found when speaking to cases that more of them were contacts of confirmed cases.  It is being rolled out as capacity allows.  As we get lower in the case numbers, we will do it on a routine basis across all of the 20% of cases that are currently in community transmission.</p></speech>

To date, we have identified 15 cases of the South African variant and six cases of the Brazilian variant.</p><p> When we identify a variant of concern - these are defined by World Health Organization classifications - we undertake an enhanced process of contact management.  The case itself has to isolate for 14 days.  We test it twice.  Such cases are very strictly isolating.  We test their contacts and the contacts of contacts are actively followed up and have to isolate.  Therefore, there is a much enhanced process of contact management around these cases and an enhanced data set collected because, most importantly, we need to try to identify the source of transmission for these infections and whether or not they are travel related.  That is an accepted process that is in place across the country now in all public health departments and we bring a weekly report to NPHET on the variants of concern that we are investigating.</p></speech>

We are way over the time.  Deputy Gino Kenny is next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1565" speakername="Gino Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030900002#H00400"><p>I thank the HSE delegation for its statement this morning.  I have two questions.</p> <p>  The first question is in regard to workplace transmissions.  SIPTU made a statement last week that serial testing in meat processing plants has been reduced in recent times.  My experience with the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in regard to workplace manifestations has been, to say the least, quite haphazard.  I understand the HSE's remit does not cover the HSA.  How is the HSE co-ordinating communication and the strategy of crushing the virus in workplace manifestations because it has been a serious issue from day one?  The witnesses might answer that question about the strategy of the HSA and the HSE.</p></speech>

We go into 85 plants every week to do serial testing where we have very strong support from the employers and staff to show up for monthly PCR testing.  We go to meat plants with more than 50 staff.  That has been going on now for a number of months and we have not amended that programme as of yet.  It tends to be enhanced by additional antigen testing going on a number of times per week and those supplies of antigen testing have been handed to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for onward dissemination.</p></speech>

We recognised this quite early on last year and we established a national standing oversight committee to work with the industry and the HSE in regard to these outbreaks.  A number of approaches were taken to developing new communications materials and new guidance for the sector.  Alongside that, we have an active surveillance programme for infections across all of these sectors.  Each of our public health departments plays a key role in working with the individual premises when they have cases, in terms of doing a public health risk assessment, determining the need for any additional control measures, following up of contacts, appropriate isolation of cases and, most importantly, constant reinforcement of the prevention messages that need to be applied in the workplace quite rigorously, and that message has to be consistently reiterated and communicated to staff and management in these facilities.</p></speech>

I refer to the rate of hourly pay to those who are administering the vaccine.  According to what I have in front of me, GPs administering the vaccine will get &euro;120 per hour, pharmacists will get &euro;70 per hour, nurses will get &euro;25 per hour and student nurses on placements in vaccination centres administering the vaccine will get nothing.  That seems unfair.  Could somebody explain why there is such a disparity between healthcare professionals getting, at one end of the scale, &euro;120, and somebody as a student nurse getting nothing?</p></speech>

First of all, the matter of pay and pay policy is a matter for Government and the Department which ultimately determine the pay policy for the vaccination programme and pay policy overall.  From our perspective, the different pay arrangements are acknowledgement of various different agreements and different professions.  In the context of GPs and, similarly, in terms of some pharmacists as well, one is in essence dealing with sole traders.  As one goes into different grades, there is a standardised grade agreed at the departmental level around the vaccination programme that we are recruiting for at present which is in the range between &euro;35,000 and &euro;50,000.  That arrangement is in place.  The point on scale will determine, based on experience, etc.  It is a function of various different pay arrangements and agreements with various different professional grades associated with it.</p></speech>

I understand 300 will be let go.  Senator Kyne touched on that at the beginning.  Many people probably do not understand how interns in the Irish public health service who are badly needed are in essence now being let go.  It does not make sense, particularly as we need as many doctors now as possible in the pandemic.  Could somebody comment on the situation around the interns?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1297" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030900002#H01000"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I want to acknowledge the huge role that interns and junior doctors have played in the pandemic.  In the three surges in the past year, they were true front-line workers and they contributed hugely to our response in the hospital system.  Interns are trainee doctors in the sense they have got their medical degree and they complete this year under the supervision of a network of medical schools in the hospital system with a designated trainer before they get full registration when they qualify and then go on to training schemes, be it in general practice or in hospitals.  We cannot look at the numbers of interns we create in isolation.  We are moving from a system where we know we have too many non-training hospital doctors.  We want to move to a system where we have training opportunities for these interns so that the numbers who come through the intern year could then access what is basic specialty training, BST, then higher specialist training and then, in good manpower planning, can progress in their careers to become either general practitioners, public health or hospital-based consultants.  In looking at the number, it is not just a question of dealing in isolation with what is right or good for one group of a workforce alone.  It is how it integrates with other training requirements as they go on.</p> <p>  As I say, we are reviewing the quality and the configuration of the existing intern posts affiliated to the six medical schools and part of this will be looking at the number and seeing if we can increase the number in line with increased training opportunities.  On that point, last year we increased the number of training places, not only the intern places, in response to the crisis and we created additional fellowship posts to enable our trainees, not only interns or senior house officers, SHOs, as specialist registrars, to stay in Ireland beyond being an intern here.  We created additional training posts in public health, general practice, anaesthesia and other critical core specialties in response to the crisis and, as I said, additional fellowship posts which allowed them to complete higher specialist training here too.</p></speech>

They are readily available and that is important in terms of retaining public confidence.</p> <p>  In terms of the vaccine programme, we all know that there are issues.  There were always going to be challenges and difficulties.  However, I would like to focus on the healthcare portal.  I would like some facts and figures.  How many healthcare staff are now registered on the portal?  How many have got vaccines and how many are waiting to get vaccines?  I understand staff in the blood board in the mid-west, for example, in County Clare, have got their appointments for vaccinations but in Limerick, they have not.  The HSE might just give us some quick figures on that.</p></speech>

The estimated size of the cohort is approximately 200,000.  As of Sunday, we had 174,000 on dose one and 84,000 on dose two.  We have seen an increase in registrations from the private sector in the past week.  That is a good thing and we anticipate that will run on for another week based on those numbers as well so we would expect to exceed the cohort size.  The Senator will appreciate that is just an estimate for the private system  While we have a good handle on the public system the private system is still there.  People are being pulled off the portal by the local vaccination centres on a prioritised basis; that is how the function works.  However, with the numbers at the moment, as I said, close to-----</p></speech>

However, front-line workers, predominantly, are picked up in this cohort so if they are in that, we could look at the blood bank to see the numbers but I do not have them to hand.</p></speech>

University of Limerick, UL, Hospitals Group was only issued with something like 3,400 doses of the vaccine whereas the south west group, for example, received 19,000.  Is there any explanation for such a difference?  It was definitely perceived as unfair.  This was at the very start so the cohort consisted of healthcare workers, essentially.</p></speech>

There was huge angst at that stage over who got what.  To explain, two things were happening that week.  One was that we had received our first deliveries.  From 26 December we were distributing them across hospital groups.  Some hospital groups were mobilising, getting ready and getting their vaccinators ready and we had planned the deployment to them in that first week in January.  The South/Southwest Hospital Group started with an initial phase on that weekend, for us and with us, and the group vaccinated, in fairness to it, was not just its own healthcare staff but GP communities as well.  There was just a very short period where one would have seen that disproportionate number but it was not just the South/Southwest Hospital Group doing its own teams; it was vaccinating some other healthcare workers as well.  Then the following week when University Hospital Limerick was up and running, that balanced itself out.</p></speech>

Has the HSE processes in place to make sure there is a fair distribution of vaccines to the 40 centres?  Has it advanced plans in that regard so we do not hear that certain parts of the country are getting inoculated far quicker and to a far greater extent than others?</p></speech>

The strongest feedback coming from any surveys is that from the public's perspective, fairness is the top factor they are concerned about.  As we distribute, the portal, as Mr. McCallion touched on, is the key mechanism for us to have uploaded the next groups of people we are vaccinating, whether it is in this case healthcare workers or others and that is the way we are arranging it.  It is similar with GPs.  For example, this week we know the supply level we have does not meed the immediate requirement of GPs and we know that upfront just based on supply.  We are distributing based on equity and proportion this week for GPs as they move into the 80 to 84 age group.  That will be a continuing principle.</p></speech>

I am very much supportive of the work of the HSE.  It is doing as good a job as it can under the circumstances but we must ensure those type of situations do not happen.  I presume there are not too many Sneems around the country.</p></speech>

With regard to GPs, it is, as Mr. Reid said, based on demand and then there is a principle of equity.  There are some practical issues with the vaccines in terms of numbers that must be given in that there is a minimum.  In some instances that results in some of the smaller practices perhaps getting a slightly larger number and hence being able to do a larger number of patients.  However, it is very much balanced on demand and then the principle of equity across the distribution to GPs and that model will continue into the mass vaccination centres as well.</p></speech>

I get the debate about carers looking to be vaccinated and understand why that cannot happen but we need much clearer timelines and information for the people in group 4.  People also need to know how they are going to be contacted because at the moment they do not know whether it is going to be by their GP or the healthcare setting or the service they are part of.  What plans has the HSE to get further clarity on group 4, which is starting this week?</p></speech>

The Senator is correct that people are out there wondering whether they are on the list or whether they are eligible.  We will contact patients, either through hospital networks or primary care networks, as we go through this quite complex group of patients with specific clinical criteria.  That messaging is going out.  We have spoken to some of the advocacy societies, including the Irish Kidney Association, Irish Cancer Society and clinical groupings.  For anyone listening today and through our communications we will make it clear we will contact people either through hospital networks or through their GPs.</p></speech>

I have three questions.  GPs to whom I have spoken in the past week have been a bit frustrated with some poor communications.  When they called the dedicated call centre, they were speaking to people who did not have the information they needed to hand.  This included information such as whether their order had been received or when exactly it would arrive.  Has this system changed?  The HSE will appreciate that there needs to be clear communication on vaccine delivery when dealing with older, less mobile patients.  I am, therefore, wondering has there been a change in communications processes or whether anything has been done on that.</p></speech>

While acknowledging some of the issues that emerged last week, in fairness, relative to the almost 1,350 practices we have been working with over the three weeks, it was a smaller number of GPs who had issues but I acknowledge they have had them.</p> <p>  To respond to the Senator's specific question, the particular changes we have put in place include a new support centre we have put in place for GPs.  As part of that, GPs from 1,350 practices will have dedicated account managers or relationship managers.  Separately, we have put in a new communications process whereby there will be a weekly bulletin going out to GPs that will clarify the availability of supplies for the following week.  This week, for example, communications went out to GPs on Saturday night to set out that the available quantity of vaccines next week would be 37,000.  Based on all the numbers they returned to us of the 80 to 84 year-old groupings, we feel it is about 15% less than they may have listed because that is the supply we have for that week.  I, therefore, expect it is giving them greater clarity in terms of planning for those vaccinations.  Again, this is on the principle of equity in distribution.</p> <p>  There are new support centres, new weekly communications and new relationship managers.  We have had three weeks of that programme, we have vaccinated more than 96,000 people who are mostly over the age of 80 and we have worked with 1,350 practices.  The vast majority of those have gone according to plan but there were issues last week, which we have addressed and will continuously monitor.</p></speech>

I have two quick questions arising from a GP with whom I spoke.  The GP in question expressed worries about the pace of the roll-out.  I understand that issues completely outside of our guests' control mean that the vaccination programme is going at a slower place than we hoped.  The GP is worried that the virus will mutate to a point where the vulnerable people who have already been vaccinated will have to be vaccinated again relatively quickly because of the slow speed of the roll-out.  I am not a specialist in this area and my questions are a result of the person to whom I was talking.  That person said that the whole point is to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible to slow down mutations.  Does Mr. Reid have any comment to make on that?  Will there be any impact because of the slow rate here?  Is the person who spoke to me expressing unfounded concerns?</p></speech>

We would rate highly in European terms for our administration of vaccines per hundred thousand of population based on the level of supply.  We also rate highly on the distribution and administration of those vaccines.  Some 95% or more of any vaccines we get in a given week are administered within that week and, in some cases, within three days.  That is at a high level.</p> <p>  The approach we have taken to vaccinating, based on medical guidance from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, has been specifically to address the most vulnerable.  If one takes, for example, long-term care facilities or nursing homes, practically all of the residents and staff of nursing homes have received both doses of the vaccine, with the exception of a tiny few with a level of sickness that means we will have to go back to them.  The vast majority of residents of long-term care facilities, more than 90,000 people, will have received their first doses of the vaccine by the end of this week.  That is a highly vulnerable group in terms of impacts that include death and mortality.  </p> <p>  The situation is similar for addressing front-line healthcare workers who are also highly vulnerable.  We are vaccinating the over-70s who are living in the community.  We are seeing a benefit from the approach we are taking.  We are, thankfully, seeing reductions in mortality, infection rates in nursing homes, outbreaks in healthcare settings, the levels of sickness among the elderly population and the levels of sickness and absences from work through Covid infection among our healthcare workers.  Transmission levels have collapsed in the past four to six weeks as a result of the vaccination programme.  We are seeing strong benefits to date from the programme based on the prioritisation approach.  It is the right approach.</p> <p>  To return to the nub of the Senator's question, the pace of the roll-out will be a function of supply, which is currently the constraining factor when we consider how much quicker we might go.  That is part of our mobilisation plan for April onwards.</p></speech>

Scotland has a high level of the B117 mutation, which is also now the predominant mutation in this country.  That report showed reduced hospitalisation with serious illness after the administration of the first doses of the Pfizer BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines, including among older cohorts.  There is, of course, concern that immune evasion may happen if certain mutations get a stronger footing.  The mutations that are shared among some of the variants may render the vaccine less effective.  However, based on two of the vaccines that have been tested, namely, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and Novavax, we see reduced but still strong efficacy.  The vaccines still have a particularly strong impact on reducing serious illness and hospitalisation.  While there may be a reduced effect, it does not mean there is no effect and it seems so far that, even with mutations, the more serious manifestations of the illness are prevented.</p></speech>

I will stand back from it all and give the Senator some facts.  Transmission, mortality, sickness and hospitalisation levels are down.  The numbers in intensive care units, ICUs, are, thankfully, down.  We know that those reductions are also a function of what is happening in the community.  Hospital-acquired infections are significantly down.  Serial testing in nursing homes show an infection rate that is now down to 0.2%.  That is a function of both reduced community transmission and the vaccination programme.  The percentage of cases of Covid in healthcare workers in the first week of this year was at 16%.  That figure is now down to approximately 4%.  There were more than 3,600 Covid cases among healthcare workers in the first week of the year and that is significantly down to approximately 300 cases or fewer.  Those are positive impacts of the approach we are taking.</p></speech>

Dr. Henry said that a number of additional posts and fellowships have been created.  What is the difference in those numbers?  While 350 posts have been cut, what is the increase in other posts?  In order to figure out the difference, we can subtract that number from 350 so we know how many intern places have, effectively, been cut.</p></speech>

The normal number of places is 734.  As a once-off, positions were offered to 1,100 medical students who were qualifying last year, a significant number of whom turned down the offer, so the final number who took up a position was 992.  In the intervening period, we have increased the number of trainees and the opportunities for interns who have finished their intern year to stay in Ireland and get a training scheme, particularly in some of the core specialties.  We have also created a number of fellowships for higher training.  We introduced an overlap last year because people who qualified began work on 25 May, rather than in July, and we plan to maintain that overlap this year.  As I said earlier in response to questions from another committee member, we cannot look at the number of interns in isolation from the availability of training places for them to proceed to after they have completed their intern year.</p></speech>

I congratulate them all, particularly those on the front line, on the dramatic reduction in the incidence of the virus and the brilliant fight against the disease, very often while facing criticism from many quarters.  It is like working in a goldfish bowl and everybody has an answer.  Those at the centre have to do the work and I congratulate everybody involved.  It has been a tremendous example of what can be done.</p> <p>  From here on in, the crucial issue will be the extent to which vaccines remain available to this country.  Can we be assured that it will not be necessary for our guests to review their projections?  When expectations are reviewed downwards, it is disappointing to the general public, although understandable.  Such a review may be caused by a lack of supply and that does not resonate all that well with the public.</p></speech>

He mentioned fighting against the disease overall.  We in the HSE would also like to reflect on why we are seeing positive benefits of the vaccine and its impact.  There are still strong levels of concern about the positivity rate, the level of transmission and the impact of the B117 strain on transmission rates.  Approximately 27% of close contacts of an infected person are testing positive and, in the case of a household, that figure is close to 35%.  I want to make sure that we do justice to the fact that we are still living with a real threat at the moment.</p><p>On the supply issue, I want to reassure all Deputies and Senators that I am aware the Department and Government officials are doing everything possible.  Interventions at EU level at the early stage by the officials and An Taoiseach did address some of the impacts we thought were going to come at us.  I know they are working quite hard and relentlessly every day on the supply.  We fully appreciate what the Deputy has said and that as we have to readjust, particularly with the readjustments downwards, there is a huge level of frustration because everybody wants the vaccine and wants it quickly.</p><p> As I said earlier, we expect the reliability of delivery to strengthen in the coming weeks, especially as we head towards April.  Potentially, as other vaccines come on board and on stream that should help us too.  We acknowledge that this quarter has been a difficult period.</p></speech>

Is there anything we can do about that?  Can the Government, for example, negotiate with alternative suppliers?  This is, apparently, being done in other cases.  Could we see what might happen there?  Confidence in the system is hugely important from the HSE's point of view and that of the general public.  If we cannot rely on a constant supply what can we do to try to do that?</p></speech>

That would be the route for any change to policy.  Having said that, when the EU process for the advance purchase agreements that we have all signed up to comes through, it will give us a pipeline of almost &euro;18 million of vaccines across a range of suppliers.  The issue of stability of those suppliers, however, and the timing of those supplies has definitely been a feature of the first quarter.  Should the Government decide to change its approach and work through a different process, that would be a policy decision for the Government.  The EU process overall, while not specifically related to this issue, has served Ireland very well, and has served the HSE very well, with drugs, medical devices, drug supplies, availability and price.  The decision such as the Deputy has asked about is a policy matter for the Government.</p></speech>

How do we make our feelings known to the suppliers? How tight is the contract?  How binding is the contract?  Can we have the contract reviewed or can we have it reviewed to our advantage?  The supply is essential to the success of the vaccination campaign.</p></speech>

I reassure the Deputy that at every stage where we become aware of or gain any foresight into supply line issues they are taken up by Department officials quite directly through EU levels and directly with suppliers through the high-level task force.  We have ongoing regular engagement with suppliers directly.  I can reassure members that any time we have raised issues at a Government level there have been escalations with senior Ministers and the Taoiseach at EU level to strengthen the levels of predictability and reliability.  It is a function of what is happening worldwide and certainly what is happening in the EU on the supply level.</p></speech>

That completely changes the HSE's own predictions for the roll-out of the vaccine.  A number of instances of that nature will, ultimately, undermine public confidence in the system that Mr. Reid is working so hard to promote.  How vigorously do we deal with the suppliers who cannot supply with regard to contacts and so on?  Do we pursue vigorously enough to be able to convince them that it is not such a good idea?</p></speech>

I can reassure the Deputy that in the context of AstraZeneca, delivery of which has been significantly impacted in the past couple of weeks, a very strong level of engagement happens regularly.  Thankfully, it has recently put in place a country manager to manage the Irish relationship, which we welcome.  In fairness to the likes of Pfizer BioNTech we have had stable supplies from it and it has a dedicated company and country manager here who, by coincidence, happens to be named Paul Reid also.  We engage with them directly and regularly.  That supply level has been stable, with one exception earlier on and we would hope to see that continue.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question about the contract and arbitration, contract negotiations happen at an EU level.  Again, this is something the Government has escalated.  I am aware that the Taoiseach has raised the issue regularly at EU Council meetings, up to and including quite recently.  These are matters on which the Government will intervene.</p></speech>

I have come across some cases where the supply issued all right but some of the attendant documentation did not, such as the relevant GP reference numbers, especially where GPs have public and private practices.  Has this been addressed?  Can it be addressed to be more efficient to get the fastest possible kick-off in every case?</p></speech>

In the third week, which was last week, across a smaller number of GP practices we fully acknowledge that there were issues not just in the smaller practices but also in the bigger practices.  We have put in place a whole range of supports to address that.  There is more engagement directly to the contact centre with more weekly bulletins to go out to them.  There is more clarity on what they can expect and on what days.  Where issues have emerged when consumables do not arrive in a timely fashion we are addressing this also.  There have been a number of issues but overall, of the 90,000 people who have been vaccinated in the over-80s and over-70s age groups across 1,350 GP practices, it has gone really well.  We acknowledge there were issues last week across a number of practices.  We have put in a whole set of arrangements to strengthen that process and we will move on.</p></speech>

I do not believe it is possible, from what we know and understand right now.  From my previous role in local authorities I am aware that the requirements for pharmaceutical companies are quite specific around capacity and equipment to develop different vaccines.  Vaccines and drug development can take some time to recalibrate.  I understand there has been some engagement to see the feasibility but it is not our strongest possibility.</p></speech>

I am sure that Mr. Reid has had many questions this morning from Deputies and Senators around the State about vaccine roll-out.  In Clare we have seen strident improvements.</p><p>A lot of people have been vaccinated since.  There are fabulous examples, such as Sixmilebridge last weekend, where the local GP was out with representatives from the GAA club.  They were funnelling people through, vaccinating them and getting them home safely.  We have had other examples in parts of west Clare where vaccines are only arriving today.  Certainly the cogs in the system are well oiled in some places but there are instances where it has been dropped.</p><p> At a recent meeting of the committee I highlighted there had been missing links with regard to HSE staff.  The mental health nurses at Ennis General Hospital had not been vaccinated but administrative staff were being vaccinated.  In some cases, it has gone beyond vaccinating cohort 2.  I was told something yesterday that I wish to substantiate with the witnesses.  Is it true that HSE staff working from home and not on the front line are being vaccinated along with their front-line colleagues?  I ask Mr Reid to verify this or dismiss it.</p></speech>

I would like to stand back for a second and come to the question.  Overall, the prioritisation and the sequencing in the vaccination programme have gone really well.  There have been exceptions and some were reported in the first few weeks.  It is very frustrating for us, and me, when exceptions happen and somebody is vaccinated out of sequence because it causes a lot of angst.  I do not support any occasion where such things happen.  We do have flexibility in the system, and we have given guidance through the chief clinical officer where vaccination programmes are being carried out.  These are very precious vaccines, particularly the mRNA vaccines, with regard to logistics, supply and being utilised within the time limit.  We have provided flexibility within the system to have a back-up list in case there are extra doses in vials to ensure not one dose is wasted.  There are some legitimate reasons where people have gone through the process and other people have been vaccinated, who would eventually come forward in cohort prioritisation.  It is also frustrating for us where it happens out of sequence.</p></speech>

The new 60 bed block in University Hospital Limerick has opened and it is great to see it.  It is alleviating some of the pressure in the hospital.  A key issue raised with me by patients and some staff is that there is no discharge co-ordinator in the new block.  During peak Covid when patients are well enough to go home or leave the hospital environment they may need support from public health nurses and their local health centre but there is no discharge co-ordinator to put such a plan in place.  People are being moved home from a hospital environment in a taxi, car or sometimes an ambulance with no plan in place.  Mr. Reid may not have the answer today but I implore him, as the helmsman of the HSE, to ensure this key appointment is made to ensure it works smoothly.  Is Mr. Reid aware of this issue?  He may not be but I ask him to respond briefly.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that University Hospital Limerick has had well-deserved investment in extra beds and blocks, which has proven beneficial.  With regard to the hospital, and overall, the investment plan we had for winter incorporated some of the issues raised by the Deputy.  We had a significant investment plan of &euro;600 million.  This may not have always been seen or understood, or perhaps we did not communicate it, but if we look at what happened throughout the hospital system over winter we saw reduced numbers of emergency department admissions and attendances of probably 10% versus last year.  However, we also saw an average of a 72% to 75% reduction in trolleys.  It is not just about reduced numbers.  It has been about improved flow through.  Some of this flow through has specifically been related to the issues the Deputy has just addressed.  We can discharge quicker to a key location identified in advance.  This has improved the flow through overall.  It has not happened in some cases, we have had-----</p></speech>

I do not expect Mr. Reid to know every nook and cranny as he leads a huge operation.  After this meeting I ask him to look, with his senior staff, at appointing a discharge co-ordinator.  It is the final piece in the jigsaw of making the facility a success.</p> <p>  With regard to intern doctors, I know it is a ministerial decision ultimately but last year there was a pilot scheme whereby the HSE service was bolstered by contracts offered to intern doctors.  In County Clare and the mid-west region, several dozen doctors were added to the system allowing for better care at ward level.  A campaign is under way and many of us are being lobbied.  Will Mr. Reid comment on the benefits of the pilot scheme, which is mooted to be discontinued?  Did it help the hospitals in offering a level of care in recent months by having newly qualified doctors contracted to the hospitals?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1353" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030900002#M01100"><p>What the Deputy is referring to is the additional interns brought on earlier last year.  What we did last year was addressed by some of the Deputy's colleagues earlier.  Normally, the number of interns in the training system, which is operated in conjunction with the six medical schools responsible for overseeing the training, is approximately 730.  Last year, we offered places to all graduates and of those 1,100 graduates, 992 took up the offer.  This was a once-off exercise last year, in view of the position we were in with the surge.  It was not part of the overall medical workforce planning, which involves not just the intern year but creating training places for them afterwards, up to higher specialty training and progression to general practice, hospital consultants or public health.  It was never the intention to maintain this beyond last year.</p> <p>  We are reviewing the current configuration of intern training, the quality of the training and the number of 734, which we will revert to this year.  We are maintaining the overlap we had last year, whereby the newly qualified medical students began work following early final medical exams on 25 May.  This was much earlier than the usual second week of July.  We hope to have an overlap of one to two weeks this year as it was particularly beneficial last year.  It is not the current plan to maintain the numbers at 1,100.  We offered places to 1,100 and a significant proportion turned them down and left the country to go elsewhere.</p></speech>

I will make a comment and I do not want a response on it.  It is about cohort 4.  It is important to outline to people, with regard to the cohort with underlying medical conditions, whether dialysis or chemotherapy treatment, that vaccination will not be delivered immediately to them but that it will be done over a period of time.  I have received a huge number of calls over the past week from people looking for clarification.  It would be helpful if it was clearly set out that this is a four or five week programme and that it will not happen overnight.  This is important.</p> <p>  I want to go back to the issue of interns because it has been raised by a number of speakers.  There is a lot of misinformation and I need clarification.  Last year, 1,100 were taken on.  My understanding is that up to 60% of interns leave after one year in Ireland.  Perhaps we might get some clarification on this.  What percentage of interns left in 2017, 2018 and 2019?  If we take 60% of 1,100 it would leave us with 440 people.  If we take 60% of 734 it would leave us with 294 people.</p><p>To me, it does not make sense to now reduce the number of interns because there is going to be quite a big exodus once people are able to travel and the pandemic is under control worldwide.  I am not sure whether we are doing long-term planning very well.  If one looks at all the hospitals across the country outside of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, the vast majority of junior doctors are non-EU qualified.  Please explain how we are going to deal with that issue.  Why are we so reliant on doctors from as far away as Pakistan, Nigeria and the Sudan coming into Ireland?  Now, when we have an opportunity to deal with the issue, we have walked away from it again.</p></speech>

Intern year is a particular year, that occurs immediately after qualification, during which junior doctors work until they get full registration thus enabling them to progress to training schemes.  The reason people may leave after their intern year may be precisely for that reason, the need to access training schemes.  Consequently, expanding the number of interns without planning for an expansion in the number of training schemes has the effect of kicking the problem down the road.  Part of manpower training, which I assure the Deputy is very actively taking place, is reducing our dependency on non-training doctors by converting those posts into training posts.  As part of our response, in July 2021 we created 106 additional places and many of them from existing non-training posts.  The reasons people may leave is to get training posts in other jurisdictions.  Our challenge is to reduce our reliance on non-training posts, which are not good for assistance and certainly not good for the doctors concerned.</p></speech>

We are also finding it difficult to fill consultant posts in smaller hospitals and do not even have any applicants for a lot of those posts.  Where is the long-term planning?  How will this issue be dealt with over the next three to four years?  I ask because I do not believe that we are dealing with this matter.</p></speech>

Repeating a situation where we create additional non-training posts in hospitals just increases our dependency on these posts.  Our manpower planning is focused on increasing the number of training posts and converting these non-training posts into training posts by creating an additional number of consultant posts and an additional number of higher specialist trainees in order that we do not have a-----</p></speech>

Yes, we have a challenge filling particular consultant posts in model 3 hospitals throughout the country, and this has been the subject of two programmes of work that we have engaged with in national doctors training and planning on reducing the number of consultants who are not on the specialist register, as well as on reducing our dependency on non-training doctors.  It is part of our manpower planning to reduce our dependency on both those cohorts.</p></speech>

This coming year, we have a recruitment plan to recruit 350 consultants, if I am correct.  We have a strategic workforce plan and part of it is well funded for this year and into next year as well.  To restate what Dr. Colm Henry has said, this is not easy.  It is not easy recruiting consultants and it is very difficult recruiting consultants and doctors for model 3 hospitals.</p></speech>

Today, we received a letter from Ray Mitchell saying that there is no national scheme to conduct a detailed survey of the people who are leaving the service, be they administration staff, nursing staff, care assistants and doctors. As some very good people are leaving, why not set up a structured survey of those who have decided to leave the HSE in order that we can learn and improve how the HSE manages people?</p></speech>

One, at a local community healthcare organisation, CHO, level and acute hospital level, there are exit engagements, discussions and surveys with staff in terms of what information they can capture as to the reason for exiting or leaving.  The reasons can range and we do have some information on that.  There is not one national system database.  The Deputy will be aware that many of our issues in the health system are legacy issues around single integrated systems to integrate that information.  We are looking at how we can get that knowledge back from the local services and the local system.</p></speech>

It we did that we could analyse the issues, for example, in a hospital, in an administration section of the HSE or any section.  It would be great to learn from why people have arrived at their decision to leave and move on to either other countries or other services within the State.</p></speech>

We have regular engagement surveys with members of staff where they can reflect back to us the mood or certain issues.  Staff surveys happen very regularly and is an ongoing process.  We also conducted, during Covid, an engagement survey with staff members to understand, from their perspective, what it was like, what worked, what frustrations they felt, what we did good and what we did not so good.

The vaccination process is ongoing.  That would be some of the numbers that my colleague, Mr. Damien McCallion, would have said on the vaccination programme for healthcare workers.

I work very closely with the Chief of Staff, Mark Mellett.</p> <p>  From a technical or prioritisation perspective, in essence, they fall into key workers, which is a later group.  NIAC is now looking at putting some of those groupings ahead.

Is &eacute; an c&aacute;s is measa at&aacute; l&eacute;irithe i dtuarasc&aacute;il an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga n&aacute; n&aacute;r glacadh le molta&iacute; uaidh &oacute; 2011 go f&oacute;ill.  Beidh orainn aird a thabhairt ar an bhfadhb seo nuair a sheolann an coimisin&eacute;ir tuairisc faoin&aacute;r mbr&aacute;id.  In ainneoin gealltanais &oacute; Choimisin&eacute;ir na nGarda&iacute; faoi sheirbh&iacute;s ateangaireachta a chur ar f&aacute;il do gach garda ar fud na t&iacute;re, n&iacute; r&eacute;it&iacute;onn an m&eacute;id sin an fhadhb bhun&uacute;sach gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an Ghaeilge ag garda&iacute;, go h&aacute;irithe aon gharda at&aacute; lonnaithe i gceantar Gaeltachta.  Bheadh sprioc agus d&aacute;ta soil&eacute;ir leagtha sa reachta&iacute;ocht faoin leas&uacute; seo go mbeadh Gaeilge ag 20% d&rsquo;earcaithe don Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &oacute; 2030, agus go mbeadh 40% den l&iacute;on foirne ioml&aacute;n inni&uacute;il sa Ghaeilge faoi 2030.  Is &eacute; sin le r&aacute; go mbeadh ar gharda&iacute; an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim sa deich mbliana at&aacute; romhainn.  Meabhra&iacute;m don choiste go raibh riachtanas Gaeilge 100% le bheith mar bhall den Gharda roimh 2005.  D&uacute;irt an Rialtas ag an am nach dtiocfadh laghd&uacute; ar chaighde&aacute;n na Gaeilge i measc na ngarda&iacute;, ach anois n&iacute;l ach aon trian de chomhalta&iacute; an Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na i gceantair Ghaeltachta in ann Gaeilge a labhairt le muintir na h&aacute;ite le linn d&oacute;ibh a bheith ag obair ann.</p> <p>  B&iacute;onn meon frith-Ghaelach sa ch&oacute;ras dl&iacute;, agus ba ch&oacute;ir nach mbeadh easpa Gaeilge sa Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ag cur leis sin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; de cheart ag gach duine sa t&iacute;r seo Gaeilge a labhairt le garda in aon &aacute;it.  N&iacute;limid ag cur an riachtanais sin 100% ar ais ach ag cinnti&uacute; go mbeidh cothrom na F&eacute;inne ann, ar a laghad, idir an riachtanas B&eacute;arla agus Gaeilge a bheith ag comhalta&iacute;.  N&iacute;l costas breise ag baint le duine le Gaeilge n&oacute; duine le B&eacute;arla a earc&uacute;.  B&iacute;onn ar gharda&iacute; traen&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh chun ruda&iacute; nua a fhoghlaim mar chuid den phost.  Mar sin, n&iacute; bheadh sa Ghaeilge ach rud eile le foghlaim.</p></speech>

N&iacute;or ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh bord St&aacute;t ag maireacht&aacute;il i bubble agus ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh athruithe ann agus suimeanna, dearctha&iacute; agus c&uacute;lra&iacute; difri&uacute;la acu.  M&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; sin ann, b&iacute;onn beocht sna boird St&aacute;it agus uaireanta b&iacute;onn cur chuige i bhfad &Eacute;ireann n&iacute;os fearr acu.  Cuideodh s&eacute; seo le d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go bhfuil an s&oacute;rt r&eacute;abhl&oacute;id at&aacute; i gceist ag an Aire St&aacute;it &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn agus a fh&aacute;s&uacute; laistigh den st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras ag teacht chomh maith toisc go mbeadh dearcadh difri&uacute;il ag na boird St&aacute;it.</p> <p>  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go mbeidh athr&uacute; ag tarl&uacute;, caithfimid l&eacute;iri&uacute; &oacute;n leibh&eacute;al is airde chomh maith go bhfuil dearcadh agus cur chuige difri&uacute;il ann.  Nuair a bh&iacute;omar ag caint faoi leasuithe roimhe seo maidir le Tithe an Oireachtais agus a leith&eacute;id, sin an f&aacute;th go d&uacute;irt m&eacute; gur ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inne a bheith ag l&eacute;iri&uacute; eiseaml&aacute;ir don phobal agus go mbeadh muidne ag cur chuige chomh maith.  M&aacute; t&aacute; muidne ag s&uacute;il go mbeadh nithe ag tarl&uacute; ag an leibh&eacute;al is &iacute;sle agus go mbeadh Gaeilge ag 20% d&iacute;obh si&uacute;d a bheidh earcaithe amach anseo sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh muid ag lorg an r&aacute;ta c&eacute;anna ar gach leibh&eacute;al.  Sin an tionchar a d'fh&eacute;adfadh a bheith againn.</p><p>T&aacute; bealach tapa againn chun an tionchar sin a bheith againn tr&iacute; na cinnt&iacute; a ghlacann muid nuair a roghna&iacute;tear comhalta&iacute; de bhoird dhifri&uacute;la.  Rinne muid an cinneadh sin maidir le hathr&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.  D&aacute; rachfa&iacute; siar 30 bliain &oacute; shin, n&oacute; b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir n&iacute;os l&uacute; n&aacute; 30 bliain, th&oacute;gfa&iacute; faoi deara an oiread fear a bh&iacute; ar na boird St&aacute;it ar fad.  Anois, t&aacute; athr&uacute; meoin agus athr&uacute; tagtha ar an dream at&aacute; ar na boird St&aacute;it i gcoitinne.  L&aacute; maith a bh&iacute; ann nuair a ghlac muid an cinneadh sin.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn dul sa treo c&eacute;anna maidir leis an nGaeilge.</p><p> T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam i gceann 20 n&oacute; 30 bliain nach mbeidh g&aacute; leis seo.  T&aacute; g&aacute; leis anois agus measaim gur sin an f&aacute;th gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh muid ag glacadh leis na leasuithe seo.  Caithfidh muid cinnte a dh&eacute;anamh go dtiocfaidh an t-athr&uacute; sin agus go mbeadh r&oacute;l l&aacute;rnach ag na boird St&aacute;it sa r&eacute;abhl&oacute;id at&aacute; le teacht, t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam, maidir leis an earca&iacute;ocht sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an bhfadhb at&aacute; ann agus an g&eacute;argh&aacute; le hathr&uacute; bun&uacute;sach a dh&eacute;anamh sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras.</p></speech>

D&aacute; r&eacute;ir sin, bheadh seans n&iacute;os fearr acu a bheith ar bhord St&aacute;it m&aacute;s mian leo, toisc go bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu agus go bhfuil m&eacute;id &aacute;irithe sp&aacute;sanna ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d le Gaeilge, i dteannta na gcoinn&iacute;ollacha eile.

D&rsquo;aontaigh an Roinn leis na sc&eacute;imeanna sin, ag f&eacute;achaint ar an m&eacute;id a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh gach comhlacht a bhaint amach.  Anois t&aacute; an Rialtas ag r&aacute; go mbeidh comhlacht &aacute;irithe i gcaighde&aacute;n 1 agus 20 cinn i gcaighde&aacute;n 2.  N&iacute; g&aacute; go mbeadh na spriocanna at&aacute; acu faoi l&aacute;thair faoin sc&eacute;im chomh d&uacute;shl&aacute;nach d&oacute;ibh n&oacute; b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir nach mbeadh siad fi&uacute; ann i roinnt c&aacute;sanna.

T&aacute; seans ann go bhfeidhmeoidh coiste comhairleach maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla.  N&iacute; h&eacute; go bhfeidhmeoidh s&eacute; as Gaeilge agus go mbeadh seirbh&iacute;s ateangaireachta ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a bhfuil beag&aacute;n Gaeilge n&oacute; B&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in acu.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; chomh seaf&oacute;ideach sin nach dtuigim go mbeidh daoine ag teacht isteach le c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta&iacute; agus scileanna &aacute;irithe a bheadh ag teast&aacute;il chun comhairle a chur ar an gcoiste comhairleach maidir le conas a dh&eacute;antar ruda&iacute; &aacute;irithe &oacute; thaobh na hearca&iacute;ochta de.  Chuala muid na daoine a th&aacute;inig os comhair an choiste nuair a bh&iacute;omar ag d&eacute;anamh ini&uacute;chadh ar staid na Gaeilge sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras.  Bh&iacute; roinnt d&oacute;ibh i gceannas ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; HR.  N&iacute; raibh ach f&iacute;orbheag&aacute;n Gaeilge ag roinnt acu agus n&iacute; raibh Gaeilge ar bith ag roinnt eile.  N&iacute; raibh a dh&oacute;thain mhuin&iacute;n ag roinnt eile as a gcuid Gaeilge chun a gcur i l&aacute;thair a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Is f&eacute;idir c&oacute;ras ateangaireachta a chur ar f&aacute;il, &aacute;fach, agus ba ch&oacute;ir go gcuirfeadh.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir liom leas&uacute; mar seo a chur mar bheadh s&eacute; as ord toisc chostais ar an St&aacute;t.  Ba ch&oacute;ir don Aire St&aacute;it smaoineamh ar leas&uacute; d&aacute; leith&eacute;id a ghlacadh.  </p> <p>  T&aacute; an tAire St&aacute;it ag cur amach teachtaireacht leis seo.  M&aacute; t&aacute; an St&aacute;t chun coist&iacute; maidir leis an nGaeilge a bhun&uacute;, ba ch&oacute;ir gurb &iacute; an Ghaeilge teanga labhartha agus oibre na gcoist&iacute; seo.  N&iacute; tharl&oacute;dh s&eacute; seo in aon t&iacute;r eile ar dhomhan.  Ar&iacute;s, is ait go bhfeidhmeoidh coiste a chuirfidh comhairle faoin nGaeilge ar an Aire i dteanga ar bith seachas an Ghaeilge.  Is &eacute; sin at&aacute; molta ag an Aire St&aacute;it ina fhreagra.</p> <p>  N&iacute; rud m&oacute;r an m&eacute;id at&aacute; i gceist le leas&uacute; Uimh. 148.  Is f&eacute;idir leis an Aire na rialacha a leagan s&iacute;os.  T&aacute; a fhios ag an Aire St&aacute;it f&eacute;in, nuair a thagann coiste le ch&eacute;ile don ch&eacute;ad uair agus nuair at&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist aige m&eacute;id &aacute;irithe oibre a dh&eacute;anamh, b&iacute;onn air athruithe a dh&eacute;anamh.  N&iacute; g&aacute; go mbeadh air a bheith ag brath ar an Aire chun ligean d&oacute; bualadh le ch&eacute;ile gach uile l&aacute;, p&iacute;osa taighde a lorg, n&oacute; a leith&eacute;id de rud.  Is &eacute; sin a tharla&iacute;onn.  T&aacute;im ar ch&uacute;pla coiste, mar shampla an coiste comhairleach maidir le Sr&aacute;id an Mh&uacute;raigh.  Leagan an tAire s&iacute;os an remit, ach is na baill a roghna&iacute;onn c&eacute; chomh minic a thagann an coiste le ch&eacute;ile, c&eacute;n obair a bheidh &aacute; d&eacute;anamh, agus c&eacute;n st&iacute;l oibre a bheidh ag an gcoiste, c&eacute; go gclo&iacute;onn s&eacute; leis an remit at&aacute; leagtha s&iacute;os ag an Aire.  N&iacute; ceisteanna m&oacute;ra at&aacute; ann sna leasuithe seo so f&aacute;gfaidh m&eacute; mar sin iad, seachas Uimh. 126.  Measaim gur ch&oacute;ir don Aire St&aacute;it smaoineamh ar&iacute;s ar an leas&uacute; sin.</p></speech>

The purpose of our meeting today is to examine the national development plan with a view to making a submission to Review to Renew, the public consultation element of the national development plan.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister for Transport and for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his officials, Mr. Garret Doocey and Mr. Dominic Mullaney.  They are all most welcome to the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members joining the meeting remotely that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex, which obviously includes the D&aacute;il Chamber.  In this regard, I ask all members who are participating remotely, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I offer my apologies for being unable to appear two weeks ago due to an extended Cabinet meeting.  I understand the committee had a very informative meeting with the Secretary General and officials of one of my Departments.  I am pleased to be present today to discuss the NDP further with the committee.</p> <p>  To pick up on some of the observations made by the committee two weeks ago, such as that the NDP will represent the most significant NDP since the foundation of the State, there are certainly key features of the new NDP that will differ from previous ones.  The most striking feature is that it will be built around the national strategic outcomes in the national planning framework.  In taking this approach of focusing on long-term outcomes, there are potentially many pathways to attaining these outcomes.  What makes this NDP review particularly challenging is that we have found ourselves in a state of flux so soon after the NDP was published and we are now in a period of rapid adjustment caused by many different converging factors.</p> <p>  Within this period of change, there are opportunities to alter what we do and ensure we do things better.  Now is the appropriate time to step back and look at our overall strategy in terms of achieving these long-term strategic outcomes.  As the Secretary General of one of my Departments indicated two weeks ago, the focus on the national strategic outcomes rather than projects gives us the flexibility, if necessary, to adjust, change tack, reprioritise or accelerate certain aspects of investment.</p> <p>  As was discussed during that meeting with regard to the sectoral strategy aspect of the review, the Department has decided to base its NDP submission to the NDP review on the draft national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, rather than its predecessor, the strategic investment framework for land transport, SIFLT.  In considering whether this is the right approach, first, I absolutely agree with the committee that the NIFTI approach must go to public consultation at the earliest possible opportunity in order that the consultation process takes place prior to the conclusion of the NDP.  I think the draft NIFTI is a very thorough and thoughtful piece of work.  I hope the public will engage with it in an enthusiastic and robust debate, and I look forward to the public consultation phase from this perspective.</p> <p>  The draft NIFTI identifies four unranked priorities, namely, mobility of people and goods in urban areas, enhanced regional accessibility, protection and renewal, and decarbonisation.  These priorities reflect and support the national strategic outcomes pertinent to transport.  The draft NIFTI is the product of several years of research and analysis and is designed specifically to support attainment of the national strategic outcomes in a way the SIFLT was not.  The completion of the research and draft NIFTI meant that the Department was able to use up-to-date research and analysis in considering how it can stay on track to meet its NDP objectives as part of this review.  Failing to do so would have led to a significant gap between the ambition of the Government, which is to align resources to attain national strategic objectives in an evidence-based manner, and the Department, as it would have involved failing to use detailed research and analysis now available to it to test at a theoretical level our current strategies against the national strategic objectives.</p> <p>  My intention is to negotiate funding for the Department which results in a very significant capital allocation that supports each of the identified strategic priorities.  The NDP review will assist in ensuring that investment is broadly aligned in support of the national strategic objectives and, if that is not the case, what needs to change.</p> <p>  On the issue of compact growth ambitions, the evidence demonstrates that the most productive strategy the Department can pursue when the goal is sustainably to absorb a rapidly growing population is to expand sustainable mobility capacity within major cities and towns.  There are two main investment strands in this regard.  First, in gross investment terms, it will take a significant share of total funding to improve public transport capacity within cities and towns because interventions are required in cities and towns that are complex and typically involve attaining mass transport capacity in built-up residential areas.  Second, it is vital we fund active travel on a significant scale due to its manifold social, economic and personal transport benefits, especially over short distances in urban and rural areas.</p> <p>  Enhanced regional accessibility is also identified as a key priority.  As the committee noted two weeks ago, there are significant opportunities to improve regional connectivity for rail and I am on the record with regard to the significant untapped potential in this context.  In terms of roads, we can be far more ambitious in how we approach road design.  Although we have made significant progress in building a national road network, traditionally we have not systemically evaluated multi-modal options during the planning and design phases of road construction.  We have all too frequently treated public transport capacity on roads as an afterthought and left active travel nowhere.  This must be addressed.  Although the advent of electric vehicles, EVs, will, over time, tackle carbon emissions on roads, EVs on their own will not solve road congestion or the phenomenon of induced demand and may contribute to continued urban sprawl.  These unintended consequences are not in anyone's interest, least of all those who live in badly located housing estates disconnected from nearby urban centres, road users stuck in traffic or residents of neighbourhoods plagued by rat-running or pass-through congestion.</p><p>In designing road networks, we need to take all these factors into account.</p><p> In order to allow time for questions, if the Chairman agrees, I will conclude my opening statement.</p></speech>

There is some concern that the shift in focus towards public transport will have a detrimental impact on a number of earmarked road projects.  What is his response to that concern?  I want to flag some important road projects in my area, one of which is that between Kilmoon Cross and the Rath roundabout.  Despite being in level 5 lockdown, traffic volumes in the area are at 85% of pre-Covid levels.  I have spoken to engineers and transport officials in Meath County Council who have analysed this project at length.  What they propose will have active traffic measures and will tick a number of boxes in terms of the national strategic objectives.  There are concerns that the shift in focus will deprioritise projects such as this.  I emphasise the importance of the Navan rail project, an issue I have raised previously with the Minister, and of the Slane bypass.  I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on those projects.</p> <p>  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Climate Action earlier, we heard from a number of witnesses, some of whom raised the need for a change in governance structures, suggesting there may be an opportunity to review the roles of the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  Are our current structures are fit for purpose?  Is the NTA sufficiently resourced to deliver on the ambitious programme of work the Government has for it?  Does the Minister have plans to address that?</p></speech>

Many of them may have been committed in the existing NDP without the funding necessarily being clearly available.  We will have to face choices in the prioritisation of a variety of transport options because if we were to build everything that is in design or in various plans, the budget would be many multiples larger.  The allocation has to be based on good transport principles, such as tackling the worst blackspots and keeping safety first and foremost.  As I said earlier, they should be projects that help us deliver on the national planning framework and the national strategic objectives set out within that.</p> <p>  It will be both roads and public transport.  The programme for Government commits to favouring public transport by a ratio of 2:1, having already allocated a percentage of the overall budget to active travel.  There will be a switch in priority towards public transport and I am upfront about that, but it is not that we will be stopping the roads programme.  Far from it, there will still be significant expenditure because I expect the capital envelope to be maintained, if not increased.  At this time, we have a critical need for investment in transport infrastructure, so I expect that an enhanced budget will emerge from the NDP process that will see a variety of projects developed.</p></speech>

According to the details I have on the road project between the Rath roundabout and Kilmoon Cross, it is estimated to cost between &euro;60 million and &euro;70 million and is yet to go to preliminary business case approval, so it is not at the detailed design stage.  The cross-section is a 6 km road, as the Deputy will know.  It is relatively early in the selection process.</p> <p>  I imagine that the Navan rail line is somewhere similar.  It is in the middle of the review of the greater Dublin strategic area.  I think the Deputy knows my views on it.  I believe the Navan rail line is the correct sort of investment not only for County Meath and the people of Navan but also for the strategic development of Dublin.  That sort of development, particularly where it is backed up by compact-led development and applications for housing within easy access of a station, is what will work best for everyone, not least young families who might want to set up there.  That is the kind of housing that people will want to locate close to.</p></speech>

We have to review their respective roles continually.  TII has great skill at delivering projects.  As an example, at a recent meeting we discussed the area of active travel and TII might take a stronger role in that, not just in terms of the regional design offices it now has but also through the likes of the greenway programme.  An agency such as that, with skill and expertise in the deploying of assets, might well have a role in a project like that.</p></speech>

We have been doing a large volume of work in recent weeks.  The clock is against us, so the Minister might return to my questions in the allocated time.  The most important thing is that the national development plan review will see strategic infrastructural programmes delivered, moved out of the doldrums and achieved and realised.  That is what everyone is hoping for.  We need to see this as a means of addressing regional imbalance, which has become ingrained in this country for many decades.  The national development plan should enable some of the infrastructure that will be delivered to rebalance and recalibrate that.</p> <p>  Other mechanisms, too, facilitate that kind of regional rebalancing and they come within the Deputy Ryan's Ministry.  I would like to ask about the post office network.  Since the start of this year, 14 or 15 of them nationally have closed.  One of them, in Broadford, was in my constituency, a 190-year-old post office, and there have been many more.  It is not just a rural problem; 13 post offices in Dublin have handed back their keys.  The Minister's party and other parties in government, including my party, are considering ways to free up the post office network and to give it some viability going forward, including through the examination of a public service obligation option to sustain it in part with &euro;17 million per annum, or through a community banking model like Sparkasse, or Kiwibank in New Zealand.  The Minister might consider that and respond to it.  Furthermore, will he consider intervening, as Minister, in the post offices that have closed during Covid?  An Post has used the Covid stick to close post offices that should not have closed at this time.</p> <p>  My final question relates to Shannon Airport, which is strategic and key to the Minister's Ministry but, overall, to the west and mid-west.  Will he enlighten us on the appointment of a chairperson of the board and what process will get under way?  There have been calls for sector-specific supports for aviation.  It will be one of the last sectors to recover post Covid and will need more than just the supports that have been in place up to now, such as capital investment in national regional airports.  It will need something more long term, an adrenaline shot, to keep it going.  Will the Minister respond to that?</p> <p>  He gave the green light to the Limerick northern distributor road last month.  Are there plans to progress phase 2?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1537" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021030900002#B01000"><p>I agree that better regional balance is the key to the national planning framework.  I keep coming back to the fact that my first priority is investment in the public transport infrastructure in Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  It is critical that the cities outside Dublin have the ability to scale up to counterbalance the excessive development of the east coast versus the south west, the north and the north west.  That has to be central to any NDP review.</p><p>The post office network is critical to our country.  That is even more true now that we are seeing significant disruption in the banking sector not only because of Covid-19 and other events, but because an underlying change is occurring.  The development of mobile banking is undermining traditional banking models.  We recently saw the unwelcome news that Bank of Ireland is to close 100 of its branches.  Ulster Bank is in real difficulty, closing and, in effect, being taken over.  I believe that the post office network is a critical bulwark against that trend and we need to protect and maintain a centre in our communities where a whole range of services, including financial and State services, are available.  The barrister Turlough O'Donnell did some good mediation between the postmasters and An Post three or four years ago.  That consultation set out a good path towards trying to protect and revive as many post officers as possible.  I believe we need to follow that course.  There are range of options.  I am familiar with the Sparkasse banking model and have met representatives of the German banking industry who espouse the model on numerous occasions.  I believe it is a key option and opportunity.  The attractive thing about the model is that it specialises in lending to SMEs and small businesses in sectors such as farming.  That is where that model does well in Germany.  The key characteristic that I like in the model is that the funds raised as deposits in an area are spent or lent in that area.  It involves real banking expertise and I would love to see that model here.</p><p> My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and I are consulting Deputies, civil servants and Government colleagues from the area on the issue of Shannon Airport.  An unfortunate series of events meant that the person we had in mind for the chairmanship had to step back.  I regret that.  We did not want to make an immediate decision after that but it is important that we get a chairperson in place.  The Minister of State and I, working together, hope to be able to progress that matter in the coming weeks.  We decided that it was best to listen to advice from various Deputies and Senators in these Houses rather than charging ahead and making an immediate appointment.</p><p> I am conscious of time and I apologise if I am not covering all of the issues about which I was asked.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and I met approximately 16 representatives of the aviation industry last Friday and had a good, two-hour meeting.  The sector is in real crisis across the world but the concerns are particularly significant here because, as an island nation, we are exposed.  The key thing the industry wants is to get back flying.  We must be careful in that regard by following health advice and ensuring that we protect our country.  However, if get the vaccine roll-out right, if it works as we hope and we get the numbers of infections right down, that will be the key to getting the aviation sector back.  First and foremost, we must address the public health crisis.</p></speech>

I also want to ask about the appointment of a chairperson for the board of Shannon Group.  It is a key appointment for the mid-west region because Shannon is the engine of growth for our region.  I welcome the Minister's comments that he has listened to Oireachtas Members.  I, as chairperson of the Shannon Oireachtas group, wrote to the Minister and asked him to step back and consult.  He offered, through his offices, a meeting with our group.  I know that he is under pressure and our original meeting had to be postponed but I would like it to be rescheduled fairly soon.  I have also written to the Minister about a number of chambers of commerce in the region that want to engage.  It is important that we get the right person in the job, someone who understands aviation, tourism, business and, most important, the region.  The chairperson must be able to engage with stakeholders.  I think there is a vacuum between the airport and the region that needs to be filled.  We need the proper person in that role.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister and the Government have backed a &euro;150 million loan to Aer Lingus.  I know that the Minister is currently in talks with Aer Lingus and I encourage him to conclude them.  I would like to impress on the Minister the need to stitch in connectivity as part of the talks.  If the State is doing a deal with Aer Lingus, it must be on the basis that there is connectivity for Shannon that includes key routes such as those to London Heathrow, New York and Boston.  Those routes are critical.  The Minister must also insist that the workforce and base in Shannon are protected.</p> <p>   My colleague earlier raised the issue of the post office in Broadford, County Clare.  Will the Minister state whether he supports a public service obligation for the An Post network, particularly for post offices that have been lost during the Covid-19 pandemic?  The service would be protected with funding of &euro;17 million annually.  The closure of some bank services presents an opportunity to offer more services through the postal network.</p></speech>

I am nervous about broadening it out too much and having meetings with a variety of different actors or agents because, to be honest, sometimes it is better to listen and talk to people directly.  That is what the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and I have been doing.  It is critical that Shannon Airport returns to being a centre for regional development.  It is not only the airport because the industrial estate and heritage sites are also critical.</p></speech>

My instinct is that the local councils might be a better home for the development of heritage centres but that is the sort of issue that a chairperson and the board will have to decide and act on.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that connectivity for Aer Lingus to the likes of London Heathrow and the east coast of the US is key.  My sense of how this will work is that the key will be that we start seeing the development of the airport in connection with the region.  What type of tourism must we think about?  What is the future of tourism in the mid west and the west?  How will Shannon service that?  We must think and use this as an opportunity for change.  We have built a tourism sector in which people fly into Dublin for two or three days, spend a day going to Clare, half an hour at the Cliffs of Moher, and return to Dublin.  That is what a lot of tourism is about.  If we try to revive Shannon Airport without changing that type of tourism model, it will not work.  We need bigger thinking about the types of tourism and promote longer-stay tourism in the west, south west and mid west, particularly.  Shannon Airport needs to feed into that and promoting those areas as green tourism destinations would work best.</p> <p>  The Minister for Finance negotiated the loan from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, to Aer Lingus.  In fact, ISIF negotiated it itself, as an independent body.  It is a commercial loan and the Department of Transport does not have direct involvement although, obviously, we are aware of the developments.  I understand that Aer Lingus is now funded and will be able to ride out the immediate crisis but no one knows for sure.  The virus has kept changing, twisting and turning and we will have to be vigilant but, for the moment, that loan has helped Aer Lingus manage its way through what has been a difficult period.</p></speech>

The key thing might be to look at other State services that we could develop through our post office network.  Perhaps we could look at other finance instruments, investment, savings or other instruments.  The real strength of the post office network is that post offices are trusted intermediaries in local communities.  If I correctly recall a D&aacute;il debate, the family in the post office in Broadford have been there almost 100 years or some such time.  Multiple generations of that family have been well regarded and trusted in the local community.  We can use that trust for the delivery of public services.  Each Government Department must look to see what other services we could distribute through post offices to broaden the business case.</p><p>That is what is going to make this work, including public services.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister and his officials who have contacted me regarding the issues raised by National Broadband Ireland, NBI, concerning the streamlining required in the context of a planning permission permits system.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would update me on the progress being made on getting that done.  We all obviously accept that acceleration is necessary in the NBP.  In the meantime, has the Minister or anybody in government engaged with other commercial entities on stopgap solutions, for want of a better term, that could be offered to people who might be waiting for three to four years, and possibly longer, for the roll-out of the national broadband plan?  I am talking about options such as a possible satellite solution.  A proper Government initiative may need to be put in place.  I would like the Minister to comment on that matter.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's support for the possibility of a community banking facility.  Have there been any conversations at Government level about such an initiative?  In the same vein, have there been conversations in government and with An Post to ensure that the requisite capacity is available within the post office network to deal with the new banking requirements the network will experience because of the unfortunate closure of Ulster Bank and also of some branches of Bank of Ireland, such as in towns like Dunleer?</p> <p>  I have brought up cross-Border planning previously.  In fairness, the Minister's officials who have spoken to us previously have given us decent enough information concerning the A5 and the Narrow Water bridge being in play in this regard.  Some of my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, in the context of the memorandum of understanding, MOU, on the strategic alliance between the Louth local authorities and Newry and Mourne District Council, have also said that some of the responsibility for the issues in this regard lie with the Minister for Infrastructure, Nichola Mallon.

It was obviously affected by the onset of Covid-19 last year and also during the first months of this year.  There have been a variety of difficulties, including with contractors coming over from the UK and workers being out because they have tested positive or have been close contacts of someone else who has tested positive.  Development has in some ways been hindered by those difficulties.  However, more than 178,000 premises have been surveyed as of 15 February.  In addition, since 25 January just about every main broadband retailer and provider has been keen to resell these services.  Premises in Cork, Cavan and Galway have been connected, with Limerick to follow in the coming months.</p> <p>  Turning to stopgap measures, there have been examples of where it has been frustrating for people regarding networks.  A neighbour may get a high-speed broadband connection, but then for a variety of network reasons the next house down is not included.  I understand that some of the operators are looking at those exceptional cases, where some extension might be possible.  On the satellite aspect, I will be honest and state that in recent times I have not heard of or been approached by developers looking at such satellite options.  It has always been a possible option, but I think the difficulty lies in the speed of and delays in connections.</p></speech>

Reiterating what I said to Deputy Crowe earlier, a good example of what An Post has done is its work with Scottish and Southern Energy, SSE, Airtricity.  The advertisements can be seen on television for the wraparound service to improve homes.  The lending facility and energy expertise is provided and An Post puts all the elements together as a product.  That is the sort of product in which I think An Post potentially has real expertise.  It is also the sort of product which would easily merge into community banking or, as I mentioned earlier, the Sparkassen model.  The provision of loans to the value of &euro;10,000 to &euro;50,000, and upwards when it comes to the commercial sector, is where we could have real expertise.</p> <p>  Regarding cross-Border planning issues, I have had several meetings with Minister Mallon and we have discussed at length the Narrow Water bridge project.  As soon as it is possible to travel, we want to commit to visiting Carlingford.  There are different views of and options for this project.  One option is a foot and cycling bridge.  The area around Carlingford and the Mourne mountains is stunning for that type of tourism and I think it has great potential.  Car traffic may also be a factor because of the major motorway bypass going in on the eastern side of Newry.  The existing road from Omeath to Newry is a country road which is not very wide, so if we approached this project in respect of it involving a major car road there could be implications then regarding upgrading the entire road network around the Carlingford peninsula.  I do not know if that is what we want in the long run.  Instead, there may be real potential here for us to do something which is iconic, spectacular and sustainable.</p></speech>

Starting with the issue of post offices, there has been talk about Broadford post office, which has closed, as have others.  We are all around long enough to know there has been talk about community banks and additional services being the salvation of the post office network.  None of that has happened and post offices continue to close, as Broadford post office has closed.  We are all well aware that establishing a community bank, which in essence is a brilliant idea, will require a cultural shift in the way we do our business and an input from the State.  That will take a hell of a lot of time.</p> <p>  My concern is that a swathe of post offices will continue to close while we as an institution of the State continue to talk about all the things that can be done.  They are going to take too long.  What is needed now is a public service obligation, PSO, and direct funding by the State to stabilise the post office network and allow for the reopening of Broadford post office and the retention of the overall post office network at its current size.  We can then look at the array of services which would make the post office network more profitable and less dependent on State funding.  However, we have to get that foundation in place as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I also raise the issue of the situation in Shannon Airport.  Other speakers have referred to the necessity to appoint a chairperson there quickly and I welcome the Minister's active engagement with stakeholders in the region, including with members of the Oireachtas and the chambers of commerce and with people who are in the know about the situation.  The sooner that appointment can be made the better, but I really welcome the approach being taken by the Minister.  Whatever the debacle was in this regard, it speaks volumes for the Public Appointment Service, PAS, and an investigation is needed.  I am aware of several individuals who seemed eminently qualified who applied for the role and did not even get an interview.  I have concerns about how PAS does its business.  This may be an issue for another committee, but it is a matter which needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  In the context of the review of the national development plan, NDP, we are looking at how we can accommodate 1 million more people in our country, including putting in place aspects such as the requisite transport networks etc. and how we can achieve all that.  In doing that, let us not forget the approximately 5 million people we already have.  I support the approach being taken by the Minister, but there is real concern that the concentration of investment in public transport as opposed to roads will leave a gap and that we will not be removing the existing pinch points for the almost five million people currently experiencing difficulties on our roads.  </p> <p>  In this regard, I think about the bridge in Killaloe, the inner relief road at Blake's Corner in Ennistymon and the road between Ennis and Ennistymon.  These are key projects that I and anyone from County Clare is familiar with.  We want to see those projects advanced.  Public transport should of course be improved, as should Local Link which is doing really well and new services are being rolled out.  However, we must also look at the speed at which people can get from point to point.</p><p>In regard to the new service from Ennis to Kilrush, it takes two and a half hours to get to the train station from Kilrush.  It is not going to move people from cars to buses.  We need to tighten it.</p></speech>

We must be careful on the banking side.  It is an industry in flux.  We have stopped using cash because of Covid-19.  How many here have a Revolut card?  How many of their relations are being queried on that?  However, that is a separate issue.  I kid you not, the questions my family have been asked on that are shocking.  It is not going to go back to traditional banking.  There is a role for financial services within that.</p> <p>  The Deputy's colleague, Michael Moriarty, has been pushing the case for an example similar in size and demography in respect of Broadford, Kishkeam and out beyond Newmarket in north-west Cork and to see if we could make it a local enterprise hub centre with several workplaces and a high-speed broadband connection.  We should be thinking beyond the traditional in terms of new services or projects.</p> <p>  There was a post bus in the Loop Head Peninsula with the post van working as a local bus.  It is similar to the system in Switzerland.  We will we see many more parcels and the post offices are not making much money from the parcel business, although everyone else is.  Those vans could go around places such as Kilrush.  Rather than waiting four hours for the next bus, one could take the post van instead.  The van could have parcels in the back and a half-dozen seats at the front.  We need to think differently.</p></speech>

It cannot be done online.</p> <p>  Our Department has an obligation, along with our colleagues, to consider whether we can extend the number of services that could go to local post offices to make them viable because they will not be with letters, stamps or cash transactions.  Those will not be the key.  It will all be mobile and electronic.</p></speech>

It will now go to public consultation.  The strategic framework for investment in land transport is Government policy approved by Cabinet.  We got a letter from the Minister's Secretary General, Mr. Ken Spratt, who appeared before us recently, stating that the Minister has approved that it will go out to public consultation by the end of March and that it will be an eight week consultation period.

The strategic framework for investment in land transport went to public consultation and was brought to Cabinet for formal approval afterwards.  I cannot see how this can be approved by Cabinet without first going to public consultation.  Can it go to public consultation and go through a normal process with the Minister bringing it to Cabinet for its formal approval prior to the finalisation of the national development plan, NDP?</p> <p>  The Department's submission to the NDP review process that is currently under way at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is done under the national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, which is Deputy Ryan's right as Minister.  If it is to underpin transport projects in the NDP, would it not be more appropriate if it went to public consultation prior to being approved by Cabinet?</p></speech>

I read the discussions with my Secretary General on this.  The national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, started in 2017 long before this Government come in.

The Minister might indicate the funding and timeframe involved in terms of the use of the existing rail network in Limerick city, which I am very enthusiastic about.  How will that feed into the process?  The Minister spoke about road projects.  Where does he see the M20 project fitting into his thought stream?  It is important to have a rail and motorway side to the project.</p></speech>

There are a variety of options.  There is likely to be a further paring down of options within the next quarter.  TII will outline some further options and analysis later this year.  The project is at a relatively early stage.</p> <p>  On rail investment in Limerick, some of the thinking behind NIFTI comes into this.  It outlines where we should optimise the use of existing assets.  In my mind, that is where the Limerick metropolitan rail plan comes in.  We are in the middle of drafting the Limerick metropolitan area strategy.  It is evolving.  The benefit of investing in the rail network in Limerick, such as building new stations and upgrading existing stations, is that existing assets are optimised.  If we open up a rail freight line to Foynes, it will create an economic rail freight cargo while at the same time allowing us to open it up for commuting and other traffic.  What I am aiming for is the likes of Adare having a rail station at the same time as the Ryder Cup.</p></speech>

The TII report for 2021 identified the existing N24 between Cahir and Limerick Junction as not being fit for purpose.  It was acknowledged that the current N24 is substandard, with a high volume of bends causing poor visibility.  The N24 is the main artery between Rosslare Europort and Limerick and demand for the route will increase due to Brexit and projected economic growth.  Tipperary town is at the centre of this pathway.  It is already an area of high traffic congestion.  It is a bottleneck.</p> <p>  The current traffic through Tipperary town's narrow and congested Main Street is measured at 85,000 vehicles per week, including heavy goods transporters.  The town is choked with traffic.  The level of traffic through the town is detrimental to quality of life and business activity.  The section between Tipperary town and Cahir consistently has collision rates twice the national average.  Delays in the town of Tipperary are causing huge frustration and a burden of cost to those who use this essential route.</p> <p>  Travelling through Tipperary town is a horrendous experience.  It is extremely dangerous for pedestrians.  The level of air pollution and noise is intolerable.  Local people are furious after years of inaction.  Having listened to every proposal and argument put forward, I have come to the conclusion it is imperative to construct a bypass from Cahir to Limerick Junction, encompassing Tipperary town, to alleviate a chaotic situation.  I believe this to be the most logical and efficient way to solve the problem. </p> <p>  Realistically, the town will not be sanctioned for two roads, a link or ring road and a bypass.  Tipperary County Council and TII have identified a suitable route for a bypass.  However, it is not currently included in the national development plan.  I request the Minister and Department to include the N24 in the national development plan.  I ask that the section from Cahir to Limerick Junction be given priority.  This would mean that the section of the bypass serving Tipperary town would be designed, finalised and commenced first.  It would form the first part of the N24 route and later become the connecting part between Limerick and Waterford.</p> <p>  Along with many others, I believe this is most cost-effective and efficient way to proceed.  With Tipperary town being identified as an area of social deprivation, investment in the bypass will not only improve the quality of life for local residents, it will also progress the local economy and expand connectivity on what is a vital strategic transport link between Limerick, Waterford and Rosslare.</p></speech>

It is plagued by very heavy levels of freight traffic.  As the Deputy knows, traffic from large industrial areas in Shannon and Galway heading towards Rosslare or the Port of Waterford all run through the likes of Tipperary town.  That leads to huge problems, including congestion.</p> <p>  Vacancies on Main Street and so on are very high because of the town's characteristics.  It is exactly the sort of priority I mentioned earlier, namely, putting town centres first and creating new and vibrant urban public realms in the centre of our 19th century market towns.</p> <p>  My understanding that in the public consultation that occurred recently a variety of options were discussed, including by TII.  A section of the road between Cahir and Limerick Junction could have a bypass for Tipperary town as a first priority.  The journey from Cahir to Limerick Junction is 35 km, as the Deputy knows.  The project would not be cheap; it would cost several hundred million.  We are constrained by budget and engineering capability.  Therefore, the best thing we could do would be to choose particular blackspots, as I said to Senator Dooley, and address them quickly.  The town needs to be rescued from its traffic difficulties as quickly as possible, which could involve highlighting and addressing shorter sections of 6 km, 7 km or 8 km and a bypass of Tipperary town.  If there was a future upgrade of the wider road from Cahir to Limerick Junction, the project would fit within that.  My priority is to deal with the likes of Tipperary town quickly.</p></speech>

It is a positive response to my request to make Tipperary town the centre of the first piece of action on the on N24.  I understand the financial constraints of his Department.  It is absolutely crucial we liberate Tipperary town from the scourge of traffic congestion.  I thank the Minister for his response, which I appreciate.  I look forward to having discussions with the officials.  It is important to include this section in the national development plan.</p></speech>

He took a strange route, through the caravanserai in Tipperary via Tipperary town en route to Limerick.  No one knows why he took that route; he should have gone via Bansha.  My family was involved in looking after the horses at the first stopping post, so my family history includes the Cahir to Limerick road.  I hope that bias does not influence my decisions.  It is an example of where we should prioritise our towns first strategy.</p></speech>

This made me think that if even a small proportion of that money was put towards proper public transport projects, we could achieve many our objectives in terms of getting people from place to place.</p><p>When we talk about transport, we are not only talking about people getting from one place to another for work during rush hour.  We are also talking about giving people access to recreation and education and those who do not own cars the ability to travel further and access many more benefits.</p><p> As currently proposed, would the national development plan cut emissions?  We now have an objective to cut carbon emissions by 7% per annum and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  If we proceed with projects that lock in carbon emissions, that release a lot of carbon at construction stage and that lock in the users of those projects, we will lock ourselves into high-carbon emission production for many years.  We cannot continue on like that.</p><p> The Minister spoke earlier about optimising existing assets.  One of the assets we have in this country which we do not optimise enough is our railway network.  Under the old railway network, there were many more lines resulting in far less dependence on cars.  We have to start shifting that balance back again.  We are always going to have cars.  We are not anti-car but we must look at optimising the assets we have.</p><p> We talk about the electrification of projects.  The DART+ programme, which includes the electrification of lines, is ambitious and to be welcomed.  The programme extends north as far as Drogheda.  Perhaps it should go beyond that.  To the west it will reach to Hazelhatch, Maynooth and possibly beyond.  While we have that expertise in the country installing and constructing that electrified network, we should consider electrifying different parts of the network, such as those around Limerick or Cork, or extending the programme to Wicklow.  As we look at these rail electrification projects, I ask the Minister to consider how they could be expanded while we have that expertise and while construction is up and running under the DART+ programme.</p></speech>

The scale of our ambition and the level of change planned are beyond compare.  The existing climate action plan includes a very ambitious switch towards electric vehicles and the use of biofuels including biodiesel.  Every country in Europe is now doing this but we are faced with a challenge to go much further and transport will be a key part of this.  It accounts for 20% of our emissions, which will need to decrease from 12 million tonnes to 6 million tonnes or lower.  They should be heading towards zero within three decades.  It is a challenge beyond compare but it will lead to a better country and economy and a more social and healthier environment.  The key development, beyond the switch to EVs, biofuels and so on, will be the reduction of demand for travel and modal switches.  These will be key elements in making the next reductions in carbon emissions.</p><p>That is why I keep coming back to the national planning framework.  It recognises that and also recognises we need not only balanced regional development but compact development.  That is why I have pushed the towns first strategy.  To the best of our ability, we should make sure people are able to live within walking distance of churches, pubs, schools and shops.  It is not <i>verboten</i>for someone not to live so close to amenities, but local services, including post offices, thrive in those sorts of well-designed communities in which people live within walking, cycling and bus distance.  They work better.  That is why the Government has shifted spending so that it is now 2:1 in favour of public transport versus roads and why, aside from that, it has set aside 20% of the capital budget for active travel, including walking.  That is for rural Ireland as well.</p><p>Deputy Matthews knows more about rail than anyone here.  He is right; we will have to electrify the network because we will have zero carbon emissions and no fossil fuels in 2030.  We have to start thinking about how to do that.  Could the network be electrified as far as south as Wicklow, in the Deputy's constituency?  The benefits would include a faster, more efficient, cleaner, quieter, quicker and better train service.  It should not stop there.  The Deputy spoke about Limerick as an example earlier.  Why would we not run commuter rail services from Limerick or beyond?  We could have a service from Nenagh to Limerick.</p></speech>

This area is evolving but I understand new electric battery options are coming into view.  Irish Rail will have to come back to us on the technical aspects but I believe that is where we are going to go, towards electrification and compact development built around good quality public transport systems.</p> <p>  We are doing a rail review this year.  Mr. Doocey, who is seated behind me, is commissioning it.  Let us go back to Tipperary town.  The town has a brilliant railway station.  We have discussed the route from Nenagh to Limerick, but why not consider a route from Carrick-on-Suir or Clonmel to Waterford?  That would build up Waterford as the capital of the south east, if that is not too difficult a thing to say politically.  It would also benefit Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel.  Those towns have fantastic infrastructure.  We can either let it go or restore it and bring it back.  Let us do up the railway station in Tipperary town and start running proper services to and from it.  At the moment, the service in Tipperary town, Clonmel or Carrick-on-Suir cannot really be used because a pony or horse and cart would be quicker.  That is part of the solution and the rail review will look at it.</p></speech>

It is interesting that the Minister talked about the Bianconi coaches.  My grandfather was the last coachman in Galway and he drove a Bianconi coach to Clifden, drawn by four horses.  Transport in Galway is, therefore, in my blood.  I would like to talk to the Minister about this light rail project.  Anybody looking at the city of Galway would certainly not use its layout if building a city.  There is a very active group in Galway concerned with bringing light rail to the city.  An excellent report was prepared by Mr. Murt Coleman, chartered engineer, with whom I ask the Minister to engage.</p> <p>  Bringing more buses into Galway will not solve the city's problems.  Some 336,000 cars a week travel into the city.  I do not live in Galway now and I am very thankful I do not.  The traffic congestion in the city is bound to have a negative effect on foreign direct investment or any other sort of investment which would create jobs.  It has become very difficult to travel across the city.  I understand there is a plan in place.  The Minister has shown tremendous imagination and willingness to listen and to reappraise situations today.  I ask that he agree to meet with the light rail group from Galway city and at least to explore the possibility of developing the project the group has in mind.</p> <p>  Some 22,000 citizens in Galway have already said they favour some sort of light rail system in the city.  I believe the system now being talked about is the Coventry system.  This is not a heavy rail system such as the Luas but a very light rail system.  The route could run from the airport at Carnmore, into the city and right through to Barna, feeding all of the satellite settlements around the city such as Mervue, Ballybane, Renmore, Salthill, Knocknacarra and Barna.  We have to move away from heavy vehicles with diesel engines and to start looking at alternatives.  I have spoken to the people involved in the light rail project in Galway and I am quite excited by what they have proposed.  Is the Minister willing to meet this group and at least to consider carrying out a feasibility study on the introduction of a light rail system in Galway?</p></speech>

Bianconi was an incredible man.  He was an Italian and a friend of Daniel O'Connell.  He hauled picture frames around the country and got fed up with seeing the aristocracy going by in their carriages so he decided to set up his own.  He ran the Ryanair of his day and had real class.  His carriages ended up going as far as Belmullet, with the first stop having been-----</p></speech>

They make a very good case.</p><p>We have an immediate priority.  We must build high-quality bus corridor routes from the likes of Barna to Taylor's Hill, the hospital and the university, through the town, through Eyre Square and out towards Parkmore.  As I understand it, that is one of the two light rail routes that people have been considering.  Similar to what we will need to do in Cork, we must identify key bus corridor routes and build them out.  It will be politically difficult to get prioritisation on the road.  That is the challenge, but it must be done in Galway and Cork with a view to being upgradable to light rail.  That is the sequence we should have in mind.  The key decision is the road space.  Impressively, the people in Galway are considering a new technology that is coming on stream.  It is very light rail, which would perfectly suit just such a staged approach of putting the bus corridor first, building passenger demand, showing that the demographics can work and changing transport patterns within the city, thereby making the case.</p><p> We will have to review the Galway transport strategy next year.  That will be the perfect place to consider light rail options.  However, we cannot delay.  We must proceed not just with bus routes in Galway, but also with cycling infrastructure.  Everyone knows that Galway is probably the area in the country worst affected by traffic.  Everyone is living on one side of the city and working on the other, leading to major congestion.  Public transport as well as cycling and other active travel solutions will be critical.  By delivering them, it will set us on the path towards converting them into light rail routes.  I understand that the latest thinking from the light rail community in Galway is along similar lines, namely, turning bus lanes into light rail lines using new, advanced and very light technology.  I would be supportive of reviewing that idea next year as part of the review of the Galway transport strategy.</p></speech>

What I heard was encouraging.  He has amazed me with his knowledge of every town and village in Ireland.  Clearly, he is the right man for the job.

I come from the town of Mallow, which is one of those towns that the Minister has described in terms of developing their potential and radiating their services outward.  I am a regular rail user.  Currently, 90% of my travel is by rail between Mallow and Dublin.  I am an onward user of the Leap card, which is like a piece of gold to me.  If I am a Mallow resident, though, I cannot use it to travel to Cork.  I can travel from Dublin Pearse Station to Greystones using a Leap card, but not from Mallow to Cork.  Therein lies the injustice and inequality.  I have been campaigning for nearly three years to have the Leap card service extended between Mallow and Cork.  I have been going in and out of the National Transport Authority, NTA, and going around the houses.  If the Minister is serious about shifting modes of transport and putting people on trains and buses, will he please take on this simple issue?  It is useless for us to talk about modal shifts unless we go after the low-hanging fruit.  It would be significant if the Leap card could be used by students, older people or people of any age to go in and out of Cork.  We would see a dramatic reduction in the number of cars on the roads to Cork because public transport services could be extended.</p> <p>  My next issue concerns towns themselves.  I hope that the Minister has relations in or some connection to Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville.  I am sure he will recount a personal tale for us.  If he has a personal connection to any of those towns, I implore him to ensure that the ongoing consultation process in respect of a bypass for Mallow is followed up with a budget line.  It is vital that the town be bypassed, but it is also important that if we are going to - I believe I have interpreted the Minister correctly in this - bypass towns like Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville, we do not take our eye off the ball as regards the proposed M20 Cork-Limerick motorway.  I continue to make the case for the motorway on the basis of regional investment into the very towns the Minister was talking about on the one hand and, on the other, ensuring that we make roads safe.  There have been too many fatalities on the routes between Cork and Limerick.  On average, there are more than 17,000 movements between Cork and Charleville per day.  Too many people have died.  I ask that the proposals not be mutually exclusive goals.  The bypass is needed, but there is also a need to deal with towns like Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville.  I do not want to be too parochial, but we must speak to thousands upon thousands of people in the Munster region who are depending on the bypass to be completed in an appropriate way.  Like the Chairman, I welcome the investment in public transport that the Minister mentioned.  I am someone who loves using the train.  The two proposals are not mutually exclusive.</p> <p>  My final point is on EirGrid and the interconnector.  Everyone sees the interconnector's potential.  The point at which landfall takes place is in east Cork.  There are residents in the little area around Churchtown and Roxborough who have expressed concerns.  If possible, will the Minister use his good offices to intercede with EirGrid, insofar as that is appropriate, to ensure that there is no disruption to the lives of people living in those little pockets?  We all realise that the interconnector will be a vital piece of infrastructure, as do the residents, but they have expressed concerns.</p></speech>

That is what is in the Cork metropolitan area strategy, which we are seeking to advance.  It is a perfect project that will use existing infrastructure.  It will require work at Kent Station so that we can run right the way through.  That makes sense.  It would also involve new stations at the likes of Tivoli, on the north side of Cork, in Blarney and in Monard where housing should be put.  Cork County Council must adjust its development plan now to configure housing with the public transport plans that I hope we will get through the national development plan review.  Linked with what Deputy Matthews spoke about, the new electric battery trains would be charged in Mallow and run in and out of there.  That makes what we are talking about a completely different prospect.  That is a metropolitan rail service, not an intercity one, and it could run much more frequently.  This is doable and should be our top transport priority because we need Cork to be strong and to grow as a centre.</p></speech>

Where we have interconnection with electricity connection supplies, we will have industry.  Little Island, the pharmaceutical industries in Cork harbour and other new industries that come in will be attracted to where that strong point in the grid is.  It is critical for Cork's industrial development and employment.  In that Cork harbour region, the interconnector is key.</p> <p>  It is a high voltage direct current, HVDC, underground interconnection to the Carrigtwohill industrial estate.  It does not have an electromagnetic charge.  We had many difficulties when we built the first east-west interconnector from north Dublin to north Wales.</p></speech>

I hope we can, collectively, be successful.  I am glad he mentioned the need for Cork to be strong because we are becoming very Dublin-centric.  We need to have a counterbalance through balanced regional development but I have some concerns.  I am fully supportive and totally in favour of the policy switch to public transport.  Deputy Sherlock spoke about the Leap card.  It is a single journey from Cork to Mallow, whereas Cork to Midleton is a number of stops.  That is part of the problem.</p> <p>  The Cabinet announced urban regeneration funding this week, which will be ongoing.  My worry is that we will end up with no Cork city and that it will be left behind.  On the island of the city now there are derelict buildings and idle sites.  Everything is moving to the docklands, which we are all for, and up the other end there is the redevelopment of Bishop Lucey Park and the Grand Parade.  However, the central piece of the island of Cork city, which is Patrick Street and the offshoots, is dying a death - no pun intended.  One could land a jumbo jet on the pigeons on Patrick Street in Cork city today.  As a Cork person I am genuinely worried.  I am supportive of the Cork metropolitan strategy and I embrace it wholeheartedly.  We had a great meeting with the NTA a few weeks ago.  I will walk and drive with the Minister on buses and bikes every step of the way but I appeal to him, his officials and the Government not to let Cork city become full of tumbleweed.  We must have a vibrant city.  I appeal to the Minister to use the national development plan with the urban regeneration fund to drive a reimagined and revitalised Cork city.</p> <p>  To that end, I refer to the issue of the airport.  We are all parochial about airports.  Cork Airport is central to the new Cork as the connectivity point.  Deputy Lowry used the word "liberation".  The Minister's legacy, along with that of other Cabinet colleagues, will be the liberation and rebirth of Cork city.  We can talk about bus corridors and public transport and have a wonderful image of what that looks like but if we have no place to go to offer a counterbalance to Dublin then we are in big trouble.  The glossy magazines Deputy Matthews spoke about will not be worth the paper on which they are written.  I will support the Minister 1000% but let us make sure that, in the case of Cork city, we do not have a city that is falling behind.  It should be embraced as a new futuristic looking city.  I thank the Minister for that.</p></speech>

I was fortunate to spend 15 years driving around the country bringing people on holidays and that gave me knowledge of many different areas, including Cork city, which I know well.  The Senator is right that the centre of the city is key.  Cork has been hollowed out, like so many Irish cities, but it is probably the worst of them.  John Spillane had a song that went "Johnny don&rsquo;t go to Ballincollig ... Johnny don&rsquo;t go to Carragaline" but everyone went out and we need to bring them back in.  That is how one gets cities that attract investment and that work in a variety of different ways.</p> <p>  Cork has its problems with flooding as it is low lying - we all know that - but it is also stunning.  Oliver Plunkett Street just won a big award as best street.  It is a fantastic city.  The critical decision we need to make is at the local council level.  As an example of something that would do exactly what the Senator is suggesting, I will take one bus corridor route in Cork.  From Ballincollig it would go through CIT and back by the hospital, down Wilton Road, the Western Road, pass by UCC, Washington Street, the Grand Parade and the South Mall and then out to the docks.  That would not just service the docks and Mahon.  It would service the centre.  That will require difficult political decision-making, similar to the decisions we are about to make in Dublin.</p> <p>  In Dublin, we are en route to delivering BusConnects and getting it through planning.  We also need to deliver a BusConnects for Cork.  It was difficult when we started that project.  The very first stage was on Wilton Road on that key section near the old greyhound stadium and the hospital.  The local council said "No" to the project.  It probably had good reasons because the locals on that street would lose some of the their front gardens, similar to parts of Dublin.  We need to come back with a different solution.  We need to look at that section of the road and decide to restrict through traffic, make it one way, use a bus gate or use the innovative methods we have now developed in Dublin, using the NTA to deliver them in Cork.  We need that bus corridor because we need to revive the Grand Parade, Oliver Plunkett Street and Patrick Street, through which that route goes.  We are starting.  I understand that the council is working on turning the South Mall around as the centre of the business district.  The docklands are starting to take off.  The plan is viable but it requires the local authority to work with my Department by being ready and keen to do this and by providing the political direction to give the road space to really go with the sustainable transport solutions.</p> <p>  As the Senator knows, the bus service in Cork is not up to standard and it does not have the same advanced plans that there are in Dublin.  Bus &Eacute;ireann and the bus companies are up for it and they will do it but political leadership is needed at a local level to say we are going to go with Cork sustainable transport systems, which will revive the centre more than anywhere else.</p></speech>

For the past number of months, since I was appointed to this committee, I have been working with him on a number of key issues.  I will be parochial for a moment and deal with some of those pertaining to my own constituency.  I concur with some of the points made by my colleague Deputy Sherlock regarding the Leap card situation in Mallow.  Indeed, one of the very first things that brought me to Leinster House as a member of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g was a meeting with him and Senator Buttimer, when he was in the D&aacute;il, to lobby for Leap cards to be introduced outside of Dublin.  We were successful in that but we were given commitments by the then Minister for Transport, that is, the previous Taoiseach and now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, that the Department would expand services for rural towns that are serviced by rail in County Cork.  I reiterate that that has to be sorted out.  We had conversations with the NTA, which has come back saying it is prohibitive because of cost.  That is unacceptable because it provides those same services to people living in the greater Dublin area who can use their Leap cards and that is not afforded to constituents in my area.  My maternal family are from Mallow.  This is an issue I am hoping to resolve and it is important to me that it be looked into.  Perhaps the Minister would have a conversation with the NTA in that regard.</p> <p>  Regarding the national development plan, there are two very exceptional projects I want to see addressed.  I recently attended a breakfast meeting with the Cobh &amp;amp; Harbour Chamber, with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to talk about the significant issues facing that town and the community there.  One issue that is of concern to Cobh residents, local businesses and the chamber for Cork Harbour and the Cobh area is the access road on and off of Cobh island.  I would like some focus to be put on that issue.  It is quite tricky in the sense that a regional road must be redesignated as a national road.</p><p>From experience of previously highlighting this with officials who have been into this committee, their responses have been fairly confusing.  From my conversations with the local authority, I understand it is trying its best to resolve that.</p><p> Most importantly, the decision on the finalisation of the national development plan is imminent.  I am adamant that I get answers from the Minister on the issue of the N25 bypass at Castlemartyr and Killeagh.  I know Castlemartyr has received money for a feasibility study, but the issues in Killeagh have been raised with us repeatedly and we need to get that onto the national development plan.  The Minister might have something to say on that and I can come back in afterwards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-09a.1638" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021030900002#K00200"><p>I will address that last issue first because it is an example of what I have been talking about in terms of what we will do with our road network and what we will invest in.  On the example of the N25, there may have been an original plan to look at the whole section from Youghal to Midleton as a dual carriageway all of the way and so on.  The key and critical bottlenecks and pinch points are in Castlemartyr and Killeagh.  There are short bypass options on the road network that would address the particular problems in those two places.  I had a meeting with TII on it because it is an interesting example of what we need to do strategically.</p> <p>  In Castlemartyr there are difficulties because the town is on the side the bypass would be done.  It is boggy and flood-prone land so it would have to be a sophisticated solution that would not be cheap.  That is the sort of project we need to look at.  Bypasses should be a priority.  It is the same with the village of Killeagh, which has a similar configuration and a similar problem with traffic running through it.  We should invest in bypasses in these places rather than making a major investment in that entire section of the national road.</p> <p>  It is the same with the R624 from Cobh to Glounthaune.  The Deputy is right it is quite an exposed road because it is almost across the causeway along the seafront and it has an old bridge.  Again, this project will not be easy because an upgrade programme to protect the road from erosion or to protect the bridge is not insignificant expenditure.  Even to do a basic upgrade of the road would not be insignificant in cost.</p> <p>  I keep coming back to the same simple and clear message that our priority in our roads programme should be on safety, protecting the assets we have, and that where there is particular inferiority on our national or regional road network, we invest there rather than necessarily in large major new motorways or other interurban projects.  We have a limited budget and it is best spent on those regional and more local site-specific investments.  That is what I would hope will come out of our end-of-year review.</p></speech>

On the east-west interconnector, significant frustrations have been outlined by people in the east Cork area on EirGrid's communication with landowners.  My family lives along that line and it affects our local community.  We have not been communicated with either on the status of the project, and I would ask the Minister to engage with EirGrid to ask it to improve its communication with local residents around the Midleton area and Churchtown.  The communication has been unacceptably poor and that has been outlined at municipal district meeting level, but I take this opportunity in the committee to ask the Minister to do that.  I would appreciate that.</p></speech>

I am not a member of this committee, but between Galway coachmen, Daniel O'Connell and Cork distilleries, I might be back again.</p> <p>  I want to raise two issues with the Minister.  First, I mention the consultation that is taking place on the Dublin 11 Luas line through Finglas.  I have raised this with the Minister and, as he knows, it is a post-2027 project.  I am sure the Minister would agree with me that it fulfils all of the goals of our programme for Government that it would be a pre-2027 project and would be prioritised in the review of the national development plan.  I do not say that in expectation of an answer today but to underline the point.  If that project was completed with a terminus at Charlestown, it would have a 2 km gap between it and the MetroLink line which is being constructed up through Ballymun.  While I do not expect both phases of that to be in place before 2027, there is great merit in connecting those two lines.  That would unlock the potential of those northern lands, assist in the regeneration of Ballymun and provide many other benefits.  I will leave all of that with the Minister, and if he can prioritise that, I would much appreciate it.</p> <p>  Second, I mention the amendments to the Road Traffic Act 1961, which I know the Minister has Cabinet approval on and which will help tackle the issue of the illegal use of scrambler bikes.  I plead with the Minister, as much as with the committee, that time would be made for the pre-legislative scrutiny of that amendment Bill and for Committee Stage, where I expect the Minister to bring forward amendments.  When will the Minister be in a position to publish those amendments?</p></speech>

It did not appear to include anything to do with scramblers, so maybe the Minister will provide a bit of clarity around that area.  Does that make sense?</p></speech>

I expect to have it shortly but we will also have to work with the Chief Whip's office.  As soon as we can get it into the House for Second Stage, we will do so.</p> <p>  On Finglas, I ask the Deputy to endear himself to his party colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, because one of the challenges we will have is that, on the public transport side in particular, we have myriad projects vying for funding at a roughly similar time.  The problem is that many of them are not ready to go to construction now.  If they were ready, they would be out the gate, but they have to go through the planning process.</p> <p>  I remember launching the Finglas project nine months ago or so and I was thrilled to do so.  It seems to me to be an obvious extension, it is mainly through greenfield sites, it services areas that badly need public transport development, and it would open up a lot of land, which is what we need to do on this.  I was slightly disheartened when I looked at the projected timelines and I wondered why it was going to take so long.  One of the difficulties is that we have to invest in MetroLink and the DART+ programme.  They are both huge investment projects that are beyond compare in their scale.  The BusConnects project will also not be cheap and that is before we start looking at the Navan rail line, and the Cork, Limerick and Galway rail investments, which are all investments we need to make.  One of the challenges in the national development plan is how we will fit all of these public transport projects into what will be, if we are up front and honest, a limited budget.</p> <p>  I would be interested in talking to the Deputy in more detail about the possibility of connecting the Finglas route to the MetroLink.  I would have thought that one risk of going down that route is that we get away from the greenfield access routes the preferred route option is on.  I would be slightly nervous that such an approach would run into planning difficulties and delays, which is what is taking us so long.  My instinct would be to stick with the existing route and use whatever help the Deputy can give me in getting the budget requirements we would need to be able to fund all of these public transport projects.  That will be a real problem.</p></speech>

I have made representations to the Minister, Deputy McGrath, and will continue to do so.  The connection on to the MetroLink line would not be a significant issue.  That option would have even more greenfield access routes than the existing preferred route.  I take the Minister's point that it is not about delaying or stalling the current projection in any way.  If we can get the first phase of that project reclassified as a pre-2027 project, I would be pleased.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned that he is doing a national review of the rail network, which is very welcome.  We wrote to his office looking for an update on that.  Could he give us a follow-up briefing on that?</p> <p>  I was struck by his reference to making optimum use of existing assets.  Could he elaborate on that, in particular in terms of rail?  He will be aware that we are looking at rail connectivity on the M20.  One of the options is to upgrade the existing rail line between Charleville and Limerick.  Limerick Junction to Limerick city has only a single rail line within a double rail line.  It does not interfere with private property.  Two other routes were proposed.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's general thinking on his vision for public transport.  He is well aware of my commitment on the M20.  I use the train to Dublin.  I am probably one of the biggest users or rail and I am a great supporter of rail, but I do not see rail and road as being mutually exclusive.</p> <p>  I want to let other members in, but I am interested in getting the Minister's thoughts on his vision for the area.  I have a strong view that rail and road are not mutually exclusive.  It is about finding a way to get connectivity and balanced regional development.  I am strongly in favour of the M20 because I believe we need a counter-pole along the western seaboard to Dublin and a key ingredient of that is a motorway.  Equally, we need to enhance the rail network.  I would like to see the Limerick Junction to Limerick city line becoming a double rail line.  I am surprised that has not happened before now.  It was there previously.  At the moment, one does not have to get off the train between Charleville and Limerick.  I would favour that approach rather than putting in a new rail line across virgin territory where it would cause significant anxiety among residents and not make maximum use of the existing rail network.  I ask the Minister to give me his thoughts on it.  It is a broader question, but it is something we do not get an opportunity to debate in the wider sphere.  We have a couple of minutes.  The Minister might just me his thoughts generally on it.</p></speech>

That is for the sake of Dubliners as well as anyone else because given the price of property in my constituency it is very difficult for my children to have the prospect of growing up in the way I did in my city because it is so expensive.  The entire economy is tipping over into the east coast.  We will all benefit from having strong regional development, in particular in cities like Cork and Limerick because that is where investment and development will go, close to universities, cultural centres and so on.</p> <p>  I agree with Edgar Morgenroth that the real way to develop Cork and Limerick is to invest in them rather than necessarily putting all the money on the connection points between the two.  I have seen so many different international transport conferences over the years say the same thing.  It is by investing in the urban public realm, in particular in public transport infrastructure in the centre of existing historic cities that, increasingly, encourages international investment and other development to occur.</p> <p>  I agree with what you said, Chairman, about using existing assets.  The likes of a twin-track line from Limerick Junction to Colbert Station in Limerick would be perfect.  A railway station at Ballysimon is included in the first draft of the Limerick metropolitan area strategy.  At the moment, it is largely warehousing and industrial estates, but close to the centre could be reconvened in the same way we are going to do in Dublin.</p></speech>

For me, it is equally as important to link the cities.  We have Galway and Limerick linked by a motorway.  At this stage, Limerick and Cork are the only two major cities in Ireland not linked by a motorway.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that it is a wider question.  I wholeheartedly agree that Georgian Limerick is hugely important.  I spent my childhood going in and out of the Glentworth Hotel.  If we are serious about it, I cannot see how we can have proper, strategic balanced regional development unless we link Cork and Limerick.  I agree that we must provide rail links but there is a missing link between Cork and Limerick in terms of a motorway.  I agree that we need to enhance our rail connectivity from Limerick Junction to Limerick city.  That is where we differ.  In terms of getting from point A to point B at every level, I cannot see how we can have proper, balanced regional development without an M20 linking Cork and Limerick.</p></speech>

If we do not bring it back, we will lose it.  That would be seen as a terrible historic loss.  We have options and difficult choices.  We have &euro;20 billion worth of a road programme and approximately &euro;40 billion worth of public transport projects, so we are going to have to prioritise.

I do not see how we cannot do it if we are serious about encouraging people and having business thrive and being a counter-pole to Dublin.  There is an over-concentration in Dublin in population, infrastructure and everything else.  We need to have this motorway.  It is about a balanced model.  It is something I will take up again with the Minister.  I disagree with his estimate of &euro;2 billion.</p></speech>

This is interesting because it is the core of the debate.  One of the reasons Dublin has grown so much is because of the motorway network.  What it tends to do is bring everything back to the centre.  If we have a western corridor motorway from top to bottom, my fear for Limerick is that investment would head to Cork or to Galway.  In truth, that is happening.</p></speech>

It is not about Limerick competing with Cork or Galway; it is about providing the synergy to be a counter-pole to Dublin.  I respect the Minister's view but, equally, as a public representative for Limerick city, I fundamentally believe we must have rail and a motorway.  They are not mutually exclusive.  There is a process under way and the M20 is in the NDP.</p></speech>

Running the railway to Shannon Airport will cost, because we have to go through Cratloe and Sixmilebridge and it is expensive when one is building on new ground.  We have discussed putting a station in Corbally and Moyross and, to my mind, the 100 plus ha that one could develop around the railway station, close to Thomond Park and Limerick Institute of Technology would provide the transport-led development on which further development could be based.</p></speech>

We do need to look at review of the National Transport Authority, NTA, and TII.  I have always found the sort of inter-relationship between those organisations to be slightly strange.  TII is very efficient at delivering infrastructure and, to my mind, it should, therefore, get on with it in terms of the various roads programmes we have discussed but also, critically, the metro project.  As I stated, I believe it can have an increasing role on the active travel side, and that is something we are reviewing.  The NTA is more on the strategic planning side but it too has shown real ability, judging by what I have seen in respect of projects such as BusConnects in Dublin.  Its staffing levels were significantly increased in the recent budget to enable it to replicate that in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick.  As I stated to Senators Craughwell and Buttimer and other members, we need the NTA to help the local authorities in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford to deliver those projects.  The NTA is responsible for the big public transport projects, including transport planning in the metropolitan cities and the delivery of active travel.  BusConnects is one of its projects.  Irish Rail has a crucial role too.  For example, the link between Limerick Junction and Colbert Station, which we were discussing, will be the responsibility of Irish Rail, in conjunction with the NTA.</p></speech>

We could go further with electric vehicles but that would require incredible change in terms of purchasing habits.  It is being considered.  I recently had a meeting to examine that option but it is very challenging and ambitious.  Similarly, in the context of increased usage of biofuel, biodiesel has land use implications which bring real difficulties.  In the areas of freight and haulage, there is no obvious immediate alternative fuel to the diesel systems and so on that are currently being used.</p> <p>  The other difficulty with transport is that it takes time to effect change.  Land use patterns are set and that is why it is so important to get housing and transport integrated now so that we meet the 2050 target, whatever about the 2030 target.  In terms of meeting the 2050 target, we have looked at a variety of issues such as bringing down speed limits as a way of being more energy efficient.  I will be honest; the initial research relating to that measure has indicated it would be of limited benefit in terms of the emissions reductions it would deliver.</p> <p>  That brings me back to the core message, which is that it is about reducing the overall demand for travel.  What has happened during Covid may well help in that regard.  Even though commuting only accounts for a quarter of overall journeys, if there is a 30% reduction in commuting because people are working from home after Covid, that accounts for a good chunk and a real saving as well as providing a benefit to people's quality of life in terms of them not being stuck commuting.</p> <p>  It also comes back to being really ambitious on active travel and a switched modal shift.  I absolutely believe that is possible.  If we created a safe route network for schoolchildren to walk or cycle to school, that would reduce the 30% of morning rush hour traffic made up of children being driven to school.  If we really went at that issue, it would benefit everyone.  It would benefit parents as they would not be stuck in traffic and it would make kids healthier.  It would make for a far more pleasant local environment with much better air quality and significant health benefits.  My sense is that it is an issue that does not divide us.  There is broad cross-party support for the investment we are making in active travel, so-----</p></speech>

I had to attend a meeting of another committee.  I wish to return to the specific issue of post offices.  An interdepartmental group is to be established between the Minister's Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  On the issue of its remit, I know it is due to report in July.  Obviously, it will look at which services post offices can operate from a governmental point of view.  Beyond that, I refer to the Minister's earlier remarks regarding being supportive of the possibility of a community banking-type model and even looking at whether there is a requirement for a public service obligation levy or whatever from the point of view of producing a model that will deliver for post offices because post offices have delivered for us in the past.  As a result of the problems in banking-----</p></speech>

There was a press release in that regard which has informed the Deputy of our latest thinking on that issue.  I was not sure whether I could mention it earlier.  I agree with the Deputy there is a real issue.  There was an interim agreement between the post offices and An Post.  As  I mentioned, Turlough O'Donnell mediated a very good solution and there were interim payments associated with that to allow us through a transition period which is coming to a close.  However, we do not have the necessary business in place.  Covid has completely undermined footfall and business in a variety of ways.  We do not want the post office network to contract further, so the Government has today decided to make continuing support available and to set up the review group to which the Deputy referred in which various Departments will come together.  It is about looking at a variety of different services we could try to deliver.  That is not new.  It is something that has been talked about-----</p></speech>
