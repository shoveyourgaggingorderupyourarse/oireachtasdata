Before we begin, I remind members, witnesses and persons in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.  The purpose of today's meeting is to examine the weighing of fisheries products.  The committee will hear from representatives of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.</p> <p>  Since 28 February, the legal requirement of mask-wearing in all settings has been removed.  However, it is still good practice to continue to use a face masks or coverings, particularly in crowded areas.  The service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear face masks when moving around the campus and in close proximity to others.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means that witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses outside the proceedings held by the committee of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in the committee meeting when they participate from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurances in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of this when contributing.</p> <p>  The committee will hear from the following representatives from the SFPA: Mr. Paschal Hayes, executive chairperson; Ms Olive Loughnane, senior executive manager and director of transformation; and Dr. Miche&aacute;l O&rsquo;Mahony, senior executive manager and chief scientific adviser.  I welcome the witnesses and call on them to make their opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paschal Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022051800002#A00300"><p>We thank the committee for the invitation to appear today.  We welcome the interest in the SFPA and its work as the regulator for the sea-fisheries and seafood sectors.  We also welcome the opportunity to outline how we seek to ensure effective and fair regulation of the areas under the authority&rsquo;s mandate in order to support safe, authentic and sustainable seafood.  I am joined by my colleagues, Dr. O&rsquo;Mahony and Ms Loughnane.</p> <p>  By way of introduction, Ireland&rsquo;s seafood economy was worth an estimated &euro;1.26 billion in 2021, having experienced growth in GDP of 15.3% when compared with 2020, with Irish people consuming an average of 25 kg of seafood per year.  The sector supports over 16,000 livelihoods, predominantly in coastal communities along the Atlantic Ocean, the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea.</p> <p>  Effective regulation and oversight of the sea-fisheries and seafood sectors is essential to the achievement of our shared ambitions for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s seafood sector, as well as ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s shared marine resources are sustainable for future generations of fishermen and fisherwomen, coastal communities and Irish and international consumers.  The SFPA plays a key role in promoting compliance, verifying it and, where necessary, using the powers provided under legislation to enforce sea-fisheries and seafood safety laws for all areas under our remit.  This includes all fishing vessels operating within Ireland&rsquo;s 200-mile limit, almost 2,000 Irish registered fishing vessels - wherever they operate - and all seafood produced in Ireland&rsquo;s seafood processing companies.</p> <p>  We acknowledge that the focus of today&rsquo;s meeting is on the weighing of fishery products, however, fishery control is one of a number of functions performed by the SFPA.  The SFPA&rsquo;s work is broad and varied in scope.  It includes ensuring legal and sustainable sea fishing.  In food safety, it includes approving, registering, auditing and inspecting fish processing establishments, along with classification and monitoring of bivalve mollusc production areas.  In food trade, it involves certification of Irish seafood exports and verification of imports.  In data matters, the SFPA collates the State's formal record of fishing activity.</p> <p>  The SFPA employs staff in the major fishing ports around the coast and at our headquarters in Clonakilty, each of whom is committed to the mission of the SFPA and ensuring sustainable fish stocks for future generations of Irish fishers.  Their work to fulfil their duties as set out under Irish law can often be undertaken in challenging circumstances.  This is particularly the case for our staff based in the Killybegs port office in recent months.  We are proud of the work undertaken by each and every one of these SFPA employees.</p> <p>  Under Irish legislation, the legal onus is on the fishing industry to comply with national and EU sea-fisheries and seafood safety regulations.  The SFPA's systems are designed to provide regulatory oversight, with checks in place throughout the catching, storage, transport and processing stages.  Similar to our counterparts in other EU countries, the SFPA operates a risk-based control policy to maximise its effort in those areas of greatest risk of non-compliance or abuse.</p><p>There are in the region of 20,000 landings of pelagic and demersal fish by larger vessels in Ireland on an annual basis. The SFPA does not have the resources to be on every fishing deck, at every haul, nor every landing of every vessel.  This is what necessitates our risk-based control policy.  Pelagic fish is a term referring to shoaling migratory oily fish which swim in the middle of the water column, including mackerel, horse mackerel, herring and blue whiting.  Pelagic fish are stored on board fishing vessels in bulk tanks and pumped ashore in bulk quantities.  Demersal fish refers to bottom-dwelling whitefish with a habitat on the continental shelf seabed such as cod, hake, whiting or monkfish.  Demersal fish are typically sorted by species and gutted, iced and boxed on board.</p><p> Of the 20,000 landings annually by larger vessels, an estimated 600 are bulk pelagic landings, which is roughly 3% of total annual Irish landings.  Bulk pelagic fishing is highly industrialised and pursued by some of the largest vessels in Europe.  Bulk pelagic landings are large in terms of both fish quantity and monetary value, and can frequently exceed &euro;1 million for a single landing.  Pelagic landings involve commercial processes, the speed and automation of which adds to both control challenges and compliance risks.  Control-supervised weighing of a small proportion of pelagic landings is only one part of SFPA controls for pelagic fisheries and landings.  At-sea data monitoring, pre-landing checks and post-transport weighing controls in permitted plants are also used.  Records of these Houses in 2005 and 2006 will show that among the central reasons for the Oireachtas to establish the SFPA, through the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, were allegations of significant non-compliance in pelagic landings and the need for meaningful controls.</p><p> In this submission and in our contribution to this committee, we hope to emphasise the following points: the SFPA implements and regulates as provided by the Oireachtas and as required under Irish law; fish-weighing obligations exist for operators for the express purpose of ensuring the amount of fish landed is accurately assessed and to ensure sustainable fishing stocks for future generations; the SFPA does not catch, land, weigh or declare fish; the accurate weighing of fish is the legal responsibility of the operators, and not the SFPA; of the approximate 600 landings of bulk pelagic fish on an annual basis, 19 out of every 20 landings currently avail of a derogation in the interim fisheries control plan to weigh after transport at a processing facility; one out of every 20 bulk pelagic landings is subject to a supervised weighing upon landing; specific control focus on a small proportion of bulk pelagic landings is an explicit control requirement to manage the particular risks of such landings and is a significant part of what secures the overall derogation to enable post-transport weighing of all landings to Ireland; and, in the absence of an interim control plan that enables the weighing after transport, every landing into Ireland would be required to be weighed upon landing.</p><p> One of the requirements of EU legislation which the SFPA is bound to enforce by this Oireachtas is an obligation on operators to weigh wild caught fish on landing.  That EU legislation, as agreed by Ireland, has a default starting point of all such fish being weighed immediately at landing with no delegated authority to the SFPA to diverge from that.  For clarity, the default position under EU and Irish legislation is that all landings into Ireland should be weighed upon landing.  The potential for fish to be transported from the point of landing before weighing is set out as one of two potential derogations of Article 61 of Council Regulation EC No. 1224/09.  In both cases derogations can only be implemented if approved by the EU Commission.</p><p> In 2012, the SFPA secured EU Commission approval for a control plan under Article 61(1) of Council Regulation EC No. 1224/09 to facilitate a derogation for weighing in Ireland after transport from a place of landing in Ireland.  Such weighing could only occur in plants specifically permitted for that purpose.  The SFPA had a variety of different controls in place to manage compliance risks arising from this post-transport weighing regimen.  In the case of bulk pelagic weighing, there was an overt reliance on operators' weigh-belt systems with the SFPA control input both at landing and at post-transport weighing.</p><p> Subsequent to the introduction of the 2012 control plan, SFPA controls identified significant and ongoing non-compliance risks in post-transport weighing of bulk pelagic fish.  Several instances of weigh-unit manipulation resulted in temporary revocation of permits until necessary enhancements were made, including one subsequent conviction.  In no case of manipulation was there any particular deviation between the declarations of masters, purchasers or weighers and this point is worth repeating.  The SFPA responded to increased understanding of non-compliance risk by enhancing its control focus on landings and weighing, and strengthening the permit conditions, to include, for example, a CCTV feed to the SFPA.  Nevertheless, a clear sentiment existed of ready manipulability of such systems, with any such manipulation resulting in inaccurate declarations of the amount of fish landed and potentially fraudulent food marketing.  This puts at risk the reputation of Ireland&rsquo;s entire sea fisheries and seafood processing sector, the sustainability of Irish fishing stocks for future generations and the authenticity of Irish seafood consumed domestically and across the globe.</p><p> In 2014 and again in 2018, the Directorate General of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries at the European Commission, DG-MARE, conducted an audit of bulk pelagic control in Ireland.  The 2018 audit formed the view that the risk of non-compliance by bulk pelagic operators with their weighing obligations was unacceptably high.  That report also highlighted deficiencies in the control methods being implemented by the SFPA, finding that these were not sufficiently robust to ensure operators did not underdeclare their catches.  A subsequent administrative inquiry by the Commission was used to quantify the extent of the concerns.  The SFPA worked to address the various concerns through enhanced controls.  A particular focus of DG-MARE was the perspective that, as part of the overall control regimen allowing most landings to be weighed after transport, there must be some instances of control authority-instigated pre-transport weighing.  The SFPA incorporated such events into its pelagic controls from 2020 under the previous control plan.  In response, industry used a pier-side device that would actively dewater and then weigh those dewatered fish, before reuniting fish with their original water.  Irish courts found no reason in law to prevent the SFPA from approving such a device for weighing and it was used for weighing pelagic landings during 2021.</p><p> In April 2021, DG-MARE revoked the Irish control plan as a result of significant and ongoing concerns regarding inaccurate weighing of catches, particularly by operators landing bulk pelagic catches to Ireland.  Accordingly, all landings to Ireland, which previously would have been weighed at an Irish establishment in accordance with the plan, were then legally required to be weighed at landing.  At a hearing with this Oireachtas committee on 11 May 2021, members were clear in relaying and endorsing concerns voiced throughout the industry about the impracticality of this.  In the case of demersal fish landed in standardised boxes, the Irish sampling plan remained in place to reduce the impact.  In September 2021, a control plan for pelagic and demersal catches was submitted by the SFPA followed by ongoing dialogue with DG-MARE.  During this dialogue ,it became clear that the EU Commission approval would only be achieved with the inclusion of pre-transport control-supervised weighing, performed on a non-industry-owned, non-industry-operated device, such as a weighbridge.</p><p>The SFPA accepted such a control plan on an interim basis from January to April 2022 in the interest of facilitating post-transport weighing.<br/><br/>Under this interim control plan, the SFPA had multiple obligations, including the assessment of processing plants&rsquo; compliance with weighing conditions as set out in the interim control plan and issuing of permits to allow the invoking of the provisions of the plan to apply.  In simple terms, the SFPA had to develop the control infrastructure reversing the paradigm shift that had occurred in April 2021 towards pier-side landing to, in January 2022, developing controls on post-transport weighing.<br/><br/>As the very premise of an Article 61(1) regimen under a control plan is one of overt reliance on the vast majority of fish being weighed after transport, the SFPA controls needed to shift back to weighing upon landing pier-side.  Additionally, the interim control plan had explicit obligation for pre-transport controls as part of an overall control of post-transport weighing.  One of the explicit stipulations which arose from dialogue with the EU Commission was that pre-transport control-supervised weighing should take place for bulk pelagic landings on non-industry-owned, non-industry-operated weighing systems.  Key representatives of the Irish pelagic industry were informed of the inclusion of this new stipulation in late 2021.  The expected frequency of controlled weighing upon landing was linked to Article 107 of Regulation No. 404/2011, meaning that 5% of bulk pelagic landings, or 7.5% of fish quantity, would be subject to control-supervised weighing.  Under this regimen, therefore, 19 out of every 20 landings could be weighed after transport at a permitted facility.<br/><br/>During the period from the opening of the season in February until the beginning of March, the SFPA accepted weighing on an industry-owned pier-side device.  It subsequently became clear that the use of this industry-owned pier-side device did not fulfil the requirements of the interim control plan, which stipulated that weighing must be conducted on a device under non-industry ownership.  It is clear that operation of the interim control plan without fully insisting on the strict terms as set in the EU-approved control plan is regrettable and detracted from overall implementation.  At this stage we are of the view that the significant amount of work done by the SFPA in early 2022 to implement the interim control plan should have moved more quickly to implement this stipulation.<br/><br/>From early March 2021, the SFPA moved to ensure that control-supervised pre-transport weighing events met all the terms of the interim control plan for those approximately 5% of bulk pelagic landings.  In the absence of an alternative, this meant the weighing of bulk tankers of fish with transport water on a State-owned weighbridge.  To meet the requirements of the interim control plan, operators may select one of two options for conducting weighing before transport at Killybegs Harbour.  Under the first method, fish exiting the vessel are discharged into an industry-owned pier-side system which momentarily separates the fish from the water.  The fish are immediately placed directly into a tanker that has been pre-filled with water and pre-weighed.  The tanker containing the fish and the water is then reweighed on the SFPA-approved weighbridge and an accurate weight for the fish is obtained.  <br/><br/>Under the second method, the fish and water exiting the vessel are discharged directly into a pre-weighed empty tanker.  The tanker containing the fish and the water is then reweighed on the SFPA-approved weighbridge.  The fish remain with their original water which operators seek to minimise in order to balance quality considerations with concerns about the accuracy of the weight of the fish. <br/><br/>In both options, the pre-transport weight, that is, the weight on the weighbridge, must be used in all statutory declarations, including the landing declaration by the master, the sales note by the purchaser and the transport document of the transporter.  Under neither option is there any requirement for the fish to be dried before, during or after control-supervised weighing.<br/><br/>It is with genuine concern that the SFPA became aware of a sustained campaign of disinformation and misinformation suggesting the SFPA was not adhering to provisions of the Northern Ireland protocol following the UK departure from the EU.  The SFPA confirms there has been no change in the fish weighing on landing arrangements between the Republic of Ireland and other jurisdictions as a result of Brexit.  Under the EU regulations, which the SFPA is bound to implement by this Oireachtas, landings to Northern Ireland could never have been weighed in Killybegs under the terms of an Irish control plan.  That derogation is only applicable to post-transport weighing of fishery products when weighed within the member state of landing.  The only way in which fishery products might be weighed in Killybegs following a landing to Northern Ireland would be through a common control programme between UK and Ireland approved by the EU Commission.  It is important to reiterate that no such common control programme has ever existed, either before or after Brexit<b>.  </b>Therefore, landings to Northern Ireland are treated similarly to landings in any EU state with which Ireland does not have a common control programme.  <br/><br/>Irish operators may choose to purchase fish landed to a jurisdiction with which Ireland does not share an approved common control programme, such as Northern Ireland.  In such cases, the weighing must have taken place in the landing jurisdiction, either through the default of immediately at landing or perhaps at a permitted post-transport establishment in that landing territory if a control plan exists there.  Crucially, however, the weight of the fish upon landing in another jurisdiction must be the weight declared by all parties.  Declaration of a weight after transport at a processing facility in the jurisdiction of Ireland is not permitted.<br/><br/>Permitting establishments to weigh after transport at a processing facility following a landing in the Republic of Ireland is a significant exemption available under the interim fisheries control plan to operators who have the systems to apply such a permit appropriately.  The SFPA will not accept the misuse of the weigh after transport system, which has the potential to jeopardise the EU Commission-approved exemption for the entire fishing and seafood processing sector.  If this exemption is revoked, all landings of pelagic and demersal fish across Ireland could be required to be weighed pier-side.  <br/><br/>The interim control plan agreed in December 2021 had a prescribed applicability from 1 January 2022 until 30 April 2022.  On foot of a proposal by the Directorate General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, DG MARE, in March 2022, the SFPA applied for an extension of approval of the interim control plan until 31 December 2022.  It is a positive development that this was approved by the Commission in late April and the control plan was adopted by the SFPA to extend previously issued weigh permits for several months.  The SFPA anticipates further dialogue with the Commission with a view to having an Irish control plan on a permanent footing by the end of 2022.<br/><br/>I emphasise again that the role of the SFPA is to regulate the sea-fisheries and seafood sectors to ensure compliance with Irish and EU laws and so that we can ensure sustainable fishing stocks for future generations.  We encourage committee members to see the broader merit of the work being undertaken by the SFPA to ensure fish are weighed completely and accurately with minimal overall impact on quality.  In the absence of approval from the European Commission of an interim or full fisheries control plan, there is no exemption to weigh fish after transport at an approved facility and so all landings, pelagic and demersal, would be subjected to weighing upon landing.As the industry and this committee experienced last year, the ramifications of no control plan are experienced right across the seafood sector and in coastal communities around Ireland.<br/><br/>Control is what the SFPA provides.  Declaring fewer fish than are actually caught is a real and ongoing risk that threatens the sustainability of fishing stocks for future generations and the authenticity of Irish seafood.</p><p>Responsibility for compliance with the regulations lies with the industry, which has a legal onus to comply.  Our role is to oversee compliance.  For those involved in bulk pelagic fishing, the control plan enables 19 out of every 20 landings to be weighed after transport.  The control-supervised weighing of one out of every 20 landings of bulk pelagic fish should be viewed in the context of the very real alternative of 100% of landings needing to be weighed at the pier.  We ask the members of the committee to consider carefully the array of potential motivations of operators choosing to decry the need to weigh one out of every 20 landings outside of systems-----</p></speech>

If the Chair does not mind, I will read that sentence.  Mr. Hayes said: "We ask the members of the committee to consider carefully the array of potential motivations of operators choosing to decry the need to weigh...".  What does the phrase "the array of potential motivations" mean?  Is this questioning the motivation or the character of people outside this House?  This is a serious matter and we must clarify it.</p></speech>

Committee members are no doubt aware that weighing provisions are among the considerations of an ongoing revision of the EU fishery control regulation.

I also welcome, behind us here, Mr. Patrick Murphy from the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, ISWFPO, and Mr. Cormac Burke from the Irish Fish and Seafood Alliance, IFSA.  They have worked hard to try to make the lives of fishermen a little easier in what are extremely difficult times.  I hope this will be the first of many meetings we will have with the SFPA and perhaps with other organisations.  A massive gap needs to be bridged between the man or woman on the ground and the SFPA.  This is obvious to the whole country and perhaps the whole world.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Hayes and his colleagues.  I also welcome this opportunity to ask some questions regarding Mr. Hayes's appointment and the policy changes that appear to be on the way in the authority since his appointment and since he began to discharge his duties in his new role as chair and sole director of the critically important SFPA.  This occurred in circumstances where the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 stipulates that there should be three such directors.  Many of my colleagues will join me in congratulating Mr. Hayes personally and wishing him and the SFPA every success in discharging such a critical role.  It is undertaking this role in circumstances in which the future sustainability of the important resource we have in the seas surrounding our small island nation must surely be achieved in conjunction with ensuring the viability, sustainability and socio-economic health of our widely scattered and often remote and island-based coastal communities.  The people most intimately connected with the living resources of our seas must be entitled to derive the greatest economic benefit from these resources.</p> <p>  I have 15 minutes and my colleagues also need a chance to contribute, so many of my questions require a simple yes-no response, while other questions require answers lasting no more than a minute.  I would appreciate if Mr. Hayes would stick to that time because I have many questions.  When a senior position is filled in the SFPA, the announcement is made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine.  Was this the case with Mr. Hayes&rsquo;s appointment?  This question requires only a yes-no answer.</p></speech>

The SFPA has consistently stated that it wishes to work with the organisations.  I could be wrong here and perhaps it has a great relationship with all the representative organisations.

Throughout the Killybegs blue whiting controversy, the SFPA has publicly insisted that it has continually offered the option to the vessels landing that they could use the pelagic flow scales.  This, however, was done without specifying that the SFPA was ordering that this state-of-the-art system, which was declared suitable by the High Court as being fit for purpose, must have the element of water removed from the system, thereby ensuring this option was just a different method of dewatering or dry-landing the fish.  This would make those fish of no use for processing for human consumption.  Will Mr. Hayes share his thoughts in this regard?</p></speech>

The obligation is to control and supervise one landing out of 20 to enable the other 19 to be brought to the factories and weighed or weighed on the pier-side weighing device, which is owned by the industry.  Therefore, there is an option to weigh the 19 out of 20 in the factories or on the pier-side weighing device.</p> <p>  On the one in 20 whose weighing we need to supervise, there are currently two options open to a master landing in Killybegs.  One is to pump the fish from the vessel into the pier-side weighing machine and then place them in a tanker that has been pre-filled with water and weighed on the weighbridge.  Following the placement of the fish in the tanker, the tanker is brought back to the weighbridge and weighed again.  One weight is subtracted from the other and the result is the weight of the fish in the tanker.  The second option open to the master or operator is to discharge into an empty tanker that is the pre-weighed.  The fish are pumped into it with the water they were originally in.  It is up to the operator to take off as much water as deemed possible without interfering with the quality of the fish.  The weight is then determined on the weighbridge, and that is recorded as the official weight of the fish.</p></speech>

The SFPA is the regulator and implements the regulations.  The regulations come to us from the legislators, including the Houses of the Oireachtas, and we implement them.  As Mr. Hayes said, the default position, the starting point or the baseline of the regulations is such that the fish are weighed immediately on landing.  There are potential derogations whereby weighing can take place after landing but authority in this regard is not delegated to the SFPA or any authority in any member state; it requires approval by the European Commission.</p></speech>

For example, it manages the risk of fish being put over the weighbridge without the flow belt even being turned on.  It manages the risk if we can see the flow belt moving and the clock clocking up.  However, there are risks that the tool does not manage, such as that of the flow belt under-weighing, whereby a kilogram does not come up as a kilogram.  The tool affords some assurances but, as with all controls tools, it does not provide assurance in the order of 100%.  The tools help but are not in themselves a 100% solution.</p></speech>

I respect the officials' point about straying into individual issues but there are many individuals who lost their jobs and did not have employment as a result of the decisions that are being taken.  Many companies are in serious jeopardy, have big loans and are wondering, because of the reputational damage that has happened.  What are the procedures for the SFPA?

The Northern Ireland authorities have roles as the port state.  The flag state, that is, the state that has given the fishing vessel licence to kill those fish, has roles.  There was a flag state here and a port state here, that was Northern Ireland.  We have roles in our jurisdiction for being responsible for controlling the first purchaser of those fish.  We carry out checks of the data provided to us by the first purchaser.  I will not speak to individual scenarios but it is likely that in the event of the transporter being present in Ireland, then we have a role as the member state responsible for controlling the transporter.  So both the transporter and the first purchaser are obliged to make declarations to us.  We assess those declarations to assess whether the fish have been weighed in accordance with the weigh regulations and to assess their declarations, which are obliged to be the same as the weigh records.  We have to assess the accuracy of the declarations in both of those instances.  We make checks to ensure the accuracy to the best of our ability from the data available to us.

In his opening statement, Mr. Hayes mentioned that the High Court has deemed the industry weighing system as operational or as fine.  Is it the case that the lack of ability to use it as a mechanism to weigh blue whiting and other fish is because it is industry-owned?  Is that the core of the issue?</p></speech>

That weighing device has been permitted and is available for use for the 95%, that is, 19 out of every 20 landings that come into Killybegs if the operator chooses to use it.</p></speech>

My understanding of what happened there was that there was a lot of interaction with the industry on the lead up to the control plan being agreed last December.</p><p>On 9 December, in the lead up to the control plan being agreed last December, there was a meeting between the industry and the SFPA where it was pointed out that one of the conditions that the Commission was insisting on was that the weighing device would be non-industry owned and non-industry operated.  On 4 February, there was a further meeting with the catching side of the industry where options for the ownership model of the weighing device were discussion.  On 11 February, there was a follow-up meeting, from the catching side of the industry, with a lease proposal in terms of leasing the machine.  On 21 February, there was a further meeting with the processing side of the sector where they informed the SFPA that the catching side of the sector had no authority to enter into any lease arrangement, and that any such offer was withdrawn.</p></speech>

First, I understand that the European Commission stated that Ireland was the most compliant State in all of the EU in terms of regulation.  Second, Ireland has a level of oversight that is unprecedented anywhere else in the EU.  Mr. Hayes does not know if that is true but I believe it to be the case.  I have outlined the level of oversight to which the industry is subjected yet we face the following debacle.  The SFPA is in negotiations with the industry on the pier side flow-scale system and if these negotiations or agreements break down, then the matter goes to the High Court.  On 4 June 2021, Mr. Justice Garrett Simons in the High Court ruled:</p> <blockquote> 	The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority has acted <i>ultra vires</i>by continuing to withhold approval for the pier-side weighing facility at Killybegs Port by reference to the &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; concerns raised by the European Commission. There is no legal basis for these concerns and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority has not sought to argue otherwise. </blockquote> <p>It is almost a year since the ruling was made.  That was surely an instruction at that time for the SFPA to regularise the situation and ensure the calibration, and certification, of said weighing system.  Does Mr. Hayes accept that the failure of the SFPA to do that has created the difficulties in which we find ourselves? </p></speech>

Would they agree it is peculiar the European Commission had not articulated any issue with an industry-owned system, but suddenly it had an issue?  Is it peculiar to it the witnesses that the Commission had an issue after the High Court decision?  The correspondence from the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, to the European Commission assures it that it is not industry-owned, but it did not raise concerns prior to this High Court case.  Is that peculiar to the witnesses?  Where did this come from?  This requirement for a weighing system that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority negotiated does not exist in any other member state of the European Union.  Is it not peculiar that the concerns of the European Commission suddenly align themselves with the authority's concerns?</p></speech>

My understanding is the witnesses' objection is that this weighing system is owned by the industry.  It went to court and the judge made a clear decision that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, is acting <i>ultra vires</i>in how it is dealing with this.  Suddenly, the European Commission started to share the authority's concerns.  It has been said publicly in many forums that the industry wants this to be taken away from its control and it is happy for it to be controlled independently.  I think we would all want that.  Why was that not addressed?  Why is there another barrier to resolving the problems at Killybegs?  Why was that not implemented?  It is a damning decision by the judge against the SFPA acting <i>ultra vires</i>, which is very serious.  The SFPA has not sought to regularise it, take control of the weighing system, and demonstrate clearly to all concerned parties that it is an independent system.  It could demonstrate it is the best regulator in Europe and good at its job, so there is nothing for the European Commission to worry about.  It could have CCTV cameras and unannounced inspections, with a level of oversight that is unprecedented in any other industry in Ireland or throughout Europe.  That is the level of oversight it has obtained and all it needs to do is to make sure the weighing system is outside the control of the industry.  Why did it not resolve those issues rather than having more barriers appear?</p></speech>

He said the industry wants the chance for ownership of the pier-side weighing device.  That is not how we left it with the industry.  As I said at the meeting on 21 February, the owners of the machines said they were not prepared to enter into a lease arrangement.  We have not heard anything different in the meantime.  The Deputy read out the judgment from the High Court case.  It was not the court's view that the SFPA or any other State body should take ownership of the pier-side weighing device.  It was the court's view that we were acting <i>ultra vires</i>by not permitting the pier-side weighing device.  It was subsequently permitted and we were in full compliance with the judgment of the court.</p></speech>

It has grave concerns about how this has been handled and the lack of consultation with it.  It asks, if the ownership of the flow scales on the pier in Killybegs is transferred to systems not operated or owned by the industry, whether the SFPA can meet the requirements of the interim control plan.  In all my talks and discussions with the industry, as is my responsibility as a Deputy for Donegal and Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on fisheries, it has been made clear to me that it does not want to have ownership of this weighing system.  It wants a solution.  I will put this to Mr. Hayes and Dr. O'Mahony.  What industry in this country would allow round-the-clock CCTV monitoring of its workers and operation by a regulator?  It is agreeing to and has accepted that level of oversight.  This is not an industry that is resisting co-operation.  It allows a level of oversight that is unprecedented in the European Union.  It is saying to take possession of the weighing system and the pier since it does not need to be industry-owned.  Will that finally address any concerns about oversight?</p> <p>  I have no tolerance for illegal fishing or for an unsustainable approach to our fisheries.  It is a precious resource and I think the SFPA does an important job.  I think it does it well and so does the European Union.  I understand that the compliance level in Ireland is 98%.  We are not a rogue state or the Wild West.  We are compliant with regulations and the SFPA does its job well.  Can we come to a point where we solve the issue in Killybegs and address the concerns of the European Commission in a sensible way?  The SFPA has an incredible level of oversight in Killybegs, which the industry accepts and was needed to deal with the concerns about illegal practices that may have taken place in the past.  In 2022, the SFPA's level of oversight in Killybegs is incredible.  Why can it not take possession or find some way for those scales to go into independent possession to address everybody's concerns?  Will the witnesses get to the crux of that issue?</p></speech>

They were followed up at a meeting on 21 February with a certain position that the owners of the scales were not prepared to transfer them and the people who suggested that they be leased or transferred did not have the authority to do so.

It is important because while there will always be friction between the industry that is regulated and the regulator, we need to work together to find solutions that benefit everyone, that benefit Ireland Inc., and that benefit coastal communities around the country.  The Deputy spoke about transfer of ownership.  Following up from that February meeting, at a subsequent meeting with the consultative committee, we invited it to make a proposal about ownership.  We are still waiting for that proposal.</p></speech>

In no case of manipulation was there any particular deviation between the declarations of masters, purchasers or weighers. </blockquote> <p>Is it not the case that the weight of what was landed would be based on what was weighed at the factory in that case?</p><p>Is that not calling into question people who should not be called into question?</p></speech>

On the 5% of bulk pelagic landings or 7.5% of fish quantity that is required to be weighed - I presume it is 5% of landings - if that 5% has been reached, is that the end of SFPA inspections?

On weighing scales on the pier, the representatives stated they had heard nothing back from the industry on offering ownership of that and so on.  Does the SFPA take a view on who the owners should be?  If the industry came back and said it wanted Joe Bloggs to operate this machine, will the SFPA accept Joe Bloggs will do it or does it say he is too close to the industry?  If he is based in Killybegs, is that a problem?  Should he be based in Donegal town, Dunglow or Galway?  What are the requirements for the person who would be the operator of the scales?</p></speech>

It makes a big difference to the crews as regards wages because blue whiting for human consumption is of significantly greater value when it goes to the factories.  The view of the fishing industry is that weighing a full vessel of blue whiting does not prevent it going for human consumption.  The SFPA may argue it does or does not; that is a moot point.  The way it works at present is it goes for fishmeal, which has a major impact on the incomes of the crew of the boat and on the workers in the factories in respect of whether there is work available or not.  There is something wrong with the way blue whiting is worked.  Is it the view of the representatives that blue whiting will work through the scales on the pier?  If that is not possible, why not?  Could the 5% be checked on every vessel rather than picking one vessel out of 20 on which to do that check? </p></speech>

Our view is that one of the options available in Killybegs at present would very accurately weigh the fish without affecting the quality.</p><p> We have regular interactions with the industry.  One such interaction related to one part of the industry that was willing to use the pierside device in the context of the first option, as I outlined in my opening statement, namely, pumping the fish into the pierside weighing device, putting the fish into a pre-weighed, pre-watered tanker, bringing it to the weighbridge, weighing it again and subtracting one figure from the other, which will show the weight of the fish.  The man in question wanted to put two stipulations on that.  First, he wanted to switch on the weighing facility on the pierside device, which I agreed to on the basis that the official weight would be the one obtained on the weighbridge.  The other would certainly be a good reference but could not be used as the official weight.  Second, he wanted to photograph the fish to see whether there was any damage to it.  The agreement was that would be done.  I do not know why it was never done, but it is a pity it was not because it would have given us much more information about how that scales would operate and whether the fish would be damaged.  Furthermore, if there were damage as shown by the photographs, it would show what modifications could made to the scales to minimise or eliminate that damage.  Perhaps Mr. O'Mahony will talk about preserving the quality of the fish.</p></speech>

The regulation is worded such that 5% of landings, plural, means we have to conduct these types of controls on all of some of the landings.  It is not sufficient to do it on some of all the landings.  The control panel refers directly to inspections according to Article 107 being done in this way.  Because it pivots back to Article 107, the answer to the Deputy's question, in the context of the regulations that the Legislature, including the Oireachtas, has given to us to implement, is "No".</p></speech>

Several members of the committee attended both of our most recent appearances before the committee, which we were happy to make, in 2021, when there was no control plan in place.  Under no circumstances has the SFPA ever disputed the view that there could be a negative impact on quality arising from weighing.  We have never gone there and that is manifest in our pursuit of, initially, the 2012 control plan and then the 2021 interim control plan.  We went after those plans to address potential quality concerns.  We see the benefit of allowing weighing to take place after transport.</p> <p>  I might approach the Deputy's question in two ways, namely, in the context of both the numerical concept and the practicality thereof.  Numerically, we have a requirement to weigh 5% of 600 landings in a certain way, and that 5% figure is what is in contention here.  We genuinely accept that there is a significant challenge in meeting the weighing accuracy and the quality and maintenance obligations of fishermen when they are conducting those 5% weighings.  We do not deny that.  As Mr. Hayes pointed out, we have offered the option that we believe best manages those weighings and it has not been taken up.  We point out the context of any detrimental impact on quality in the overall context of 100% of landings and the alternative to 100% of landings.  Five per cent of 600 landings is a much smaller figure than 100% of 40,000 landings.</p></speech>

I am trying to get a deeper understanding of the culture and the dynamics that exist between fishing communities and our guests' good selves in the SFPA.  What I have seen so far, and I think they would objectively agree, is that a tension exists, and I use the word "tension" advisedly.  I need to have a better understanding of the governance arrangements and the statutory functions of the SFPA in respect of its relationship with, in the first instance, the community as represented by fishers and processors, and also in regard to this consultative committee.</p> <p>  My understanding is that Mr. Hayes is the executive chairperson.

That is a reasonable expectation.  In the case of pelagic fish, we are obliged to weigh 5% in a certain way before transport so it is a completely different paradigm for that landing.  The notice to weigh says that your landing has been selected as one of that 5%.  This means that even though you had expected to be weighing up the road, you are weighing right here right now today.  The important part of it is the weight before transport, which is the weight that counts for the declarations that Deputy Pringle referred to earlier.</p></speech>

At that meeting, a number of things were discussed.  Following that meeting, the industry was given three options to weigh on landing at Killybegs.  One of them included use of the pier-side weighing device for the controlled landing.  However, and this is why it is not a yes-no answer, the ownership model of the pier-side weighing device was also discussed at the same meeting.  The three options were given on the basis that the ownership model would be addressed going forward.  What happened after that was the ownership model was not addressed going forward.  We found ourselves in a position where we were non-compliant with the control plan and on 6 March we withdrew the option to use the pier-side weighing device for the 5% of weighing.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that there was confusion.

I outlined this for Deputy Mac Lochlainn earlier.  There was a subsequent meeting on 11 February when a lease proposal was put forward by the sector.  The owners of the machine attended a meeting on 21 February and said that this was not going to happen and that there was not going to be a lease agreement.  In other words, the transfer model was not going to change at that stage.  From 21 February to 6 March, we were looking at what we could do in those circumstances.  The option that was not compliant with the control plan was withdrawn on 6 March.</p></speech>

That is built into the thinking of all of us who have an interest in the sustainability of the industry, including processors, fishers and those with other vantage points.  I am trying to understand the dynamics in respect of the consultative committee.  I understand Mr. Hayes attended the meeting on 4 March.  Would there have been an opportunity at that meeting to further discuss the issues around the notice to weigh on landing?  I do not have a masters degree in fisheries policy, and I am not being facetious when I say that.  Many of us are on a steep learning curve.  If there is a consultative committee, you would hope the culture of that committee would be such that you would all move together in lockstep and the consultative committee would be the mechanism through which you would work through or triage all of these issues.  The perception I have is that the industry feels it is on the back foot now.  This is the perception, rightly or wrongly.  It feels it is being put upon.  As a layman in this respect, I fail to understand why the industry would have ownership of a device that is the subject of a regulatory process.  I ask Mr. Hayes to forgive me if it is a stupid question, but I am not afraid to ask a stupid question.  Why would it be the industry?  If you are regulating the industry, why would the industry own the device or the machine?</p><p>Mr. Hayes outlined options for us.  I am still trying to understand fully the differences between options 1 and 2.  I have been doing some searching and made some notes.  Is there are a danger on option 1 that you are asking an operator to make a false declaration of their landings?  Water will potentially be recorded as fish and not as water.  I am operating from the notes I was jotting down and I could be wrong.  I ask Mr. Hayes to forgive me if I am way off the mark.  On option 2, it seems to me - again, I could be wrong so he can disavow me of my ignorance if necessary - that the operator can drain as much water from the fish he or she chooses but only 2% of the final weight can get recorded as water.  Am I understanding that correctly?  Does this not run contrary to the whole issue of sustainability and preserving the fish?  If only 2% of the final weight can be recorded as water, what permutation does that have for the quality of the fish <i>in situ </i>while the fish are going through this process?  We are in Kafkaesque territory if we have reached a point on this lovely island of ours where we are talking about such options.  I really want to understand option 2, in particular.  I am worried that under option 2, the quality of the fish could become severely diminished.  The sustainability question then comes in.  The quality question also comes in, as does the value question that we are all concerned about.  Mr. Hayes does not have to tell me I am ignorant if it is an ignorant question, but he can educate me.  I am happy to be educated.</p></speech>

I think he left himself out of that.  Legislators have a big role in sustainability.  As a regulator, the SFPA does the bidding of the legislators.  Legislators have a huge role in regard to sustainability going forward.</p> <p>  I will turn to the options that are available.  The Deputy is dead right when he says that there is 2% allowed for water but in fact that means the water gets weighed as fish.  That is not the ideal situation.  It is up to the operator to let as much water as he feels he can out of that tank.  He dewaters to the extent that he feels is possible without affecting the quality of the fish.  We would say that is the least favourable option but it is an option that is available to the operator if he wishes.  We would say that option 1 is preferable.</p></speech>

Let us say half the truck is filled with chilled water, the truck is brought across the weighbridge and a weight is recorded.  The truck then backs up to the pier-side device, the fish are added to the tanker and the tanker drives off to the weighbridge where it is weighed again.  One weight is then deducted from the other, giving a very accurate weight of the fish.</p></speech>

No, this is not surreal.  It is not rocket science; it is about weighing fish and figuring out how much fish are landed.  It should not be rocket science.  The fact that we are having a discussion about it is not surreal.  This is the backbone of fishery control.  The whole point of giving a quantitative, capped amount of fish that fishermen can catch is that it needs a backbone.  This is about giving that backbone.  There is nothing surreal about that.</p> <p>  I am not sure where the confusion is in option 1, but it is option 1 because it is our recommended option.  We believe it will give a very accurate weight and absolute control over quality.  There is no limit to the amount of water one could have.  The big issue with option 1 is that the water is weighed and is in the tanker before the fish arrive in the tanker.  Let us say there are 10 tonnes of water in the tanker.  The tanker then comes to the pier-side device, which has been built as a weighing system.  It has active de-watering, by which I mean the fish are tumbled between conveyor belts and a huge fan blows the water off them.  The conveyer belt has a grid on it so the water can fall through it.  Essentially, the fish will be without water for the few seconds that they are going over the conveyer belt.  The fish then go into the pre-charged tanker.  The only addition to the tanker from its first weighing is fish.  That tanker goes over the weighbridge, the first weight is subtracted and a further 2% is taken off that figure to account for any residual water that might be in the gills of the fish, or anything like that.  That gives an accurate weight of fish.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if we are creating an onus.  The answer is "No".  The first tanker comes pre-charged and the second tanker can get its water from the water that was with the first tanker&rsquo;s fish.  It can be diverted one way and then the other.</p> <p>  The other question was whether we are creating an onus on the vessels.  No, the vessels have their refrigerated sea water and refrigerated systems.  They have refrigerated sea water.</p> <p>  We need to contextualise this.  This is 5% and it is a way of unlocking almost 100% weighing at the factory.  That is what we are getting to here.</p></speech>

We should keep in mind that, throughout the period, Killybegs kept going and there were always many landings into the harbour.  There are 20,000 landings from large vessels in the country every year, and if smaller vessels are counted, there are 40,000 landings.  There are still landings of whitefish into Greencastle and crab into Rathmullen, for example.  In Deputy Michael Collins's area, potters land crab and lobster into Schull.  All along the coast, landings continue.  One important issue we did not touch on in the previous session is that if this control plan is lost, we will be back to the situation we faced last year between April and December, whereby every fish on the quayside will have to be weighed.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that at least one of the suggestions that came forward from the sector in regard to trialling the first option, as I outlined, which relates to using the pier-side weighing device, recording the weights on the device if desired and photographing it, was a useful option from the point of view of the sector and from our point of view in order that we could see exactly what was happening.  I would certainly be interested in reviving that.</p> <p>  At a meeting on 16 March, we asked the sector to come forward with any proposals and no proposals have yet arisen from that.  We are not sure at this stage whether, as some committee members suggested, there is a willingness to transfer the ownership.  If that is the case, to whom will it transfer and will it be adequate to meet the conditions of the control plan?  There are areas we can explore, but if there were an easy solution to this, we would have found it.</p></speech>

As I mentioned in my opening statement, the Commission is dealing with a new control regulation.  It is in trilogues so its resources are tied up in that.

As Deputy Pringle noted, there is a bit of time to resolve this if there is to be any hope for the future of many fishermen.  There are talks about transfer of ownership.  The SFPA is waiting for the sector to come back to it about that and it is a possibility.  Mr. Hayes said that if there is a solution, the SFPA would have found it.  To me, though, making fishmeal out of fish is not an easy solution.  It is no solution at all and a disastrous situation that all concerned find themselves in.  I hope we will have regular meetings here over the next few months to see how we can find a solution.</p> <p>  A fisherman rang me today.  Fishermen are talking about tie-up schemes and decommissioning.  They want to get out.  Is that what the Department, the Government or the country wants?  I certainly do not see that because there is massive potential in the waters south-west of where I live and throughout our country.  It is sad that fishing is almost at an end.  For some reason, we seem to be continuously destroying this industry.  Regardless of whoever is driving the rules, be it the Government or the SFPA, they do not seem to be the same as the rules that apply throughout Europe.  We find ourselves in a dire situation and a solution needs to be found before we face wipe-out.  On our part, we will try to make sure every option is afforded.  I sincerely hope the Minister and Department will do the same.  I ask the SFPA to find a solution and work with the sector to make sure the solution suits everybody.</p> <p>  Fishermen ask me when decommissioning will start.  It is sad to think they cannot get a straight answer.  It is unfortunate they are looking for decommissioning as a way out but that is what they are facing.  I presume Mr. Hayes has no answer on when decommissioning will start.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022051800002#P01200"><p>Yes.</p></speech>

The ridiculous situation that pertained in Union Hall last summer where fish had to be weighed on the quayside and then brought 500 m to the factory up the road will not happen this year because the control plan stays in place.  Regarding the dire situation, I will point out that Killybegs continued to operate through this period and there were many landings in Killybegs throughout the pelagic season this year.  I can give the Deputy statistics about them if he wishes.</p> <p>  Regarding fishmeal, the Deputy is right to point out that a lot more blue whiting has gone for human consumption this year and last year.  In years past, the bulk of blue whiting used to go for fishmeal.  It is welcome to see value being added to this fish and that it is going for human consumption rather than fishmeal.  With regard to landings of blue whiting, the catch of 19 out of 20 vessels that land there goes straight to the factory for weighing so the Deputy must take this into account when he describes the situation as dire.  The catch of only one out of 20 vessels has to be supervised and weighed on the pier side.  What the sector has chosen to do in respect of blue whiting since the requirement came in and the two options became available was divert all the landings that we declared controlled landings into fishmeal.  It has taken that option rather than using either of the two options for pier side weighing and having this fish used for human consumption.  I hope we can avoid this situation going forward because the more of this fish that is used for human consumption, the better.  Deputy Pringle referred to the extra value to the fishermen if it goes into human consumption.  I agree with that.  It is much better to see it going for human consumption than for fishmeal.  Decommissioning is a question for the Minister.  It is not something we would comment on given the role of the SFPA.</p></speech>

There is no control plan with the North of Ireland or Great Britain but very substantial numbers of landings have come through the North over the years.  My understanding is that since 1983, there have been around 5,000 per annum.  The SFPA has been in existence since 2006.  How many licences for permits for weighing landings that came through the North has it removed during this period?</p></speech>

They were not minded to be weighing in Ireland but we made it very clear they need to weigh in Ireland.  We enforced weighing in Ireland on those landings for the same reason, which is that there was no common control programme in place.  It is a reciprocal answer to the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I hope it does because we should not be here today.  It is terrible we all must be here today.</p> <p>  The final area I want to probe is risk analysis and what is available to the authority.

That would make the authority the strongest regulator.  There are electronic fishing logbooks, vessel monitoring systems, VMS, data, the dipping of refrigerated seawater, RSW, tanks and overt surveillance of vessels landing.  All this is required for the authority to fulfil its task.  There is covert surveillance and it can carry out joint operations with the Garda and Revenue Commissioners.  I understand there can be phone surveillance as part of joint operations, if required.  Will the witnesses confirm it has all those powers, either solely or jointly with the Garda or the Revenue Commissioners?</p></speech>

While that gives us a window to enter discussions with the Commission, we do not want to get right up to the end of that window and, perhaps, be stuck with no control plan in place again for a period.  We want to move straight from one into another.  I am only guessing now, but we hope to have the control plan in place in the third or fourth quarter of this year, but not right up against 31 December, which is essentially what happened last year.  The plan was agreed right at the death of the year and came into being on 1 January.

The bigger picture is as I outlined earlier, that is, that we have a number of fish stocks off our coast.  We are lucky to have the richest fishing grounds in Europe.  Those stocks are assessed scientifically to establish what the outtake from them can be.  That sets a limit and feeds into the quota management, which is the business of the Minister.  Quotas are distributed and vessels go out to fish.  That is where the SFPA comes into this.  Vessels go out, they fish those stocks, they land and we meet them at the quayside.  Nineteen out of 20 of them will go to the factories and will weigh what they have there.  I am talking about bulk pelagic fisheries now: mackerel, horse mackerel, herring and blue whiting.  Nineteen out of 20 will go straight to the factory because we have a control plan in place that allows for weighing in the factory.  On the basis of those 19 landings going to the factory, one out of 20 has to be weighed under our supervision at the pierside.  Those fish are transported in bulk tanks containing refrigerated seawater that is chilled down to preserve the quality of the fish.  The vessel pulls up to the quayside and those fish get pumped into the pierside device, which is, to all intents and purposes - I am sure Deputy Mac Lochlainn has seen it - a hopper and a conveyor belt system that carries the fish up the conveyor.  As he pointed out, there is a facility to weigh on it, a continuous belt weigher.  In option 1 we do not use that weighing facility; we just use the conveyor portion of it to convey the fish into a tanker that is waiting under that machine and that has been pre-charged with refrigerated water and weighed on a weighbridge, so we have a weight for the tanker and the water.  The fish is added and the tanker with the water and the fish goes back over the weighbridge again.  It is weighed again.  One weight is subtracted from the other to give a very accurate weight for the fish.  The fish then go to the factory for processing.</p></speech>

As my colleague outlined, some fish are more robust than others in these circumstances.  Water and fish are pumped into the tanker, the tanker goes to the weighbridge and the operator removes as much water as he or she wants to remove, while keeping in mind preserving the quality of the fish.  Then it is weighed on the weighbridge and the weight of everything in the tank is recorded as fish, and therein lies the issue.</p></speech>

We are the regulator so there is an onus on us to regulate and implement the laws of these Houses.  We have co-operated on the development of a code of conduct for vessel owners.  I have actively engaged with the committee on the development of key performance indicators and there is some really good expertise on the committee.  We have worked with the committee to provide extensive information on Brexit, and that predates my time to a large extent.</p> <p>  It is important to state that consultation happens in many forms.  While the committee is one vehicle for consultation, section 48 of the Act states that we can work with the consultative committee or by other means.  It is important to acknowledge the role played by people right across the organisation, including sea fisheries protection officers who engage with fishermen on piers and those who do things like canvassing the opinions and expertise of industry members on the development of new technology.  We value this input as it allows us to be more effective and efficient in terms of carrying out our mandate, and ultimately securing the sustainability of the industry for future generations.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the work of other regulators in other streams.  The digital regulator, Ms Helen Dixon, has had a very competitive role with the Department of Social Protection on certain issues.  Has the authority, in its role as regulator, ever had to take on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with regard to certain issues?  Is the authority's role as regulator about regulating the activities of the fishing industry, rather than the Department as it works within its remit?</p></speech>

There is provision in the Act, as provided by these Houses, for us to make suggestions on policy matters to the Minister.  Our job is to regulate the fishing sector and the seafood sector.  In my opening statement, I outlined all of our roles as a regulator, but they face towards the sector.</p></speech>

However, committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online via Microsoft Teams.  All those attending the committee room and environs should continue to wash their hands properly and often, avail of sanitisers outside and inside the committee rooms, be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  If they have any Covid symptoms, no matter how mild, they should not attend in the committee meeting room.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members participating remotely are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex, as they are all fully aware.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Shanahan.</p> <p>  The purpose of the meeting is to continue our discussion of the general scheme of the right to request remote work Bill 2022, which was referred by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, for pre-legislative scrutiny by the committee.  The Bill aims to provide a legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing a request for remote work can be based.  It also aims to provide legal clarity and procedures to employers on their obligations for dealing with such requests.  The committee has discussed the proposed legislation with officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, representatives from IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and representatives from Grow Remote and Glofox.  Having heard the views of various industry bodies, I am pleased that today we have an opportunity to consider matters further when we will hear from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I welcome from the Department, Mr. Dermot Mulligan, assistant secretary, Ms &Aacute;ine Maher, principal officer, and Mr. Mark Doheny, assistant principal officer.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The opening statements have been circulated to members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite Mr. Mulligan to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.431" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot Mulligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051800002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairperson and members for their further invitation to attend the committee today to discuss the draft general scheme of the right to request remote working Bill.  I welcome the opportunity to do so and thank the committee for its work to date on this issue.  As members may recall from our previous engagement during this pre-legislative scrutiny process, I am the assistant secretary and head of the workplace relations and economic migration division in the Department.  Joining me today is Ms &Aacute;ine Maher, principal officer with responsibility for employment rights policy, and Mr. Mark Doheny, assistant principal officer with responsibility for employment rights policy.</p> <p>  As I indicated in my appearance in February, and as the T&aacute;naiste has said on numerous occasions, we have a listening ear on the draft legislation and are open to changes to it.  As the committee will be aware, the Government&rsquo;s remote work strategy was published in January 2021 and commits, under pillar 1, to legislate to provide employees with the right to request remote work.  We recognise that the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in remote working becoming a reality for many of us, often quite abruptly.  It is important to reflect on the valuable contribution made by both workers and employers during this difficult time.</p> <p>  People showed great resilience and flexibility in adapting quickly to a very significant shift towards working from home.  We agree that the progress made towards a more flexible and balanced approach to our working lives should not be lost.  That is why the T&aacute;naiste and the Department have publicly committed to ensuring that this legislation is as clear and balanced as possible, in order to positively assist both workers and employers to adopt remote working practices.</p> <p>  That being said, it is important not to conflate the experience of home working during the pandemic with remote working under a regular scenario.  Using a global health crisis as the basis for legally requiring employers to continue to allow all workers to work remotely would not be a fair, balanced and proportionate proposal.  It is also clear that not all occupations, industries or roles will be appropriate or suitable for remote working.  Therefore, it is not practical to introduce an automatic legal right to remote work.</p> <p>  We thank the delegates from ICTU and IBEC for their contributions at the second session of pre-legislative scrutiny.  We noted that while both parties made very helpful and constructive observations, there appeared to be some divergence of views on how to legislate in this space.  In this context, I emphasise that the intention of this legislation is to act as a floor-level protection to ensure that all workers, be they full time, part time or on fixed-term contracts, have the legal right to formally request remote or hybrid working and for their employer to be obliged to consider that request and respond to it.</p> <p>  It is not the intention of the draft legislation to negatively impact on employers&rsquo; ability to attract and retain talent in a competitive jobs market, nor to undermine existing remote working arrangements that may offer more favourable terms overall.  We want all workers to have the right to request remote work and not just certain categories of worker.  As the T&aacute;naiste has said on several occasions, as long as the business gets done and services are provided, employers should facilitate remote working where they can.  We also welcome the submissions to the committee from Grow Remote and Glofox.  They gave personal testimony on the positive impacts of increased remote work, while also speaking to some of the challenges encountered by business and workers alike in navigating the step change towards remote and hybrid forms of working.</p> <p>  Based on our engagement with the members of the committee and taking on board feedback from our stakeholders, the Department is currently examining how best to strengthen the redress provisions and the right of appeal in the draft legislation.  In addition, we are considering a reduction of the enumerated grounds for refusal.  Our engagements with both ICTU and IBEC, in particular, have been constructive and informative to date and we are considering their inputs on areas including qualification periods, flexibility and impacts on SMEs.  The report of this committee, following the conclusion of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, will also be very valuable in this regard and we will carefully consider its contents.</p> <p>  Remote working has the potential to fundamentally change the nature of where, how, when and why people work.  This could, in turn, bring about positive economic, spatial, environmental, cultural and societal change for our country.  We know that remote work could help to achieve a wide range of public policy objectives.  These include increasing participation in the labour market, attracting and retaining talent, enabling balanced regional development, alleviating accommodation pressures, improving work-life balance and reducing carbon emissions and air pollution.  In response to this huge potential for public good, these draft legislative proposals are being brought forward by the Government to make remote working a permanent feature of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce, in a way that can benefit all.</p><p>I thank the committee for its engagement with us during the development of this draft legislation and look forward to further discussion today.</p></speech>

It is your second time here, and we have had extensive discussions during two other meetings as well.  You said in your introduction that there are some divergences in views.  That is putting it mildly.</p> <p>  I will now invite members to discuss the issue with the officials.  I remind members participating remotely to use the raise hand function on Teams.  More importantly, when they finish speaking, please take it down.  I call Deputy O'Reilly, who has 14 minutes.</p></speech>

It is much better when we are in the room.  That is my personal preference.</p> <p>  Mr. Mulligan said in his statement that the Minister indicated that he and his Department have a listening ear.  Where was that when this was being drafted?  Ms Patricia King from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, appeared before the committee, as Mr. Mulligan mentioned in the submission, and she indicated that this legislation did not go through what would be a normal and established consultation process with the trade unions.  It is quite obvious that it did not, given where the legislation is and the fact that Mr. Mulligan is saying that he is willing to engage with substantial amendments to it.  This is not meant disrespectfully to the volume of work that went into it but it is an indication that the Minister and the Department got it badly wrong.  One of the reasons is that the normal consultation process was bypassed.  Can Mr. Mulligan explain where this came from if it did not come from a consultation with the trade unions and, indeed, with IBEC and others?  That does not appear to have happened.</p></speech>

Before that, in fact, there was a consultation process as well on the national strategy, Making Remote Work, to progress remote working generally.  We had 145 written submissions, so it was an extensive consultation process.  We looked carefully at the submissions we got.  As I noted earlier, there has been a divergence of views in respect of the views expressed in those submissions and since then.  It is a matter of us trying to put in place a framework to allow requests for remote work to be dealt with in a structured way that allows employers and employees to have that conversation in a structured way and to build in certain floor-level protections.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051800002#B00500"><p>With respect, if there was consultation, the listening ear has to be a new thing because the submissions that were made cannot have been taken on board.  Otherwise we would not be here discussing substantial revisions that will be necessary to make this fit for purpose.  I accept that there was a process of consultation, but Mr. Mulligan will have to accept as well that it was not robust enough.  Certainly, Ms King had the view that she was not involved in the normal consultation process in which she, as the head of ICTU, would have been expected to be involved.  That is what has brought us to this point.</p> <p>  Mr. Mulligan will know that this proposed legislation has gone down like a lead balloon with workers.  He will have heard that.  Even some employers have said they would not have written it like this.  Perhaps there is a lesson in this for the Department and specifically for the Minister, that it is not enough to engage in consultation unless one is going to listen and take on board what is being said.  This legislation is going to be judged on whether it delivers for workers and whether it compels an employer to be fair.  We are not trying to legislate for the majority of employers who I am sure are grand, but for those who will not grant reasonable requests.  Can Mr. Mulligan enlighten us as to where the 13 sweeping, and I would call them subjective, grounds for refusal came from?  It cannot have come from the consultation process.  I have read a good number, probably not all, of the submissions and I did not see anyone asking for that, not even the toughest employers.  Can Mr. Mulligan elaborate on where they came from?</p></speech>

We specifically had a question in the consultation about what were thought might be reasonable grounds to refuse.  In effect, there were 27 to 28 different variations of reasons for refusal brought in.  I noted from their testimony here that representatives of IBEC said that they felt some were not even reflected within the 13.  The grounds were intended as something that might be reasonable for a particular scenario.</p> <p>  Obviously, this is a statutory employment right and it is going to apply to all.  It is a step change with an employee having the power to essentially renegotiate a key part of the contract, and we have to be mindful of the potential impact on employers.  The stated grounds were stated broadly because a broad number of grounds were given, and they were given repeatedly.  It was not a case of it being one isolated event.  Even workers in their submissions gave grounds.  We had well in excess of 100 personal respondents and some of them said that the broadband speed where they were would have been a factor in why they believed they could not get it.  We made an effort to reflect all of them and the broadness of the grounds is reflective of the submissions we received.</p></speech>

I have long argued that remote working should be considered a separate and distinct form of work, as shift work would have been when it was considered a couple of decades ago.  It is its own form of work and it must have its own structures in place.  The pandemic heightened that activity.  Over the years even the civil and public service was slow to embrace what we initially called teleworking.  That probably tells how old I am.  Then it became e-working and now it is remote and hybrid working.  The fact is that it was very slow and then it was very sudden.  There is a massive lost opportunity, and we are in the post-pandemic period now, that the time was not used to put the structures in place.</p> <p>  Mr. Mulligan said in his submission that the Department is looking at strengthening the redress provisions and the right of appeal as well as the reduction in the grounds for refusal.  These are fairly substantial amendments that will have to be made.  With respect, I suggest that we would not be here if the consultation process had been a little more robust.  What exactly is the Department looking at when it refers to strengthening the redress?</p></speech>

We are looking to see what that looks like and whether it is possible to operationalise that without creating a right to have remote working granted.  What we are trying to create is a right to request remote work, but not a right to have remote work.  How does one craft the legislation to do the former but not the latter?  For example, it has been suggested that perhaps in looking at an employer's refusal it is whether one could look at that with some type of reasonableness test, or on objective grounds whether it was reasonable and so forth.  What we are looking at currently is whether it is possible to do that from a constitutional point of view without infringing the constitutional rights of a business owner and without actually creating a right to have remote working as opposed to a right to request remote working.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.443" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051800002#B01200"><p>I would not have a problem with the right to have remote working, but perhaps that is just me.  I suggest that the Department start from the premise that all requests are granted unless there is a good reason not to.  It has to trust people as well.  Some people's work cannot be done remotely.  We could not have our emergency department nurses working remotely.</p><p>However, I doubt if any of them is going to request it either.  If the Department was to come at this from the positive perspective, as it were, of the worker, one would assume all requests would be granted, save for cases where there is a good reason not too, rather than starting with a menu of options for saying "No", and we then build on that and undermine the redress and so forth.  The Department has come at it from the wrong perspective, to be frank, and it was a bad place to start.</p><p> Another question is with regard to the previous statements whereby work that was done during the pandemic would not count as a reason.  Therefore, if a person successfully worked, and I am thinking about someone going to the WRC or Labour Court to argue it, he or she must be able to argue that he or she did so, albeit in trying circumstances, and because he or she had to and not perhaps because his or her employer wanted.  Does Mr. Mulligan agree, however, that if a person goes to the WRC or Labour Court, he or she must be able to argue that he or she successfully did it for two years?  That must surely count for something in any consideration.  It makes a bit of a mockery of two years of successful working from home for workers if they cannot then rely on that in requesting remote work or a hybrid arrangement.</p></speech>

I just made the point in the opening statement that the conditions that were necessary for us all to work and do what we needed to do during a global pandemic are not the same as a normal scenario.</p> <p>  To be clear, however, the Government is very keen that remote working would be progressed and developed.  As I said in the opening statement, there is much potential from all sorts of points of view.  It is to be progressed and developed and that is the policy.  In many situations, however, the working environment was not ideal during the pandemic.  I do not think we can assume that because everyone worked successfully during the pandemic, that could not be improved on in normal times.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.446" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051800002#C00300"><p>I respectfully disagree.  I also suggest that Mr. Mulligan does not have data to back that up.  He has a feeling that most people did not work successfully from home.  I will tell him that I have a feeling that most people did work successfully from home.  I know that because they tell me that.  Mr. Mulligan knows that as well, however, because the same as me and others, he probably also worked successfully from home.  Again, this is where I fundamentally disagree with the starting point for this.  It is not starting from the point of view of trusting workers and assuming they will do the right thing.  I am not surprised given the person that is heading it up, but still contained within this legislation is an assumption that workers are going to be hanging the latch when they are at home, and that the balance must be in favour of the employer preventing it.  It is actually a really positive move for workers.  I genuinely wish the T&aacute;naiste and his Department had come at this from the perspective of trusting workers and building on that which was done during the pandemic.</p> <p>  The lesson many people learned during the pandemic was that remote and hybrid working can work.  The regret was that it was not done in a staged and planned manner, and that it was simply a case of snapping the fingers and saying now everyone has to work from home.  People managed that despite the housing crisis and the overcrowded accommodation in which they were living.  They managed it despite ropey broadband and despite sitting at the end of the bed with a laptop balanced on their lap, in many circumstances, but they managed.  The Department is missing a trick if this legislation does not come from the perspective of positively looking at how workers do this.  All that is in it - not all, but a substantial portion - and what is being discussed in the media and by others is the right for an employer to say "No".  I think that is the wrong place to start.</p></speech>

As we are all familiar, when this was last discussed before the committee, there was widespread agreement that the Bill in its current format was weighted too heavily in favour of employers.  The comments this morning with regard to a reduction in grounds being considered, strengthening the redress provision and the right to appeal are welcome.  Obviously, businesses will have genuine reasons they cannot facilitate some requests but the legislation can certainly strike a better balance than it does currently.</p> <p>  It would seem, for example, that the reasons employers can offer in terms of concerns around businesses, mainly around confidentiality and intellectual property, are unnecessary given the safeguards that can be put in place from an IT standpoint.  Naturally enough, confidentiality and intellectual property are a constant risk for some companies but I do not see the risk being higher whether an employee is working from home on a company laptop or working in an office.  Is that one of the grounds that may be removed?  Could I get more detail on what grounds are being considered for removal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.457" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot Mulligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051800002#C01400"><p>I thank the Senator very much.  Business associations have actually said they are concerned about protection of intellectual property, IP, and, indeed, general data protection regulation, GDPR, rules in respect of people working from home, and the suitability of the home environment in that context for remote working.  I will just make the comment that this observation has been made to us.</p> <p>  In terms of the grounds, I do not know; we have 13 published in the Bill.  We are looking at those quite fundamentally.  We are not getting into the particulars of saying this one in, that one out.  We are looking at it more fundamentally than that as to the structure of that part of the Bill.  That is a work in progress.  We have heard the view that there are too many grounds and that the way it is structured is not appropriate.  As Mr. Doheny said, the business associations said there are not enough grounds and that others should be included as well.  We are looking fundamentally at the nature of that section to see how it could be amended.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulligan mentioned that his own crew has a hybrid option involving two days and that he is open to increasing that.  How long will the uncertainty continue?  I am concerned that there is one rule for one group and another rule for another group yet they are both working for local authorities in Galway, whether that is Galway City Council or Galway County Council.  Naturally, it is much more difficult for workers who have to travel 45 miles or 50 miles to work, but their counterparts up the road are able to work from home two or three days per week, as is right.</p></speech>

It is rolling out that roadmap to the wider public sector.  It is operating to its own timeline.  Certain jobs may have an element that will require on-site attendance.  The Bill specifies that the policy of the organisation should establish roles that would have suitability, or roles that are inherently unsuitable, perhaps, for remote working.  As regards the individual roles referred to by the Senator, I do not know what those roles are but it would be a matter for the public sector and the respective Departments and local authorities to comment in line with their requirements as employers.</p></speech>

People in my constituency are telling me that, basically, it is up to each HR department within the local authorities to decide whether employees may apply for the hybrid model.  I do not wish to get into individual cases but, to be clear, there is a local authority very close by and its employees are still on a hybrid model involving two or three days a week, as they ought to be.  I hear Mr. Doheny's point in respect of there being a small percentage of jobs that cannot be done from home, but that number of jobs is minimal.  In the context of the public service, it is unusual that the HR department in a particular local authority can make one rule, while that in another local authority can make a different rule.  I ask our guests to comment on that.</p></speech>

Within that, each Department or parent authority formulates its own policy.  However, there is a programme for Government commitment to 20% remote working in the public sector and measures are being created to achieve that.  There may be service provision levels that require certain jobs to be on site but that is a task for HR units to centralise and get in line with the overall public policy.</p></speech>

I refer to head 14, relating to the requirement for employers to have a formal remote working policy.  Do our guests agree that there are many employers, some of which are small employers employing a small number of people, whose workers will not be able to work remotely?  Some of the employees may be working remotely in an unusual way.  For example, is it reasonable to expect an employer with a plumbing business that carries out plumbing in households and employs two or three people to have a remote working policy?  There are other employers who might have a shop with one or two people working in it.  It is not possible for those people to serve customers remotely.  Is it fair to ask people such as that to have a remote working policy in the first instance?  Could consideration be given to some employers being exempted from having a remote working policy and having to go through the associated bureaucracy?  Alternatively, it could be kept so simple that it would just be a matter of the employer stating that he or she does not have a remote working policy because none of his or her employees would be impacted by it.  There are many employers with a small number of employees which could be impacted by this and if they did not have such a policy, it would be an offence.  I ask our guests to tease out that issue.</p> <p>  Under head 8, employees are asked to carry out a self-assessment.  That seems vague.  Is there a proposal to have some kind of template for that self-assessment?  Reference is made to proposed working locations and specific requirements for carrying out the job, such as data protection and confidentiality and so on.  Some employees may not be able to do that.  That may need to be tightened up.  </p> <p>  Head 10(2) provides that an employer shall return a decision within a reasonable time and specifies a 12-week period.  That is three months, which is an awfully long time.  It may be that the period should be shortened to one month.  That would be reasonable.  I acknowledge that 12 weeks is the outside limit, but it is still an awfully long time.</p> <p>  Head 12, to which other members have referred, relates to grounds for an employer declining a request for remote working.  One of the grounds is that an employer cannot reorganise work among existing staff.  Much of the remote work we are discussing seems to me to be desktop type of work.  Whether an employee is in the same room or building or a different location, it should be possible to reorganise work.  There is reference to a potential negative impact on performance and quality.  Both of those metrics are subjective and difficult to argue against.  I am uncertain of the value of those provisions.</p> <p>  I understand the need for the provision relating to Internet connectivity, but what happens if that connectivity improves?  If it is not working, it is not working.  Of course, the connectivity should be tested.</p> <p>  I refer to the ground relating to concerns in respect of the commute between the proposed remote working location and the employer's on-site location.  I suggest that should not make a difference unless it is some kind of blended arrangement whereby a person has to be in the office for one or two days and so on.  Other than that, it should not matter.</p> <p>  I refer to the final ground, which provides that a ground on which an employer may rely is that the employee "is the subject of ongoing or recently concluded formal disciplinary process".  That should be removed.  Those circumstances should not be mixed up with a request for remote working.</p> <p>  Head 6 refers to the requirement for an employee to have 26 weeks' continuous service.  I have spoken to several people who are currently working in this area.  They tell me that it is an employee's market right now.  The requirement for 26 weeks service seems to imply that the employee in question is a new employee.  If an employee wants the right to work remotely, should that not be negotiated on entry, at the very beginning?  People to whom I have spoken who are working remotely and newly employed make it a condition of accepting the job at interview that they have the right to work remotely.  That is one of their conditions.  Maybe that should be done at the start.</p> <p>  Those are my questions and comments.  I thank our guests.</p></speech>

We referenced the codes of practice.  This is something we will look at in terms of the codes providing practical and pragmatic guidance to workers and employees on how such a policy would be developed and what it might cover.  We agree with the Deputy's main point.  We want to make it simple and accessible and we are mindful of not placing an onerous administrative burden on anyone.</p> <p>  We take the point around self-assessment.  We do not want to inadvertently transfer any obligations.  We want to make this a fairly simple and streamlined process.  We will look at self-assessment in the draft and reflect on the comments the Deputy and his colleagues on the committee might make in their report.</p> <p>  Regarding the six-month eligibility criteria, a minimum term of employment is a relatively common provision around accessing a suite of employment rights through legislation in Ireland.  As far as I am aware, parental and carer's leave entitlements require 12 months continuous service so it is relatively well-established.  We will examine the Deputy's comments around the length of time.</p> <p>  We are looking at grounds for refusal in the round for subjectivity and other areas.  Obviously, we will be guided by the committee's report.  I will finish on the point about continuous service.  The Deputy is right.  In the current very tight and competitive market, many employers are already offering remote-only or hybrid work patterns on an entry model.  Of course, in a competitive market, employees are free to negotiate on entry.  The intention of this legislation is not to supplant any more favourable arrangements for remote or hybrid work that are already being offered.</p></speech>

These remarks should not have been put to an official to comment upon.  Regarding head 12, a lot of attention is being paid to what or should not be on the list.  The reality is that whether or not the employer picks one of these is entirely subjective.  It is not an exhaustive list and is not justiciable in any way so unless we remove the subjectivity or the justiciable or adjudicatable element, I am not sure whether working on the list offers a lot.  I wonder whether we could use the fact that the employer must have a policy to require not a subjective decision but a decision that is rooted in the policy so that if a request is rejected, it is rejected on the grounds of something in the policy.  That would then provide an opportunity for the WRC to look at the adequacy of the policy so there would not necessarily be a lot of individual cases going to the WRC but an employer's policy could be presented to the WRC for adjudication as to whether it met the code.  It is an offence, which I presume is a criminal offence or least a fineable offence, not to have a policy.  Is the Department looking at that area?  What will be in the code?  Has the Department given thought to what the code is like?  What are the do's and dont's of a policy?  Once the policy is produced, there must be reasonable grounds that the employer will follow them when it is making decisions.  This legislation contains the power to use a code in quite a powerful way if it is designed in that fashion.  Can we move away from the subjective?  What is going to be in the code that could become an evolving requirement to facilitate more and more remote working as we go?</p></speech>

We envisage that it would cover areas such as identifying roles that would inherently suitable for remote work and looking at the nature of work and the internal appeals mechanism.  We see that being firmly fleshed out in the code of practice.  It would in general establish best practice with handling requests, submission handling and return of a decision.  We are at an early stage in terms of engagement with the WRC on the issue.  However, it is a policy consideration that is active at the minute.</p></speech>

Perhaps an assessment of the policy of the employer against the code of practice might offer some way of creating objectivity and allowing the WRC to make an objective assessment that does not require it to get involved in the detail of an individual's circumstances, the circumstances of the business and the business context.  We will reflect on that point.</p></speech>

That is not what is intended.  Perhaps that might be something the WRC could take into account whenever an appeal is made to it.  If the policy is out of line with the code of practice, that might be something the WRC would take into account when it is making its decision.</p></speech>

Is it possible to develop some process of change over time so that if someone declares it is reasonable not to accept a person's request now, they would be under some obligation to remove the vulnerability of the data protection system if that was the ground?  Can we get to something that is more a case of evolving good practice rather than coming in with a sledgehammer?  Where a policy is inadequate, can we use a nudging process rather than a black-and-white adjudication process?</p></speech>

We are contemplating how to frame this legislation in a way that does not create a right to remote working but only a right to request remote working.</p><p>One of the options open to an adjudication officer is to refer a situation back to an employer to consider it again.  To use the example given, the employer's policy could be referred back to the employer for review in the context of the code of practice and, indeed, a situation can be referred back to an employer to be reconsidered.  That is rather than saying employer X or employee Y should be granted remote working.  That would create a right to remote working, which is further than what the legislation has in mind.  We must find a mechanism in between that allows the adjudication officer, as part of a process, to ensure the employer considers the issue in an appropriate way.</p></speech>

This is very exciting because we have never done this before.  We have had no remote working Bill or legislation of any kind.  It is good coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic that it made us realise how much we can do working from home.  It is really important that we bring forward legislation.  There has been much work done on this.</p> <p>  I have a few questions and comments.  I worked from home remotely full-time for 12 years and I know the pros and cons.  I have long lived experience around remote working.  What have other countries done and how has it worked?  We could learn from other countries that have been doing this for a long time before us.  I would like to know a bit about that and I presume much of the work done by the delegation was based on what was found in other countries.  What was the best practice discovered in Ireland?  For example, I worked for a non-governmental organisation, NGO, for 12 years full-time working from home.  I wonder if the witnesses reached out to companies that are already doing remote working from home to learn about what they know about what works or does not work.</p> <p>  If the committee recommends workers could contest their employer's refusal on any grounds, how would that work and is that realistic?  Somebody could be a block layer on a building site and request remote working, for example, so we must scrutinise our Bill because one cannot always expect to be allowed to work from home in every instance.  We know that would be illogical.</p> <p>  I disagree with one of the previous speakers and it would be madness to be able to request remote work from day one on the job.  If I am an employer and I create a new job, it would have a job description.  If the job description does not state that the worker can work remotely full-time, he or she should not expect to be able to apply for a job and demand to work from home.  There must be a bit of logic and cop-on.  If a person wants to work from home full-time, he or she should apply for a job where it is offered from day one.  I can see the need for people coming into the office to work for a certain period before an employer would know the person could do the job properly and does not need further training.  Once that happens, the worker may be able to work from home, plough on and get the job done.</p> <p>  If the Bill is passed, we must ensure two elements are covered.  We must ensure the working environment in a home is appropriate for the employee, and that will probably have to come down to the employer.  That would be an extra cost on the employer and I would like to hear about how we plan to support the employer in covering those costs in some way.  The other question relates to carbon reduction that this could bring.  It is really positive and we must push on with it so that as many people as possible work from home and reduce our fossil fuel dependency.</p> <p>  When I was working from home full-time, it was really important for me to meet other people.  I got involved in creating the first remote working hub in Ennistymon so I would have a place to go.  I briefly experienced the hub in Cahirsiveen and I realised the importance of such a facility to somebody who works from home and may only get to the main office in Dublin once every three months.  We would go mad working from home all the time if we did not meet people.  It is really important if we bring the Bill forward that we take remote working seriously.  It is not about letting people working from home full-time.  We must give them the option to go to an office somewhere, hop on the Wi-Fi and have other people around them.  That is from a social and mental health perspective and it is really important.</p> <p>  I welcome the Bill.  It will be challenging to get it completely perfect and one can never please all the people all the time.  It is important we bring a Bill forward as soon as possible to get remote working to a position where we can catch up with many other parts of Europe.  We learned much during the Covid-19 pandemic so I imagine the delegation has learned much about what employers have managed to do in that time.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Doheny to speak to the international experience, as he reviewed that area, as well as the consultation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.491" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Doheny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051800002#F00400"><p>With the international review, there are three countries we examined closely with a similar right to request flexible working.  These are the UK, Netherlands and New Zealand.  In each of those scenarios, remote working is one of the options available under flexible working and we looked at their best practice.  The UK is looking at that again and currently revising practice.  Its legislation predated the Covid-19 pandemic and despite the fact it has been in place since approximately 2014, there have been difficulties regarding the uptake of remote working.  It is actively looking at the area now and we are engaging with the UK in that regard to see if we can take lessons from it.  The UK follows a similar structure and employers are obliged to have a policy, and in those cases there are reasonable grounds for refusal.  The number differs around countries, ranging from nine in some countries to eight or six.  It depends on the individual scenario.</p> <p>  In the rest of Europe many countries have remote working or teleworking by agreement only where there is an agreement between the employee and employer.  It is covered in collective bargaining rather than a legislative right.  We looked at countries with a similar structure and attempted to take lessons from them.</p> <p>  The employer is responsible for health and safety obligations in the workplace, whether remote, in a hub or in somebody's home.  The Health and Safety Authority has provided guidance for that throughout Covid-19 in respect of the obligations on employers performing health and safety assessments on workplaces, etc.  There would not be a transfer of obligations to the employee in this legislation and it is not intended.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned carbon reduction and that is a goal for the Government as a whole.  There are a number of policy objectives that can be assisted by remote working, including increasing activation in disadvantaged groups in the labour market or greater regional dispersal.  Carbon reduction is a key priority but we are also mindful that this would be a bit of a step change in the employer-employee relationship and we must be balanced and proportionate with the legislative measures we bring forward.  We are attempting to do that.</p> <p>  The Senator made a point about social interaction and we got it over and over again in the public consultation.  Many private individuals who had been working from home saw the benefits but they also saw some of the downside.  There may be greater fatigue and difficulty switching off.  There may also be difficulties arising from a lack of social interaction.  They are considerations and many businesses have taken that on board in formulating policies and aiming for some aspect of a blended or hybrid scheme.  The use of hubs may be considered at an organisational level.  The Department, along with the Department of Rural and Community Development, has certainly put much money into funding hubs.  That has been done in various funding schemes.  There is consideration across a number of Departments in that regard.</p></speech>

I also agree with her important point around remote hubs and other ways in which we can ensure workers have the ability to interact socially.  Remote hubs are included in the overall remote working strategy from which the commitment to legislate in this area stemmed.  As Mr. Doheny referenced, colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development are working with a range of stakeholders on how best to utilise our current infrastructure around remote hubs to see whether it can be enhanced.</p><p> On the Senator's wider point, I understand the witnesses from Grow Remote reflected on the mindset shift around remote and hybrid work and the different options and opportunities, including remote hubs, that are increasingly becoming available to workers.  They referred to their mapping and data-gathering exercise that will provide information on where people who are currently working remotely are based.  We are following that research closely.</p></speech>

It is difficult because each employer and employee is individual and every job is individual.  It is a challenge to legislate because the law applies to everybody.  I appreciate the nuance that is needed in this regard.</p> <p>  When I worked remotely from home and sometimes felt the need to see other humans, I had to pay to use the local hub.  My employer would not pay for it.  Consideration might be given to introducing a reduced rate for people in that situation or requiring employers to pay for it if they are letting people work full-time from home.  I had it in my head that if I am using my home office to work for an employer, I am saving that company from having to rent or otherwise provide office space for me.  It is something to think about.  In using my own electricity and heating, I saved my employer a lot of money.  I would expect a company to set employees up properly to work in their own home.  In my case, my employers did that but, at the same time, I had to pay to use the hub and I paid for my own heating and electricity usage.  The company did pay for my broadband usage, or most of it, which was good.</p> <p>  I wish the witnesses the best of luck in this.  It will not be easy to please everybody.  I would love to hear about the mistakes that have been made in Britain.  I do not know whether we should set our bar in accordance with anything that is done there.  If my memory serves me correctly, it has never been a place that is great at managing workers' rights.  However, we must learn from others.  I am not sure what the witnesses have learned from Grow Remote or other companies that have facilitated remote working and whether such learning has helped them to formulate the Bill.  I thank them for their continued work on this issue.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Mulligan for his opening statement, in which he referred to his intention to look at a reduction in the number of grounds for refusal and to strengthen the redress provisions and the right to appeal.  I will focus in the time available to me on heads 6 and 12.</p> <p>  This legislation to allow for the right to request remote working is part of an overall strategy to give people better access to employment and more job opportunities, especially in locations where there are not the same opportunities as there are elsewhere.  We want people to be able to work where they want to work.  It is about embracing locationless work.  For me, the fundamental aspect of the legislation is around unlocking that potential, which is why the qualification period of 26 weeks is problematic.  If somebody wants to work fully remotely in Kerry or Donegal, for instance, they will have work in the office, wherever that may be, for 26 weeks in order to prove themselves and be able subsequently to work remotely.  We have tried to show through the example of Grow Remote and Glofox that, in fact, people can on-board remotely.  Location is still embedded in parts of the legislation.  The 26-week requirement is problematic if we are supposed to be delivering more jobs in different parts of the country.</p> <p>  There was reference to parental leave.  The right to that leave is not a right to request.  If a person asks for parental leave, the employer may postpone it for six months but, on the spectrum of rights, it is very much a right to have rather a right to request.  These proposals for remote working, however, will only give a right to request.  Internationally, we are moving towards day one.  The witnesses specifically referenced the UK but other countries are moving in the same direction.</p> <p>  I want to ask about resources.  This Bill offers a floor of rights but, as I said, it is a part of a transformation under which the ambition is to facilitate jobs in parts of the country where there is less access to employment opportunities.  It is part of a digital transformation.  What resources will be put in place to back this up?  Companies need to be future-proofed.</p> <p>  In regard to the grounds for refusal, as set out under head 12, the approach being taken in other countries is that the presumption is "why not?" when it comes to an employer approving remote working, rather than focusing on the employee having to give reasons it should be allowed.  The provision in this legislation is open-ended, with the employer, having given the application due consideration, being able to decline a request for remote working on reasonable business grounds, which may include, but are not limited to, a list of specified reasons.  Within that list, the language is quite soft, with reference to potential negative impacts and concerns.  In New Zealand, to give an example, the provision is that an employer may refuse a request only if that employer determines it cannot be accommodated on one or more grounds, as specified in the legislation.  It is the same with the UK legislation, which sets out the specific business grounds for refusal.  The legislative provisions in those jurisdictions are much tighter than what is proposed in this Bill, both in terms of the language used and the specified reasons for refusal.  The grounds for refusal should be reasonable and demonstratable.  There is a policy aspect to this and if there is a link there that makes it easier to set out what is reasonable and demonstratable, then I will take the witnesses' views on that.</p> <p>  There are some provisions in the Bill that, in my view, should not be included.  Refusal is permitted where the employer cannot reorganise the work among existing staff.  However, the remote worker is just as much a team member as is any other employee.  An inordinate distance between the proposed remote location and on-site location is given as another reason for refusal.  Again, we are locking in location when this is supposed to be about opening up the possibility of locationless work.  Refusal is also permitted where there are ongoing or recently concluded formal disciplinary processes involving the requesting employee.  There is a problem here in that an employee having a difficulty in getting to the office may be part of the reason that he or she is under a disciplinary process.</p></speech>

On head 6 and her comments around unlocking the potential for locationless work, I want to emphasise that this is about a right to request remote work in jobs where such a facility is not specified or where the employer is not already engaging in such accommodation.  It is in no way the intention of this legislation to undercut the many companies that are already offering hybrid or remote-only options and are recruiting on that basis, as specified from day one in the job description.  As we heard from the representatives of Grow Remote when they contributed to the committee's discussion on this issue, a lot of employers in the current jobs market are already offering those opportunities from day one.</p><p>I referred to parental and carer's leave.  A minimum term of employment, as I said, is a relatively common provision in a lot of different legislation, not just on parental and carer's leave.  The new Sick Leave Bill, as drafted, also requires a minimum term of employment.  This is intended as a floor, not a ceiling.</p></speech>

Those are the reasons there is a minimum term of employment.  I know that the Senator's view is that the 26 weeks stands out.  On the basis of our engagement and the public consultation, there was a divergence of views on this.  Some wanted a lot more.  I am conscious of the Senator's time.</p></speech>

What I said was that we are looking fundamentally at the grounds to see how they can be changed.  There have been a lot of divergent views, as Ms Maher said, but there is satisfaction about the way this is structured.  We are looking at the grounds fundamentally to see how we can improve them.  That is part of a wider review of the grounds for appeal to the WRC and how we can do this in a way that puts in place an effective framework to allow employees the right to request remote work but not necessarily the right to get remote work.  That is quite complicated to do but it all-----</p></speech>

The concluding part of the opening statement refers to all the positives: the positive economic, spatial, environmental, cultural and societal change for our country, increased participation, attracting and retaining talent etc.  There is also the report published by the Department this morning, which points to an average of &euro;413 a year in savings for workers working remotely from reduced commuting costs, the monetary value in reduced carbon emissions of over &euro;7 million and a time saving of 93 hours a year, which is valued at just over &euro;1,000, quite a low valuation.  It works out at about &euro;11 an hour less than most workers get paid.  Mr. Mulligan factors in the fact that people can have cheaper and better quality housing and reduced need to pay for childcare.  The positives are enormous and are spelled out towards the end of Mr. Mulligan's opening statement.  That does not really tally, however, with the Department's and the Government's approach to this, which is very minimal, in reality.  What we are talking about is the right to request rather than the right to do and, therefore, a corollary of the right of refusal on the employer's side.  Why is that?  Why do all these positives not weigh more heavily in the Department's considerations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.510" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot Mulligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051800002#H00900"><p>The Deputy is right - and we are very clearly in agreement on this - about the potential for good across a whole range of policy areas, including in the interest of employers and firms, in the interest of employees, in the interest of the environment and so on.  We are very clear about that.  That is why we have a national remote work strategy, of which this right to request remote work is a key recommendation.  However, in putting in place a framework to allow for a right to request remote work, we have to balance the various interests and views, including those of businesses, business owners, employers, employees, trade unions and so on.  The committee has heard some quite divergent views as to what has been proposed.  As a Department, it is for us to review those views and to try to find a way that advances the overall agenda to achieve the objectives, which we both agree are really good ones and important to get to, but to do so in a way that does not infringe the rights and responsibilities of the various interests.  One of those is business owners' constitutional rights in respect of their businesses.  We have legal advice as to how far we can go in that regard and we have to take that into account as well.  In addition, as has been said here today and on other occasions, in the marketplace many employers are offering fully remote work from day one, some are offering hybrid working and so on.  There is a whole range of situations in the real world, whereas, from the point of view of the legislation, we need to put in place a framework that seeks to be fair to everyone and seeks to put in place protections in order that employers deal with everyone's application fairly and that employees deal with their applications and their requests in a responsible manner as well.  We need to try to find a middle way or to get a balance that allows for the development of this agenda in a good way, a structured way, and one in which we achieve all the things the Deputy and I have talked about today as public goods.</p></speech>

When Mr. Mulligan talks about the balance in this, he is talking about business interests and business owners not being in favour of doing this.  There is not much balance there.  If you give the right of refusal to employers, you have not really given much of a right to workers.  Workers can ask their employers for things today.  They do not really need legislation to have the right to request something, and the current situation is that employers have the right to say no.  Under the current heads, they will still have the right to say no.  I ask Mr. Mulligan to expand on that point.  Is he saying the Department has legal advice that it would be unconstitutional, for example, to give certain categories of workers the right to remote work?  Is that why the Department is focused on this right to request?</p></speech>

There is legal advice to that effect.</p></speech>

I know that that is not a satisfactory answer.  Business owners have a constitutional right in respect of the ownership and control of their businesses.  That is the core of it, but what the exact rights are in different situations would vary from situation to situation.</p></speech>

Employers could make the case that minimum wage legislation is a restriction on their constitutional right to private property and right to run their businesses as they like.  Clearly, however, it is largely accepted that that would not be accepted.  There is clearly an accepted level of intervention on the part of the State into the relationship between employer and employee.  Is Mr. Mulligan saying it would be unconstitutional to provide to certain categories of workers a right to remote working?  Is that where the limit is?</p></speech>

They spoke, quite rightly, about balance and proportion and a framework that is fair to everyone.  That is what we all want to achieve.  I reviewed earlier the international review of the right to request remote working.  It is a very useful document but it does prompt the question of why, having revewed legislation from a host of different countries, including New Zealand, did the Department opt initially for a law based, effectively, on the British Tory law passed in 2014?  Why is that, given how restrictive it is, and given that we know from 2020 data that the law has not worked?  It has only resulted in a 4% increase in flexible working across Britain.</p></speech>

The Bill we published was based on, and influenced significantly by, the stakeholder consultation we did.  Mr. Doheny can talk in a little more detail about that as well.  We wanted to come up with a framework suitable for the Irish situation and that would reflect some of the views, including divergent views, expressed by different stakeholders.  It was an attempt to find that balance and middle way to create a framework that would allow remote working to develop in Ireland.  That is what we want to do.  That is the objective so we are working on how to create a framework to allow that to take place.</p></speech>

We looked at what they do in other European member states, whether by agreement only or by legislating within the collective bargaining fold.  We focused on the ones that had a similar right to request, which had been committed to in the remote work strategy.  We did not copy the UK in any way, shape or form.  We looked at New Zealand, the Netherlands and the UK and there were positives and negatives in all regards.  The UK is tweaking its legislation post Covid and so is the Netherlands.  The pandemic has forced every country to look again at the legislation it had in place.  The Bill was drawn primarily from the public consultation, stakeholder involvement and contributions.  We got very telling and detailed contributions from private individuals, business representative groups and trade unions and all those were reflected in the Bill.</p></speech>

I have to be honest; I find it hard to accept that it is just a coincidence that the Bill the Department produced looks almost exactly like the British law, except that it is even more onerous.  We will have to agree to disagree on that.  It is refreshing to hear that the Department now accepts the Bill needs to be fundamentally changed.  My colleague from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions described the original Bill as fundamentally flawed, stacked in favour of the employer and unfit for purpose.  I will home in on a couple of key points for change.  What was the thinking behind only allowing an employee to appeal a decision on technical grounds?  That was an extraordinary feature of this first draft of the Bill.  What was the thinking behind that?</p></speech>

This was about ensuring an employer responded fairly to the application and, when making a refusal, conducted itself fairly in relation to an application.  There is also the matter of how to support the development of a right to request remote working without creating a right to have remote working.  That is something we continue to grapple with and we are thinking about how we can do that.  As I mentioned earlier, it is quite complicated and very tricky to do tat.  That is why there was a focus initially on the procedural piece.  The T&aacute;naiste has asked us to look at that again to see how we can develop that so it is not merely procedural.  We are doing that at the moment.</p></speech>

It is a welcome recognition.  What about the 12-week rule?  This harks back to some of the points Senator Currie made.  It is quite a cumbersome first draft of the Bill.  It should not take 12 weeks for an employer to respond.  In a market where we are hoping to attract very skilled employees, surely we need more flexibility.  What was the thinking behind insisting on a three-month timeline for a response from an employer?</p></speech>

Having said that, the length of time a worker might reasonably expect to wait before their request to work remotely would be considered by their employer currently sits at 12 weeks, as set out in the draft heads.  It is possible that we will look at that, weighing up the balance between what we want, which is to make it easier for people to request remote work and facilitate remote working where possible, while also, as my colleague has said, being mindful of business needs for employers and rights employers have around ensuring their business can continue as it is.  We can consider those points and I thank the Senator for raising them.</p></speech>

I also thank the officials from the Department for coming here today.  I am conscious that they have an enormous workload and are having to take time out to come to this hearing today.  However, to be frank, I am wondering about the purpose of today's hearing.  On 26 January, 16 weeks ago, the T&aacute;naiste said he was open to changes to the Bill.  When Department representatives appeared before the committee 14 weeks ago on 9 February - Ms Maher was not there that day but Mr. Doheny and Mr. Mulligan were - they talked about looking further at the legal issues with regard to the redress provisions and the right of appeal.  They said then it was a work in progress.  The statement today says the Department is still examining the redress provision and the right of appeal and is considering the enumerated grounds for refusal.  We have been having a conversation about that for the past hour but I am none the wiser as to what the precise intentions of the Department are with regard to these issues.</p><p>The Department has a job to do and we as a committee also have one to do here, which is to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny.  I have a great concern that our committee is being asked to produce a report in a vacuum because we do not know what the clear intentions of the Department are.  I am unsure whether our committee should issue any report in the absence of clear detail from the Department as to what it wants this Bill to look like.  This goes back to the question about the precise timeliness.  Mr. Mulligan said that he is waiting for us to report back so that he can then decide.  He said on 9 February that he is looking at these matters.  What update does he have on these?  It is not acceptable that so many weeks have passed and we are still not clear as to what exactly the Government is going to produce.  The T&aacute;naiste should be here today and the Chairman will be aware that I have said in private session on many occasions that he should be here to give account to the committee.  This is not to shoot the officials here but for those officials who are tasked with drafting the legislation, we need to hear more detail because otherwise we are going to be writing a report in a vacuum.</p></speech>

I am not sure if it would be appropriate for us to proceed and finalise our thinking as a Department without hearing the views of the committee in a report.  As I said at the outset, we are very appreciative of the work of the committee in this area, we welcome the points of view and we are trying to take them on board as expressed both on the previous occasion and today, albeit divergent as some of these are.  We acknowledge that is the task ahead of us and when we get the report, we will be working as quickly as we can to progress the issue.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ulster Bank's director of corporate affairs, Ms Elizabeth Arnett, and our head of corporate and SME banking, Mr. Olaf Fitzsimmons.</p> <p>  I understand the committee is keen to get started, therefore, I will keep my opening remarks brief.  Fifteen months ago, on 19 February 2021, we announced our phased withdrawal from Ireland and since then we have made significant, sustained progress.  At every step we have kept the committee updated and have engaged with customers, the industry and a wide range of stakeholders.  </p> <p>  I understand the focus of today's meeting is on the movement of current and deposit account customers to new providers.  I would like to take a few moments to speak about our approach.  We started our Choose, Move, Close campaign last year when we announced in October the details of our plans, providing customers and the industry with almost six months&rsquo; notice to prepare even before we commenced issuing formal letters to customers in April of this year.  We very deliberately announced that while customers did not have to take action at that time, they would eventually have to close their accounts.  Making that statement allowed us the opportunity to start a very important conversation.  </p> <p>  Between October and April we led significant engagement with the rest of the industry, the direct debit originators and other important stakeholders such as groups representing older customers, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and the Department of Social Protection.  We placed advertisements in national newspapers to ensure we reached as many interested parties as possible and held roadshow sessions to talk stakeholders through our plans.  During this time we also undertook a number of proactive measures to ensure our most vulnerable customers and those who might need extra time and support were fully informed.  We committed to keeping our branches open throughout this process.  This front-running allowed customers, the industry, the direct debit originators and other stakeholders time to prepare for the formal start of our letters to customers.</p> <p>  On 13 April 2022, we began to write to customers on a phased rolling basis to provide them with six months' notice to choose a new provider, to move and to close their current and deposit accounts.  At this time, I am happy to say the volume of activity is in line with our projections and we are not experiencing any operational challenges in our branches or telephony teams in responding to customers.  Our letters are being issued in tranches to help facilitate orderly account switching and new account opening across the industry. </p> <p>  We understand that giving customers ample support is as important as giving them ample time to carry out the process, especially those with additional needs.  While many customers will not need to come into an Ulster Bank branch, our branches will remain open throughout the process to ensure those who wish to can come in directly to us for face-to-face help.  We have also offered to the industry the opportunity to be physically present in our branches and space on our website to help our customers open accounts and I am delighted we will start to see that support available in our branches this month.  We have also launched comprehensive online customer support hubs for our personal and business customers, which are updated at every milestone. </p> <p>  This is an important step in the phased withdrawal of Ulster Bank and we recognise that for our customers, especially those who have banked with us for decades, choosing and moving to a new provider requires effort, time and support.  Reflecting our unique footprint and history in Ireland, we have a distinct customer base, therefore, the plans we have put in place for this task are in response to that.  We are taking a responsible and prudent approach, which includes regular monitoring and evaluation of the progress throughout this process.  It is a priority for us that we do the right thing by our customers and colleagues as we support our customers to avail of an alternative financial provider.  I thank the members of the committee and we will be happy to take questions. </p></speech>

I am accompanied today by my colleagues, Mr. Barry D&rsquo;Arcy, executive director and KBC Ireland's chief risk officer; and by Mr. Darragh Lennon, director of retail distribution.</p><p> We look forward to a constructive discussion on the migration of current accounts as KBC exits the Irish market.  It is our intention to be as comprehensive as possible in answering the committee's questions, while fully respecting commercially sensitive information and the boundaries set by the regulatory and ministerial approval process for the transaction with Bank of Ireland.</p><p> We understand the crucial importance of a current account in the financial daily lives of our customers.  We also understand that changing banks involves time and effort on behalf of customers and it is our intention to support them through that process.  We are fully aware of the apprehension about the volume of customers that will seek to open new current accounts and the challenges that presents to the market.  We are determined to meet our responsibilities and to minimise to the greatest extent possible the inconvenience caused to our customers.</p><p> It might help to provide additional clarity on the number of KBC accounts involved in wider current account migration process, the KBC part of which we expect to be concluded in approximately 14 months, prior to our departure from Ireland.  KBC entered the current account market relatively recently, in 2013, which is reflected in KBC hosting a low volume of current accounts.  Based on data analysis, we estimate of the 130,000 total current account holders, approximately 52,000 will need to open new accounts or move to new providers.  The other 78,000 account holders already have an account with another provider.  Of those 52,000 customers, in the region of 97% are digitally active, which should support the migration process and make it easier and more convenient.</p><p> Of the 52,000 account holders who will need to move to new providers, fewer than 100 are categorised as vulnerable.  They will be separated from the general customer group and provided with a bespoke engagement strategy.  This engagement will include more intensive outreach and one-to-one support.  We will have a dedicated vulnerable customer phone line and appoint a dedicated vulnerable customer team to meet these customers' specific needs on a case-by-case basis, including empowering the team to make decisions about accommodating any additional needs.  The team will work closely with vulnerable customers through the closure process to make sure they understand what action is needed and to offer every support and assistance.  Vulnerable customers will also be provided with additional time if it is required to complete actions or close their current accounts if they are unable to do so by the proposed closure date.</p><p> In summary, the account closure process will be managed in the following way.  Every customer will receive six months' notice of account closure.  From 1 June, formal closure notices will begin to issue to specific customer groups on a phased basis, throughout 2022 and early 2023, extending over a 14-month period.  Communication will be in plain English, and all technical terms will be clearly explained.  It will be made clear to customers who they should contact and how they can contact KBC throughout the process.  We will outline any potential impact on customers and explain clearly the actions they are required to take.  We will continue to communicate with customers regularly.  This will be supported by advertising in relevant media to ensure ongoing awareness of the process.</p><p> We have increased our staff dedicated to servicing customers in our contact centre by 40% to ensure that we maintain strong service levels to our customers, including, as I mentioned, creating a dedicated vulnerable customer support team.  Additionally, we are increasing staff numbers in our operations department by 20% to meet the expected demand arising from switching and current account closures.  We will adjust staff deployment as required and we are confident that our staffing levels will meet expected demand, but we will monitor this and are ready to deploy more staff if needed.</p><p> It is important to underline that our business model is such that the vast majority of customers engage with us through our contact centre.  Some 90% of customer servicing is done through this me channel and we have made sure and continue to make sure we have the right resources to keep customer service levels high.  Our average customer waiting time until we pick up the phone is just 21 seconds in 2022, so customers can have direct contact with our colleagues.  Our hubs are also used by a small number of our customers for support and we will continue to review how our customers are using our hubs as we move through the process and we will keep these open as long as that support is needed for a substantial number of our customers.</p><p> To further assist customers, KBC will not charge current account maintenance fees from the point at which we commence issuing closure notices in June.  This will apply to all customers.  The purpose of no current account maintenance fees is to provide customers with flexibility so they can open a second current account without incremental costs with another provider.  It will allow them time to switch incoming and outgoing recurring payments from one account to another, at their own pace and at the pace of the payment providers.</p><p> Our intention is to take a flexible approach that will ensure that people are supported at every turn throughout this process.  I wish to reiterate our very strong commitment to continued support and responsibility for our customers, colleagues, communities and all stakeholders in society.  Our exit will be carried out in an orderly and responsible manner, fully respecting all the obligations we hold.  I acknowledge and thank all our staff, who continue to provide excellent service and support to our customers through what is a challenging time for them too.  They continue to go above and beyond every day and we are extremely grateful for their continued commitment and support.</p><p> Even if our customers are required to close their account with us and open a new one, they are still our customers until they are not.  Our intention is to take care of them to the greatest extent possible.  Our mission is to support them and communicate comprehensively with them, ensuring they have the information they need, understand the actions they need to take and have sufficient time to take those actions.  We are ensuring customers do not incur current account maintenance fees, providing support to those most vulnerable and redeploying staff to support all customers, including the 52,000 who we estimate will have to open new accounts.  We are doing and will continue to do all that we can for our customers.</p></speech>

Welcome to the committee.  Unfortunately, it is in circumstances which we would rather not be in whereby both banks, after making hefty profits in this State, have decided to leave.  Now, 1 million customers have to find a new banking home.  I will direct my first comments to Ms Howard.  Ulster Bank has started to issue letters and KBC will do so from next month.

The letters only began to issue on 12 April.  As I have said, we started our choose, move and close campaign last year.  The outreach to customers has also helped.  Perhaps Ms Arnett would like to provide a little bit more detail on that.</p></speech>

As Ms Howard has said, we started the process of engaging with customers last October.  We reached out to well over 30,000 vulnerable and older customers and all sorts of other groups, including customers who rely on an overdraft, customers who are politically exposed persons and who may need additional time, and so on.  All of that activity is contributing to the action we see today.  That is what Ms Howard is referring to.  We are definitely seeing an overlay of the public campaign we ran and the conversations in the media, in this committee room and in other places.  That is certainly raising awareness among customers.  We are seeing that.  In the call-outs to older customers, we saw a very high degree of awareness.  Many customers have the process of choosing, moving and closing well under way.  A high percentage of those customers are safely through the process.  That is borne out in our engagement with our colleagues in the Department of Social Protection, who tell us that there is a high level of engagement among those who receive pensions from the Department.  As it stands, having sent 120,000 letters, 30,000 of our active current accounts have safely transacted through the choose, move and close process.</p></speech>

From the date of the letters, which was four weeks ago, 22,000 customers have closed their accounts.  However, I would imagine that those customers started the process before the letters were issued.  We have very clearly told customers that they do not need to take action until they hear from us but that, if they are ready, we are ready.  We have proactively prompted customers who we believe will require additional support to start the journey as early as possible.  We are telling the vast majority of customers, who we believe will probably transact most of the journey digitally, that they can wait until they have the letter to take action but that we are ready to respond to what those customers require.  We are not seeing any trends outside of what we predicted with regard to our contact centre activity, website activity and activity at the branch level.  We want to get into a steady state of action wherein what we are doing stimulates customers to take action and there is an appropriate response from the rest of the industry to move customers across as safely and smoothly as possible.</p></speech>

Since March last year, 122,000 accounts were closed.  Some 8,700 of those included in the numbers provided were closed by Ulster Bank itself.  Is that not right?  These are dormant accounts that massage the figures to make it look as if more individuals are closing their accounts.  Some 8,700 of these accounts were closed by the bank.</p></speech>

It should be borne in mind that the closing of the account is the final step.  The customer has to go through the process of selecting an appropriate service provider, opening an account with it and undertaking the process of moving across either by their own hand or through the switcher process.  The final step is the closing of the account.</p></speech>

Of the accounts that were closed by individuals as opposed to the bank itself - that is 22,000 minus the 8,700, so approximately 14,000 - how many were closed through the switching process as opposed to the direct method?</p></speech>

I will just make that point.  Approximately 10% are using the switcher process right now.</p></speech>

Others want to maintain control of the process.  The switcher process will do certain things but it will not bring your salary or pension payment into your new account.  It will take direct debits and standing orders but not other payments.  Depending on the nature of your account, it might suit you to use a different process.  Fundamentally, at the heart of both the switcher process and the choose, move and close process is ensuring the regulatory protections are afforded to customers in the appropriate way.  Whatever process the customers choose, at the end of the day, the change will be done in a way that meets those requirements.</p></speech>

The switcher process is obviously more labour-intensive from the bank's point of view and its agenda is really to get out of town as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The switcher process starts with the new bank, the receiving bank, but we have provided very clear information in our letters and brochures and on our online hub for customers.  I believe our brochure was provided to the committee.  We are very clear about the journeys that are available to customers and we are very clear with customers about the pros, issues and steps associated with their type of account so that they have the information and can go to the other service provider and make that choice.</p></speech>

Earlier this year, the director of consumer protection in the Central Bank, Colm Kincaid, said that banks are not where they need to be.  Just yesterday, Ms Howard attended a round table discussion for CEOs.</p><p>It is clear the Central Bank does not believe that the banks are up to scratch, in terms of where they need to be.  Ms Howard, as CEO, decided to pull the trigger to issue 120,000 letters telling individuals that they need to close their accounts despite all the evidence across the banking sector - she does not operate in isolation here - indicating that we are not ready.  Does she accept that was a mistake at this stage?</p></speech>

About 70% of our customers choose to do their banking digitally using either mobile or online banking.  Those customers can open an account at another bank of their choice and of course there are other financial institutions beyond the three traditional banks.  They can do that online whenever they want.</p></speech>

I do not contest the figure of 70% of people banking online or digitally.  Many people will do transactions digitally but would Ms Howard agree that a large proportion of people, far more than 30%, open a bank account in-branch?  The numbers provided to the committee from other banks which have seen accounts opened in recent months, such as AIB, show that a large proportion, not 30%, of accounts are opened in-branch?  There is a difference between setting up a direct debit online and actually opening up a new bank account.  I say that because I think it is a false narrative to suggest that the fact that a large proportion of the population banks digitally means it is so easy to open an account.  The statistics, and the reality on the ground, show that nearly one in two people go into a branch to open an account.  They are not ready.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that there have been some hotspots where we have seen long times for customers to get an interview in a bank, but they are hotspots.  We are also seeing good momentum.  The other banks are recruiting people and trying to get up to speed so they can cope with the volume.  The hotspots are there but we have good lines of communication with those banks and they are being dealt with.  From next week, we will have people in our branches from other financial institutions so that if a customer wants to open an account with them, there will be further help and support for our customers in doing so.</p></speech>

If there is anyone listening to this who is concerned about that, now is the time that we will engage with them to get those issues resolved.  There is a suite of measures that we can put in place.  They can be looked at on an individual customer basis to see how best to support that customer.  It is not in any of our interests to leave a customer adrift in a situation like that and it certainly is not our intention.</p></speech>

KBC has told the committee it expects that process to be completed in 14 months.  That is the timeline on which it is operating.  What happens to a KBC current account that has not migrated by the time it finally exits and completes its withdrawal?  What happens to legacy accounts?  If there are accounts that have not migrated to another financial institution, what happens to the money in those accounts?</p></speech>

This is absolutely not our intention.  We will engage throughout that six-month notice period.  We will engage on a very regular basis with the customers to keep them aware of the fact that this notice is out there, and to see what we can do help them.  There is a lot of communication going to all our customers.  We will write them a letter and we will also provide them with booklets with all of the actions they need to undertake so there is a very extensive support process put in place to make sure that customers have the information, have the time, and can take the actions they need to move their current account.  This is the main purpose of what we are doing in this process.</p><p> We are committed to supporting our customers and this is a process we are starting now.  We do not have experience with this very large change of customers.

We were all stunned when KBC announced that, essentially, it was giving customers three months to close their accounts, to deal with everything that is involved with switching or closing an account, and to move to a new provider.  We know from the experience of bank customers in the market that even under normal circumstances this can be very challenging.  I note that KBC has agreed to extend this period by another three months.  Did the Central Bank instruct KBC to do that or did KBC make that decision itself?  We had discussions with the Central Bank when it appeared before this committee in early April.  The Central Bank put on the record that it did not believe the exiting or the receiving banks were in a position at that point in time to properly execute this process.  Will Mr. Jansen be clear to the committee: did the Central Bank ask KBC to extend the period?  Did KBC make that decision itself or in consultation with the Central Bank?</p></speech>

We also got input from other stakeholders and we decided to change this period from three to six months.</p></speech>

Mr. Jansen indicated that KBC spoke to a number of stakeholders when it was considering the execution of this process.  I am assuming that the bank engaged fully with the staff representatives in the Financial Services Union to discuss how this process was going to work, and to discuss training requirements and redeployment requirements.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

It is a very intensive engagement process.  I believe that the majority of our colleagues are very happy with how this works.  We have a very active employee council.  There is wide representation on the employee council representing all the parties in the different activities and departments in the bank.  We talk to them on a regular basis.  I have been appointed as CEO of this bank for a week now and I spoke with them last week.  It is extremely important to keep a very close contact with the employee council.  That is how we agree things between us, the bank and the staff.  It works very well.</p></speech>

It is not an independent trade union.</p> <p>  My next questions are for both institutions.  I am concerned, as are other members, about the position whereby people may have difficulty switching and opening new accounts in the context of direct debit payments with utility companies and so on.  Will the witnesses from Ulster Bank and KBC talk the committee through what kind of engagement they have had with the utility companies and the regulator in this space?  There is potential for huge difficulty and especially at this time when, as Deputy Doherty described, people are experiencing great demands on their household budgets.  People are being put to the absolute pin of their collar and the last thing they need is the prospect of missed direct debit payments for bills for electricity, gas, TV subscriptions and telephone services.  Will the bank representatives talk the committee through the processes they both engaged in with the utility companies and the relevant regulators?</p></speech>

We engaged with the direct debit originators.  We looked at who our customers pay direct debits to, and we identified the top 20 of those.  We then called them in.  We also engaged with the direct debit originators through Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI,  and it was also a topic of discussion with the Central Bank yesterday.  Ms Arnett will speak about the actual engagement model we had.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.631" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elizabeth Arnett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#E01800"><p>We started this very early because we could see there was a role for us and a role for the receiving institutions, but in between there are the direct debit originators.  We ran a press campaign to advertise that we were having engagement with direct debit originators.  We could clearly see from our data what the larger 20 are but there are many more that may not feature in a top 20 list.  We advertised publicly in the press and we held a briefing session.  We learned a lot from that around the challenges direct debit originators would have.  We had a very good dialogue with them, and in particular I would mention the Department of Social Protection.  We have a very proactive engagement with that Department, which is now on a weekly basis.  The Department has set up an online tool where, in real time, a person can change his or her bank account details.  Some 10% of pensioners in receipt of a pension from the Department of Social Protection have already used that.  This is not surprising to us because we outreached to those customers and encouraged them to move early.</p> <p>  It has been a useful dialogue for us to have from the very outset.  We have also seen evidence of direct debit originators that we had not engaged with directly and who received the message.  Some pension funds, for example, have been proactively reaching out and letting people know that if they are Ulster Bank customers they need to give the companies the details.  Other direct debit originators such as alarm companies and so on have also been very proactive in this space.  We cannot do enough in continuing that dialogue and reinforcing it because this is where there could be a real point of pain for customers if we do not have that process as smooth and as easy as we can.</p> <p>  Customers are also giving us feedback on certain service providers to let us know if they cannot find the link on their websites and if it is difficult.  We are engaging with direct debit originators to give them that feedback to try to smooth the process, so as to influence it as best we can from our perspective.  The BPFI is very engaged in this space as well.</p></speech>

I ask my colleague Mr. Lennon, who has been engaged in the industry engagement process, to talk a little about this.</p></speech>

We had a much broader attendance than that at the actual event, at which we shared in detail our plans and numbers, when we expected notices to issue to customers, what supports are there for customers and so on to try to give them a picture as to what the timing might look like from their perspectives.  We have then had numerous bilateral engagements with different direct debit originators since that event where they have asked us to share some more detail, perhaps, about our plans or to look individually at our customer base and see where customers might sit.</p> <p>  We have engaged with the Department of Social Protection as well, which is obviously a big one because there is a process to be gone through for customers there in terms of changing social welfare.  That is an important process for customers as social protection payments are incoming payments and it would be a very difficult situation if that was not done correctly.  Similarly, through the BPFI there are weekly engagements with the BPFI and the direct debit originators.  It is a large group of direct debit originators there.  We continue to be part of that and will continue to engage.</p></speech>

The banks had a round-table meeting with the Central Bank yesterday and, as I said earlier, both Mr. Colm Kincaid and the Governor of the Central Bank made it clear to the committee a few short weeks ago that they did not believe the exiting or receiving banks were ready to execute this process in a customer-focused way.  When the banks met Central Bank officials yesterday, did the officials tell them they now believe the banks are ready or do the officials believe the banks have some way to go yet before the industry more generally is ready?</p></speech>

I thought all parties found it constructive.  It is fair to say we all agree we should have those meetings on a more regular basis going forward as we start to support our customers with their actual movement in much bigger volumes.  The recognition is there is good momentum right across the industry.  It goes beyond the five banks and it is very important for us that it goes beyond the five.  There is good momentum but it is also fair to say there is more to do.  We have alluded to that already.  There is ongoing work with direct debit originators.  We all need to do that through the BPFI and also through the Central Bank of Ireland.  Given the scale here, we will inevitably see some challenges arise but trying to get ahead of those by working together is the order of the day and everybody was committed to doing that yesterday.  It was a very welcome meeting and I am sure there will be more of them.</p></speech>

This is about getting the right balance between too many communications and the right number of communications.   Once a formal letter has been sent, we will continue to communicate to customers to understand why they have not taken action and see how we can support them.  However, it is ultimately in the best interests of everybody and especially customers to find a new bank.  We do not want people to be left in a position where they do not have an account.  It is not in our interest and it is definitely not in our customers' interests, so we will be encouraging everybody to get on with the journey once we send the letter.</p><p>We will put what we call a no-transaction mark on the account at the end of the six months.  I suspect that will also prompt customers to contact us, and if they are on their journey, we will be flexible in that time to help them complete that journey.  We believe six months is enough but some people do not act, perhaps, until that no-transaction mark is applied.  After one month, we will send the customer a cheque for his or her remaining balance, but we would hope most people will have acted.</p></speech>

We have not set a fixed date.  We have a plan that leads us to the end of August next year, but if we see that it does not work or that there is a problem, we will try to resolve that.

I thank the Chairman and apologise for the interruption.  The case in point relates to a family who got into arrears during the property crash.  They were a customer of KBC and their arrears had an arrangement made for them whereby a good chunk of the debt was warehoused.  The family are not rich, by any means.  They live modestly and both parents work very hard in an effort to pay down their debt.  They feel it is unlikely they will be able to pay the warehoused element of the debt in full.  They have heard, and it is a widespread feeling, that Bank of Ireland will be far more aggressive regarding the warehoused element and will treat the customer in a different manner from how KBC has treated them until now.  They fear they will reach a point when they are in retirement, when their income will be low, and their property might be sold, or forcibly sold, from underneath them, leaving them in a very difficult position given rents are incredibly high.</p> <p>  This creates a number of questions for both exiting banks.  What is the volume of accounts in debt or arrears they have each sold on to the remaining banks?</p></speech>

As for what we are doing now, assuming the transaction is approved by the competition authority to PTSB, we made a deliberate decision that we would try to get customers who are in financial difficulty onto a reperforming basis in order that they could go to PTSB with their account deemed to relate to a reperforming loan, and that has been very successful.  In two of three cases, we have been able to work with them, which is broadly in line with what we were seeing even before Covid and throughout Covid.  We have been able to get them onto a reperforming basis and we have found those customers have been able to stay on that.  They will go to PTSB, subject to competition approval of the transaction, as part of that loan sale.</p> <p>  We are in exclusive talks with AIB in regard to the other side of the mortgage business, but we are looking to put exactly the same in place.  We will put customers' accounts onto a reperforming basis and they will travel to AIB, subject to that being binding or to getting competition authority approval.  This is so important because it means we will get as many customers as possible onto a reperforming status, and we will then have to deal with customers whose accounts are not performing.  Ultimately, we will have to make a non-performing loan sale, but we did not want to do that until we had given everybody the chance to reach reperforming status-----</p></speech>

This is a performing loan and the performing loan, together with the warehoused part, is part of the intended transaction with Bank of Ireland.  Let us not forget that we still need that approval from the antitrust authorities.  It is good that the loan is part of this transaction with Bank of Ireland because Bank of Ireland steps into our shoes and the legal structure we are using is technically called a part three.  It steps into our rights and obligations when taking over this portfolio so it will respect the engagements we have agreed with those customers.</p></speech>

The family could be looking to do that exact deal that is intended to be done with Bank of Ireland but that is being refused to the families.  As late as yesterday this particular family indicated that this is what it wants to happen at this juncture because it is considerably worried that by the time its loan gets sold on to Bank of Ireland, the bank will still push it for the full amount of the contract it is in.  This is despite the fact that Bank of Ireland will probably have experienced some level of write-down on the debt already in the transaction.  I want to ask Mr. Jansen straight out if KBC will allow customers to experience the same level of write-down in loans that it is intending to give to Bank of Ireland in the transaction.</p></speech>

A number of my questions have been asked, which is unfortunately the way sometimes when you are late to ask questions in a committee meeting.  I have two key questions that follow on from questions that have been raised.  First, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan spoke about accounts that are inactive and then become dormant.  I understand that what was being said was that once these accounts are inactive, they go into a trust and it takes 15 years for an account to become dormant and then revert to the State.  Are the witnesses saying those moneys will be kept within that trust for 15 years?</p></speech>

I understand that the follow-up from that was that the entities that would be looking to pursue those outstanding moneys would be new ones with different banking licences.  Is it the case, therefore, that under no circumstances would those moneys be transferred to debt collectors?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.735" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jane Howard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#H02400"><p>The first thing is that customers have current accounts and then they have a product on them called an overdraft.  For our customers who have an overdraft, the vast majority have good credit and there is no reason they will fail to get a current account with an overdraft with another financial institution.  That is the first and most important point.</p> <p>  As Ms Arnett alluded to, there are some customers, whom we have been early in reaching out to, who we know are in some financial difficulty.  We are already working with those customers to try to restructure that overdraft for them.  In some cases they perhaps should have put it onto a personal loan earlier.  For example, they might have built up an overdraft that should be on a personal loan and is reducing over a number of months and years and so we are helping them out.  Again, if anybody is listening who is in financial difficulty I ask them to please reach out to us.  We are reaching out to our customers and we ask them to reach out to us as we are here to help.  This should not stop these customers getting a new current account at another bank, even if they have some challenges with their credit capabilities that mean they would not get an overdraft.  In those circumstances we will still help those customers with our people who have specialist skills in helping customers in financial difficulty.  That work will continue.  Is that clearer?  Customers can still get new accounts but the overdraft is a product.  Most people should be able to get exactly the same product but for those who cannot we are here to support them.</p></speech>

If there is a situation, as Ms Howard is saying, by next year, does she know when next year?  Will it be a full 12 months from when the bank is fully closed?  Will it be before that?

We have not yet started the work in terms of the non-performing loans, overdrafts etc.  That has been deliberate.</p></speech>

As a finance committee, we need to look at the issues that could arise.  Obviously, it would be in everyone's interest that that does not happen but it will be a matter of concern for us if it is a situation where some do not.  It can be a situation realistically that there will be at least one person affected by this, if we are to be frank and honest about that.</p> <p>  Ulster Bank has not started the process of looking at how or when it will sell those non-performing loans.  It could be less than a year, I suppose, from when it is closed.</p></speech>

This is one of the stories of this hearing so far.  One would not know it to look at the profits of the banks but there is a cost-of-living crisis in this country.  Working people and people of low-to-average and even somewhat higher-than-average incomes are under the cosh.  They are under the cosh with rising prices in the supermarkets.  They will be under the cosh with rising interest rates not too far down the road.  It is clearly the case that there are not one or two cases, or one or two dozen.  There, inevitably, will be a significant number of customers of their banks, I put it to Mr. Jansen, who will not be able to clear their overdrafts within the timeframe that the bank is allocating to them.</p> <p>  Are we given to understand now that at a certain point next year those loans Ms Howard described as "non-performing loans", will be sold on and that one of Ulster Bank's options is to sell them to debt-collection agencies?  Could we have clarification from representatives of both banks on that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.746" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Jansen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#J01000"><p>We have not decided on the finality of this.  I would like to reiterate we have approximately 6,000 overdrafts.  I refer specifically to overdrafts.  These overdrafts are largely performing.  We will be looking with customers to find a solution.  Maybe Mr. Lennon can go into a little more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.747" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Darragh Lennon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#J01100"><p>It is important for us.  Relatively speaking, we have a small number of overdrafts.  We have 6,000, of which only 1,500 are used.  We feel that we are well positioned to work individually with any customers who are not in a position to repay those given the low numbers involved from our own perspective and that we will be able to find solutions for those customers given those relatively low numbers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.748" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jane Howard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#J01200"><p>If I could go back a step, in October of last year we started to reach out to customers who have a heavy reliance on an overdraft facility.  We think there are approximately 1,000 who may have some difficulty in repaying their overdraft balance within the six months.  Those are the customers to whom we have been talking to understand how can we help them.  In some cases, as I said a moment ago, it is about restructuring it onto a reducing loan.  It may be that customers can afford it but having the structure of a repayment actually helps people to get that debt down.  That is what we are focused on at present in terms of helping our customers.</p> <p>  I reiterate that the vast majority of customers are good for credit.  If you are good for credit, even in times where it is difficult, you can still get an overdraft facility or, if it is more appropriate for you, a loan to help you through.  We are reaching out to those customers.  We will support them.  That is the priority right now.</p></speech>

My follow-on question is, given that representatives of both banks have indicated that the numbers that might be involved in this scenario are on the lower side, something that I am not fully convinced of given the cost-of-living crisis and the financial pressures bearing down on ordinary people at present, can we get a guarantee from the representatives of each of the banks at the committee here today that non-performing loans will not be sold on to debt collection agencies?</p></speech>

We will update the committee as we progress.</p></speech>

For those 1,500 customers, as Mr. Lennon indicated, who are more active users of the overdraft, we think that there is a solution possible.  We will work with them.  We will listen to them and see, if there is really a need, how we can help them to repay those overdrafts ultimately.  Then we will, indeed, see how we will deal with that going forward.  We have not decided anything because we believe that those customers in most cases will be able to repay their overdrafts or find a new overdraft with a new current account provider that is linking up with their financial needs or both.</p></speech>

I note that when I asked the question about debt collection agencies being ruled out, I did not hear the word "Yes" from either of the representatives of the two banks.</p><p>I will move on.  This is again a question for the representatives of each of the banks.  Their mortgage books are being transferred but credit cards and current accounts are not.  Will they explain to the committee why this is the case?</p></speech>

I am not speaking about the future but about what has happened in the past.  It seems this is making it more difficult to be able to carry out this unprecedented volume of account switching.  I know some emergency steps have been taken to bring staff into assist with it but I think the banks have been hampered in their efforts by the extent of job shedding in the past.  I am interested in the comments of the witnesses on this.</p></speech>

This is a very important part of the reason we did the transaction with these two banks.  In terms of where we are today, we have recruited additional people to support our customers.  We have no issues with being able to meet the demands of our customers.</p> <p>  We are increasing our resources.  Another very important dimension in our case is that we have upskilled people so they can help our customers, whether they come into the branch or call us.  We can guide those customers who may want to transfer or open a new bank account online.  As I said earlier, and I do not know whether the Deputy was there, with effect from next week we will have representatives of other banks and credit unions in our premises who will be able to support customers with opening an account.  This is another very important step forward in supporting our customers.</p></speech>

We have redeployed quite a number of people who were previously involved in sales to support our transactions and our customers with moving their accounts to other banks.  We have staffed up substantially our contact centre and operations department with people to support the expected increasing volume of accounts being moved and closed.  As I explained earlier, of those 52,000 customers who need to find a new home, 97% are digitally active.  We will provide a solution to customers in the third quarter of the year, from August, so they can close their accounts digitally and make the process even easier.</p></speech>

The witnesses have expressed their hopes they will be able to carry out these changes in the timeframe outlined.  There are serious observers, including in the Central Bank and on the committee, who are doubtful the process can be completed within the timescale.  The question then arises as to what happens in that scenario.  I have been clear and unambiguous.  I believe in that circumstance the Central Bank will need to intervene to stop the banks from leaving until such time as the needs of the customers have been catered for.  What is the position of the witnesses on this question?  They must accept there is the possibility they will not reach the deadlines.  What is the plan in that circumstance?</p></speech>

I absolutely acknowledge that.  The way we have set out the plan is tranched and phased.  It gives customers six months and end to end the period is approximately 18 months.  As part of this plan we have built in continuous reviews.  We will look at what is happening.  There is good momentum.  The other banks are recruiting resources.  The challenge is that we do not know what customer behaviour will be like.  We do not know whether customers will act when they get the letter or whether they will leave it to the last minute.  We will keep it under continuous review.  We will take appropriate action to help our customers to move once they receive the letter.  If they do not do this we will review it and see what action is necessary at that time.</p></speech>

We will support them.  We have put in place a timeline.  We have already shown we are flexible when putting it in place.  We will continue to be flexible.  We think it is a realistic plan.  We will put a lot of support in place.  We will make sure there is sufficient communication and explanation for our customers as to what they have to do in the process.  We will help them with this.  We will deliver a booklet with all of the product features and what they will have to do.  We will give them a list of their direct debits and standing orders.  We will support them in what they will have to do.  We will follow up with customers.  As Ms Howard said, it is a very important process that has never been done before.  If I was on the other side, I would be very happy to take those customers.  We have good customers.  I would be very happy to see an opportunity to take on additional customers.  I am sure the industry, An Post, credit unions and fintech companies will be very eager to take our customers.</p></speech>

There is real pressure on them as a result of this.  No doubt the committee will engage again on this in the months ahead.  A key takeaway of the discussion we have had so far is the indication from the banks that they will at a certain point next year sell non-performing loans.</p><p>They have not given any guarantees to the committee that those loans will not be sold to debt collection agencies.  In a cost-of-living crisis where people have been put to the pin of their collars, that is very concerning news.  The debate and discussion will continue.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman.  I apologise for coming to the meeting so late.  I had other commitments all day.</p> <p>  Like the Chairman, I have had ongoing engagement with all the banks in respect of outstanding debts, impaired debts and so on.  With one or two exceptions, the banks have been willing to talk.  That is helpful in the circumstances that prevail.  The banks that are being discussed today have always been courteous.  They continue to be so.  That is the way it should be because Oireachtas Members act as third-party supports.  Certain concession have to be made.  We have to be mindful of that, particularly in the context of contacting the borrower without alerting the third party, even though that third party is registered.  I acknowledge that.</p> <p>  I refer to the issue raised by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  Is it common for banks to write off debt and make a tax concession application for so doing?</p></speech>

It has mainly been mortgages, if I am being honest.  I am referring to the personal book.  It starts with understanding their financial position.  In some cases, customers may have a significant amount of equity in their home and could trade down.  In other circumstances, customers may have other funds available and we can reshape their debt.  We may also write a little bit down to acknowledge that they have as well, and meet what they are doing.  In other cases, we find that the term is not right.  We consider the term and may extend it.  There are several things we do, but it is very much on a case-by-case basis.  We have some customers who have done everything possible to try to keep up to date with the debt, and we can help them.  Other customers, however, may be less willing to find a way to repay their debt.  In every case, however, we consider the customers, take them through a case clinic and examine what we can do to get them onto a repayment programme that works for them and keeps them in a home they can afford to be in.  That has been incredibly successful.  That is the way we have looked at it.</p> <p>  I cannot comment on the tax side.  I do not think it is a tax issue, but I am more than happy to take that mater away and revert to the Chairman on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.772" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#L00700"><p>I ask Ms Howard to do so because I have been through all these issues with various banks from time to time and my understanding is that banks make tax claims in the event of write-offs of debt or, in other words, under a bad debt heading.  That has traditionally been the case and I presume it continues.  It is not peculiar to any one bank; it applies to all banks.  In the event of an impaired debt being passed over to an incoming bank, such as the warehousing of debt in this particular case, it is important to know whether a tax concession was sought in respect of the part of the debt that was warehoused or that did not live up to expectations through the repayment period.  For instance, sustainability becomes a significant issue, but that is sustainability as determined by the banks.  The customer has to be part of this as well and his or her needs have to be considered, no matter who he or she is.  I am referring to a specific case.  In that case, the borrower stated in the context of KBC that there was reference to allowing customers who have fully co-operated to settle their debt, etc.  According to the borrower, at the price it was agreed to sell to Bank of Ireland, there would be no financial loss to KBC in what he or she is seeking.  I contend that is a reasonable statement, particularly if a tax concession was sought in respect of any part of that debt when it was written off, regardless of to whom it was written off.  Our guests from KBC may wish to respond quickly on that issue.</p></speech>

The borrower has put it down on paper and asked a question that has already been pursued by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  The borrower is willing to do his or her best but will not be able to maintain the full debt, for whatever reason.  The debt has been sold, probably at a discount, and, because of that, the borrower is asking for sympathetic consideration.</p></speech>

I will pursue the matter again because I also received a letter from the family concerned.  Just like the Chairman, I sat at a table with representatives from the various banks in recent years.  Some were sympathetic; others were not.  I will not mention any bank in particular.  Suffice it to say that in the context of those who were not, I had the doubtful pleasure of watching people cry their eyes out in front of a bank in the clear knowledge that they were getting no help from the bank.  I am not accusing any of those who are present of that.  I will not attribute it directly.  I am taking that into account.  I wish to state emphatically that the banks that lent to people on the basis of the prevailing circumstances at the time have a moral duty to ensure that when circumstances change, it is not just the circumstances for the borrower that change; it is the circumstances for everybody.  Given that there was wide-scale over-lending throughout the country, ending up in a financial crash, there is a significant responsibility still on lenders to acknowledge the plight of borrowers.</p> <p>  There is little time remaining in this session.</p></speech>

There are several issues to which I wish to refer quickly.  I would have thought it be very simple, once the customer agreed on the bank or lending entity to which they wanted their funds transferred, for the selling banks to meet the incoming bank electronically and transfer the account and have done with it, whatever the facilities were.</p> <p>  A matter that needs to be considered is the extent to which overdrafts, as opposed to debit cards or credit cards, are available to the customer when transferring.  I would have thought that whatever facilities the customer had with his or her previous bank for a long number of years would transfer with the accounts and that it would not be necessary for the customer to start from scratch and make new applications.</p><p>I am aware of the difference between the interest rates applicable in relation to overdrafts when compared with credit cards.  It is a huge difference.  My point is that a little more flexibility in relation to overdrafts would be hugely appreciated by bank customers who may be borrowing.  </p><p> I am looking at other things here that I had written down-----</p></speech>

I was upstairs earlier so I listened online.  Most of the questions I had have been covered.  There are one or two questions I would like to ask.  I wish to support the family that wrote to every member of the committee.  I know Mr. Jansen gave a commitment that the bank will correspond with or meet the family.  I believe a number of people are in a similar situation and fear losing their homes.  It is important to stress that.  It is also important that they be given a level of service and commitment.  I am glad Mr. Jansen has committed to that.</p> <p>  I am a customer of Ulster Bank.  I recently went to the bank to work out how to close my account.  It is fine for me because I am computer literate.  I was able to email my different direct debits and change them over.  All of them have changed quite smoothly, bar one, on which I am still trying to communicate.  However, a number of older people are very afraid.  When they go to the bank they are told they need to do this themselves.  That is not right.  Somebody must be made available to help these older people because many of them have never used a computer.  They have never had to do these kinds of things themselves.  I would like a commitment that the different branches will look at helping and supporting older people, especially in respect of transferring their direct debits, because it is not easy to do so if you do not know what you are doing.  I also visited the bank to which I am transferring and that has been a good experience.  The committee will engage with representatives of those banks later.  It is important to get the message out that KBC and Ulster Bank will help, especially older and more vulnerable people.  </p> <p>  What will happen with those people who have not come forward or have ignored the letters?  They have stayed loyal customers of both banks.  They did not ask for the banks to leave; the banks chose to leave.  What will happen with those customers?  There are quite a few of them.  Between the two banks, a couple of hundred thousand customers have not engaged.  I would like a response on that, please.</p></speech>

I do not know if the Senator was upstairs when I said that from next week we will have representatives of the other banks in our branches.  We have had credit unions take us up on the offer to be physically present in the branch.  That is very important because that is where the accounts for those customers can be opened and we can help them to move.  Digital is not right for everybody.  In fact, we acknowledge that encouraging older customers to do that digitally could be putting some of them at risk.  We want to support them in the right way, face to face.  That is why we have invited financial institutions into our branches.</p> <p>  My colleague will address the Senator&rsquo;s other point.</p></speech>

We have said very clearly to customers that if they want to take action early, we are here to support them, but they do not have to take action until we write to them.  On a rolling basis over the next six months, we will be writing to customers every week.  That is the first piece of communication that customers will get from us.  There is a series of letters and prompts planned, in line with what the customer has allowed us to do in terms of contact with them.  There is a cut-off point between where communicating with a customer is helpful and where it reaches the point of badgering, for want of a better word, so we have to get that balance right.<br/><br/>Awareness will grow and momentum will build as regards the campaigns we are seeing from other banks encouraging customers to open accounts with them.  I know the BPFI is planning a campaign and I think the Department of Finance is perhaps planning a campaign, but I am not fully <i>au fait</i>with the latter.  We are seeing early-adapter customers fully going through the choose, move, close process.  However, we are keeping a very close eye to identify the customers who are not immediate reactors.  We will increase the communication rate with those customers in order that people take action within the appropriate time.  When we get to the end of the process - the six months for customers - if there are additional requirements for customers because of a particular vulnerability, we will engage with them in line with what their specific requirements are.  As we said, there is a six-month notice period, which we believe is an appropriate amount of time.  The account will then go into what is called a &quot;NoOps&quot; where there is not a transaction on the account, but the account is still open.  After that, if we still have not heard from the customer, we will return to them what is on deposit by virtue of a cheque.</p></speech>

We did a lot of stratification and analysis on customer segments.  Of our 52,000 customers, about 1,000 are aged over 64.  Of those 1,000 customers, 94% are digitally active.  We have, luckily, a number of people who are a little older who engage digitally with the bank and the banking system.  Of course, we are committed to support customers who are in need, which is why we have put in place all of the support we have provided.  We will communicate also on a regular basis during that process with our customers.  We will do what we can to support elderly customers.</p></speech>

I have my account with KBC.  The assistance provided during my first contact with the bank left a lot to be desired.  I had a conversation with a bank representative named Dylan who patched up all the issues and concerns I had.  I know it is a difficult job but the bank has to reach out much more, particularly to people, as Senator Byrne and others said, who are not computer literate.  That is a concern for members.</p> <p>  Both Ulster Bank and KBC stated they have had positive engagement with the utility companies.  I am glad to hear that.  As members are aware, the committee sent correspondence to Electric Ireland, Energia, PrepayPower, SSE and Bord G&aacute;is seeking a submission before 9 May.  Today's meetings are taking place to help customers and to highlight and try to deal with the issues.  They are intended to be constructive and supportive of both the banking industry and customers.</p><p>That way we as legislators, in contact with the regulator, become informed and have a role to play.  Having written to all these companies asking for submissions by 9 May and enquiring as to their availability to attend a meeting on 13 May, in addition to a follow-up on 17 May, there was no response except from Bord G&aacute;is, which said it would not attend but would provide a note.  Today, PrepayPower responded by saying it would provide a note but would not attend.  Energia said it would provide information by Friday and would indicate whether a representative would attend.  I find that absolutely appalling from utility companies that have the wherewithal to deal with the issues up-front with the banks, their customers and this committee.  They have chosen not to do so.  That is what I take from their response.  We can only reply on the witness's engagements with utility companies to clarify matters for their customers, who may be in arrears and dealing with all sorts of problems.</p><p> Following this meeting, the utility companies should respond to the committee, make a submission and attend the committee.  They are showing a disrespect to the committee and more so to their customers and the efforts being made by this committee and Members of the Oireachtas to facilitate what is a huge transaction for banks, customers, and those depending on the system.  I make that appeal now and will mention it again when the representatives of the other banks come in.</p><p> I thank our witnesses for coming in and for their contribution to the meeting.  If any other issues arise, I hope they will keep the committee informed; it would help us with our work too.  That concludes this section of the meeting.</p></speech>

In our first session today, we had a long discussion with Ulster Bank and KBC, which was worthwhile to pursue in the context of the issues.  When witnesses are answering questions put by the members, they may bear in mind what I said at the end of that session.  We have written to all the utility companies - Electric Ireland, Energia, PrepayPower, SSE group and Bord G&aacute;is - to ask them about their availability to attend Oireachtas committee meetings.  We also asked them for a submission and repeated that request on 17 May.  Bord G&aacute;is responded by saying it would not attend but would provide us with a note.  Today, PrepayPower responded by saying it would not attend.  Energia emailed us to say it would provide information by Friday.  I repeat that I find that unacceptable behaviour from companies that are meant to look after their customers.</p> <p>  The banks that came before us, KBC and Ulster Bank, outlined what they were doing.  They were looking at this from the point of view that all of us are stakeholders, namely members of this committee, banks, customers, utility companies, and others.  However, the utility companies we have been dealing with have certainly not shown the same due respect to their customers or this Oireachtas committee.  I again appeal to them to think about the invitation we sent and the information we asked for, and to participate fully with all of us as we try to resolve this huge transaction.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Jim O'Keeffe and Mr. Brian Nugent from AIB, Mr. Gavin Kelly and Mr. Martin McKenna from Bank of Ireland, and Mr. Eamonn Crowley and Mr. Patrick Farrell from Permanent TSB.  We are also joined by Mr. Brian Hayes and other representatives of the banking industry.  They are all very welcome.  Opening statements will be made followed by engagement from the members.  Mr. Hayes will go first.  I remind witness of the note on privilege; do not name or upset anyone.</p></speech>

It is a privilege to be here and we appreciate the opportunity to come before the committee as exiting and remaining banks.  As an industry group, Banking and Payments Federation Ireland especially appreciates that.  I am joined by our head of consumer banking, Ms Michelle Byrne, who has taken on a lot of responsibility in our team for many of the issues we are dealing with across this migration of accounts.</p> <p>  It is safe to say that the loss of KBC and Ulster Bank to the retail bank landscape in Ireland is a significant issue and challenge for the whole sector.  It is a significant challenge for customers.  They did not ask for or want this.  We have an absolute responsibility, from the perspective of exiting and remaining banks, to make sure we deliver results for our customers over the next year as they find a new home for their bank accounts.  We are very conscious of that.  It is incumbent on the entire sector, including exiting banks, remaining banks, and other providers such as credit unions, An Post, and digital providers, to find solutions as we go forward.</p> <p>  It is a logistical challenge, but I am conscious of one other thing.  It is more than just a logistical challenge; it is a reputational challenge.  The industry must step up to the plate and stand up to its responsibilities across the piece over the next year or so, to make sure we get this right given everything that has happened in the past.  Given our experience of the payment break situation over the past two years, where short-term liquidity was provided by our members to about 180,000 business, corporate and personal mortgage customers, there is a lot of learning we can take from that going forward in terms of what has taken place.</p> <p>  This is the number one priority for our organisation.  We are dealing with this every day, week and month for the past year or so.  The other day, representatives from the charity sector were in with us about standing orders, such as payments people make to Tr&oacute;caire and other NGOs.  It is a big issue for them to make sure we get it right.</p><p>We will have to deal with many issues that throw themselves up as we go through this.  We very much appreciate the observations of the members, given the fact that they are all front-line politicians.  They hear and see people in their communities.  Let us work through that as best we can.  From our perspective, people and customers have to have confidence in the system that we deploy among the exiting and remaining banks.  We will see a particular challenge going into quarters 3 and 4 of this year.  I hope we can demonstrate our readiness to deal with those challenges.</p><p> I will not go through some of the issues we had in our submission in much detail but there are questions being raised in terms of the switching code or the alternative of choose, move, close.  A customer chooses a new provider, transfers his or her direct debits and closes his or her account.  We are agnostic on that.  All we are saying is that different customers will choose different journeys.  We have to be conscious that it is not a solution for everyone.  We are very conscious that whether a customer chooses the switching model or the moving model, there are fundamental consumer protection rights along that journey which have to be vindicated by those exiting and remaining banks.</p><p> The issue of direct debit originators, DDOs, has cropped up and it is in our submission.  I am conscious of the Chair's opening remarks on the readiness of the industry.  We have met the top 20 DDOs over the course of the past number of months on at least three occasions.  We have a good engagement with them.  Their problem is our problem.  It is a problem of resourcing up and making sure, from a remaining-bank perspective, that we are ready to deal with the new customers coming the way of the banks.  We still have a job of work to do.</p><p> Our organisation has written to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and we have looked for engagement there.  We have raised it with our own regulator, the Central Bank of Ireland.  We are very happy that our regulator has written to financial service providers within its own authority.  However, there is a job of work to be done there, especially on direct debits, standing orders, recurring payments and credit transfers.</p><p> Frankly, the problem will not be opening or close an account.  The problem will be in the meat in the sandwich.  Effectively, that will be the transfer of all these payments from service providers and making sure that the experience is good.  We reckon that approximately 7 million of these transactions emerge.  If one takes an average of ten transactions per personal account and somewhere between 30 and 40 transactions per business account, one sees the scale of the challenge.  Working together, we will get there, but there is a role for others to do and the example of our own regulator to follow.  We would appreciate that.</p><p> Vulnerable customers are absolutely essential to get this right.  Vulnerable customers do not come with a tag on their back.  They are people who may well be challenged digitally.  They are potentially older people, although we should not make the mistake that older people cannot deal with some of these issues.  They can.  However, banks have a considerable role to play there.  Our banks have very dedicated teams when it comes to vulnerable customers.  They know how to escalate issues.  Many of those people will want to meet people face to face.  In that regard, face-to-face meetings, home calls, late-night- and weekend-opening branches are crucial.</p><p> The implementation of the assisted decision-making legislation will help as we go forward in terms of some issues of capacity.  Our members have opened, since the last day of February this year, in excess of 4,000 accounts for Ukrainian refugees who have come to this country.  Some 15% of the total cohort or 26% of all adults have had an account opened by our members since the end of February.  That is by the co-ordinated action of the remaining banks that have worked with the industry and other agencies to make sure we got into those centres to open those accounts.  With regard to communications, we launched a campaign this week on FraudSMART.  It is a well-known, industry-wide campaign.  There will be many attempted scams of people as we go forward.  We as an industry have a big job to do in making sure we get the message out to keep our customers safe.</p><p> My last remark will be an appeal to the Chair and other members of the committee.  This issue has arisen about anti-money laundering and how one open accounts.  To open an account, one needs proof of address and proof of identity.  This has been raised in terms of consumer protection and Deputy Doherty has raised it publicly.  Some people do not have a passport or driver's licence.  One might say that is a minority example and it may well be so, but we would like to be able to open those accounts with public services cards.</p><p> We have been articulating for the past five years that we cannot do that under the current legislation.  We are precluded from doing that under the current legislation.  I am referring specifically to Schedule 5 to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  If the Oireachtas allowed us to open accounts with public services cards, we could deal with the cohort of customers who find themselves in this position.  It would help older people who do not have the documentation to get through this.  We cannot do what is illegal.  It is currently illegal for us to accept a public services card.  If we change the legislation, it would help.  I ask the committee to take this up with their colleagues.  It is not provided for in Schedule 5 to the original Bill.  It is specifically precluded.</p></speech>

They are providing us with a valuable forum to demonstrate our capacity and readiness to welcome on board customers seeking new financial homes, in the wake of the departure of Ulster Bank and KBC Ireland from the domestic market.  I am joined today by my colleague, Mr. Brian Nugent, head of consumer banking.  For our part, AIB is disappointed with the departure of these two banks.  These exits are prompting sweeping changes that will have far-reaching consequences for the banking sector, customers and the wider economy.</p> <p>  On the one hand, the impending withdrawal of such long-standing institutions will undeniably have a major impact on the operations of the remaining banks.  On the other hand, this will also allow us to demonstrate our capacity to incorporate thousands of new customers in an orderly, well-organised manner to ensure continuity of banking services.  In this once-in-a-lifetime change to the banking landscape in this country, involving the transfer of 1 million accounts, we will do all that is necessary to ensure that customers of Ulster Bank or KBC who choose to come to AIB have as friction-free and seamless an experience as is possible.</p> <p>  A strong, well-functioning banking system is essential to the lives of households, businesses and individuals.  It is especially critical in these times of stress and we deeply appreciate the reverberations of three severe economic shocks - Brexit, Covid and latterly, the war in Ukraine - in our customers&rsquo; lives.  However, it is perhaps worth recalling the flexibility employed by the bank at the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic when, over a very short period, we reshaped our operations on scale to provide almost 80,000 payment breaks and kept our branches open, even as 80% of our colleagues were obliged to work remotely.</p> <p>  Today, the task of managing a smooth and efficient switching programme does not just concern the remaining banking providers and their staff.  It also extends to a broad range of critical stakeholders.  It involves the exiting banks, Departments, the Central Bank of Ireland, employers, utilities, service providers, insurance companies, and any third party who benefits from the regular transfer of money from a customer account.  We must work together with a co-ordinated, planned approach to safeguard against confusion and to streamline the flow of customers into their new providers.   With 245 group branch locations and three call centres, AIB Group is already immersed in preparing for the arrival of hundreds of thousands of customers seeking not just to open new accounts, but to begin new financial relationships with the bank.</p> <p>  On that basis, we are allocating appropriately high levels of resources through the redeployment of 300 existing staff and the recruitment and training of an additional 700 temporary staff solely for the task of welcoming new customers.  We are also investing major resources in enhancing our digital capabilities to allow customers open new accounts online as part of our leading digital offering.  We are especially conscious of the necessity to support vulnerable customers through the change process and we have put in place a dedicated helpline for those who may need extra help opening a bank account with AIB.  I can assure the committee that whatever additional resources are necessary will be put in place to talk to and guide vulnerable customers with their switch to AIB. </p> <p>  On any given year, AIB opens 250,000 new accounts.  This year alone, we have opened more than 130,000 accounts for customers.  These data include non-Ulster Bank and non-KBC customers.  We offer two main account opening options.  The first is remote via our mobile app.  This provides a convenient and efficient means of opening an account that, depending on the complexity of the customer needs, can be completed in approximately 20 minutes.  The second is in person at any one of our branches, which takes approximately 60 minutes to complete.</p><p>In support of customers in locations where demand is particularly high, we have increased the number of appointments available by offering weekend time scheduling.  In tandem with this, we have also adapted our digital account opening process to facilitate greater ease of access for customers.  To avoid any unnecessary anxiety, it is important that customers bear in mind that their accounts in their existing bank remain open while they proceed with the establishment of a relationship with the new provider.</p><p> The transition of 1 million current and deposit accounts, involving many millions of direct debits and standing orders, is unprecedented.  It is a major lift for the sector and disruptive to a large swathe of customers.  However, as I mentioned at the start, if all of the stakeholders are part of a coherent plan, we will protect the customer and prove the remaining banks are flexible, robust and organised to convert this challenge into an opportunity.</p><p> I thank the members of the committee and I look forward to the discussion.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Martin McKenna, who is head of operations in the bank in Ireland.</p> <p>  The banking sector in Ireland is currently experiencing a period of unprecedented change, with two banks exiting the market.  In regard to this matter, we have ongoing engagement with the Central Bank of Ireland, our representative association, Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, and with other banks to ensure consumers are as clear as possible as to the steps they need to take to navigate this change.</p> <p>  In preparation, we have responded with a range of supports to assist consumers seeking to open new bank accounts.  This includes 500 additional personnel with roles in account opening and operations teams, contact centre teams and mobile support teams based across the Bank of Ireland branch network.  We are also providing step-by-step guides for consumers, a dedicated phone line and an online hub.  To further ensure consumers are aware of the range of supports in place, we have also recently commenced a consumer awareness campaign on TV and radio, in print and on social media.</p> <p>  So far this year, Bank of Ireland has opened double the number of personal current accounts when compared with the same period in 2021.  We anticipate an ongoing high level of demand for new accounts over the remainder of 2022 and into 2023.  Seven in ten accounts are currently being opened via digital channels, and customers also have the option of meeting a branch adviser or calling our account opening team to assist them through the process.  We have also recently launched a booking system for both business and personal customers to arrange an appointment with their local branch.  We are continuously working to improve our customer experience and customer service.  In response to the additional demand already being experienced in our call centres, 100 of the 500 roles outlined earlier will be based in these teams, with more than half already in place.</p> <p>  There will, of course, be some customers who need additional support to change account provider.  Our vulnerable customer unit is a centre of expertise within the bank and provides support to customers and their families who find themselves in vulnerable circumstances or situations, including age-related or cognitive impairment, financial abuse, addiction or illness.  This unit is currently also supporting displaced Ukrainians who need banking services, including guidance on transferring assets and assistance in opening a basic bank account.</p> <p>  In providing excellent customer service, we also must follow certain legislative and regulatory requirements when opening accounts, for example, to prevent criminality and money laundering.  These requirements are in place to protect consumers, the financial system and society as a whole from the negative consequences that can arise from abuse of the financial services system.  As a result, any Bank of Ireland representative involved in the account opening process receives formal training across these and other areas to ensure compliance with legislation and regulation.  New staff members also spend a period of time shadowing experienced subject matter experts before they are deployed both to ensure compliance and to help them better assist consumers who have queries about the account opening process.</p> <p>  As we look to the second half of 2022, and as the Central Bank mentioned when it was recently before this committee, it will be difficult to predict consumer behaviour during this transitionary period.  We are, therefore, carefully monitoring our data for any trends and spikes so we can consider how best to tailor our services.  Account switching is not just a simple transaction between the exiting and receiving banks.  It involves utility companies, payroll units within businesses, Departments and agencies, such as the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners, and many other service providers.  Since the implementation of the payment services regulation, direct debit originators, including utility companies and telecommunications providers, are now responsible for updating their customer account details on existing direct debit mandates.  This means some direct debit originators will not accept instruction from third parties, such as exiting banks, and will only accept instructions to change bank account details from the customer.  The engagement and commitment of the wider business community in Ireland is, therefore, vital to ensure full preparation and minimise consumer inconvenience.</p> <p>  Bank of Ireland has moved swiftly to put a range of supports in place for consumers and will continue to do all it can to make this process as smooth as possible.  As a full-service retail bank with a 239-year heritage, we are committed to serving the needs of our customers and the Irish economy for the long term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.809" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Crowley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#P00600"><p>I am joined today by my colleague Patrick Farrell, who is the retail banking director at Permanent TSB, and we both look forward to the discussion with the committee.</p> <p>  The exit of two banks from the Irish market is an unprecedented event in the history of Irish banking.  I want to assure the committee that we at Permanent TSB fully appreciate the importance of this challenge and the need for us and the wider industry to meet it.  At Permanent TSB, we have five key priority areas of focus to ensure we can support customers, colleagues and communities through this seismic change.  These priorities are as follows: safely integrating more than &euro;7.6 billion of mortgage home loans, business loans and credit facilities into our business over the coming months; supporting customers in transferring their banking relationship to Permanent TSB in as smooth and straightforward a manner as possible; preserving jobs and welcoming 450 new Ulster Bank colleagues to Permanent TSB later this year; maintaining our support for local communities by enhancing our branch presence in 25 communities throughout the country, increasing our presence in close to 100 locations nationwide; and continuing to serve and support hundreds of thousands of our existing customers and the provision of home loan mortgages and small business finance into the Irish economy.</p> <p>  There is no more important priority for Permanent TSB this year.  Over the past 12 months we have deployed hundreds of colleagues across the Bank to ensure we meet these objectives and deliver for our customers, colleagues and communities.  When it comes to account switching, in the first four months of 2022 we opened three times as many current accounts as we did in the same period last year.  It is clear many Ulster Bank and KBC customers have already decided to switch bank sooner rather than later, and we are delighted we have been in a position to facilitate all those customers who have already chosen Permanent TSB as their new bank.</p> <p>  I want no one to doubt how important this is to us and how seriously we are taking it.  We have always been big promoters of switching and competition.  That is clear from our success in growing our share of the mortgage market steadily over the past decade.  It is clear in the ambition we have displayed in our agreement to acquire &euro;7.6 billion in Ulster Bank residential mortgage and SME assets, and 25 Ulster Bank branches in communities across Ireland, which signals our intent to be an even stronger competitor in the Irish retail and SME banking market in the years to come.  It is clear from our success in outperforming the market for attracting current account switchers from banks that have departed in the past, such as Halifax and Danske, where we overindexed by way of attracting customers to Permanent TSB. </p> <p>  Nonetheless, the simultaneous departure of Ulster Bank and KBC represents a switching challenge of a much greater scale.  In particular, Ulster&rsquo;s current account and deposit account base is far more sizeable than those of banks that have left the market in the past.  Switching a banking relationship to a new provider also needs to be considered in the context of the individual needs of customers, in addition to the extensive documentation requirements relating to anti-money laundering for both personal and business customers with which banks must comply.  The scale of change and personalisation requirements together create complexity.  It creates risk and it creates a requirement to scale up our infrastructure to cope with an unprecedented volume of account switchers.</p> <p>  That said, our plans are well under way in this regard.  That is why we have hired approximately 350 additional colleagues to the bank since July last year.  Over the coming months, we will also be hiring another 400 colleagues to support the job of welcoming all these new customers and getting them what they need: access to our app, new online banking logins, new cards, new PINs and re-establishing all the payment instructions that underpinned salaries going into their accounts and bills and other payments going out.  It is why we will run a major customer awareness campaign to make things as easy as possible and let people know what they need to do.</p><p>It is why we have reorientated our branches throughout the country, our web channels and our telephone channels to get new customers through our physical and virtual doors and settled in quickly with their new accounts set up.  It is why we are putting teams on the ground in the communities of the 25 Ulster Bank branches that we will be acquiring, ensuring that we can support these customers in transferring their accounts to their new local Permanent TSB branch.  We are also consistently monitoring customers' feedback to ensure that we can improve the experience.  Vulnerable customers are also top of mind for us and it is vital that the departing banks identify their vulnerable customers and work with us to provide the necessary supports required to assist these customer in transferring their accounts.  We are enthusiastic about making this significant investment.  It is necessary, and it demonstrates how much we want the business of Ulster Bank and KBC Bank customers.</p><p> However, leaving aside all the investment we are making, the scale of the challenge means the success of this switching exercise will depend on many more parties than Permanent TSB and the other banks that are represented here today.  Account opening is only the first step in the process.  It will require the support of the country&rsquo;s utility providers and other direct debit originators, such as the energy suppliers, the broadband and telephone companies and every business whose customers use direct debits to pay their bills.  They will have a huge role to play in quickly and efficiently processing customer requests to change direct debits from their old bank to their new one and cutting out the difficulties that a missed payment would cause for a customer.  It will require the support of our regulator, but it will also require the support of policymakers and legislators such as members of the committee.  All parties must work together to minimise disruption for customers, removing as much as possible of the customer workload involved and facilitating greater efficiency in transferring millions of payment instructions from the departing banks over to the Irish banks that are going to stick around and support the customers who are leaving those banks.</p><p> To reiterate, our priorities are as follows: to safely integrate over &euro;7.6 billion of mortgage home loans, business loans and credit facilities; to support customers in transferring their banking relationship to Permanent TSB; to preserve jobs and welcome 450 new Ulster Bank colleagues to the bank; to maintain our support for local communities by enhancing our branch presence and growing it from a current 75 branches to almost 100 branches; and to continue to serve and support hundreds of thousands of existing customers and the provision of home loan mortgages and small business finance.  I assure the committee of our commitment to making the customer journey to Permanent TSB as simple and stress-free as possible.  We look forward to continuing to welcome thousands of new customers to a bank with a deep community heritage and customer service ethos.  However, without an ecosystem of support, with all parties prepared for this unprecedented challenge, there is a significant risk for customers and for wider society.  It is imperative that we all work together to ensure the safe passage of hundreds of thousands of customer loans, accounts and long-standing banking relationships.</p></speech>

In recruiting the numbers, whether it is a permanent or temporary position, do the banks have a policy on employing someone with a disability?  There is a 3% target or more in government.  Do the banks focus on that in their recruitment?  When I see those numbers, it might be an opportunity for someone who wants part-time work and who has the ability to get in there.  I am just drawing our guests' attention to the need for enterprise in this country to focus on employing people with disabilities.</p></speech>

We have a lot to get through; I hope we get through as much of it as possible.  I thank them for answering the questions in the questionnaire.  That is very helpful.</p> <p>  I will turn to Mr. Hayes to give us the real sc&eacute;al.  All the banks' representatives have told us how wonderful they are doing in terms of providing resources to customers.  With regard to the average call waiting times, in Permanent TSB it is four minutes, it is two minutes and 53 seconds in Bank of Ireland, one to ten minutes in AIB, 21 seconds in KBC Bank, which is topping the league, and 50 seconds in Ulster Bank.  However, the Central Bank carried out an investigation and said that the longest call waiting times in some of the retail banks were unacceptably high, with customers waiting over two hours in some cases, and that some telephone lines had an abandoned rate of over 50%.  I can speak of that from personal experience, as a person who was on the telephone for over an hour with one of the banks, and I will not mention which.  Eventually I hung up because I was so frustrated.  Then there is the number of customers.  How is it that all the banks' representatives are telling this committee that they have waiting times as little as in the seconds when the Central Bank is telling us that in some cases it is in the hours?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.820" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#Q01100"><p>I noted the Central Bank report.  Looking at the report, the data the Central Bank was taking it from predated the information that the members gave the committee.  I suspect that is for a number of reasons.  The banks routinely look at the waiting times involved.  As I understand it, most of the data set, and I cannot recall the exact date, was around the time when those call centres, like every other call centre in the country, were affected by staff who were out because of the Covid situation or who were affected by the disease itself.  I think the Deputy is referring to data that are somewhat historical <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the data in the questionnaire that came back to the committee.<br/><br/>That said, we have a huge job to do here.  I heard the Deputy say earlier that digital is one thing, but call waiting time is another.  We are in this a month at this stage.  There is a massive ramping up of resources now, either through deployment within the banks or new recruits, and I believe the Deputy will see those waiting times come down, as he has in terms of the data back from the bank.  The bank is also doing a survey later this year, so it will be a matter for it to describe the waiting times to the Deputy and the public at that stage.  However, we have to do better.</p></speech>

Hundreds of thousands of customers are in a terrible situation where they have to switch, find their direct debits and deal with all the issues.  Why were they not just transferred as part of the transaction with Permanent TSB?</p></speech>

We tried our best to negotiate that outcome, but we could not find agreement in that respect.  It is probably a question for Ulster Bank.  Given our position in the Irish market and our competitive position, it is something we wanted to achieve in our ultimate transaction but we could not reach agreement with the bank.</p></speech>

Starting from next week, we will be putting staff members into 22 of the 25 branches.  We have got agreement with Ulster Bank to go into 22 of the 25 that are involved in the transaction.  We will also be going into 32 of its other branches throughout the country.  We will also be supporting that with five mobile branches, which we will be putting on site to support customers.</p> <p>  We will be looking at footfall in the various towns in the Deputy's constituency.  Obviously, he has Buncrana, Ballybofey and Killybegs as well.  We want to make sure that we are actually in the right place at the right time to support the customer to move across by putting staff in branches and having extra space for mobile branches.  We are going to be communicating on the ground and advertising locally to try to encourage customers to come and join us.  On the Deputy's point, we want them to be viable, vibrant businesses going forward in order that we can stay and support those communities.</p></speech>

Some of it will be helpful.  One of the consequences of KBC and Ulster bank withdrawing from the market, which is obviously a terrible thing for consumers and for the footprint of banking in the State, is the reality that many of the loans involved will be transferred to Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB.  Many of those are fixed-rate loans.  When customers come off the fixed rate, Ulster Bank charges higher rates.  There is a big difference at this point, for example, in an Ulster Bank loan that is transferring to Permanent TSB.  Ulster Bank's fixed rate, at its lowest, is 2.2%.  Permanent TSB's is 2.8%.  What signal, if any, can Permanent TSB send to the customers involved?  We expect the European Central Bank, ECB, to increase interest rates, possibly by 0.5%.  Given the high rates Irish banks already charge, is there are view that they will absorb some of that ECB interest rate increase for these customers?  In reality, Ulster Bank and KBC were offering the lowest fixed rates on the market.</p></speech>

We are taking these customers on to retain them.  As part of taking on those customers, we are conscious of the rate differential.  For instance, our standard variable rate for a Permanent TSB customer is lower than that for an Ulster Bank customer.  Customers on a standard variable rate in Ulster Bank will, therefore, benefit from a lower rate.</p></speech>

I am just stating a fact; that is all.  In that respect, we will be examining our rate.  We have fixed rates on offer.  It is absolutely our intention to retain Ulster bank customers who join our book, not lose them to other players.  We will adjust our rates accordingly.</p> <p>  With regard to the interest rate environment, we will just have to see how that evolves.  We can see that non-bank players are actually increasing their fixed rates whereas the banks are not at this moment.  That is a differentiating factor in the market.  It is our intention to retain those customers.</p></speech>

For somebody who has received a letter, closed his or her account and transferred and whose fixed rate period may be coming to an end, will that person be hit with increased mortgage costs at a time when the ECB is likely to increase the rates in the coming months?</p></speech>

Obviously, this is still subject to approval so I will comment in that context.  From our perspective, we are working very closely with KBC to bring across mortgage customers, deposit customers, credit cards and loans.  One of the really important parts is protecting customer rights and ensuring that they come across in the terms and conditions.  We are working to make sure that if a customer in KBC is coming across, he or she is coming across on the fixed rate he or she is on today.  It is really important to say that.  Those customers will come across.  They will not have to do anything as that mortgage comes across and they will get that fixed rate they have.</p> <p>  It is difficult to commentate or speculate on future rate changes.  We have a very competitive proposition in the market.  We have a number of products available to customers, whether they want a cashback facility or want to choose one of our green mortgage options.  However, I would not speculate on future ECB rate changes or what might happen with rates when they do come in.</p></speech>

Forget about what the ECB is going to do in the future.  That is going to make things worse.  From Mr. Kelly's point of view, I am asking him whether any consideration has been given to trying to absorb some of the increases the ECB is looking at implementing or actually addressing the bank's fixed rates, which are quite high - extremely high in the context of Europe - and recognising that the bank is benefiting from these loans and from customers putting their deposits in.  The bank is consolidating its footprint.</p> <p>  This is every Christmas rolled into one for the banking sector.  We have two banks withdrawing, as bad as that is.  This is good news for AIB and Bank of Ireland and, to a lesser degree, Permanent TSB.  They are now monopoly players.  They are now dominant in the banking sector and it is bad for consumers.  That is a good example of how it is bad for consumers because more competition would mean those individuals would have cheaper mortgages than they will have now when they transfer to Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

It is very important to say that.</p> <p>  Second, I believe we have a very competitive product range in the Irish market today, which is important.  We recently launched new propositions for different cohorts of mortgage customers.  As a result, I think we have a very strong range of products available in the Irish market today.  I cannot speculate on what is going to happen in the future.  At the moment, rate changes are speculation.</p></speech>

We have dealt with this in the past at different committees in terms of different banks' approaches to how we dealt with the mortgage arrears.  They will now come over to Bank of Ireland.  There is a concern that Bank of Ireland will deal with them more aggressively.  My concern would be that the banks will do what they have done in the past, which is to sell them on to vulture funds.  Can Mr. Kelly give a commitment that the transfer of warehoused split mortgages from KBC will not be sold on in the immediate future or over the coming years?</p></speech>

We are buying a mortgage book and giving mortgage customers a new home.  It is not my intention then for those customers to move or to sell those mortgages anywhere.  KBC already did a deal for some of its non-performing loans.  We are buying performing loans from KBC.  It is certainly our intention to hold onto those mortgage customers over the medium to long term.</p></speech>

There will be another 100,000 in the next number of weeks and approximately another 100,000 every month thereafter for a year.  Banks were letting staff go and now they are scrambling to find and recruit staff.  There is a lack of planning here.  These banks announced that they were withdrawing from the market well over a year ago.</p><p>Maybe that leads me to my next question, which I will direct to Mr. Hayes.  Will he tell us what will change now?  I read his opening statement, which referenced all these working groups that have been set up and all the rest, and Banking and Payments Federation Ireland has been at this for almost a year now, but the Central Bank has given it an F mark, or very close to it.  It stated it was clear that on the ground banks are not where they need to be to meet the challenge of this exercise.  The Central Bank also said the banks are not providing the necessary level of reassurance to affected customers and it called them in.  We are at the start of the process, but for an individual who is one of the 120,000 people who has received a letter stating his or her account needs to be closed within six months and, if not, the account will be frozen, we are well into the process.  As a co-ordinating body, Banking and Payments Federation Ireland has not been able to live up to the expectations the Central Bank set for it more than a year ago.  I do not want the representatives to say how great they are doing.  I want to know what will change after the CEOs' round table yesterday, if anything.</p></speech>

As I said, we are a month into this.  At one level, we are dependent on the exiting banks and their communications strategy that, in fairness to them, has been ongoing for some months now.  We are at the start of this process.  The regulator is doing what any good regulator should do, which is putting pressure on our regulated entities to make sure they live up to expectations under the customer code in the existing legislation.</p> <p>  The direct answer to the Deputy's question about whether there are more things we have to do better is "Yes".  Four areas were identified in the meeting yesterday.  One was around data collection and the question of greater alignment of data between the exiting banks and the remaining banks.  Another job we can do better is around vulnerable customers and co-ordinating efforts more in that area.  An enormous amount of work is going on at present, but there are industry-level engagements we can undertake for vulnerable customers who are really challenged by this.  I fully get that.  Even though more than 70% of customers may well be opening and closing their accounts digitally, many are not.  There is more we can do there.  The third area on which we were asked to concentrate was flattening the curve.  The major challenge, to be frank, as we go past the summer into quarter 3 and quarter 4 of this year, is what the integrated plans from our members will be and making sure they satisfy the expectations of our regulator in this space.  The fourth area was on our engagement with other stakeholders.  We have been doing a lot of this work but, to the point we made in our submission, the DDOs are not part of the switching code.  No bank can take money from somebody's account tomorrow if it is not authorised to do so.  There are other players on the pitch we have to keep working with.  We are open to looking at any and all suggestions from our regulator and others on how we can do that.  The four areas identified yesterday were data, vulnerable customers, the flattening the curve argument and stakeholder matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.863" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#S00300"><p>I will make two final points.  I will pick up on the point made by Mr. Hayes on 70% plus of customers opening their accounts digitally.  That is not accurate.  I am sure he knows that as the CEO of Banking and Payments Federation Ireland.  I will put on record, from the data Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB have given us, that 36% of Bank of Ireland current accounts, or almost one in four, have been opened in their branches since the start of the year, which is more than 18,000.  The figure for Permanent TSB customers who are opening their accounts in-branch is 51% and 65%, or nearly two out of three, of AIB customers are opening their current accounts in-branch.  This leads me to the point that I genuinely and strongly believe the banks are not scaling up enough to deal with the serious pressure that will come at a later stage.  People have put the letters to one side, but as more and more attention is paid to this matter there will be a major spike.  I will make that point.</p> <p>  It will be disputed but there is nearly an attitude of the switching code having so many problems.  I am not saying it is perfect.  Obviously, the switching code is not in the best interests of the banks because it is labour-intensive.  The receiving banks and withdrawing banks have to do quite a bit of work, which is staff-intensive, but there are benefits to it.  Banking and Payments Federation Ireland has been engaged with the DDOs, and I agree 100% we cannot force them to engage, but some are engaging and are willing to do this.  On customer awareness, why does Mr. Hayes's organisation not publish a full list - maybe it has and I have not seen it - of all the DDOs, including the most common, the top 20 and others, that are part of, and engaging with, the switching code and others who are not?  If somebody wants to switch, it is a matter of the switching code being terrible and certain banks do not use it and all the rest.  The alternative is that people do it all themselves, where they can use the switching code and also switch manually for the entities that do not use it, whether it is Spotify, gym membership or whatever.  Why does the federation not publish that information so we know who is involved and who is not? </p></speech>

That is something we are going to do.  We want to do two things with the campaign.  The CCPC has a very good campaign at present, which I am sure the Deputy is aware of, and we wanted to ensure that was doing its job.  Our campaign is around the dos and don'ts on the switching side and on the moving side, and to make sure people are aware.</p> <p>  To the Deputy's point, Ulster Bank is seeing about 10% of its customers using the switching code.  It gave that figure in evidence to the committee.  One of the advantages of the switching code, at one level, is that people see, from the remaining bank and the exit bank, where exactly things are coming from.  The dilemma is, if there is a significant number of DDOs as part of the transaction, someone could be left stranded high and dry, or in a circumstance at the end, where if an individual uses his or her account at the end of the process it could nullify the whole exercise.  I hasten to add Ms Byrne has much greater expertise on this than me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.865" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Michelle Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#S00500"><p>As the Deputy knows, the code is a regulatory code.  Relevant members have to comply with it as a matter of law and they must be able to demonstrate that compliance to the Central Bank.  The code will work well for some customers, especially those who believe they may need a little more support in the process and, as Mr. Hayes mentioned, those customers who may have little or no direct debits on their accounts.  In all of this, the information imparted to the customer and the education the customer is able to access, in terms of understanding what is involved in either doing it themselves or doing it under the switching code, is very important.</p> <p>  It is important customers understand that if they use the code, not everything will move as part of that.  A part of it is about being aware.  As Mr. Hayes also mentioned, we have had a lot of engagement with direct debit originators.  One of the things we asked for from them was that they engage in proactive communications with customers of the departing banks.  That will be very helpful in informing those customers how to go about updating their account details with any of those originators.  That is another important part of it.</p></speech>

We talked about the fact that, on a general level, there is some commentary around the switching code.  On a practical level, when a customer comes into a branch or meets a colleague to open an account, he or she is talked through the switching code and the options suitable to him or her and, based on the customer's circumstances, branch staff will work with that.  We have not disdained the switching code in any shape or form as part of that process.  As Ms Byrne outlined, it is a very regulated and very well set out process.  It is monitored very closely, etc.  While there may be some chat in the universe around it, that is not the policy or the approach we are taking.</p> <p>  On the other comment regarding the numbers, this is an activity where we are driving momentum through it.  The Deputy is looking at numbers, which is valid because we shared them with the committee and the data cover the period up to 1 March.  If we look at something like digital, and in our case the Deputy's numbers were perfectly correct, we have stepped that figure up to 50% of customers and tomorrow morning we will step it up to 70%.  The bank is diverting serious resources that would normally be for other activities to drive it.  There is that momentum capability.  We are seeing that turnaround time etc. on locations.  I would not like colleagues or customers to feel we are sitting on our hands.  We want customers to come forward because we are making those changes rapidly to meet them.  I give assurance to the Deputy, as the numbers play out over the next while, he will see that trajectory coming through and that momentum will be very evident to him, as new data plays out.</p></speech>

Representatives from the Central Bank came before the committee in early April and told us that, as far they were concerned, all of the evidence they had suggested that the exiting and receiving banks were not in any way prepared for the scale of the challenge that faces the sector over the next few months.</p><p> In his earlier contribution in response to Deputy Doherty, Mr. Hayes told the committee what the Central Bank told him yesterday.  Did the Central Bank expressly say to Mr. Hayes and to the banks present here today that, if the Central Bank was not satisfied that the timeline set down by KBC and Ulster Bank for the closure of accounts and the opening of accounts in new institutions was being met, the Central Bank would instruct or force those banks and Banking and Payments Federation Ireland to adapt those timelines and extend them?  Did the Central Bank say explicitly that if it was not satisfied, it would be prepared to do that?</p></speech>

I believe it highlighted the issue of the best customer outcome, which was the phrase it put to us, on the exiting side and the remaining side.  The Central Bank, rightly, is looking at this very closely to ensure we have the best customer outcome.  I am not going to make a comment on what it said on that particular point.  That is a matter for it and it would be unfair of me to make a comment.</p></speech>

I would hope the regulator would act in the best interests of customers.  We all want this to work.  This is an unprecedented challenge.  We all understand the scale of the challenge the retail banks face and the difficulties that will be presented for the witnesses as senior executives and for staff over the next period of time.</p> <p>  Mr. Hayes referred on a number of occasions to the application of the switching code and some of the deficiencies in the code.  It is nobody's fault that deficiencies are there.  The switching code is old.  Based on what Mr. Hayes said, we could all probably agree it needs to be modernised and updated to reflect new ways of doing business that have evolved over recent years.  It certainly needs to take account of that.</p> <p>  We were all very concerned, and I am especially concerned, about the vulnerabilities involved in direct debit payments, standing orders and so on.  I am aware that Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, is conscious of that.  I appreciate Mr. Hayes confirming this will be a priority for BPFI and the member banks.</p> <p>  I am a little concerned about what was said around stakeholder engagement.  I may have picked it up incorrectly.  The witnesses spoke of engagement with utility providers.  The Chairman has put on the record the displeasure of this committee at the response of utility and energy companies with regard to their engagement, or lack thereof, with this committee on this issue.  From what I can understand from what Mr. Hayes has said, and perhaps he would clarify this, contact was made, or sought, with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and with the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, but that the engagement was not necessarily forthcoming.  If that is the case-----</p></speech>

They need to take a customer-focused approach as well.  This could potentially be catastrophic for many customers who find themselves in very difficult situations as things stand at present.  Perhaps Mr. Hayes will elaborate on what the engagement with the CRU and ComReg was and where it stands at the moment.</p></speech>

They are getting ready for the significant transaction changes that are going to occur.  The points I was making in both correspondence we sent to the other regulators were around the timeliness, the resourcing issue, and meeting us to see if we can do something together.</p> <p>  I am aware that people have made suggestions.  The Financial Services Union is on record as looking for a task force.  Our colleagues in the Central Bank made the point to us yesterday around organising the stakeholder bit.  We are open to doing anything.  We would be at any meeting, at any time, at any place and anywhere, when everyone is around the table.  There needs to be a bit more joined-up action here.  I am not laying blame on other regulators here.  I am just saying that we would be grateful if what the Central Bank has done in highlighting to other financial services entities under its authority, they would do the same to other entities under their authority in other regulatory settings.  That will take a bit of time.  We will be around any table at any stage.  There is an enormous amount of knowledge across the sector, as the committee is hearing today from our colleagues on the exiting and the remaining side, which can help us all to get there.</p></speech>

BPFI certainly sees sense and the member banks see sense in actually working co-operatively with the regulators, but I would not want them to take a minimalist interpretation or view of what their remit is in this.</p> <p>  I also have some practical questions for the bank representatives before us this afternoon.  My understanding is, and the witnesses may correct me if I am wrong, that all the banks represented here today have cut their opening times in call centres in recent times.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We have condensed some of our lines to the normal nine-to-five hours.  We have continued with those critical lines where customers may require out-of-hours support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.881" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Crowley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#T01300"><p>That is the same for Permanent TSB.  We have similar support for fraud and things of that nature on card lines.  For the main service we have condensed and shortened those hours.  This is primarily related to resourcing issues due to the impact of Covid and an increased customer demand, particularly as the new digital security SEA authentication came in last year.  The level of interaction by customers has actually increased and call types have lengthened, which has put extra pressure on those call centres.  It requires a certain consultation time to obtain that service.</p> <p>  Customer patterns have also changed.  Given that people are working from home, they tend to ring within those normal hours rather than outside of working hours.  They now have more flexibility when working from home, so customer choice has changed in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.882" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gavin Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#T01400"><p>In Bank of Ireland we have found we are running 9 to 5 for most of the standard lines, but for fraud it is 24 hours a day availability.  If a customer has any sort of an issue on his or her account, he or she can get through to us all day.</p> <p>  In this process in particular, we have certainly found that digital is the preferred channel of choice.  Again, the numbers are moving but now 70% of our accounts are opened digitally with Bank of Ireland.  Digitally means that when a new customer comes in, he or she can actually scan his or her documentation, including his or her passport.  We can verify it digitally and the account is opened in 50% of cases on the same day the customer has applied for the account.  This means the customer gets his or her IBAN on day one, which is a critical first step in this process.  The customer gets that almost immediately.  This is very important.</p> <p>  The contact centre supports are for customers who may have some difficulties, or if they need to enquire or have any queries.  That is why we are ramping up the contact centre team. This is to ensure that if a customer wants to come into a branch for a little bit more assistance, he or she can contact us to get an appointment, or if that customer is having any difficulty with the process, he or she can call us and we will walk that customer through it.</p></speech>

Bank of Ireland's own analysis suggests 70% of new accounts are opened digitally.  I accept and appreciate that.  What are the waiting times involved for booking appointments if somebody wants to open a new account?  If a person were to call on the first Monday of a particular month, when could he or she expect to get an appointment?  Will Mr. Kelly talk me through that timeline?</p></speech>

It is very important from my perspective but I want to make sure I also talk about the 2,500 colleagues I already have in place for supporting customers across branches and contact centres, and who are working very hard to open accounts.  Customers can walk into a branch today and, in the vast majority of cases, open an account with us when they come into the branch.  When customers want to book an appointment to that service, we are experiencing a four-day average wait if customers want to open an account.  That is from the date they pick.</p><p>If they decide to pick next Friday, for example, they will get an appointment and be in the branch the following week.  We are tracking this closely.  I would like to get the timeline a bit shorter if possible.  It is all down to choice, which is why we are redeploying more resources into the branches.  We initially put in an additional 50 to help with the account-opening process and we are increasing that to 100 to ensure we will support the 2,500 colleagues who are there.</p><p> There is momentum behind this and customers are moving their accounts.  We launched a significant awareness campaign last week to help customers understand what is involved in the process, and we are seeing customers respond.  Over recent weeks, account numbers have increased already on what we experienced in the first quarter.  The good news is that those numbers, such as the 50% of accounts being opened and numbers processed within the same day, are holding.  We are absolutely sticking to those numbers and that is important, from my perspective.</p></speech>

I assume that where there is an Ulster Bank branch in a town or location where there is also a Permanent TSB branch, the Ulster Bank branch will close and the asset will not move over to PTSB.  To be narrowly parochial on my part, in Drogheda, for example, where there are both Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB branches, the former is likely to close and Ulster Bank will do whatever it wishes with that asset in time.  Permanent TSB will then operate only one branch in such a location.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

Naturally, we would love them to choose us, but they can choose AIB or Bank of Ireland.  In effect, the branch will close and cease as a branch, whereas in the 25 locations where we are taking over the branch, there will be Permanent TSB signage over the branch in due course.</p></speech>

I understand Permanent TSB let go a number of call centre staff over recent years but has re-added staff.  Of course, staff will also transfer from Ulster Bank under TUPE legislation over a period.  What is the net gain of staff?</p></speech>

It is something of a route for staff given that working in a call centre is quite a challenging job and they are very well educated in system processes and dealing with customers.  As a result, they lend themselves to promotion or movement into the branch network and other parts of the bank such as fraud and issues of that nature.  That has been a feature of the call centre staff.</p> <p>  We have increased our headcount numbers in the call centre.  Within the 450 staff moving over, there is no element of call centre staff because they support the retail banking network and the current account customers, who, unfortunately, are not coming to us.  It is the mortgage customers who are moving to us.  The current account customers do not fit into the TUPE definition, from that perspective.</p></speech>

As I think they have all said, this is, obviously, a very significant event whereby two banks in a relatively small banking sector with limited competition are moving out.  The concern of this committee, and I am sure of our guests, is that we want to see a smooth transfer of those hundreds of thousands of bank account holders to one of their banks.  We have no preference as to where they go, they might be disappointed to hear.  When politicians engage with people who come to us to talk about their experience with banks, their one constant complaint is that they do not have access to people for face-to-face meetings in branches.  I might start with Mr. Crowley and Mr. Farrell of PTSB before coming to the other banks.  What additional human resources are in place to facilitate customers who want face-to-face meetings in banks?  In case I want to meet somebody in PTSB, how many additional people have been provided to facilitate that?</p></speech>

We also have 100 staff who are mobile, whose job is to be out in the community meeting customers in their local businesses and homes.  That is a considerable advantage to us at the moment because we are able to meet even vulnerable customers who might be unable to come in to meet us.  In respect of this particular challenge of meeting the increased account-opening work coming at us, we have added an additional 300 onto our front line, half of whom will be directly in our branches and contact centre, while the rest will be on our switching and operational teams to help with the account-opening.</p></speech>

On top of that, we are putting two staff members into 22 of the 25 locations as part of the deal, subject to CCPC approval.  We are taking on an additional 50 staff to support those 25 branches.  To return to our earlier comments, we want everyone who is an Ulster Bank customer today in those locations to join Permanent TSB, so we are investing an additional 50 staff for those locations alone to make it easier for those customers to join us.</p></speech>

To return to some of the earlier comments, the level of digital adoption is increasing week on week.  Last week, 72% of our sole current accounts came through digitally.  Even so, we are conscious some customers will come into the branch and we will help them to open the account digitally in the branch.  There is a mix.  One cohort of customers need a lot of attention and time and we spend that time with them.  One of the initiatives we have rolled out in Permanent TSB is called the "just a minute", or JAM, initiative.  Customers with learning difficulties or vulnerabilities can, without verbally saying so, identify themselves as needing extra attention and our staff are now trained to take them into a private area such as an office to spend that time with them.  There are many customers who, when they come in, we help use their smartphone and download the app and they will have opened the account in minutes.  By contrast, there are many other customers who do not come near the branch and can serve themselves at home.</p> <p>  In ramping up our capacity, while we have put an awful lot in place, we understand customers could behave in different ways.  None of us knows the exact timing and we talked earlier about flattening the curve.  Our commitment is not only to investing in the people and technology we have to date; if we need to do more into 2023, we will do that to ensure every customer will have the easiest possible journey across to us.  We see this as a great opportunity to get as many new customers as possible into our business.  They are our future growth, and it is a significant commercial opportunity for us to do that.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.903" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#U01900"><p>We cannot guarantee anyone in that regard and the customer would have to go through a credit assessment.  That is a requirement.  Nevertheless, there is no waiting time.  Customers can either come into a branch, go through a credit assessment and give us their financial details, or they can even apply online and we will contact them to obtain and verify their financial details in order that we can then make a credit decision.  We will also make some changes in midsummer whereby customers will be able to apply online and get an approval in principle, and they will then be able to upload their documents.</p><p>So if customers come from Ulster Bank then they will be able to rely on their Ulster Bank performance and credit history as opposed to the situation in the past whereby when a customer joined a new bank then he or she would need to create a credit history with the new bank.  There is no waiting time.  We are trying to facilitate all customers who have a requirement for a credit card, an overdraft or a personal loan.  We want that business and we want to help people to move that business across to us.  Obviously we must make sure that the product is suitable for the customer.  We must go through a proper credit assessment to make sure that that suitability is there.</p></speech>

We have already redeployed around 150 resources and we have on-boarded about 150 more.  We intend to redeploy about another 150 and we expect to bring on board about another 550 over the coming months.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about appointments, and Deputy Pearse Doherty mentioned them earlier.  Our penetration of customers coming onto the digital app was lower at the beginning.  We have worked through that and, as I said, we are now launching into 70%.  During that period we accommodated customers with face-to-face appointments in the network.  What we are doing now is that as we release some of that it means there will be much more capacity available in the network to meet customers as we convert those over.  It is not like they suddenly disappear.  Our colleagues who have worked hard in the network will be able to pick up on that extra piece.  There is another part.  From our perspective, because of the wide range of branches that we have, as many as 82 of the locations overlap with ourselves.  In terms of the Ulster Bank locations that exist, we have been fortunate enough to pick up a lot of the activity that we are seeing coming through there.</p> <p>  The additional piece is important.  To give the Deputy a sense of the scale that exists today, and even before we add on that piece, it might be important for Mr. Nugent to comment.</p></speech>

We have nearly 250 locations if one counted all of our branches and different brands across the patch so it is hugely important for us that we have those interactions and they work well for our customers.  We would do about 34,000 interactions in our branches with customers in terms of branch visits.  That is a huge part of our business and it continues to be hugely important to us.  We have about 1,500 colleagues working on that across, for instance, the AIB brand in our branches.</p> <p>  Earlier we touched on the call centre.  Traditionally, the guts of 600 staff would have operated in our call centres around the start of the Covid period.  That would be towards 800 staff and growing to deal with the change in the banking environment, the way customers interact with us now and the fraud levels.  The increased regulation with secure customer authentication has meant that we have had to really step that up and we continue to step that up as we go through the cycle.  There is the capacity that is needed to run a call centre now to deal with the extra initiatives.  For example, the fraud element, of which the Deputy will be aware from dealing with his constituents, is a hugely important interaction for us and for the customers.</p></speech>

So those areas were areas where we had to deploy our extra resources more promptly.  That and Dublin central, where Ulster Bank was quite strong, is where we have had to deploy my own offices on Grafton Street.  Our colleagues worked overtime, and did extra hours and work from early doors on this initiative but we have been about that.  Yes, we went to the hotspots first.</p></speech>

Obviously we are about that as well because that is the challenge.  We must make sure that customers come early in terms of that so that we are able to have the discussion.  To be fair, we are seeing a lot of activity on that front both on the credit card and the overdraft sides.  So customers are not as passive on that side of it as we might think.  They have realised that they need to find a pathway to move those products as well.</p></speech>

We overlap with most of the Ulster Bank locations that are closing, as in over 80 of them.  Today, we have Bank of Ireland staff present in Ulster Bank branches in Blanchardstown and Eyre Square, and tomorrow in Patrick Street Ulster Bank, actually opening accounts and giving information on Bank of Ireland accounts.  They are already up and running and live.  We will continue to support Ulster Bank in the various different spots that it feels sit needs extra support in and we will put staff in.  Specifically, we put in an extra 50 resources to make sure that we kept appointment wait times for customers down to a minimum and, if at all possible, accommodate them there and then.  We are putting those 50 resources in to be on the road, and to respond and meet customers at their homes or businesses where a little bit of extra help is required.  It is an important point to call.</p> <p>  We have spoke a lot about consumers here today.  Small businesses were affected by this matter as well.  There are quite a number of small business current accounts in the banks, and in Ulster Bank in particular, that are closing.  We have found that a small business customer requires a bit more help and wants to meet face to face.  We are increasing the number that are going into the branches by another 50 and we have already increased our contact centres by 100 resources.</p> <p>  Again, depending on what we see and where we see demand, we will make sure that we are flexible and meet those requirements.  The demand to do things digitally is starting to increase beyond just the opening of accounts.  We are already building multiple product application forms.  What does that mean?  Digitally, one can apply now for an overdraft, credit card and deposit accounts all on the one form and we will deploy that in a number of weeks' time.</p> <p>  This is all about trying to react as customers come in and see what the demand is.  What we are going through is unprecedented and it is really important that we are flexible in terms of how we develop.</p></speech>

The banks will become irrelevant if the customer cannot be served.</p> <p>  From the point of view of these Houses, there must be a greater emphasis on the fact that members of the Houses are persons of special interest in terms of security and I do not know how that came about.  To the best of my knowledge, I have never created a security problem, at least not so far, but I know that there have been security problems in the banks, and the banking system, and I am not so sure that the customer was always at fault.  I look forward to a response to what I just said.</p> <p>  The thing that I most want to complain about is the anticipated opening hours of banks.  First, it is not possible to conduct all work without calling into a bank, having a face-to-face meeting, talking to a person or establishing a contact.  That used to be a big part of security once upon a time.</p><p>The opening hours are so restricted that it is virtually impossible for people who are at work, on shift work or whatever the case may be to arrange to meet their bank.</p><p> A large sector of the security relating to the banks seems now to have transferred to the shoulders of customers.  It is a regular occurrence, particularly from the point of view of Members of these Houses, that online transactions are interrupted by some security guru or other on the basis they want you to repeat whatever information has been inputted and it will be verified in due course.  It is annoying, especially if one is in a hurry.</p><p> A large number of bank branches throughout the country have closed.  I do not know how it will be possible to continue in business without a number of banks available, open and dealing with customers.  Even the ATM in Leinster House was closed and taken away.  I do not know why.  The excuse I was given was that it was not making money.  I know of a few other ATMs that were not making money because the money was being extracted with a JCB.  It would not normally happen in the Houses of Parliament.  I am anxious to get a reply to that issue.  I would like an indication as to when it can be restored because it was a safe area for people to access in a city that is becoming increasingly unsafe to access ATMs in the open air.</p><p> I was recently approached by a customer who had a golden years account for many years.  I am not talking about myself.  The man in question transferred his account from Ulster Bank to Bank of Ireland and the same account does not apply.  What is wrong with cherishing customers who were other banks' customers until now and had to change over because their bank is leaving the market?  The over-55s and holders of those particular accounts are entitled to treatment equal to that they have come to expect.</p><p> I also wish to talk about phone contact.  Every customer needs to be able to contact his or her bank and not via a call centre or some other circuitous system whereby the emphasis is on no contact.  Customers should be able to contact their banks.  I know the lack of contact does not apply to everybody.  There are cherished customers of the banks who get that contact all the time.  All customers should be cherished customers.  We all contribute to keeping the banks alive.</p></speech>

I read the opening statements so I thank our guests for submitting them.  Some of my questions have already been covered.  I will ask about customers of KBC or Ulster Bank who might have distressed loans or whatever else and are under a lot of stress.  They now have to deal with another bank.  I am looking for assurances from each of the three banks that every customer will be dealt with individually and his or her concerns will be taken into account.  It is a stressful time for people who are coming with loans in the background and are negotiating with other banks, especially when they may already have been in negotiation with KBC or Ulster Bank and got nowhere.</p> <p>  My following question is for Mr. Hayes.  I have asked the question of KBC and Ulster Bank in the past.  Why have they chosen to leave Ireland?  Many fine banks are still here but there must be a reason those two banks are pulling out.  What are Mr. Hayes' opinions from his dealings with them?</p> <p>  I mentioned to the representatives of the two banks who were before the committee earlier that I am currently an Ulster Bank customer.  I went to one of the banks that is represented at this meeting recently and I had a positive experience.  However, a number of more vulnerable customers have come to me.  Mr. Hayes addressed this issue in his presentation.  Some older people are not proficient in email or online although I know others are.  Some need an extra bit of support, for example, to set up their direct debits.  Are each of the banks going to provide that support, especially to older and more vulnerable people?  Some of them are stressed about the fact they now have to deal with another bank.  They might have been dealing with the same bank for decades.  The change has caused upset, especially to some older people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.938" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim O'Keeffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#W00900"><p>The Senator asked about customers who might face difficulties when they come over to us.  As an unfortunate outcome of the crisis, we have built a core competence around dealing with customers who face financial difficulties.  Support will be afforded to people who face financial difficulty when they transfer to the bank.</p> <p>  Dealing with vulnerable customers is a key focus for us.  We have a dedicated line.  We have undertaken thousands of hours of training.  It is an area we survey and manage tightly.  We can already see the benefit to vulnerable customers who are transferring to the bank.  Our colleagues in the network, as I am sure is the case for the banks my colleagues represent, are visiting nursing homes to help customers who are facing challenges in moving their accounts.  How we are supporting people on the ground is probably not often lifted up to this level.  We can all be confident that support will be provided.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.939" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gavin Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#W01000"><p>My answer will be similar.  We are in negotiations with KBC, to whose representatives the committee talked earlier.  It is critical that when customers come across, they understand their rights and the way in which their accounts are managed in Bank of Ireland will be the same as was the case in KBC.  I am proud of our track record in helping customers in financial difficulty.  We have proved in recent years that our primary focus is to keep vulnerable customers who find themselves in difficultly in their homes.  Many of the services and solutions we have provided are working and have allowed those customers to maintain their homes.  That is an important part of how we conduct our business and it will not change for KBC customers when they come across to Bank of Ireland.</p> <p>  I reiterate with regard to vulnerable customers that this is a key time for us as an industry.  It is important we stand up and are counted with regard to how we support vulnerable customers.  It is great that so many customers are using our digital services.  We will be judged on how we support vulnerable customers as they move their accounts.</p> <p>  We have looked at a number of different types of journeys that customers might find themselves on and areas where they might find themselves in difficulty.  We are offering support.  We are training staff.  As others have said, we are making sure we are there to support customers and, if necessary, going to meet them in nursing homes, at their premises and in their own homes to offer that support.  We are constantly trying to change our processes to support customers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.940" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051800002#W01100"><p>Like the other two banks, we have, unfortunately, built up a core competency in this area.  We will take the time to look after those customers who are in financial difficulty and help them when they come across.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about more vulnerable customers, sometimes elderly customers, who need a bit of extra time and assistance.  As I mentioned earlier, we have launched a "just a minute" programme in our branches.  It helps those customers to identify that they just need that little bit of extra time and someone to talk to about the mad digital world.  The majority are going into the digital world but we all know many people who need a little bit of time, attention and care.  That time is available.  Our colleagues around the country are offering support.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Keeffe mentioned his staff are visiting nursing homes and my colleagues around the country are also doing that.  Even during the pandemic, they looked out for elderly customers who they noticed were not coming into the branch anymore.  In some cases, they even did a weekly shop for those elderly customers.</p><p>There is a lot of care going on at local level that would not be seen at this level.  Our colleagues do amazing work around the country.  We have an enhanced care team in our contact centre.  This is a special, dedicated line where the staff are not trained on average call times, call handling or anything of that nature.  They are trained to spend time with the customer for as long as it takes, listen to what the customer needs to do, spend that time with them to help them move across and look after their needs.  Hopefully, that gives the Senator some assurance.</p></speech>

We will give a written reply directly to the clerk to the committee on them.  I believe he was referring to PSD2, which is domestic and European law, and which the banks must implement with regard to strong customer authentication that requires a double-click for security.  We will come back on the ATMs, the PSD2, and the opening hours.</p> <p>  The Senators raised questions on those two very significant institutions that are leaving, one of which was in the country for 150 years and the other for 40.  Both banks remained after the crash when they had significant positions and did not cost the Irish taxpayer anything.  We must prosecute that question.  It is a fundamental question.  I am happy to come back to deal with that on behalf of the industry at a public session.  I am aware that some of these issues will be played out in the dialogue on the banking review, which I know Deputy Doherty attended in Tullamore on Monday.</p> <p>  Retail banking is a scale business.  We are a population of 5 million.  The cost of regulation - the actual cost to income ratio - in Ireland is approximately 65%; across Europe it is approximately 50%.  Let us consider the way in which our industry is structured with the cost of capital.  We must hold approximately three times as much capital as our European peers.  There are issues around security that we must address at some point in the future.  There are also issues around net interest income.  The Irish banking sector obtains 80% of its income from interest, whereas in the European case it is more like an average of 60%.  Every fee increase that an Irish bank has to propose must go through the Central Bank of Ireland under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act.  No other country in Europe has that.  The only other country in the world that operates that is Nigeria.</p> <p>  We have major problems as an industry that I would love to discuss further with the committee and with my colleagues in the BPFI.  We really must have a proper debate on it.  That debate is predicated on not forgetting the past, the reputational issues and the legacy issues, but also having the courage to address some of those fundamental commercial issues that are no different in other European jurisdictions.  As a country we really need to have that debate.</p> <p>  If I am an investor and I want to invest in any of these public limited companies in front of me here today, I would expect a return of 8%, 9% or 10% on average per year for my investment.  These companies are owned by investors.  These are public limited companies.  The European average is 8% and Ireland's average in normal times pre-Covid was between 4% to 5%.  If I am not returning equity then I am not going to have the money into my business to invest in technology and all the things we need.  We really need a serious debate about all the factors that are making the landscape for retail banking in Ireland challenging.  Perhaps that is an issue for another day.</p> <p>  I saw the Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes survey on Monday, which was independently compiled face-to-face.  Goodness knows, from a previous life I would probably recognise a dodgy poll or survey if I saw it.  This particular survey, however, showed that according to Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes, 82% of the people surveyed were either extremely satisfied or satisfied with their Irish banking service.  This is not the narrative that is out there.  I believe there is a problem in that.  The experience of ordinary people as they go about branches, as they deal with the digital offering, and as they deal with the call centres seems to be broadly satisfied, but the industry as a whole has this very difficult and challenging narrative.  We have a job to do, collectively, in addressing that and making sure of the translation of that.  It was a very interesting survey on Monday.  It was independent and nothing to do with us.  It was conducted face to face and gives some quite encouraging remarks, especially to the 22,000 people who work in this sector and keep the sector going.  We owe it to them to keep their heads up as we go through this very challenging period.</p></speech>

Good morning members.  I thank the committee for the invitation to meet with it to discuss the HSE National Service Plan 2022.  The plan outlines the health and social care services that will be provided to the people of Ireland in 2022 within the allocated budget of &euro;20.7 billion, which includes: additional investment in new measures, including the winter plan, of &euro;310.3 million; and additional existing level-of-service funding of &euro;727.4 million, including &euro;286 million pay-cost pressures for funding increments of &euro;39 million, &euro;364.4 million for existing levels of service and demographics and &euro;77 million in respect of 2022 full-year costs relating to table 4 of the National Service Plan 2021.</p> <p>  The plan also outlines additional once-off investment specified for Covid-19 costs of &euro;697 million including: &euro;497 million to cover Covid-19 responses, including but not limited to, vaccination, testing and tracing, personal protective equipment, and hospital and community Covid-19 responses; and &euro;200 million to cover acute and community-scheduled care access, waiting lists and waiting times, including use of public and private hospitals.  In addition to submitting a national service plan, we have also submitted to the Minister a capital plan of &euro;1.045 billion allocated in 2022, which includes an ICT capital plan of &euro;130 million.  The national service plan focuses on the delivery, improvement and reform of healthcare services while continuing to manage a Covid-19 environment, and it is prepared within the strategic context of Sl&aacute;intecare, the HSE Corporate Plan 2021-2024, the Minister&rsquo;s annual statement of priorities, and the winter plan.</p> <p>  Healthcare reform is focused on the need to change models of care and increase capacity to reduce waiting times, especially for those with urgent and complex care needs.  The focus of the 2022 waiting list action plan is for waiting times for hospital procedures to be reduced to a maximum of one year by the end of 2022, and the maximum time an outpatient will have to wait to be assessed by a hospital consultant to be 18 months by the end of the year.  In 2022, we are operationalising additional bed capacity, including capital and staffing, as follows: the final 308 acute beds from the 2021 national service plan, which included the approval of 1,146 beds; opening a further 72 acute beds in 2022; completing an additional 36 critical care beds; and completing an additional 258 community beds.</p> <p>  Reducing our dependence on the current hospital-centric model of care and supporting capacity building in the community is key to realising the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare.  This will, over time, reduce visits to and admissions from emergency departments and should lower emergency department waiting times more generally.</p><p>Through the enhanced community care programme and related programmes during 2022, we are progressing several initiatives, including completing the roll-out of 96 community healthcare networks, CHNs, establishing 30 community specialist teams for chronic disease management and completing the roll-out of 30 community specialist teams for older persons.  Through our reform programmes in 2022, we are supporting people to live full lives in the community, with access to a range of person-centred community services and supports across their life spans and care needs.  This will enable increased access to care and supports at home and in the community, thus reducing the requirement for long-term residential care and acute services.  We are working to ensure compliance with standards and to reduce the number of people living in institutional settings by providing more appropriate community-based accommodation.  This includes 120,000 additional hours of personal assistant supports, while 30,000 additional hours of home support are being delivered in disability services and an additional 2 million home support hours are being provided for older people this year.  This will expand and enhance supports for people to live self-directed lives in their own communities.</p><p> The profound impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health and well-being is evident across every sector in Irish life.  We are continuing to reform mental health services and to improve access, with the focus in 2022 including: continued development and implementation of the agreed clinical programmes and new models of care; reducing waiting times for adults, children and young people; and improving the availability of and accessibility to services through increased provision and improved community mental health services.  The foundation of a modern health service is integrated patient-centred care facilitated by collaboration between service users and all those working to deliver health and social care services.  Implementing real and sustained reform at scale is complex and must be progressed in tandem with meeting the challenges of delivering day-to-day services.</p><p> Despite the extraordinary pressures and challenges faced by healthcare staff during the pandemic, much progress has been made on adapting service models in line with Sl&aacute;intecare and principles of integrated care.  It is also fair to say that challenges faced by the health service and experienced by service users before Covid-19 were exacerbated significantly by the pandemic, particularly with respect to access to local community support services, for example, including day services for older people and scheduled care in our acute hospitals.  We are, however, always focused on delivering reform and enhancing the patient experience.  This includes: improving service access across primary, community and acute services; addressing waiting lists and waiting times; increasing the range and capacity of services delivered to patients in community settings; increasing bed capacity; addressing health inequalities; focusing on health promotion; and ultimately bringing us closer to the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare, as set out in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.</p></speech>

I also thank them for their tremendous work during the Covid-19 crisis and the lockdowns and the commitment they gave to their work in the health services, for so long and, undoubtedly, at huge cost.</p> <p>  I do not propose to go through the entire service plan because it contains approximately 170 pages.  That is for another time.  My questions are simple and straightforward.  My first query concerns the waiting lists, and especially the acute and special needs elements of those lists.  Apart from the service report, to what extent can we expect a serious attack to be made on the waiting lists during this plan?</p></speech>

Regarding the waiting lists, the service plan has a specific reference to a &euro;200 million allocation to enhance access to care plans and to give funding to a whole range of initiatives to address waiting lists.  The plan launched by the Minister set out a range of actions.  In summary, these are a combination of ways in which we set out to strengthen capacity in the public service.  Equally, there are ways in which we plan to utilise the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and the private hospital system for increased capacity in this period.  Additionally, there is a suite of measures to reform clinical pathways in respect of how people receive their care.  This is the approach and the actions contained in the plan.</p> <p>  We have had a horrendous four months of impacts on the hospital system from Covid-19.  Those impacts affected many of the actions we had set out.  We have a range of actions, however, that set out measures in the context of recurring funding to be allocated, and that will, ultimately, require further funding in the service plan for next year.  There are also actions that require only non-recurring funding.  Some of the actions to be undertaken are dedicated to addressing the issue raised by the Deputy in the other part of his question regarding people with special needs.  This provision has been allocated in the context of some elements of our community.  Additionally, a portion of this allocation of funds will be primarily targeted towards the assessment of needs process and to addressing the challenges we have in respect of disability services.  </p> <p>  Therefore, a range of actions and initiatives will be undertaken, including reform of how we deliver services.  An example would be people receiving care perhaps not having to wait for a specialist advanced nurse practitioner, ANP.  These are some of the ways we are looking at this aspect.  I refer to new ways of dealing with outpatients and inpatient day cases and of doing scopes.</p></speech>

I know these intentions are genuine and I agree this is the right way to go about it, but we in the midst of a waiting list crisis.  These date back several years.  It is has been indicated to me that children or adults with special needs are being told they are on a five-year waiting list.  I cannot understand how that could have happened.  I speak as a former member of the old Eastern Health Board.  If this had occurred in that era, there would have been an instant reaction.  There could not have been a situation whereby the parents of a patient might be told their child was on a long-term waiting list.  Something would have been done about it.  I need to know now what is being done to address these issues.  I refer to those issues that are current and to previous ones as well.  To eliminate a waiting list or a queue, it is necessary to start at both ends at the same time.</p></speech>

On the scale of the challenge the Deputy just set out, it is not acceptable or good enough for anyone to have been waiting for these lengths of time.  It is, however, a function of the many legacy issues that we need to resolve.  Strategically, the right direction to take is that set out in the various elements of the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.  These include reducing the pressure on our acute hospital system, delivering more services, and more outpatient services, in the community, having more intervention teams helping in the community and enabling more access to GPs and primary care for diagnostics to reduce the pressure on hospitals.  These are the right measures to take strategically.</p> <p>  The legacy problem we have will not be solved in the first year of the service plan.  We have been in discussions with many other health administrations, including in the UK, that have also been severely impacted by the effects of the pandemic.  This has impacted us, but we now have a good strategic plan that is funded.  The implementation of the plan, though, has faced challenges in the first four to five months of this year.  There is also a strike today.  The actions set out in this service plan, however, are the right ones to pursue strategically.  It will take time to bring this plan to fruition and there will be a multi-annual approach in respect of resolving some of the chronic issues we have with waiting lists.  This process is about reform and changing the pathways in which people see their care being delivered.</p></speech>

I refer to using operating theatres for ten, 12 or 20 hours, or whatever the case may be, to reduce the backlog.  Mr. Reid said this is not going to happen in a year.  In a year's time, the waiting lists will still be what they are now, with another year's worth of patients added.  The process will have repeated in the same way in two years' time.  Rather than allowing things to continue in this way, it is imperative that we use emergency measures to deal with the existing backlog and to prevent it from increasing.</p></speech>

Deputy Durkan is correct, though, that we must first get on top of day-to-day demand.  If we do nothing, it is estimated in the plan that approximately another 15,000 people will be added to the waiting lists.</p><p>We want to address that by staying ahead of it this year.  That is our intention.</p><p> On the wider aspects, Dr. Henry might talk about some of the reforms and more embedded ways of doing things so that we can get and stay on top of demand for future years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.962" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#C00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Part of our initiative to address waiting lists is to consider new ways of providing access to care rather than relying on traditional referral to consultants in hospitals with lengthy waiting lists.  For example, we are expanding throughout the country a virtual fracture clinic that began in Tullamore hospital.  This means that rather than waiting three weeks and making repeated visits to an in-person fracture clinic following an uncomplicated fracture, and that with the provision of extra physiotherapy and advanced nurse practitioners, we can provide next-day virtual fracture clinics with appropriate advice.  The outcomes are as good and there is a high degree of patient satisfaction.  This reflects much of the work that has happened since the pandemic began.  We have seen a huge rise in the number of virtual clinics, all of which enjoy great satisfaction and very good outcomes and come under the governance of existing clinical pathways.  This is one example of many pathways we are trying to expand and promote that involve diversifying the types of healthcare settings and professionals to which people can gain access to achieve the same outcome, perhaps more quickly and satisfactorily.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.963" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#C00300"><p>Having regard to the fact that money or financing drives everything, I am aware that the current budget is the biggest ever.  Is it sufficient to do what has to be done?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.964" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#C00400"><p>I will answer, after which Mr. Woods or Ms O&rsquo;Connor might want to comment.  The budget is not sufficient to do all that has to be done.  In one year, we will not address the really serious legacy issue we have concerning our waiting lists but we will start the process.  We had a short-term action plan from September to December when we were coming out of one wave of Covid.  We saw a 5% reduction in the waiting lists.  The current plan seeks to have what would be the biggest ever reduction, namely, a reduction of 18%.  As already stated, we have been challenged in the first four months but the aim behind the plan is to start to make significant progress this year.  However, no single year will be sufficient.  Much of the additional funding we received in the past couple of years, which was very welcome, has supported us with recruitment, but it has also been targeted at addressing Covid and its impact on us, whether that was through testing, tracing or vaccination, and also the dual pathways we have had to put into our hospitals.  It will be a multi-annual plan.  It sets out to address the issue in a way that we have not done before, and it sets out to make progress sustainable.  Mr. Woods might elaborate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.965" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#C00500"><p>On the point about the use of facilities at the weekend out of hours, we are funding the use of theatres and diagnostic equipment over the weekend on sites through both direct HSE funding and NTPF funding.  On the Deputy&rsquo;s point, there is no financial issue for us at the moment in seeking increased access for patients; the challenge is a capacity one.  Therefore, we are investing in all the capacity we can, including through using our own spaces as best we can over weekends and evenings.  That is being funded additionally through NTPF funding and direct HSE funding under our access-to-care plan to the extent that this can be done.</p> <p>  The importance of the pathways is that effectively implementing those that Dr. Henry referred to redirect the flow to some extent and brings people to the most appropriate place more quickly.  However, we are using our facilities out of hours and will do as much of that as we can this year, because the key challenge is capacity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.966" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#C00600"><p>I need to ask about the capital plan regarding new facilities and hospitals promised, over several years in many cases.  Are we in a position to accelerate in this regard?  The population of the country is increasing.  The number of people who will require treatment of one kind or another will increase and we will have to increase the standard and availability of services in line with that.  If not, we will have the same problem with a backlog in five years&rsquo; time, which is not acceptable.  Have we adequate capital funding?  It would appear that we do.</p> <p>  The role of NTPF funding is recognised, but we need an emergency response to the issues ahead of us at this stage.  It is not acceptable to have people on a five-year, two-year or one-year waiting list.  We have to get away from that.  Anything of help could be an improvement, but the fact of the matter is that we are long past the stage at which this became an emergency.  What part of the plan incorporates an emergency system to deal with the growing problems as they arise, knowing that we have lost some key people from the health services in the past three months?  Perhaps we might be told why they sought to relocate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.967" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#C00700"><p>I will address a few points if I can.  We can do nothing other than fully agree that the waiting lists are unacceptable and that we have to manage our way through.  However, we have to start the process.  We certainly have been impacted over the past while.</p> <p>  On the emergency approaches, I did not respond to one of the Deputy&rsquo;s earlier questions.  He is correct that one approach is to increase theatre utilisation.  There are good examples of hospital groups that have put in place change-management processes that account for the whole flow across the hospital.  It is not just a matter of addressing the use of theatre but also of increasing the flow throughout the hospital, which increases theatre utilisation.  Working with the services, Dr. Henry is finalising a plan with us that will start to address, across a range of hospitals, theatre utilisation, good practice, good processes and how we can replicate these across the system.  I apologise to the Deputy as I meant to respond to him earlier.</p> <p>  On emergency-plan approaches, the action list the Minister launched for waiting lists involves a process overseen by me in the HSE weekly, and jointly with the Department fortnightly.  It is integrated into the service in terms of the allocation of funds and expected delivery on foot of any incremental funds got for measured delivery against the targets for reducing waiting lists.  A new governance structure and oversight system are in place to do what is required.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that we have a very significant legacy in the acute hospital network, for sure.  On his question in respect of the capital plan, the plan is a real one.  We have a &euro;1 billion capital plan.  Our capital plan is significantly consumed by some of the major strategic projects that the Deputy will be familiar with, especially those that have featured over recent years, including the children&rsquo;s hospital, the national forensic mental hospital in Portrane, and the additional 120 units for the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  These represent a very significant absorption of capital but we have a range of initiatives to start addressing some of the real legacy infrastructure issues.  For example, Galway hospital has significant infrastructural challenges but so too do many other hospitals.  We have a limited capital envelope, it is significantly absorbed by some the major projects, and we are trying to utilise it on a multi-annual basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.968" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#C00800"><p>I welcome Mr. Reid and his colleagues.  I wish well those who are leaving us or changing roles.  We do not want to announce something that has not been publicly announced yet but there are many rumours going around.  If there are changes in people&rsquo;s roles, the best of luck to everybody involved.</p> <p>  I wish to start with page 37 of the national service plan, which refers to maintaining an acute laboratory workforce and equipment to support the required testing capacity.  My first question is on medical scientists.  Mr. Reid has rightly stated over the course of recent months that medical scientists, as well as many front-line healthcare workers, went above and beyond the call of duty.  In fact, he very much praised the systems designed and built to roll out testing capacity in this State.  Obviously, medical scientists were part of that.  They were working at the high end of it.  Much pioneering work is being done, as I am sure Mr. Reid would acknowledge.  Could he acknowledge that medical scientists played a critical role in testing and creating the architecture for Covid testing over the course of the pandemic?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.969" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#C00900"><p>I have two responses.  First, there is nothing hidden regarding new roles.  Ms O&rsquo;Connor is due to take up a new role as managing director of one of the groups within the VHI.  We wish her well.  Her loss will be huge but thankfully she will not be lost to the health system.</p><p>As the Deputy mentioned, I sent out an internal communication that, based on our commitment to Sl&aacute;intecare, Mr. Liam Woods will take up a new role as implementation lead to ensure that from a line perspective, they are integral in terms of inputs, design and ownership of execution. </p><p> Second, in regard to medical laboratory scientists, I recognise again, as I have done very publicly, that the role they have played throughout Covid-19 has been phenomenal.  Their response, commitment and the sacrifices they and many other healthcare workers made has been exemplary.  For example, if we take the infrastructure commitment that they and others brought us from, we had the National Virus Reference Laboratory, NVRL, at the start of this pandemic with a capacity of about 600 per week.  We have moved to a capacity of more than 300,000 in terms of Covid-19 testing.  That did not happen just by putting infrastructure in place.  There was also a process, change management and people's commitment.</p></speech>

They also play a critical role in the roll-out of acute healthcare services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.972" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#D00300"><p>Yes.  I was just recognising where they brought us from in a kind of wartime of Covid-19 but on a day-to-day basis, as we can see from the impact of the dispute today - Mr. Woods communicated publicly on it this morning - it has a significant impact on the running of the health system not only in terms of waiting lists but also emergency departments and flow-through in hospitals.  They have a very significant day-to-day role.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.973" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#D00400"><p>I refer to the recognition Mr. Reid has just given them, which I accept in good faith.  They are critical to the roll-out of acute services.  The issues they are raising have prevailed for a decade or longer and they have been in and out of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  We are being told that the resolution of this issue would cost about &euro;10 million a year.  The last time Mr. Reid was before an Oireachtas committee, he was with Mr. Robert Watt and there were questions - I will not get into the rights and wrongs of it - about a secondment of one individual which would have cost &euro;2 million a year.  The money was found to enable that to happen and it has since been paused.  We are being told that it would cost &euro;10 million to deal with 2,000 medical scientists who have a claim.  Why are we at a point where they are engaged in industrial action?  My understanding is that they paused any industrial action during the pandemic because they wanted to make sure they were in place to do their best, as Mr. Reid acknowledged they have done.  Why is this issue not resolved by now?  What steps will Mr. Reid and the HSE take to resolve it?</p></speech>

There are pay parity issues in regard to the grade referenced and the biochemists and career pathways.  When industrial action happens, in particular strike action, it is inevitable that there has been a breakdown in industrial relations discussions.  There were discussions up to and including yesterday in the WRC.  Our commitment is strong in regard to the WRC commitments.  It would be an engagement between ourselves and the Department of Health.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a key role in this as well.  Our commitment is to stay in the room and try to resolve this.</p></speech>

There needs to be negotiations to bring this to an end because it is going to have a big impact on acute services.  Already we are hearing about the possible cancellation of procedures, which is unacceptable.  We all want it to be resolved.</p> <p>  In regard to Sl&aacute;intecare, which is covered in page 16 of the HSE National Service Plan 2022, central to any plan are targets, timeframes, resources to ensure we can achieve the targets that are set and meet the timeframes as well as planning and proper supports and processes to realise targets.  Taking some of the big ticket items in Sl&aacute;intecare, what is the timeframe for completion of removing private healthcare from public hospitals?</p></speech>

Policy decisions are there on reducing private practice.  A key part of that is the ongoing consultant contract negotiations that have been going on for a really long time.</p></speech>

If there is not a timeframe as in "the HSE does not have a timeframe as to when this will be completed", that needs to be said.

That is what we have been told; that is Mr. Reid's job.  One of the key elements of it is universal healthcare.  I am not saying it is not complex.  Any plan has be underpinned by a target and a timeframe.  What is the timeframe?</p></speech>

A key policy decision for Government is the funding that will be committed over a multi-annual basis to give full access to GP care.  The policy decision has been, as Deputy Cullinane said, to start to fund it for six- and seven-year-olds this year and we are executing that.</p></speech>

Obviously, we have been severely impacted in the first four months and we are going to be severely impacted today but that is what our funding is mobilised to do.  That is what we are allocating the funds to the system to deliver.  That is what we are measuring our system against.</p></speech>

In regard to recruitment, which I believe is central to realising all of these issues, we had a lengthy discussion the last time Mr. Reid was before us on the commitment to recruit 10,000 staff.  There was a comment that we could, as a minimum, recruit 5,500 and maybe more.  Has that changed?  How close are we to reaching that target of 10,000?  In Mr. Reid's view, will that target be met by year-end, that is, a net addition of 10,000 staff in the health service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.996" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#D02700"><p>What we set out very clearly when we were last before the committee was that achieving that is a function of what we can achieve in the market.  We have the funding to do it.  We set out that we believed 5,500 was a baseline that we will achieve.  To give a very real update on it now, on average we have been recruiting slightly more than 600 per month net since the start of the year, which puts us at about 170 over the baseline.  We are running on track, above that baseline.  We are not running on track to the 10,000.  We are going to review the whole process with the Department and the Minister at the end of May.  However, there has been an encouraging first few months of our recruitment process.  That will include international overseas recruitment of nurses and very significant new recruitment processes for consultants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.997" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#E00100"><p>I will make a final comment.  I will not speak in the second round.  We are all committed to Sl&aacute;intecare and want to see it happen as quickly as possible.  Nobody doubts the complexity of many of the requirements to make it happen.  We will not remove private healthcare from public hospitals unless we resolve the talks with consultants, yet a chair still has not been appointed and there is no sense of when that will conclude.  That is central to it.  We will not achieve universal general practitioner, GP, care unless we increase GP capacity.  I would imagine we need to change the GP contract to ensure there is greater flexibility about funding and how we resource GP surgeries, which has to be a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  We are stuck in talks regarding provision for six- and seven-year-olds.  There is still no resolution to it and it is frustrating.  There seems to be no clear timeframe.  I have tabled parliamentary questions about the timeframes.  I have been told we need to do planning, to look at the consequences of rolling out free GP care, at what demographic changes might happen, and about all sorts of work that needs to be done.  I do not know if it is being done, but it is central to Sl&aacute;intecare and I am concerned there is not sufficient urgency about it.</p><p>I am concerned about the targets set for waiting lists.  They are ambitious but I do not see the needed resources to meet those targets.  I wish Mr. Woods the best of luck in his work with rolling out the regional health areas.  I have concerns about what they will be.  I think they will be central to achieving those targets.  I have a final point for Mr. Reid.  The problem with the targets set is that there are no local or regional targets.  We set national or State-wide targets where everybody is responsible but nobody is responsible.  Unless we start to drill down into each individual hospital and health area, the targets will never be met, because there are hiding places for hospitals.  We have to get real about the accountability if we are to have any chance of reaching the targets.  I thank the witnesses for attending.</p></speech>

We share the concern about the availability of GPs and the pipeline.  We see an increased number of GPs coming through training programmes and we are working with the Irish College of General Practitioners, which now has the training capacity needed.  We will thankfully see increasing numbers coming through that pipeline in the next few years but it is still a real issue.  We have provided significant funding to support GPs through the winter plans and Covid.  GP access to diagnostics has significantly improved their capacity and capability and is good for people using the services.</p> <p>  Regarding the commitment to provide for six- and seven-year-olds, negotiations are happening through and with the IMO.  I am confident we will reach a conclusion on that process.</p> <p>  Regarding waiting lists, resourcing and local targets, we are providing resources.  Some is supported by the recruitment I just spoke about.</p> <p>  I agree that accountability is much stronger.  We can have a national target and need to look at how it is broken down.  I chair a weekly meeting.  We look at the funding when we agree it.  Each hospital group and hospital has made submissions for money from the access to care fund.  We allocate it based on delivery commitments and we measure each hospital group against those.  Things happen, as they did today, but we have a targeted focus for recurring and non-recurring funding.</p></speech>

It would be too easy to pass by the notion that Covid has probably been a good news story for the HSE.  It is not over yet, but if someone had asked two and a half years ago if the HSE had the capacity to roll out more than 9 million vaccines, maintain our hospital system to some degree and keep our healthcare system moving during that period, with all the commitments required from personnel and the leadership required from the management and board, there might have been some questions about it.  I do not think there are any questions about it now, which needs to be acknowledged.  This will be the chief executive's first opportunity to move into a greenfield setting to some extent and set about implementing the things I imagine he wanted to do when he was appointed chief executive.  Covid arrived soon after that.  How close is the HSE to normality?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for his comments.  I worked in the private sector for 30 years and the public sector for 12 years.  I have never seen any organisation implement so much change over such a short time, with so many people and such a great impact.  That is what happened by the response of our health teams.  I recognise that publicly and thank the Deputy for doing so.  Having said that, we know the challenges we still face.  We were able to track during Covid that the public's trust and confidence in the health service strengthened, though it could be said to have started from a low base.  We know it is always fragile and could collapse quickly, but we want to build on it.  A key issue for our board is continuing to build trust and confidence.</p> <p>  We spoke about some of the challenges that are ahead of us already.  Sl&aacute;intecare is the right direction for the health system.  It is about relieving the legacy pressures on the acute system by doing things differently in the community service and increasing capacity regionally.  The other issues arising for me as CEO, which I set out at the start and which we have made progress on, include accountability.  We want to strengthen accountability in the health service.  Things will go wrong and we should support people when things go wrong, but equally, we have to have an accountable system that has open disclosure and holds systems to account where things should not have gone wrong.  That is something we want to strengthen, and that involves performance management, which we are rolling out and has not been rolled out fully across the health service to date.  It involves another range of strands concerning management accountability and clear lines of responsibility.  Those are some of the issues, as are waiting lists and Sl&aacute;intecare, which we spoke about.  Value for money and the best use of taxpayer funds committed to us by the Government form a key issue.  We want to give confidence to our funders, the public, that we are providing the best value for money in return.</p> <p>  A big challenge we have had and which I set out when I came in is engagement with our stakeholders who work with us.  There was a great example of that during Covid, with trade unions, representative bodies, Government and Oireachtas Members.  The public heard a much-strengthened voice from the health service.  That is good for us for the future.  We will all have different challenges and disagreements at times, but the health system needs to have a more unified voice.  The public has told us that is what they trust.</p></speech>

I just want to gesture towards the following point and I do not want a response to it.  There are a number of outstanding reports and investigations that have not been published and that would be a concern for committee members.  These reports and investigations range from issues like child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, to nursing homes and that kind of stuff.  I just want to alert Mr. Reid to the fact that these are on our radar, although I cannot go into detail on them now.</p> <p>  I want to raise the issue of the medical scientists' industrial action, which is taking place today, and it should not have come to this.  Every test, as previous speakers have said, is critical and dependent on the role of the medical scientists.  They made a presentation to us yesterday that was pretty factual.  This is going back an awfully long time and there are recruits being brought into the system who are significantly less qualified but getting more pay.  One of the lines they gave us was that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does not fully understand what is going on and that, if it did, these people would not have been allowed to strike.  There is a suggestion of a communications issue between the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the importance of their roles.  There is also a suggestion that they are leaking to the private sector and even to other better paid positions within the public sector.</p> <p>  I had constituents on to me in recent days about my local hospital, Tallaght University Hospital, and the Chair would have had the same communications as we represent the same constituency.  These people have had procedures and appointments cancelled because they were dependent on tests being carried out.  This is an issue that has its origins back as far as 2001 and a lot of iterations since then.  The HSE says it is engaging in the WRC and all the rest of it but this should not have happened.  The laboratory is the pulse of a hospital.  There are very few procedures, aside from scans and X-rays, that are so connected with every procedure that has to take place in a hospital and so many procedures simply cannot take place without them.  Will the HSE give us some sense of the urgency with which this is being dealt?  Their claims are serious and they are earnest and well-qualified people who see less qualified people coming into different grades in the system and getting paid more.  Will the HSE give us some serious answer on how this will be resolved, when it will be resolved and what steps it is taking to ensure further industrial action, which the medical scientists have said will have to take place, will not take place?</p></speech>

It is always a breakdown when strikes happen and I have been involved in industrial relations for all my career, but we are engaging in the WRC.  I would not agree that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not aware or that we may not have communicated through the Department of Health or with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the seriousness of the issues.  We would collectively be aware of the impact of this so we would have represented that, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is well aware.</p></speech>

There are other laboratories outside of hospitals that would also potentially be affected, including the blood transfusion service, which is not affected today because it is exempted in dialogue with the Medical Laboratories Scientists Association, MLSA.</p> <p>  The impact is immediate and severe.  While there are some derogations in place for urgent and priority work from working with the MLSA, to answer the Deputy's question directly, we were engaging in the WRC yesterday with a view to resolving the issue and we will continue to do so.  We cannot approach a situation where there will be two days of action next week without serious consequence for patient safety in the health environment.  The challenge before us is to resolve this before we move into further stages of escalation.  I am sure members are aware from MLSA statements and from its observations to members that there is a further proposal for three days of action beyond that.  Our commitment is to be engaged and directly involved in urgent dialogue to resolve the problem.  We have done so and will continue that until we have a resolution.</p></speech>

I want to pay tribute to Ms O'Connor.  I have known her for many years, both locally on the northside of Dublin and at a national level, and her service has been exemplary.</p><p>She has provided outstanding leadership within the public health service and she will be a huge loss to it.  I wish her well in her new career and thank her for all her work.  I also wish Mr. Liam Woods well in his new role.  I am sure we will be engaging on that shortly.</p><p> There has been a fair amount of talk about what happened during Covid.  The HSE showed its best side during Covid in terms of how it as an organisation and all of the staff responded.  Everybody adopted a shoulder-to-the-wheel approach which was outstanding across the board at all levels within the HSE.  Two key principles were followed during Covid.  The first was that we effectively had a single-tier health service for a long period during those two years.  That made a huge difference.  The second was that services were available free at the point of use.  I have thought about this quite a bit since.  Let us imagine a situation where the Government or HSE decided that people would have to pay for vaccines.  It is unthinkable that only those who could afford it would be vaccinated.  That would be a two-tier system.  Let us imagine that only people who could afford to do so could take Covid tests.  There are people who had multiple tests.  That is also an unthinkable scenario.  The principles underpinning Sl&aacute;intecare are to have a single-tier health service that is free at the point of use.  We saw those principles in action and how well they worked.  The concern is that we are now moving way from that.  Thankfully, we are moving away from the particular pressures of Covid - the big ones at any rate.  Given that we would not for one moment think of doing things differently during Covid, why are we reverting to a two-tier system in which money talks and it is tough luck for those who cannot afford it?  We need to preserve the lessons learned from Covid about those things that worked very well.</p><p> I will not go into individual services, as we normally do with the service plan.  There are many issues we could ask about in relation to staff, waiting lists, etc.  There are common themes running through the problems in the health service and we need to look at some of those overarching themes.</p><p> On Sl&aacute;intecare, I sometimes get the impression that Sl&aacute;intecare is in one place but the real day-to-day health service is somewhere else.  The Sl&aacute;intecare stuff is theoretical and many of the elements of that are not being implemented.  There are reasons for that.  The difficulty in recruitment and retention is a major stumbling block to implementing Sl&aacute;intecare.  I am also concerned about the talk of a ten-year implementation plan.  We are halfway into that.  It is not an implementation plan that achieves implementation in ten years but a staged plan.  Notwithstanding Covid, a great deal of time has been lost in terms of that implementation plan.  I am not saying that is the fault of the HSE.  This has to come from Government, as it must provide the funding and policy direction.</p><p> The overarching issues are principally to do with recruitment and retention.  Why are those problems there?  Why is it so hard to hold on to people and to get people in the first place?  This can be a self-fulfilling prophecy because the more people leave and the more vacancies there are, the harder it is to stay because of the increased stress levels.  We have seen a large number of people leaving.  One has to ask whether there is a cultural problem.  I am not sure what the answer is and what solutions the HSE is bringing forward to address the critical problems of recruitment and retention.  Will Mr. Reid talk to us about that?</p></speech>

I have often used the same example of universal healthcare in terms of what happened in Covid.  The Deputy used the example of testing and tracing and vaccination.  During that period, these were free, as the Deputy said, and prioritised based on need.  We worked down through the sequencing on vaccination and testing and tracing.  Those are classic examples of what a public health system should be about.  They are really good ones for us to leverage.</p> <p>  The second part of Deputy Shortall's contribution was on some of the themes and a concern she has, on which I do not disagree with her, that Sl&aacute;intecare can be seen as something separate as opposed to being embedded in the line system.  That is part of the approach in terms of new governance structures, with the Secretary General, Mr. Robert Watt, and I overseeing it, our line management teams having responsibility for it and Mr. Woods coming to work in a role to make sure the line is engaged in the design and implementation of it.  However, let us stand back from the Sl&aacute;intecare process, change management for regions and what happened during Covid and is in place now - Ms O'Neill and Ms O'Connor might want to comment on that - and look at some of the core fundamentals that we have had to put in place.  Enhanced community care is happening and that has been a combination of factors.  As regards community health networks, 96 teams are to be in place and over 50 of them are now in place.  We have been resourcing the community specialist teams, for example, for older persons and chronic diseases and illnesses.  Approximately 1,500 people of approximately 3,100 people have already gone into them.  The National Ambulance Service now plays a new role.  It does not only provide paramedics 24-7 and bring people to acute hospitals but treats people outside of the hospital system, including in nursing homes.  We played a new role during Covid in providing supports and commitment for nursing homes.  As I said, one of the examples in Covid, which we are trying to embed and leverage, is a single integrated process between primary care and GP care and the acute services.  One of the ways we have done that is giving GPs access to diagnostics.  There were 140,000 last year and we are up-----</p></speech>

They mean a lot to me.  In this room, the Deputy goes back further with me in my career than probably anybody else.</p> <p>  In terms of culture, the Deputy is correct.  There are a couple of issues in terms of teams.  Part of our challenge is that we are growing services in all different care groups.  We are competing and there is an internal competition taking place between mental health, disability, primary care, etc.  When we look at that in the round, there is something about specialisation in terms of what a population needs.  We have a very professional health service compared with many other countries.  We have many highly trained and skilled staff, which is great.  We need those people but we have to ask ourselves what we are doing about the lower end in terms of the whole population piece.  The Deputy will know this from Sl&aacute;intecare.  Our challenges and the bit we have to focus on is getting that lower level right.  We need the specialist end but if we are not doing the lower level right, it is all for nothing at the other end because we will just keep trying to plough people into a much tighter end of the pyramid.</p> <p>  From our perspective, in trying to retain the staff we have has to be about local ownership in terms of staff identifying with their local unit.  Our staff surveys show that people identify with their team or ward.  They do not identify with the HSE if they are working in a team in Ballymun or whatever.  We have to enable that centrally.  The regional health areas, RHAs, will bring us back to that with more focus on the local unit, local identification and empowering people to work for their local populations.  It is that sense of ownership and control that encourages people to stay and the retention is huge.  Between the pandemic and everything else, that has got a bit lost.  Hopefully, with the development of enhanced community care, ECC, we will get back to that.</p></speech>

That is why recruitment needs to be taken away from the corporate centre.  I hope that will be a key part of the regional health areas.</p> <p>  I know Mr. Reid and his colleagues have to keep the show on the road every day, they are operating at high pressure levels and they have to have staff in place.  There is a problem, however, with what can be seen as privatisation by stealth where there are difficulties or decisions taken that the HSE will bring in private companies to provide those services.  That is a real problem.</p><p>I really would like to get figures from the HSE at some stage to see how much of its budget is being spent on outside organisations, be they voluntary, charitable or commercial.  There seems to be a growing commercial element in HSE staffing responses.  I looked at Nua Healthcare Services recently.  It is getting about &euro;75 million for the provision of disability services and another &euro;22 million for mental health services.  It is a commercial company and there are lots of others.  A significant number of EY staff have been brought into the HSE.  This is creating a particular dynamic.  If the HSE is bringing in private companies to provide public services, it does not sit very well with existing staff and causes a lot of resentment among them.  We hear that a lot.  My concern is that there seems to be a trend towards outsourcing services and bringing in private providers.  Could Mr. Reid talk to us about that?  </p></speech>

It is needed at certain times, particularly during Covid.  There is also a requirement to bring in specialist expertise that we do not have.  We spoke about some of it in terms of cyber security.  There was a requirement during Covid.  There always will be a requirement to bring in specialists for periods of time and that is what we do.  Ultimately, I would not agree that we have seen services increasingly privatised.  That is because we have seriously enhanced our own internal resourcing.</p></speech>

It was quite a critique of where Sl&aacute;intecare is going and the state of our public health services.  It was a very thorough critique of where we are.  The association said that there was a severe shortage of consultants in the public health service and that 838 consultant places need to be filled.  Nearly 1 million people are on some form of waiting list via the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The association says that if this continues, the waiting lists, which are at the heart of the dysfunction in our public health service, will accelerate.  This situation could continue for decades.  Given all that, surely the issues identified by the association must be addressed, particularly vacancies in the public health system.  If they are not addressed, we will be having the same conversation next year, the following year and the following year.  The waiting lists for procedures have accelerated, particularly in the past number of years because of Covid.  If these issues are not addressed, Sl&aacute;intecare will be largely academic.</p></speech>

We spoke about some of the challenges earlier on and the contributions related to many of them.  There is no doubt that the recruitment of consultants is a major challenge for us.  It is a worldwide market.  Having said that, over the past two years, we have recruited the highest number of consultants on a full-time basis in many years.  A total of 406 consultants have taken up positions on a full-time basis in the HSE.  This was not achieved in many years over a two-year period so that is positive.  We are aiming and have funding to recruit more consultants.  It is a particular challenge in some parts of the country.  In many cases, consultants want to be in urban centres.  This is not just in terms of hospitals.  These challenges are also seen in community services.  We are working with the various colleges in terms of the pipeline and what is coming through.  It is a real challenge but in the past two years, we recruited a higher number than we have done in many years.  It is still a major challenge for us.</p> <p>  I think I covered waiting lists earlier but I restate that we have a very targeted and focused programme to start the process of addressing waiting lists but this will be done on a multi-annual basis and it will take time.  We have undoubtedly been impacted by Covid, particularly in the last quarter, but we have very targeted initiatives.  </p> <p>  We do not disagree with the argument that these are all very real challenges for the health system.  Their advice is knowledgeable but we have to start and the start of the process is recruitment, which we have funding for, and a very targeted focus on funded initiatives on waiting lists.  Sometimes one could come into the health system and say we can do nothing but we can, will, should and need to do something for the public.  That is the approach we are taking.</p></speech>

The Irish Hospital Consultants Association said that nearly 1 million people are on waiting lists.  What percentage of the 1 million people waiting on medical procedures will be directed towards the private health system?  We all agree that there is a two-tier health system in this country.  There is a private health system and a public one.  Sl&aacute;intecare is a policy that in some way aims to introduce a universal health system.  When one digs down, one can see that private healthcare is still as evident as it was a number of years ago and is still playing a significant role in the overall healthcare system.  This makes one think that private healthcare will not be eradicated but will have a bigger role to play in Sl&aacute;intecare.  What percentage of people on waiting lists will be directed towards private healthcare?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1064" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#H01300"><p>At a national level, there is no doubt that a significant proportion of the population - over 50% - choose to have private healthcare.  People choosing private healthcare is very much a part of the health system in Ireland.</p><p>Government policy, which we are executing, is to reduce the use of private capacity within the public health system.  I touched on some of that earlier with Deputies.  We want to do that and see that executed.  I do not know the exact percentage, but it is low.  We use the NTPF more and more significantly as part of the access to care fund for some of the more basic procedures.  Mr. Woods can talk about that.  We also use the private system now.  We use approximately 1,700 or 1,800 bed days per week, which is approximately 400 patients per week from the public system.  We are leveraging off private capacity to do that.  Overall, the vast majority of care happens within the public system, but we have our constraints and we would like to see more capacity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1066" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe resumed the Chair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1067" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#J00300"><p>To give the committee a sense of this in percentage terms, by far the largest amount of care that addresses waiting lists is provided in the public hospital system.  I am talking about acute waiting lists.  To give the committee a sense of this in monetary terms, the HSE is investing approximately &euro;1.8 billion per year in its core elective activity.  That includes day-case and inpatient work.  A further &euro;200 million is available under access to care, which we have discussed a little.  That is also available for investment in the public system.  The NTPF is investing &euro;150 million, some of which is coming into the public system, for example, the cataract clinic in Nenagh.  There are other examples of the NTPF buying within our system.  In terms of scale, however, and without going into a lot of numbers on patients treated, that is still marginal to the overall success but very important in hitting the targets for long-waiting patients.  That is probably the best way to think about that.  For us, the key is to enable our system to have the theatre access and the bed access to deliver on what is a growing commitment.  The bulk of delivery is still in the public system.  I heard Deputy Shortall's question about the growth and investment in commercial or private entities, and we can certainly respond to that.  As the CEO has just said, the safety net arrangement, which is still running with the private system, sees approximately 1,800 bed days a week used in the private system for public patients.  Of course, the intention of that was Covid response, and that arrangement will cease at the end of June.  From our point of view, that is just an idea of the kinds of proportions involved.</p></speech>

Approximately 5 million procedures in any given year are carried out by the public system.  We have very significant waiting lists, but significant activity does happen within the public system.</p></speech>

It is important, as always, to reiterate our thanks for the work they have done over recent years, which continues because, clearly, the backlog has to be dealt with now, and that is important as well.  I wish Ms O'Connor the very best of luck in her new role.  I have no doubt but that she will bring her enthusiasm to it.  I also wish Mr. Woods all the very best in his new role.</p> <p>  I wish to raise three issues.  It will be no surprise to Mr. Reid that the first relates to University Hospital Limerick, UHL, and the continuing challenges with overcrowding and patients on trolleys for protracted periods.  The hospital continues to be the worst in the country in that regard by a significant number.  At the end of April the Minister for Health announced that he was requesting Mr. Reid, as CEO of the HSE, to deploy an expert team to go into the emergency department in Limerick and to assist with the situation there.  Has that team been deployed?  If so, what is the initial feedback from it?  Mr. Reid might also tell us who heads up the team.  This is a very serious situation.</p></speech>

It has some real population density challenges that it has to manage, particularly given how the hospital group is constructed.  There is one emergency department across the group, so it has real challenges.</p> <p>  Second, we deploy teams on various occasions, particularly to go into emergency departments and to look at process flow and organisation.  In discussion with the Minister, we have sent a team of specialists into Limerick and UHL.  That team is drawn specifically from our performance management team and comprises some people who are experienced in process flows and emergency department management.  They go in very closely and work with the management and clinical teams.  Some of those people have been deployed to UHL already.  I will ask Mr. Woods to give the Senator a brief summary of what they might look at.</p></speech>

The staff, the nurses' unions and so on have looked for an independent review.  What is Mr. Reid's view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1072" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#J00800"><p>Each of our emergency departments has distinct and separate issues and challenges.  The issues in Limerick or UHL are very different from those in Galway and those in Beaumont.  We have specialists who go in and work with the teams and the knowledge we have within the system.  They know the solutions, so, no, I do not agree that a separate specialist review is needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1073" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#J00900"><p>I will provide a little context.  The position in Limerick, while it is very difficult and the hospital is under a lot of pressure, is, in fact, not unique.  The attendance growth we have seen in Limerick is at the higher end of the scale nationally as to what is happening now versus what happened in 2019, so there is huge pressure on Limerick.  That is particularly true of the over-75 category, with patients attending and being admitted.  There is a phenomenal pressure within the hospital system in Limerick and there are already active management responses in that regard.  As for the team to which Mr. Reid referred, there was an initial meeting on-site in Limerick last Friday attended by a group including clinical and some special delivery unit, SDU, support people and people from my unit.  They are working out an approach to the flow issues within the hospital and any measures we can take beyond the hospital that will support both the front and the back door.  That will include dialogue with staff within the Limerick-----</p></speech>

To be fair, the group had put down proposals on this prior to engagement with us.  Over the next two to three weeks, that will give us a position on which we can work with the UL hospitals group and the community healthcare organisation, CHO, locally.  It is between the two that we can best address the issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1076" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#J01200"><p>Mr. Woods mentioned the long waiters.  The most important thing in an emergency department is not the number of trolleys but how long people spend on those trolleys.  Trolleys are a feature of emergency departments.  If patients are admitted to emergency departments, they will be on trolleys.  Our challenge is more about seeing how long people are there.  When people are admitted to emergency departments, they get treatment, procedures and so on.  We talked about scientists earlier.  A lot of tests are done in emergency departments.  It is worth noting, bearing in mind that attendances at our emergency departments among older people are rising week on week and are higher than they have ever been before, that the national average length of time somebody spends in an emergency department is now eight and a half hours.  The reality is that in Limerick it is nine hours, so not that far off the national average.  Yes, Limerick has the highest number of attendances and is experiencing a surge in the number among the older population attending, which it has had consistently during Covid, unlike all other emergency departments in the country.  In fact, however, its throughput is not that far off other emergency departments.  It is important to note that.</p></speech>

The witnesses might provide a progress note to the committee, perhaps in three or four weeks, as to how the impact is being addressed.</p> <p>  Another issue is the HPV vaccine, specifically the catch-up programme.  I understand that the Minister asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, NIAC, for a recommendation and that that recommendation has now been sent from NIAC to him in the past two or three weeks.  In reply to me in the Seanad last September, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, committed to abolishing the catch-up fees for people who did not take the HPV vaccine originally but who then decided a year or two down the road to do so.  How is that catch-up programme going?  Have the witnesses had any communication from the Minister to the effect that the fees should be waived?</p><p>If so, when would Dr. Henry expect that to happen?</p></speech>

The pandemic affected many of our established vaccination programmes.  I am happy to come back to the committee with a report on the current uptake and our plans to improve uptake further.  Improvement was due largely to the work of advocates such as the late Ms Laura Brennan and others who worked tirelessly and selflessly to try to promote a vaccine that saves lives.  We have extended the programme, as the Senator knows, not just to teenage girls but teenage boys as well.  I do not recall seeing the mentioned letter coming to the national immunisation office regarding the pricing.  I will check that and revert to the Senator.</p></speech>

It is important.  We have seen the benefit of vaccines, particularly over the past two years, when it comes to saving lives.  A cost of &euro;400 to &euro;600 for a family whose daughter or son wishes to avail of a catch-up vaccine is no longer feasible and must be eliminated.  I look forward to hearing about that.</p> <p>  There was an announcement by the Government of free contraceptives for girls aged between 18 and 24.  Where are we with that programme?  There has been &euro;9 million committed in the service plan.  How much training has been provided on the long-acting reversible contraception and have many medics signed up to it?  What is the geographical spread and how is the information campaign progressing?  It is a very important area of women's healthcare.</p></speech>

I will jump to my favourite topic, which is always students and students who work in the healthcare system in particular.  How many student medical staff across the board are working in the HSE?  How vital are student nurses and midwives or other healthcare student cohorts?  Do they represent an important part of staffing in a context in which we are thinking about staffing shortages?  Are they a vital part of the staffing cohort where there are staffing shortages or how do they interplay with that?  I have other questions and will come back in with those, if it is okay.</p></speech>

The Senator referenced student nurses and midwives.  Approximately 1,500 come through in the various years and at each stage of their college course.  They are primarily led and supported by the colleges they come from and are deployed as part of their training at various stages, including in their fourth year.  They are an integral part of the support and learning process with services.  It is also key, and it has been particularly so over the past two years and this year, to offer full-time employment to all graduates coming through the programme.  They are an integral part of the pipeline.  We work with colleges on the work they do to ensure the learning environment is appropriate.  The student healthcare workers are a core part of our health system overall.</p></speech>

There are 23 different disciplines in the health and social care group outside medics and nursing, and they come and go.  Some may be in for a year; for example, a medical student may spend a year in a service while other students could be in for just a couple of months.  We have no way of knowing at any point the number across all the services.</p> <p>  It is important to note students work under supervision.  They are critical in being there but they are supervised.  In nursing, for example, they have staff whose job it is to look after and mentor students on-site.  Depending on their stage of training and all that, it can be a very different picture.  It depends on the discipline and the year they are in.</p></speech>

Ms O'Connor has said the HSE does not know at a given point how many students are in the health system.  They are being trained and under supervision.  There has been a major conversation around student nurses and midwives and whether they should be paid or remunerated or receive stipends, etc.  Should we look at this, even if it comes through the institutions?  It comes within the context of the HSE's work.  I hear all the time about students working in the 23 disciplines, as have been mentioned, and they do not see how they can continue or they are concerned about progress.  They cannot afford to do this because they may have to take time from their other work to do this training, etc.  Should there be more responsibility put on the Minister or whomever to provide stipends in order to facilitate students?  Will students continue coming through the system because they are pursuing something of a vocation?</p> <p>  I will jump to the other two questions before the witnesses respond.  I reference the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, report that was publicised at its conference indicating that approximately seven staff per day are physically attacked in their work.  What engagement has occurred with the INMO on this and what impact will the content of the report have on staff recruitment or retention?  I will come back in with the other question, which has skipped completely out of my head.</p></speech>

Many people, including students, are struggling with costs.  Student nurses, for example, get paid for their intern year or fourth year.  Other students do not get paid and it would be a complex picture if students were to be paid for their clinical training.  I do not know and it would be a very big decision.  As I said, it is bigger than just us.</p> <p>  We have had discussions on the INMO report and, to be fair to the organisation, it flagged its concerns on a regular basis in terms of assaults on staff.  It is something in which we have seen a significant increase, particularly in areas where we have unscheduled presentations, such as accident and emergency departments, acute mental health services, etc.  We are looking at that and there was a review some years ago on the safety of staff in those areas.  We are looking at that and working within the organisation and the quality and safety committee to see how we might examine the question again.  There is no doubt but that there is a challenge for staff working in some of those areas and in how we continue to provide services in a safe way.</p> <p>  We are grappling with how to provide services to the patient and protect staff.  We have a responsibility to our staff and to provide care but we must consider the matter.  We have different types of solutions in different services and areas.  For example, there may be security people in some departments and not others.  We are examining that issue and we have spoken to the INMO about it.  I do not know if it is enough to deter people from a role in healthcare if that is what they want to do.  There are many people working across our services.  There are many staff working in the community who may feel exposed and we have many policies relating to lone work in order to protect staff working in isolated services.</p></speech>

I thank the HSE for all its hard work as I imagine that period has been quite stressful.</p><p> I want to highlight the Owenacurra centre and the correspondence the committee received from the HSE yesterday justifying the decision to close it.  It was detailed and provided positive news about the expansion of various HSE services in the area, but unfortunately it did not really address the central matter in the committee's letter.  I am concerned that no independent report has concurred with the HSE's decision-making, and experts disagree.  That includes our own Deputy Hourigan, who is an architect.  Unfortunately, she is unable to be here today but she has outlined achievable plans that would allow the current residents of Owenacurra to stay in their homes.  I and others have visited the centre and met the residents and families.  I was affected by how passionate the residents and their families feel about this.  There is also a concern the HSE's consultation process with the residents and their families has been deficient.  I do not think it fits with the emphasis on community building and patient autonomy, dignity and respect that the Sl&aacute;intecare roll-out was supposed to represent.  Is there any possibility the HSE can reconsider the decision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1094" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#L00200"><p>One of the key drivers of the assessment that was highlighted in previous reports was how we look at the separation of day services and people who are residents.  Regardless of infrastructure and those issues, there is no doubt that, by any assessment, the rooms the residents have to live in and access for services and day visitors is highly inappropriate.  We do have expertise.  There is significant expertise in the HSE and we also engaged significant expertise outside the HSE to undertake the assessment of the building.  As we outlined in our letter yesterday, there are issues around fire safety, asbestos, mechanical and electrical engineering, and particularly the lack of social space in the building.  It is not fit.  I agree with the Senator but issues around dignity and respect cannot be met within this building.  We believe our strategic approach is the right one.  It is supported, and the Minister has been very clear on that.  That is the strategy we are working through with getting more people living in the community, with very good community services and locations.  We are looking at purchasing some residential properties that can be supported for this.  That has started.  We are working extremely closely with the remaining residents and their families on a wide range of bases and supports to do this in a very humane way.  However, our expertise has been very clear in its assessment.  Does Ms O'Neill want to add anything?</p></speech>

The correspondence and the previous discussions have probably detailed the scale of the examination, the basis for the decision and the number of expert inputs there have been.  There has been huge engagement with the users and families.  On her own visit there, the Senator will have some of our HSE staff who have been involved in the planning for this and the support for it.  Periods of change are very difficult.  Across mental heath and disability services, we have been involved in a significant number of transitions from existing arrangements where people have moved from their homes after a number of years to new settings.  They have been difficult, no more than they would be for any of us.  One thing we have learned is that, afterwards, they will reflect that while they were very reluctant, concerned and fearful of the move, when they made the move, they understood the difference it could make to the quality of their life.  Looking back they understand how much happier and better they are with the level of accommodation and supports in the new arrangements.  We could probably do more with the service users and families and with people such as the committee who have genuine concerns to give them opportunities to see the types of arrangements we have put in place and how people have reflected on the fear of change but have understood in hindsight that it was in their best interests.</p></speech>

I will begin with capital projects.  I have engaged with the T&aacute;naiste on the emergency department and maternity and paediatric unit in Galway and asked him to engage with the officials, which I believe he has.  This is a long-running project and I appreciate it is complex.  We have had commitments, and the previous Minister for Heath, Deputy Harris, received commitments from the Saolta University Health Care Group as far back as September 2018 that a planning application would be lodged before Christmas 2018.  Here we are in 2022.  Could I say that the planning application will be lodged this year?  Can Mr. Reid say whether a planning application for an emergency department and maternity and paediatric unit in Galway will be lodged this year?</p></speech>

I have been chairing over recent weeks a discussion with the hospital group and with our own estates management and services to look at the timeline and pipeline of infrastructure projects in Galway.</p><p>The pressures on that service are very significant.  I will give a quick summary of the key projects, some of which were just listed.  Regarding the current status of the emergency department and the women and children's block, the assessment review has been submitted to the HSE.  We are finalising board papers to submit to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform this week, in addition to a preliminary business case, which we are expecting to be submitted in the coming days.  That is a process that has progressed well over the past few weeks to get everybody on the same page as to the right strategic location and how to bring that through.  Separately, the temporary emergency department, which involves an investment of about &euro;13 million, is expected to be commissioned within the next two months.  The Senator has asked previously about the cardiothoracic ward.  That is valued at &euro;4.7 million and is near completion.  It is a 12-bed ward and will be operational by the end of June.  The oncology development is valued at nearly &euro;63 million and is at an advanced stage.  It is hoped to commence the commissioning of the building in the third or fourth quarter of 2022.  The orthopaedic theatres in Merlin Park University Hospital are worth about &euro;10.57 million.  Construction is complete and the theatres are currently in the process of being commissioned.  They will be made operational on a phased basis from June 2022.  The outpatient department in Merlin Park is valued at &euro;12.5 million.  That project consists of the replacement of accommodation for the outpatient services, which will be displaced to the emergency department and women and children's block.  The issuing of the tender for this project is due in the coming weeks.  I reassure the Senator that there is a particular focus on bringing all those projects through the key pipeline we have to get them through.</p></speech>

In parallel, we are in discussions with the local authority and there is dialogue happening there.  In the past, there have been significant challenges around what would go where and what it might look like when it goes in.

It is very frustrating for all involved.  I acknowledge that there will be a temporary emergency department but there is huge frustration about the delay on this project.  All I can do is keep raising it, as I have been doing, within the committee, with the Minister, with the Secretary General and at a political level with the T&aacute;naiste.

They will ultimately be the ones impacted.  There has been some frustration in trying to get everybody aligned on what site it should go on, where it should go and what will be in it.  That is at a local level, a hospital group level and a national level.  All the key players have come together and have agreed a site and location to move this through.

Cancer survival rates are thankfully increasing.  People are living longer so the likelihood of getting cancer has also increased.  The survival rates for breast, colorectal and lung cancer patients are worse in the west than in the rest of the country, particularly for breast cancer.  In HSE west, the cumulative five-year standardised net survival rate for female breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2011 to 2015 was 80%.  That is compared to 85% on average for the country.  Similarly, the rate for lung cancer was 16.7% in the west versus 19.5% nationally and for colorectal cancer, it was 62.6% in HSE west versus 63.1% in Ireland.  There is a commitment in the national development plan to build a cancer centre in the area.  It states, "In accordance with balanced regional development, a cancer care network for the Saolta region ... with a Cancer Centre at Galway University Hospital with appropriate infrastructure will be delivered."  The witnesses may not have these data now but I ask for a comprehensive note on where that is at.  We had a presentation in March from Professor Michael Kerin, which was well attended by Oireachtas representatives.  We have lower survival rates in the west.  There is a need for this centre and a commitment to it in the national development plan and Project Ireland 2040.  Is there an update on that?</p></speech>

However, we have seen improvements.  Looking broadly at what feeds those improvements, it is screening programmes.  For some of the cancers the Senator mentioned, it is also early diagnostic programmes and rapid access clinics.  About half of those cancers are diagnosed through rapid access clinics, which we have for lung, prostate and breast cancer.  There was a drop-off through the pandemic, particularly the first year and couple of months, in attendance at rapid access clinics.  There was also a troubling drop-off, as there has been in other countries, in diagnosed cancers in 2020.  The National Cancer Registry Ireland, NCRI, recorded a 15% drop in cancers in 2020, which suggests these cancers may present, as in other countries, at a later stage where they are perhaps more advanced and need more complicated treatment.</p> <p>  One of the actions we took in a national sense during the pandemic was to invest in and resource the rapid access clinics, to maintain as high a level of access as possible and ensure people did not present later in an upgraded fashion.  We invested in our cancer services with successive winter plans throughout the pandemic in order to address the drop-off in presentations.  In addition, there was a drop-off in surgical and diagnostic procedures, which was particularly marked in 2020.  In 2021, there was a catch-up nationally in attendance at rapid access clinics.  There was an increase in attendance, particularly at breast clinics, and there was a catch-up to the expected 2019 figures with regard to other cancer-related activity, be that diagnostic activity, chemotherapy or surgical activity.</p> <p>  I cannot answer the Senator's question with respect to the particular investment in Galway.  I will come back to him with a specific note on it. </p></speech>

That will feed into the winter planning process.  It is hard to believe we are talking about next winter.  The challenge in the west is where to put new beds.  There is not an obvious spot to land in new acute beds.  The solution in Galway has to be about how we access the community beds and what those beds do.  Additional beds have opened in unit 6 in Merlin Park to support the acute services run by the community.  We also have beds in some of the other community and district hospitals there.  There are very good examples, whether in Galway, Mayo or so on, of how the hospitals and community work more collaboratively around virtual wards, for example, and the acuity within the community.  We cannot necessarily build new hospital beds.  We have talked about the big capital plans but there is a lot of scope in this area.  To be fair, between hospital and community, Galway is one of the more integrated areas for ensuring people are discharged.</p><p>The critical bit for us is increasing the acuity for people who are discharged from hospital or to prevent people going into hospital in the first place, by ensuring the community is stepping up with community intervention teams, CIT, and outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy, OPAT.  These are all community-based programmes to support people who are quite acutely unwell.  That is what they are looking at in the west.  We met the group CEO and chief officer about what their plans are for the coming year.</p></speech>

It is quite a lengthy plan so I have read the parts relevant to my own region.  I thank the HSE for the opening statements.  I followed most of the meeting from my office because I am juggling a few other meetings, as are most Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la.</p> <p>  My questions are quite region-specific.  This Saturday after lunch there will be another large protest and public meeting in Ennis on the general hospital.  The feeling in the region is it should have a far more major part in meeting the public healthcare need.  What can the HSE officials say to people in Clare and the mid-west about the capacity beyond University Hospital Limerick, UHL?  I raised this in the D&aacute;il just last week with the Taoiseach and have raised it with the Minister.  There must be an answer in the region beyond UHL.  I believe that answer is in St. Johns, Ennis and Nenagh.  What reassurance can the officials give the people of the mid-west that the HSE is committed to bolstering public healthcare capacity in that region?</p></speech>

On overall investment in the mid-west there is strong investment going in community service to directly support UHL.  The Deputy is aware, I am sure, there is a 96-bed block in process at UHL.  The use of Ennis and Nenagh in support of UHL but also themselves is something we are committed to developing.  We have already put services in Nenagh with that in mind.  Those are contracted services supporting access to care, so there is a strong commitment to developing services across the region in both acute and community.  I am not sure if Ms O'Connor wants to say anything about that.  That is what I would say there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#N01400"><p>When accident and emergency services closed in Ennis General Hospital the whole argument at the time, which I did not buy into, was we would have centres of excellence in each region and people would travel beyond their home base for certain aspects of healthcare.  The problem has largely been consultant capacity.  It certainly has been in the mid-west, though not to the same extent here in Dublin because within the capital there are quite a lot of consultants who have specialties in the various realms of healthcare.  We do not have such a capacity in the mid-west more than a decade on.  Thus the closure of Ennis accident and emergency unit based on that argument has been proved to be flawed.  It does not work.  I am aware the HSE has opened up a local injuries unit and there has been capacity building and many positives but is there now a feeling within the HSE that diminished capacity is coming back to haunt us and maybe there is yet again a need for accident and emergency care at Ennis General Hospital?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#N01500"><p>I might take some of that.  On the reconfiguration of Ennis and Nenagh and the nine hospitals reconfigured under what was called the smaller hospital framework of 2014, it was the right thing to do for patient safety and outcomes.  In 2022, and indeed when this was devised in 2014, we look at access to healthcare in terms of outcomes.  Once a sign is put up that says "Emergency Department" people have a reasonable expectation the full range of services, the complexity of services and the expertise will be behind that sign to give them all the care they need.  We know that with the expectations people rightly have these days we are not able to do that.  That does not just apply to Ennis hospital.  We have bypass now for myocardial infarctions and for stroke. We are introducing a trauma strategy that will centralise trauma into some hospitals.  Generally speaking, what was replaced, largely successfully in my view, in the smaller hospital framework document was the concept of an emergency department that does everything with medical assessment units.  These are operated during working hours during the week and people see defined, differentiated medical problems within the capacity and within the framework of expertise in that particular hospital.  That has largely worked well in those nine hospitals.</p> <p>  What the Deputy said is also correct in that reconfiguration exposed a capacity issue that was perhaps especially marked in the mid-west.  We had one model 4 hospital, a centre of excellence as you might put it, with all the complex range of services including a cancer centre, and then the rest of the hospitals are model 2 without a model 3 hospital in between like those in Cavan, Mullingar or Castlebar, which have 24-7 emergency departments.  Since the smaller hospital framework was devised in 2014 that has been successfully implemented in those hospitals but capacity issues have come to the surface and are being identified through the additional 1,146 beds throughout the country as part of the successive winter plans.</p> <p>  On a safety and outcome basis I defend the reconfiguration in a general national sense.  It was the right thing to do then and remains so to meet the expectations of the public around what they can expect when they do into an emergency department.</p></speech>

However, the point is every single week UHL is breaking all numbers for trolleys.  It is debated in the D&aacute;il Chamber every week yet the outcome we have come back to again is another inquiry where we will look into what has gone wrong.  I am being told by staff within the hospital that when the top brass come down from Dublin or there is a ministerial visit, trolleys are pushed down all the corridors, including the morgue corridor, to give things a better appearance.  That is not how it is felt on the ground, not how patients see it and not how many of the front-line staff see it.  We are really bashing our heads in the region wondering why the HSE and Sl&aacute;intecare recommend the three new elective hospitals for Ireland be based in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  Why is it not on the agenda, given all that incessant pressure UHL is under, and given many of the HSE's own management figures in the region are pushing for it?  Why is it not being pushed forward?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy.  Just to reassure him, when the top brass come down from Dublin as he describes I have been there with the team and seen at first hand the very real challenges that exist within UHL.  I will say what I said earlier.  I have strong confidence in the management and clinical team down there.  They have some real challenges on a population basis and I wanted to publicly say I have a lot of confidence in the management and clinical teams.  There are very significant challenges based on it being the only ED in the region; that is for sure.  The solution is a summary of what Mr. Woods has said, namely, leveraging the minor injuries unit and the investment that has gone into Nenagh.  Utilising St. John's on a continuous basis is part of the solution but also some of the community interventions that have happened-----</p></speech>

The elective hospital has been subject of a review for a long time now.

I certainly would like to see that progressing based on those three sites.  The business cases are being finalised for each of the individual sites by the Department.  I would like to see that progressing.  I think the Government decision is the three sites and that is a policy issue for Government.</p></speech>

I refer to the major urban centres of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Every single hospital grouping has its own pressures and we get that but what the HSE is doing is building additional capacity in the groupings that already fare better than the UHL hospital group.</p><p>By not progressing an elective-only hospital in the Limerick, Clare and mid-west region, it is ensuring that their capacity stays at a rock-bottom level.  Yes, there is a new 96-bed block and inroads are being made, but in terms of meeting that absolute need for an elective-only hospital, that will be lost and it will not be fulfilled, I believe, for another generation.</p><p> I want to move on with my questions because I do not have much time.  Shannon Doc is an incredible out-of-hours service in the mid-west and there is a huge campaign to have it beefed up for Shannon town, which is County Clare's second-largest town.  When people there have an acute health need out of hours, it means a trip to accident and emergency.  They could avoid going to accident and emergency and avoid taking up a trolley in a corridor that night if there was 24-hour capacity in Shannon Doc, or certainly capacity throughout the night and at weekends.  I have written to Shannon Doc and it has been very engaging and helpful, but we need someone on high in the HSE to look at this.  If it is truly hub and spoke, then we need to build capacity beyond University Hospital Limerick.</p><p> I have written to the HSE and the International Protection Accommodation Services, IPAS, the authority co-ordinating accommodation for Ukrainians.  There is a HSE 17-bed facility, Inisgile, at Parteen, County Clare.  It was renovated in the past three years but has been lying idle.  Surely this is the site for accommodation for Ukrainians but no one will answer on that.  This is why, unfortunately, I have to bring it to the committee today.  The witnesses may not have the answer today but I ask, in the coming days, whomever's desk it is sitting on, that they would respond to this.  It is three or four weeks later and we have not even had an acknowledgement of this.  The witnesses might respond.  I appreciate the witnesses taking the time to be with us today.</p></speech>

As part of the access to care fund in the national service plan, significant advance funding has been given to Children's Health Ireland, CHI, to increase theatre capacity in Crumlin and Temple Street and also to get in further resources.  There are just over 190 awaiting surgery.  It is very complex, as the Chairman will be aware, and it needs multidisciplinary teams for each surgery.  We are anxious to tackle that and particularly anxious to get it back to the maximum four-month waiting list.  There will be occasions where it will take longer but the investment has been advanced to CHI and it is finalising a plan to start to address some of that this year.</p></speech>

The speech and language therapy services are particularly challenged.  It is one of the areas we would like to target under our own community waiting list initiative and the access to care points that were discussed earlier.  We have asked areas to come back with proposals under the waiting list funding to see if there are targeted programmes for speech and language therapy.  The constraint around that is getting the therapy time.  I should say that we have been successful in some work around psychology services for children, where, between overtime, out-of-hours services and so on, we have taken 1,200 children off the waiting list.  We are trying to construct something similar for speech and language therapy but we are more constrained by the available hours.  A number of the speech and language therapists are not available and they have other commitments out of hours, and we were not as successful in bringing forward some of the programmes on that.  However, it is one of the priorities on our waiting list access plan for community.</p></speech>

The committee hopes to deal with the matter at some stage.  I know there are some centres but, while one centre might be dealing with the lungs and heart, inflammation of the brain may be involved, which requires neurological services.  People are saying that the current model is clearly not working for them.  People may have to go to various different services in this regard.  Is that being considered as part of the plan?  Do we have a sense of the number of people who are suffering from long Covid?  I know it is not a medical term but there is clearly a great challenge in this regard not only in Ireland, but internationally.  Are we looking at tweaking or changing the model and establishing centres of excellence that people can go to?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1169" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051800002#P00500"><p>It is a good point and "long Covid" is the appropriate term.  We call it post-Covid syndrome for those in the early stage of post-acute illness and long Covid for those with symptoms that last longer than 12 weeks.  Our knowledge of this is increasing all the time.  Of course, when we were living through the pandemic, we needed to devise a model of care first.  The model of care we designed at that time, in consultation with the programmes and clinical leads, involved looking at the whole spectrum of illness including self-awareness, self-management, communication with GPs and specialist pathways for those who developed specific symptoms.  There tended to be constellations of symptoms around respiratory problems, some neurological problems, fatigue and so on.  We established a number of specialist centres.  Not all of them are up and running.  There are some staffing issues with some of them but Ms O'Connor has just told me that six more posts have just been approved and recruitment is under way.  At least three of those centres are now up and running.</p> <p>  As to the Chairman's question on reviewing the model of care and adapting it to what we now know, if more knowledge comes through as people's experience with long Covid progresses and if they develop other symptoms that were not highlighted at the beginning, we will, of course, adapt the specialty centres and the expert input to address whatever needs come to light.  The early impression was one of predominantly physical symptoms along with some neurological and psychological symptoms.  We largely worked with the respiratory and infectious disease communities in designing these specialist centres that we refer patients to.  As I have said, not all of them are up and running.</p></speech>

Gathering all of that information so that we can adapt services as they develop to respond to the actual needs is a very significant part of the work we are doing.  There are a lot of things we do not know with regard to the number of people out there and what they need.  As Dr. Henry has said, we have started and we are developing a service now.  We will continue to work on it.</p></speech>

I have seen the figures and they are very low.  I understand there were challenges with regard to Covid and so on but is there a plan to increase that percentage and, if so, by how much?</p></speech>

The screening age range is from 25 to 65 with increased frequency in the first few years, reflecting the higher prevalence of HPV infection in younger age groups.  It broadens out to five-year intervals thereafter.  In March 2020, just before the pandemic, we switched over to the HPV form of screening, which is more sensitive and less prone to false negatives.  It is more reliable and picks up more early-stage changes that may lead to a cervical cancer.  In recent months, we have seen attendances lower than the target figures.  We are looking at a communication campaign to bolster awareness and attendance and to ensure that all eligible women aged between 25 and 65 attend for what is now a more sensitive screening programme and one which has, since 2008, picked up quite a number of cancers and tens of thousands of early-stage changes in cells which present a risk of progressing to cancer, as is reflected in the more recent report that came out only in the last few weeks.  Since 2008, we have seen a reduction in the rate of cervical cancer of the order of 2.5% to 3% per year as an effect of this programme.</p></speech>

That will certainly be ready in the second quarter of this year.  It will not have the capacity to take over all testing, at least in the initial few years.  We will continue to need to use Quest Diagnostics as a partner.  This company performs all testing at the moment.  It will take some years before all testing for the country is centralised in the laboratory at the Coombe.  I foresee a need for a secondary partner such as Quest for some years to come.  To reassure anyone who is listening, Quest provides an excellent service.  That is reflected in Dr. Scally's review.  We are confident that the arrangement we have with Quest will support the programme as we transition to the Coombe lab, beginning this year, and in the years to come.</p></speech>

We have worked very closely with our technology teams to restore that link, which is currently being tested.  That impacted on the testing happening in that centre.

When we devised the model of care a year ago, the only data we had was real data from different healthcare systems around the world which showed initial high rates of symptomatic post-acute syndrome followed by rapid attrition as the months went by.  In other words, it seemed to disappear with time.  I got some data this morning from one particular hospital in which as many as 20% or 30% of patients who developed acute Covid and were hospitalised still had significant symptoms 12 weeks later.  That is the experience of one particular centre.  Part of the work we are now doing, in addition to building up these specialist centres for referral, is carrying out a survey to get a greater understanding of the service needs based on the symptoms people have.  Our awareness of the syndrome is evolving around the world, not just in Ireland.  We know the geographic distribution of Covid from epidemiological data received from public health during the pandemic.  We know that certain counties, such as Donegal, were particularly affected.  The specialist services and pathways we set up one year ago reflected where we felt the highest prevalence might be, based on acute illness.</p><p>As I said, part of the work we are doing now is trying to make an impact through the numbers.</p></speech>

If we go back to 2020 people were very acutely ill.  We said at the time it was not flu.  There was a high conversion rate to ventilation on assisted respiratory devices in a ward setting.  It was much higher than any other viral illness we were used to at that scale.  It was not surprising that we saw a large degree of residual symptoms in people in a post-acute period for weeks afterwards.  The question the Deputy and others have is about long Covid syndrome for 12 weeks or longer.  It appears less strongly related to the initial acuity of the illness.  We also see it in people who were not severely ill initially.  It also seemed less tied to age.  There is something counter-intuitive about the pattern of long Covid syndrome.  It does not necessarily reflect the initial acuteness of illness and does not necessarily reflect how old or frail a person may be.</p></speech>

As we know, the vaccine protects people from serious illness.  The point I was making earlier is that it is not necessarily related to the original severity of the illness.  We would expect people in intensive care or those in hospital for a protracted time to have post-acute symptoms for four, six or eight weeks after admission.  For long Covid syndrome, there is a looser correlation with the original severity of the illness.  There is a correlation but it is not as strong.</p></speech>

This is with regard to the national maternity hospital, which was signed off yesterday.  There is still a little hangover of an issue on it.  The CEO of the HSE is answerable to the board.  The board of HSE overwhelmingly approved the new national maternity hospital project.  Was Mr. Reid at any of the meetings where the term "clinical appropriateness" was discussed?  Will he rehearse for us again the reasons the HSE insisted on the inclusion of this term and what it means?</p></speech>

The board set out a range of matters it wanted reflected in the legal documents to strengthen and future-proof the national maternity hospital.  Something that is reflected in the legal documents is the issue with regard to legally permissible and clinically appropriate services.  The intention and driver of all of this from the HSE, and the board in particular, was to future-proof the maternity services on the campus.  These maternity, gynaecological, obstetric and neonatal services will be on site with other services.  We want the national maternity hospital to be protected for these services so that other services such as cardiac services would not merge into it.  It was about future-proofing and strengthening the case that the services set out to be delivered are those that will be delivered.</p></speech>

The committee has had pretty comprehensive discussions under the stewardship of the Chair.  A specific question was raised by a witness last Thursday who asked whether there would be an irresistible pressure on the Government of the day or hospital management of the day to state spare beds in the new national maternity hospital would be used for other purposes if St. Vincent's University Hospital and its emergency department came under pressure and there was spillover.  My interpretation is that this would not be possible because it would not be clinically appropriate to the new national maternity hospital.</p> <p>  Dr. Rhona O'Mahony made the point that the budget for women's health is often at the bottom of the health budget and too easily conceded to other issues.  Very often women's health issues become secondary issues.  The budgeting is also ring-fenced.  I assume this speaks to clinical appropriateness.  What Mr. Reid is saying is that every service to be carried out in the national maternity hospital will be appropriate to its range of services, and that when it comes to spillover or if the emergency department is absolutely crowded a Minister or the Cabinet cannot say free beds in the national maternity hospital would need to be released.</p></speech>

It was to protect the hospital so that other services not related to those to be delivered by it would not end up being provided there in any scenario.  In fairness, this dialogue and discussion happened between all parties.  All parties were in agreement that this scenario cannot emerge.  The intention was to strengthen all of this.</p> <p>  With regard to the budget, what is important in any future national service plan is that the budget is committed, as it is at present, to national women and infants health programmes, particularly to maternity and the wider services I have referenced.  This was the exact driver of the discussion and the debate.  It is to future-proof the hospital so the scenarios the Deputy outlined regarding other services that are not related to a national maternity hospital cannot end up being deployed in it.  We are confident, with all parties, that it is protected.</p></speech>

The Chair and I spoke about this recently.  Without making assumptions about the committee, we might have a longer conversation about it at some stage.  There are six types of hepatitis.  This does not seem to connect with those six.  Without breaching confidentiality, to which we are very sensitive, is it a cause for concern?  It seems to be of unknown origin.  What type of discussion is going on internationally on this?</p></speech>

We have had a small number of cases in this country.  I believe we have had six cases and another seven cases are under investigation.  Fortunately we have very good public health epidemiological links with other countries and we are getting daily reports from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre on the patterns seen in the UK.  Thankfully it is rare.  Some of the children get very ill, including a relatively high proportion progressing to needing liver transplants.  Tragically, some children do not survive.  It is a very rare condition but nevertheless a new condition.</p> <p>  In the best tradition of epidemiology we are looking at all the cases for common experiences and exposures and anything that suggests a common trait between them.  There is some suggestion, particularly from the UK where there have been many more cases, that it may be associated with adenovirus.  It may be a reaction to the adenovirus.  This is not yet a definitive position internationally.  Information is being pooled all of the time.  Our public health people are linking with their colleagues in Europe all of the time to pool information on the profile of patients getting the illness here, their experience and how the illness progresses.  It is of concern.  Perhaps by the time we speak again we will have more information because we will have more numbers and, perhaps, more outcomes from the pooled experiences of Irish, British and other cases.</p></speech>

I will go back to the termination piece.</p><p>HSE hospitals are kind of playing catch-up in this regard.  A number of them are not providing termination services - I understand that only ten out of 18 were doing so up to last year.  Clearly, that is not good enough.  The Minister stated that the number might get up to 14 this year.  I am just flagging this as something we are watching in the context of the recent debate.  The witnesses may not have anticipated this question, and I would be happy with a written answer, but they might be able to give us some of the reasons this is happening.</p></speech>

We are all with the Minister on this.  We have to, and want to, get all the maternity hospitals providing this key service for women, and we are committed to doing so.  Dr. Henry might outline some of the rationale behind that and some of the challenges to getting there.</p></speech>

Yes, we absolutely want this service to be delivered in all our maternity hospitals, as is right.  We are up to 11 hospitals now that are doing so, with Sligo hospital being the most recent one to come on board.  For the remaining hospitals, we are working with the management and clinicians in each of them and linking some of the new consultant appointments to provision of this service.  For example, in St. Luke's in Kilkenny, in Kerry, Cavan and in Portiuncula hospital, the full range of services will be provided once the new consultants are in post.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, there needs to be a hospital service at between ten and 12 weeks to provide for surgical or medical termination.  A named consultant presence to take referrals for women and to carry out the terminations is essential.  In the four hospitals to which I referred, this has been part of our discussions regarding the new consultants that have been provided to support the service.  They must start up the service once these posts are in place.  My hope is that it will be provided in those hospitals this year.</p> <p>  In the remaining hospitals - Letterkenny, Portlaoise, Tipperary and Wexford - there are some individual issues.  We have 90 maternity units and we would like each of them to have six consultants on the rota.  In the case of this particular service, it is more likely that not all the consultants and other staff would be signing up to provide it.  We are sometimes relying on a small number of staff or, in particular in the smaller units, just one or two individuals to carry out the service.  We are working with those hospitals, which tend to be the ones that have existing staffing difficulties at consultant level in terms of getting permanent staff on board or filling vacancies.  We are working with them to link new consultant posts with the service.  I cannot give the Deputy the same assurance that I can give in respect of the other four hospitals in terms of the service being provided this year.</p></speech>

It is about ensuring that if pressure comes from other areas of speciality within a general hospital, such as cancer care or cardiac care, or there is potential overcrowding in the emergency department, and if there are free beds in maternity, those beds simply cannot be encroached on by other professional medical services.  The maternity hospital is ring-fenced, in effect, for maternity and neonatal services.  As I understand it, that is the context from which the term "clinically appropriate" derives.</p></speech>

It is about future-proofing.  Obviously, the duration of this project is over the significantly long term.  We wanted to make sure the service is ring-fenced, at all stages into the future, for women and infants programmes, including maternity, neonatal, gynaecological and obstetrics, in order to protect the service and ensure it is there for the future, over its entire lifespan, and will not be compromised.  In fairness to the dialogue that happened with partners after the discussion with the board, everybody was committed to that principle.</p></speech>

There are similar issues with Westdoc in Galway and the expansion of GP services to my own village of Moycullen as well as to Rosscahill and Oughterard.  I have heard, although I have not had it substantiated, that there may be a reluctance among Galway city GPs to carry out that expansion.  They feel they have enough to do in the city and they do not wish to take on new work in those locations.  Is this something the witnesses have encountered in other areas?  Will funding solve it or is it an issue of whether personnel are willing to take up that extra responsibility and extra work?</p></speech>

We just do not have enough GPs, full stop, for whatever we want them to do.  What we are seeing across the board at the minute - members may be hearing it from their constituents - is that there are challenges for people in accessing the services of GPs.  To take on an out-of-hours service requires GPs to do many more shifts, unless they employ another doctor to take that work on from afar.  For local out-of-hours services, where local GPs provide the service, to expand basically means doing more shifts.  Depending on the capacity that is available, that can be a decider for them.  Some out-of-hours services bring in doctors just to provide that service, rather than local GPs doing it.  It depends on the specifics.</p> <p>  In terms of the funding available for out-of-hours services, that is something we have to look at, as I said earlier, in terms of the demand that is currently being experienced, particularly in light of the response to the Ukrainian people.  Notwithstanding that, we know we have been very challenged in terms of GP service provision and this is something we are looking at in terms of GP training numbers and all of that.  I imagine the difficulty with the out-of-hours service in the Senator's area is related to that broader issue as well as to the availability of GPs.  My colleague, Ms O'Neill, might have more detail on that.</p></speech>

It absolutely is about the utilisation of the available resource, whether that is the GPs who are currently in practice and-or other GPs who are not currently in practice but are providing other, out-of-hours services.  To be fair, discussions are under way directly with the Irish College of General Practitioners around how best we can model the service based on the resources we have and the resources we are seeing coming through.</p></speech>

Basically, it has introduced a novel approach to try to deal with eye care waiting lists.  It has agreed to collaborate and to pool resources to come up with new ways of approaching it.  Its members gave a presentation here a couple of weeks ago and they have asked to appear before this committee.  It appears that some of the longest waiting lists are in the area of eye care, with approximately 500,000 people throughout the country on a waiting list for procedures and so forth.

We have an ageing population and, unfortunately, an ageing population is a time bomb particularly in the area of eye care, be it diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts and so forth.  Unless we get on top of it in the next few years, we will become overwhelmed.  Some would say we are already overwhelmed when there are buses bringing people to the North to get cataracts done.  It is a failure of our system when that happens.  Our objective should be to ensure that this type of thing does not happen and that, in fact, people would be coming from the North to us for care.  That is the level I would like to see in eye care.  We have some of the best brains in the world in this country.  They are sought after to speak in America, throughout Europe and so forth.  We should use them to eliminate waiting lists because it can be done.</p></speech>

I wish them well in the roll-out of the plan.  They mentioned the 120,000 additional hours of personal assistant supports and 30,000 additional hours of home support.  I suppose it will raise people's expectations in that regard.  There is also the target of eight hours in emergency departments.  Following this meeting, people will say they know of someone who was there for 24 hours, two days or whatever else.  The plan is in place now and the expectations of people will rise and it is to be hoped that we will be able to fulfil all their expectations.</p> <p>  Before we finish, I also thank Ms Anne O'Connor and I wish her well in her new role.  I say that sincerely on behalf of the committee.  The HSE is facing huge challenges with some of the changes and the institutional memory it is losing, but they are the challenges it will have to face in the future.</p></speech>

D&aacute; dtuigfeadh daoine &oacute;ga na deiseanna iontacha at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il, n&iacute; bheadh drogall orthu &iacute; a labhairt.  T&aacute;imid ag brath ar dhaoine &oacute;ga chun pobal Gaeilge nua-aoiseach a chruth&uacute;.

Nach bhfuilimid ag iarraidh pobal Gaeilge a chruth&uacute; ar fud na t&iacute;re?  Ba cheart go mbeadh na deiseanna c&eacute;anna ar f&aacute;il i ngach baile in &Eacute;irinn d&rsquo;&eacute;inne at&aacute; ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  T&aacute; s&eacute; de cheart acu an deis sin a bheith acu mar gur teanga oifigi&uacute;il na t&iacute;re &iacute;.</p> <p>  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th go bhfuilimid teoranta i dtaca le pobal Gaeilge a chruth&uacute; in &Eacute;irinn amh&aacute;in?

Is pribhl&eacute;id dom labhairt leis an gcoiste inniu faoi mo thuiscint agus mo thuairim&iacute; f&eacute;in maidir le pobal nua-aoiseach Gaeilge a chruth&uacute; anseo in &Eacute;irinn.  Caid&eacute; at&aacute; i gceist le pobal nua-aoiseach?  Caid&eacute; at&aacute;imid ag cuardach agus caid&eacute; at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th?  Nach topaic ollmh&oacute;r &eacute;?  T&aacute; seanfhocal ann, agus s&iacute;lim go bhfuil s&eacute; s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilte le r&aacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; ar eolas againn uilig ag an phointe seo in&aacute;r saol Gaeilge: n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag smaoineamh air seo agus m&eacute; i mo shu&iacute; sa bhaile ag scr&iacute;obh amach na focail seo.  T&aacute; againn ar an l&aacute;mh amh&aacute;in "n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile" agus, ar an l&aacute;mh eile, "comhlacht aontaithe de dhaoine aonair".  Is ionann an d&aacute; rud.  Is ionann pobal agus daoine le sprioc amh&aacute;in ag teacht le ch&eacute;ile le bheith aontaithe.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir a dh&eacute;anamh ach dul i neart ansin.  Is f&eacute;idir linn pobal nua-aoiseach a chruth&uacute; anseo in &Eacute;irinn gan amhras.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n d&oacute;igheanna chun an aidhm sin at&aacute; againn a chur i bhfeidhm.</p> <p>  Cad iad na ruda&iacute; simpl&iacute; a thiocfadh linn a dh&eacute;anamh chun pobal nua-aoiseach Gaeilge a chur chun cinn?  T&aacute; a fhios againn nach bhfuil gach duine den intinn ch&eacute;anna maidir leis an nGaeilge.  N&iacute;l gach duine in aon cheantar ag iarraidh &aacute;r dteanga bhinn a fheice&aacute;il.  N&iacute; br&eacute;ag le r&aacute; &eacute; go raibh an Ghaeilge ceangailte leis an bhochtanas i ndiaidh an Ocrais Mh&oacute;ir, agus bh&iacute; s&iacute; ceangailte le st&aacute;das &iacute;seal s&oacute;isialta.  N&iacute; raibh muid ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus, thar na blianta, sh&iacute;l formh&oacute;r na ndaoine nach raibh an Ghaeilge t&aacute;bhachtach.  N&iacute;or sh&iacute;l muid go raibh s&iacute; de dh&iacute;th orainn.  Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; sin mar go bhfuil suim sa Ghaeilge de dh&iacute;th.  T&aacute; s&iacute; de dh&iacute;th orainn uilig mar Ghaeil &oacute;ga.  T&aacute; s&eacute; de dh&iacute;th go mbeidh an Ghaeilge thart orainn go n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha.  T&aacute; an t&eacute;arma sin, "go n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha", t&aacute;bhachtach.</p> <p>  Go pearsanta, t&aacute; s&eacute; n&iacute;os fusa dom an B&eacute;arla a labhairt.  Bh&iacute; an B&eacute;arla thart orm agus m&eacute; ag f&aacute;s an&iacute;os.  D'fh&aacute;s m&eacute; an&iacute;os thuas sna S&eacute; Chontae agus t&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil mo chuid taith&iacute; difri&uacute;il &oacute;n taith&iacute; a bh&iacute; ag na baill.  T&aacute; s&eacute; n&iacute;os fusa an B&eacute;arla a labhairt.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir &eacute; sin a sh&eacute;anadh.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th?  Is &eacute; an B&eacute;arla an teanga at&aacute; thart orainn an t-am ar fad.  B&iacute;onn tionchar aige sin orainn.  T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh &aacute;r dteanga a labhairt agus tionchar Gaeilge a bheith orainn fosta.  Is f&eacute;idir leis an d&aacute; theanga a mhaireacht&aacute;il le ch&eacute;ile.  Bu&iacute;ochas le Dia, th&aacute;inig athbheochan na Gaeilge, a bhu&iacute; le Conradh na Gaeilge agus leis an ts&aacute;robair a rinneadh.  Bh&iacute; r&oacute;l nach beag ag na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta, TG4, Col&aacute;iste Lurgan agus na dl&uacute;thdhiosca&iacute; ceoil - na ruda&iacute; simpl&iacute;.</p> <p>  N&iacute;l aon seans againn Gaeilge bhinn n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha a chleachtadh mar ph&aacute;irt don saol &oacute; l&aacute; go l&aacute; nuair nach bhfuilimid ar scoil.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil pobal nua-aoiseach Gaeilge de dh&iacute;th orainn.  N&iacute; bheidh an Ghaeilge f&oacute;s beo sa tsocha&iacute; n&aacute; sa todhcha&iacute; gan an cine&aacute;l br&uacute; sin chun an Ghaeilge n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha a thabhairt isteach sa phobal at&aacute; againn cheana f&eacute;in.  An ionann pobal agus &aacute;iteanna aitheanta inar f&eacute;idir le Gaeil teacht le ch&eacute;ile?</p><p>B'fh&eacute;idir nach bhfuil gach duine r&eacute;idh an Ghaeilge a aithint go f&oacute;ill ach caithfidh go mbeadh &aacute;iteanna ainmnithe do Ghaeilgeoir&iacute; at&aacute; ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a spreagadh.  Teasta&iacute;onn &aacute;iteanna ar leith i ngach cheantar le teacht le ch&eacute;ile ag aois ar bith n&oacute; ag leibh&eacute;al ar bith, &aacute;iteanna ar leith do na Gaeilgeoir&iacute; le teacht le ch&eacute;ile agus an Ghaeilge a labhairt go n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha.  Is f&eacute;idir seo a bheith againn i rud simpl&iacute; cos&uacute;il le caif&eacute;.  Is f&eacute;idir an raidi&oacute; Gaeilge a chur sa ch&uacute;l agus bunt&aacute;iste eile a bheadh ann n&aacute; go mbeadh poist ar f&aacute;il do na Gaeilgeoir&iacute; &aacute;iti&uacute;la.  Bheadh daoine ag iarraidh am a chaitheamh anseo.  &Aacute;it simpl&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th orainn; gn&aacute;th &aacute;it Gaeilge don ghn&aacute;th Gaeilgeoir.  An ann pobal Gaeilge nua-aoiseach agus Gaelscoileanna teacht le ch&eacute;ile c&uacute;pla l&aacute; sa m&iacute;osa chun Gaeilge a spreagadh i measc ar phobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la?</p><p> Ceann de na pr&iacute;omh-f&aacute;thanna ar th&aacute;inig athbheochan ar an Ghaeilge n&aacute; na Gaelscoileanna.  Is muid na Gaeil &oacute;ga; is muid an ghl&uacute;in nua.  Agus nuair a bh&iacute;onn muid ag teacht le ch&eacute;ile, thig leat dra&iacute;ocht &aacute;r dteanga a fheice&aacute;il thart ar na leana&iacute; ar fad agus is f&eacute;idir an pobal a fhorbairt agus a choth&uacute;, c&uacute;pla l&aacute; sa m&iacute;osa fi&uacute;.  T&aacute; an tionchar sin de dh&iacute;th orainn agus t&aacute; an dra&iacute;ocht sin ag imeacht uainn gan a bheith le ch&eacute;ile.  A chairde Gael, t&aacute; m&eacute; ag labhairt libh anois.  Is muid anam &aacute;r dteanga.  T&aacute; s&eacute; de dh&iacute;th orainn teacht le ch&eacute;ile mar phobal chun an Ghaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm ar a ch&eacute;ile.  T&aacute; s&eacute; chomh simpl&iacute; sin ach an bhfuil an mhaoin againn?</p><p> Cad &eacute; at&aacute; againn nach raibh ag na Gaeilgeoir&iacute; romhainn?  Is &eacute; sin na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta.  Cad &eacute; a bhfuil n&iacute;os nua-aimseartha agus n&iacute;os coitianta do Ghaeil &oacute;ga n&aacute; na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta?  T&aacute; an fhianaise againn go bhfuil muid in ann pobal a chruth&uacute; ar l&iacute;ne.  Smaoinigh faoi na milli&uacute;in daoine ag dul i dteagmhail le ch&eacute;ile gach l&aacute; tr&iacute;d na me&aacute;in cos&uacute;il le TikTok, Facebook, Instagram agus Snapchat.  Nuair a bh&iacute; Covid ag an phointe is measa, bh&iacute; muid uilig ag maireacht&aacute;il ar l&iacute;ne chun coinne&aacute;il suas chun d&aacute;ta len&aacute;r gcairde agus len&aacute;r dteaghlaigh.  Bh&iacute; pobal againn ansin.  Bh&iacute; pobal againn tr&iacute;d na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta.  C&eacute; at&aacute; le r&aacute; nach bhfuil muid in ann sin a bheith againn ar&iacute;s, ach tr&iacute;d &aacute;r dteanga dh&uacute;chais?  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta &eacute;al&uacute; ort d&oacute;igh ar bith.  Cad &eacute; faoi &aacute;it a chruth&uacute; d&uacute;inn ar an Idirl&iacute;on, agus n&iacute;l m&eacute; ag caint faoi na cluich&iacute; Gaeilge r&iacute;omhaire teoranta a thugann na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; d&uacute;inn ar scoil.  T&aacute; ard&aacute;in Ghaeilge cos&uacute;il le Facebook n&oacute; TikTok de dh&iacute;th chun atmaisf&eacute;ar Gaeilge binn a chruth&uacute;.  T&aacute;imid &aacute;balta sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</p><p> T&aacute; a l&aacute;n f&eacute;idearthachta&iacute; againn i dtaca le pobal nua-aoiseach ach caithfimid na ruda&iacute; seo a chur i bhfeidhm.  T&aacute; an spreagadh sin ann agus t&aacute; na daoine r&eacute;idh le hobair, me f&eacute;in san &aacute;ireamh, ar son &aacute;r dteanga a fheice&aacute;il thart orainn sa phobal ar&iacute;s.  Ag deireadh an lae, is ann pobal agus muid ag teacht le ch&eacute;ile le troid ar son &aacute;r dteanga d&uacute;ch&aacute;is.  Is ann an neart sin agus ruda&iacute; speisialta a thiocfaidh le teacht d&aacute;r dt&iacute;r agus d&aacute;r dteanga d&uacute;chais.  B'fh&eacute;idir nach bhfuil pobal nua-aoiseach Gaeilge againn go f&oacute;ill ach is f&eacute;idir linn sin a bhaint amach.  I ndeireadh na d&aacute;la, is f&eacute;idir le spark beag tine iontach a chruth&uacute;.  Go raibh maith agaibh a chairde Ghaeil.</p></speech>

Is &eacute; an t-&aacute;bhar a bheidh faoi chaibidil agam n&aacute; an f&eacute;idir linn pobal Gaeilge nua-aoiseach a chruth&uacute; in &Eacute;irinn.  Chun an cheist seo a fhreagairt i mbeag&aacute;n focail, is f&eacute;idir linn gan amhras ach t&aacute;im anseo chun l&eacute;argas a thabhairt ar na c&uacute;iseanna taobh thiar den mhuin&iacute;n at&aacute; agam.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, t&aacute;imse den tuairim go bhfuil deis n&iacute;os fearr againn anois pobal Gaeilge a chruth&uacute; in &Eacute;irinn n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; riamh.  I gcompar&aacute;id le blianta &oacute; shin, n&iacute;l aon srian ar an m&eacute;id ard&aacute;in ina labhra&iacute;tear Gaeilge go nad&uacute;rtha gach uile l&aacute;.<br/><br/>Mar dhuine at&aacute; ag caint inniu ar son na gl&uacute;ine &oacute;g, t&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir dom go bhfuil baint mh&oacute;r ag na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta leis an sc&eacute;al seo.  Nuair a chasaim mo ghuth&aacute;n ar si&uacute;l, is f&eacute;idir liom teacht ar r&eacute;imse leathan tionchair&iacute; n&oacute; influencers a bh&iacute;onn ag labhairt go laeth&uacute;il as Gaeilge ar Instagram n&oacute; is f&eacute;idir liom tr&aacute;chtaireacht a fh&aacute;il ar an nuacht domhanda is d&eacute;ana&iacute; tr&iacute;d a bheith ag l&eacute;amh giolcanna Gaeilge ar Twitter.  Is &eacute; an pointe at&aacute; a dh&eacute;anamh agam n&aacute; gur uirlis iad na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta pobal daoine &oacute;ga a shroicheadh.  Chonaic m&eacute; an chumhacht seo go r&iacute;-shoil&eacute;ir i mo scoil f&eacute;in c&uacute;pla seachtain &oacute; shin agus Seachtain na Gaeilge faoi l&aacute;n sheol.  N&iacute; chreidfe&aacute; an m&eacute;id cainte a bh&iacute; ar si&uacute;l i mo rang Gaeilge mar gheall ar an bhfeachtas Energia a bh&iacute; feicthe againn go l&eacute;ir ar TikTok.  Sc&eacute;al ollmh&oacute;r a bh&iacute; ann toisc go raibh tionchair&iacute; l&aacute;rnach sa f&oacute;gra agus lean an comhr&aacute; ar aghaidh sa rang Gaeilge as Gaeilge feadh na m&iacute;osa.  Tharraing an feachtas me&aacute;n sh&oacute;isialta sin aird &aacute;r n-aoisghr&uacute;pa agus bh&iacute; tionchar d&iacute;reach aige ar an nGaeilge a spreagadh in&aacute;r saolta laeth&uacute;la.<br/><br/>Tuigim &aacute;fach go nd&eacute;anann an cheist a cuireadh orainn tagairt do phobal Gaeilge agus n&iacute; an t-aos &oacute;g amh&aacute;in a bh&iacute;onn bainteach leis sin.  Feicim go minic go mb&iacute;onn d&uacute;il f&oacute;s ag na daoine f&aacute;sta m&oacute;rthimpeall orm ar na me&aacute;in thraidisi&uacute;nta ach feicim freisin go mb&iacute;onn nuacht &aacute; sh&uacute; isteach acu ar l&iacute;ne n&iacute;os minice n&aacute; riamh.  Measaim f&eacute;in go bhfuil na me&aacute;in tr&iacute; Gaeilge ag dul i ngleic leis an &eacute;ileamh seo agus go nearta&iacute;onn siad an pobal Gaeilge at&aacute; &aacute; chruth&uacute; againn.  De r&eacute;ir Forais na Gaeilge, f&eacute;achann thart ar 330 000 daoine ar <i>tuairisc.ie</i>le haghaidh na nuachta is d&eacute;ana&iacute; gach uile l&aacute;.  Caithimid cuimhneamh go bhfuil ard&aacute;in ar n&oacute;s RT&Eacute;, TG4 agus st&aacute;isi&uacute;in raidi&oacute; ar n&oacute;s Raidi&oacute; Na Gaeltachta agus Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute; ann.  Is &eacute; bunchloch bun&uacute;sach aon phobal ar bith n&aacute; nasc idir dhaoine agus n&iacute;l aon s&iacute;ol dabht i m'aigne gur f&eacute;idir an nasc sin a choth&uacute; tr&iacute;d &aacute;r me&aacute;in agus tr&iacute;d &aacute;r me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta as Gaeilge a thac&uacute; agus a mhaoini&uacute;.  Anuas ar seo, t&aacute; pobail Ghaeilge nua&ndash;aoiseach &aacute; gcruth&uacute; ar fud na t&iacute;re i nGaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; agus i scoileanna Gaeltachta.  Gan amhras t&aacute; taith&iacute; phearsanta agam ar an gcine&aacute;l pobal Gaeilge seo.<br/><br/>Anois ba mhaith liom c&uacute;lra f&iacute;or-bheag a thabhairt don choiste orm f&eacute;in ar son mo ch&eacute;ad phointe eile.  Mar is eol don choiste faoin dtr&aacute;th seo, Sorcha is ainm dom.  T&aacute;im 17 bliana d&rsquo;aois agus t&aacute;im ag cr&iacute;ochn&uacute; an c&uacute;igi&uacute; bhliain an tseachtain seo chugainn.  S&iacute;ola&iacute;m as Tr&aacute; L&iacute; agus d&rsquo;fhreastail m&eacute; ar bhunscoil l&aacute;n-Bh&eacute;arla sa sr&aacute;idbhaile bheag Cathair U&iacute; Mh&oacute;r&aacute;in.  Labhra&iacute;m Gaeilge ar scoil ach B&eacute;arla sa bhaile.  Rinne m&eacute; an cinneadh chun freastal ar Ghaelchol&aacute;iste toisc go bhfuil gr&aacute; agam don Ghaeilge ach braithim go l&aacute;idir go bhfuil baol ann gur bheag muintir rang a s&eacute; a bheidh ag d&eacute;anamh an cinneadh c&eacute;anna sa todhcha&iacute;.<br/><br/>Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; n&iacute;os luaithe n&iacute;l dabht ach gur f&eacute;idir linn pobal Gaeilge nua-aoiseach a fhorbairt ach n&iacute; cheart d&uacute;inn constaic&iacute; a chruth&uacute; d&uacute;inn f&eacute;in.  De r&eacute;ir <i>Peig.ie</i>, t&aacute; 71 me&aacute;nscoileanna tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge in &Eacute;irinn agus an chonstaic at&aacute; &aacute; cur &oacute;s &aacute;r gcomhair n&aacute; an moladh go mbeidh ardteistim&eacute;ireacht n&iacute;os deacra sa Ghaeilge le d&eacute;anamh acu n&aacute; scoileanna l&aacute;n-Bh&eacute;arla sna blianta ag teacht.  Le haghaidh daoine cos&uacute;il liomsa, a bh&iacute; eaglach an t-athr&uacute; go Gaeilge a dh&eacute;anamh, t&aacute; seans ard go gcuirfidh an t-eolas seo bac orthu Gaelchol&aacute;iste a phiocadh in aon chor.  Mar thoradh, n&iacute; bheidh siad p&aacute;irteach sa phobal Gaeilge nua-aoiseach at&aacute; &aacute; chruth&uacute; againn.  &Oacute; thaobh mo chairde a fhreastala&iacute;onn ar scoileanna Gaeltachta, bheadh pion&oacute;s &aacute; chur orthu in ainneoin gur iadsan at&aacute; ag coime&aacute;d &aacute;r dteanga beo. Caithfidh go bhfuil &aacute;r dteanga beo beathach chun pobal Gaeilge nua a chruth&uacute;.  T&aacute; f&iacute;or-ghr&aacute; agam d&aacute;r dteanga d&uacute;chasach agus t&aacute; s&eacute; de dh&iacute;th orm go mbeidh pobal Gaeilge ann le haghaidh an ch&eacute;ad gl&uacute;in eile chomh maith.<br/><br/>Creidim go l&aacute;idir go bhfuil pobal Gaeilge nua-aoiseach ar na bac&aacute;in.  T&aacute; dul chun cinn ollmh&oacute;r d&eacute;anta le d&eacute;ana&iacute;, ar n&oacute;s an Ghaeilge a dh&eacute;anamh mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il ag leibh&eacute;al an Aontais Eorpaigh agus na deiseanna fosta&iacute;ochta iontacha a thagann leis sin.  Faraor, de r&eacute;ir UNESCO t&aacute; an Ghaeilge ceann de na 12 teangacha san Aontas Eorpach leis an st&aacute;das &quot;cinnte i mbaol&quot; agus mar sin beidh pobal Gaeilge nua de dh&iacute;th orainn chun &aacute;r dteanga d&uacute;chais a thabhairt sl&aacute;n.  Is f&eacute;idir linn &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; taca&iacute;ochta a thabhairt d&rsquo;ambasad&oacute;ir&iacute; Gaeilge ar na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta, sna me&aacute;in Gaelacha agus in&aacute;r gc&oacute;ras oideachais.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il as an deis iontach a tugadh dom labhairt leis an gcoiste agus as &eacute;isteacht liom.</p></speech>

Tuairisc&iacute;odh go nd&uacute;irt an ceannfort gur easpa garda&iacute; le Gaeilge is c&uacute;is leis seo.  De r&eacute;ir <i>tuairisc.ie</i>, i m&iacute; Ean&aacute;ir na bliana seo tuairisc&iacute;odh gur chinn an Gharda go foirme&aacute;lta ar 13 I&uacute;il na bliana seo caite bac a chur le riachtanas Gaeilge don phost mar gheall ar dhaoine le disl&eacute;icse agus imircigh.  C&eacute;ard faoi na cainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;chasacha Gaeilge a dteasta&iacute;onn uathu a ngn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge?  N&iacute; h&eacute; go bhfuilimid ag d&eacute;anamh idirdheal&uacute;, go bhfuilimid cin&iacute;och n&oacute; aon rud den ts&oacute;rt sin ach an mbeadh t&iacute;ortha coimhth&iacute;ocha eile s&aacute;sta gealladh d'imircigh &Eacute;ireannacha agus Gaelacha ina dt&iacute;ortha f&eacute;in i bpoist den ts&oacute;rt seo agus neamhaird a bheith &aacute; d&eacute;anamh ar a dteangacha oifigi&uacute;la f&eacute;in?  An bhfuilimid ag tabhairt suas &aacute;r bhf&eacute;ini&uacute;lacht ar mhaithe le daoine eile a sh&aacute;samh?  D&uacute;radh n&aacute;r l&eacute;ir c&eacute;n fi&uacute;ntas a bh&iacute; leis an riachtanas Gaeilge d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a bheith ag iarraidh a bheith ina s&aacute;irsint&iacute; n&oacute; ina gcigir&iacute; sa Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Samhlaigh oifigigh ag an leibh&eacute;al seo gan focal Gaeilge a bheith ina bpluic acu agus iad ag feidhmi&uacute; ina gcuid r&oacute;lanna.  C&eacute;n chaoi nach bhfuil acmhainn&iacute; ag a leith&eacute;id d'eagra&iacute;ocht poibl&iacute; nuair at&aacute; eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; ar n&oacute;s TG4 n&oacute; Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta a fheidhm&iacute;onn go hioml&aacute;n tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge?

C&eacute;ard faoin strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge agus n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine le Gaeilge geallta a bheith earcaithe sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras i dtaca le hoili&uacute;int sa Ghaeilge a chur ar f&aacute;il d'fhostaithe St&aacute;it?<br/><br/>In agallamh a craoladh ar Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta le deireanas, d&uacute;radh nach f&eacute;idir garda&iacute; nuach&aacute;ilithe a bhfuil Gaeilge l&iacute;ofa acu a chur sna st&aacute;isi&uacute;in tuaithe de bharr easpa taith&iacute; sa phost.  C&eacute;n dreasacht at&aacute; ann d'&oacute;g&aacute;naigh an cheantair Ghaeltachta a bheidh ag iarraidh filleadh ar an &aacute;it d&uacute;chais n&oacute; c&oacute;ngarach d&oacute;ibh agus iad ag s&aacute;samh na coinn&iacute;ollacha teanga at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th ar an bpost?  Cotha&iacute;tear constaic&iacute; d&oacute;ibh fanacht ag obair ina gceantair f&eacute;in.  Nach bre&aacute; go mbeadh garda&iacute; a bhfuil lu&iacute; agus eolas acu ar an &aacute;it filleadh ar an gceantar agus an ghairm a chleachtadh?  Nach bhfuil s&eacute; tuairiscithe go bhfuil garda&iacute; a bhfuil Gaeilge l&iacute;ofa acu i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath nach bhfuil sp&eacute;is acu glacadh le foll&uacute;ntas Gaeltachta?  T&aacute; s&eacute; mar sprioc ag Drew Harris, Coimisin&eacute;ir An Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, go mbeadh Gaeilge l&iacute;ofa ag os cionn 50% de na garda&iacute; a bh&iacute;onn ag obair i st&aacute;isi&uacute;in Ghaeltachta faoi 2025.  C&eacute;n chaoi a bhfuil siad chun teacht an&iacute;os leis an l&iacute;on bhreise seo mura bhfuil siad chun garda&iacute; nuach&aacute;ilithe le Gaeilge l&iacute;ofa as ceantair &eacute;ags&uacute;la tuaithe gan taith&iacute; a chur ar dualgas sna ceantair tuaithe?  De r&eacute;ir &aacute;ireamh a rinneadh in f&oacute;mhair 2019, n&iacute;l Gaeilge ach ag tr&iacute;&uacute; chuid de gharda&iacute; na Gaeltachta.  Nach nd&eacute;anfadh s&eacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; c&eacute;ille garda&iacute; a bheith lonnaithe c&oacute;ngarach don bhaile seachas a bheith ag taisteal agus ag cur le tranglaim tr&aacute;chta?  N&iacute; air&iacute;mid an costas breosla agus an lorg carb&oacute;in a t&aacute;imid ag f&aacute;g&aacute;il ar an timpeallacht.  T&aacute;im cinnte go n-aont&oacute;dh an tAire, an Teachta Eamon Ryan leis seo.<br/><br/>T&aacute; muidne, mar &oacute;g&aacute;naigh as Conamara l&aacute;r, ag &eacute;ilimh inniu sa choiste an deis a thabhairt d&uacute;inne filleadh ar &aacute;r mbaile tar &eacute;is na gc&aacute;il&iacute;ochta&iacute; a bhaint amach, an teanga a shol&aacute;thr&uacute; agus a chaomhn&uacute; i dtimpeallacht n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha.

Beidh tionchar d&iacute;reach ag an easpa soil&eacute;ireachta seo ar mhic l&eacute;inn na gc&eacute;ad bliana ach go h&aacute;irithe.

Is chun donas a rachaidh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; agus mic l&eacute;inn srianta sa mh&eacute;id oibre gur f&eacute;idir leo a dh&eacute;anamh i rith an tsamhraidh.  Seo ceann de na hearn&aacute;lacha is m&oacute; inar tharla athruithe tar &eacute;is na ndianghlas&aacute;la &eacute;ags&uacute;la.  Bh&iacute; ar dhaoine a ngairmeacha a mhalart&uacute; agus d&rsquo;fhan formh&oacute;r acu sna poist nua de bharr coinn&iacute;ollacha oibre agus p&aacute; n&iacute;os fearr a bheith &aacute; thuilleadh acu.

De r&eacute;ir tuairisce ar RT&Eacute;, d&rsquo;fh&aacute;g 70,000 oibr&iacute; an ghairm seo &oacute; bhuail an phaind&eacute;im.

Mar sin, t&aacute;imid ag &eacute;ileamh &aacute;r gcearta maidir le hoideachas tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al a fh&aacute;il.

C&eacute; nach raibh Gaeilge ag mo thuismitheoir&iacute;, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, thuig siad fi&uacute; amh&aacute;in ag an bpointe sin an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann le d&aacute;theangachas agus bh&iacute; meas acu ar an nGaeilge mar &aacute;r dteanga dh&uacute;chais.  D&rsquo;fh&aacute;g m&eacute; an scoil bheag sin le l&iacute;ofacht Ghaeilge ach, in &eacute;ineacht leis sin, gr&aacute; don teanga agus don chult&uacute;r chomh maith.<br/><br/>D&rsquo;fhreastail m&eacute; ar ghn&aacute;th-mhe&aacute;nscoil ansin toisc nach raibh Gaelchol&aacute;iste sa cheantar, agus n&iacute;l ceann f&oacute;s ann, ach mhothaigh m&eacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; go raibh rud &eacute;igin in easnamh domsa ar aon n&oacute;s.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag iarraidh filleadh ar ais ar an saol l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge sin.  Chr&iacute;ochnaigh m&eacute; an ardteistim&eacute;ireacht agus beagnach ag an n&oacute;im&eacute;ad deiridh, roghnaigh m&eacute; an c&uacute;rsa Gaeilge agus iriseoireachta a dh&eacute;anamh in Ollscoil Chathair Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath, &aacute;it a raibh R&oacute;is&iacute;n O&rsquo;Hara, at&aacute; ar mo thaobh cl&eacute; liom anseo, ina l&eacute;acht&oacute;ir agam.<br/><br/>Thosaigh m&eacute; an c&uacute;rsa sin in 2013 ag foghlaim na scileanna at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th ar dhuine mar iriseoir agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; seo d&eacute;anta, beagnach, ar fad tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.  Ni raibh ach mod&uacute;l anois is ar&iacute;s againn i mB&eacute;arla agus muidne measctha le mic l&eacute;inn eile.  Fad is a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ann, d&rsquo;fhorbair m&eacute; mo scileanna iriseoireachta, cinnteoireachta, scr&iacute;bhneoireachta agus craolt&oacute;ireachta, go hairithe, ach freisin bh&iacute; seans agam feabhas a chur ar mo chuid Gaeilge toisc go raibh s&iacute; in &uacute;s&aacute;id agam gach uile l&aacute; le mo l&eacute;acht&oacute;ir&iacute; agus le mo chomh-mhic l&eacute;inn uilig.  Bh&iacute; deiseanna &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de ar f&aacute;il taobh amuigh den rang freisin, ar nd&oacute;igh, agus scr&iacute;obh m&eacute; le haghaidh an nuacht&aacute;in, <i>The College View</i>, bh&iacute; cl&aacute;r raidi&oacute; agam ar feadh seal chomh maith, agus bh&iacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;ite sa Ghaeilge go hioml&aacute;n.  <br/><br/>D&rsquo;fh&aacute;g m&eacute; an ollscoil in 2016 agus, mar is eol don lucht &eacute;isteachta b'fh&eacute;idir, bh&iacute; an margadh fosta&iacute;ochta thar a bheith deacair ag an am.  N&iacute; raibh m&eacute; r&oacute;-chinnte an raibh saol an iriseora go hioml&aacute;n oiri&uacute;nach dom ach bh&iacute; a fhios agam freisin go raibh an-suim agam i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; reatha agus sa pholait&iacute;ocht chomh maith.  Is mar gheall air sin a chas m&eacute; ar an st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os.  N&iacute; raibh aithne agam ar dhuine ar bith sa st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s agus n&iacute; raibh leid d&aacute; laghad ag mo chlann n&oacute; ag mo chairde c&eacute;ard a bheadh ar si&uacute;l agam.  Chonaic m&eacute; f&oacute;gra&iacute;, &aacute;mh, le haghaidh poist mar oifigeach cl&eacute;ireachais agus oifigeach riarach&aacute;in as Gaeilge agus thuig m&eacute; go d&iacute;reach go mbeadh bunt&aacute;iste agam mar gheall ar mo ch&eacute;im agus mo Ghaeilge chomh maith.  Chuir m&eacute; isteach ar na poist sin ar fad agus is beag n&aacute;r chuir m&eacute; isteach ar na poist sin faoi dh&oacute;, toisc go raibh m&eacute; ag l&eacute;iri&uacute; mo chuid sp&eacute;ise sa sruth Gaeilge in &eacute;ineacht leis an gceann i mB&eacute;arla.  Tar &eacute;is agallaimh agus scr&uacute;duithe ar leith a dh&eacute;anamh, chomh maith le scr&uacute;d&uacute; b&eacute;il agus scr&uacute;d&uacute; scr&iacute;ofa sa Ghaeilge chun mo chumas d&aacute;theangach a l&eacute;iri&uacute;, d&rsquo;&eacute;irigh liom &aacute;it a fh&aacute;il ar an bpain&eacute;al.  <br/><br/>Chuir me t&uacute;s le mo ghairm i Roinn an Taoisigh a bh&iacute; thar a bheith sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il.  Is post sa sruth Gaeilge a bh&iacute; ann.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag obair san oifig phr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach agus freagrach as comhfhreagras an Taoisigh i mB&eacute;arla agus i nGaeilge.  Bhog me ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; an Roinn Oideachais tar &eacute;is c&uacute;pla bliain, &aacute;it a bhfuilim f&oacute;s ag obair anois.  Den chuid is m&oacute;, t&aacute;im freagrach as cur i bhfeidhm an bheartais Gaeilge ansin, ag cinnti&uacute; go bhfuilimid ag comhl&iacute;onadh &aacute;r bhfreagrachta&iacute; do phobal na Gaeilge, agus ag g&eacute;illeadh d&rsquo;Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la agus d&aacute;r sc&eacute;im teanga chomh maith.  Bh&iacute; seans agam in 2019 dul ar iasacht go dt&iacute; Seirbh&iacute;s Thithe an Oireachtais anseo chun a bheith i mo chomhairleoir beartais.  D&rsquo;oibrigh m&eacute; ar dt&uacute;s ar an gCoiste um Chult&uacute;r, Oidhreacht agus Gaeltacht, mar a bh&iacute; s&eacute; ag an am, ach tar &eacute;is an olltoghch&aacute;in in 2020, bhog m&eacute; chuig an gcoiste seo.  Le linn dom machnamh a dh&eacute;anamh ar mo chuid ama go dt&iacute; seo sa st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s, rith s&eacute; liom go bhfuil s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go bhfuil go leor deiseanna fosta&iacute;ochta ann toisc go bhfuilim i mo Ghaeilgeoir.  T&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir freisin go dtugann an st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s deis dom.  N&iacute; as an nGaeltacht m&eacute; agus, mar sin, t&aacute;im i mo fhoghlaimeoir agus beidh m&eacute; i mo fhoghlaimeoir i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  Sa st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s, toisc go bhfuil an Ghaeilge in &uacute;s&aacute;id agam gach uile l&aacute;, b&iacute;onn seans agam feabhas a chur ar mo scileanna teanga agus t&aacute;im ag obair mar bhall de phobal na Gaeilge ar son phobal na Gaeilge.  Ar bhonn pearsanta, t&aacute; an-s&aacute;samh ag baint leis sin.<br/><br/>Go raibh maith ag &aacute;r lucht &eacute;isteachta as a bheith ag &eacute;isteacht liom inniu.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go raibh s&eacute; &uacute;s&aacute;ideach d&oacute;ibh agus go l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; an &aacute;it l&aacute;rnach at&aacute; ag an nGaeilge i mo shaol agus sa st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s chomh maith.</p></speech>

Nuair a labhair m&eacute; le mo bhainisteoir, Eoghan, don ch&eacute;ad uair, bh&iacute; m&eacute; an-neirbh&iacute;seach ag labhairt as Gaeilge ar&iacute;s mar nach raibh aon mhuin&iacute;n agam ionam f&eacute;in.  Spreag Eoghan m&eacute; i mo chuid Gaeilge toisc go raibh a fhios aige go raibh an teanga agam.  Rinne m&eacute; c&uacute;rsa n&oacute; dh&oacute; a chuir Tithe an Oireachtais ar si&uacute;l agus &oacute; shin, bhog m&eacute; ar aghaidh chun c&uacute;rsa creidi&uacute;naithe teastas sa Ghaeilge ghairmi&uacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh ag leibh&eacute;al 5, agus t&aacute; leibh&eacute;al 6 ar bun agam faoi l&aacute;thair.</p> <p>  &Uacute;s&aacute;idim an Ghaeilge gach l&aacute; i mo shaol oibre agus anois t&aacute; taith&iacute; agus muin&iacute;n agam chun cumars&aacute;id &eacute;ifeachtach a dh&eacute;anamh gach l&aacute; ag an obair.  T&aacute; seans agam mo chuid Gaeilge a chleachtadh le mo chomhghleacaithe, le comhalta&iacute; an choiste, finn&eacute;ithe n&oacute; cuairteoir&iacute; a fhreastala&iacute;onn ar Theach Laighean, agus le neart daoine eile.  Seolaim mo r&iacute;omhphoist i nGaeilge, cuirim glaonna guth&aacute;in ar dhaoine i nGaeilge agus d&eacute;anaim mo chuid iarratais agallaimh cruinnithe, ar n&oacute;s mo dhul chun cinn agus forbairt san &aacute;it oibre, go hioml&aacute;n i nGaeilge.  Ar an mbealach seo, buaileann t&uacute; le daoine a dh&eacute;anann iarracht labhairt leat i nGaeilge fi&uacute; muna bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  D&eacute;anfaidh siad iarracht c&uacute;pla focal a &uacute;s&aacute;id chun a gcuid Gaeilge f&eacute;in a chleachtadh tr&iacute; r&iacute;omhphost a sheoladh ar ais chugat as Gaeilge, cur i gc&aacute;s.  T&aacute; an-&eacute;ileamh anois sa st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s ar dhaoine go bhfuil Gaeilge acu.

T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go bhfuil an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite agam inniu tar &eacute;is iad a spreagadh chun machnamh a dh&eacute;anamh ar phoist san earn&aacute;il phoibl&iacute; agus sa st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s, agus gairm bheatha a bhaint amach ina mbeidh an d&aacute;theangachas mar bhunt&aacute;iste d&oacute;ibh.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051800002#A00200"><p>Before I commence, I remind members participating remotely they must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  I ask members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones as these interfere with the broadcasting equipment and that members participating remotely please use the raised-hand icon on Teams if they wish to contribute.</p> <p>  This morning's meeting has been convened to discuss the State's national carers policy and the means assessment criteria administered by the Department of Social Protection.  Ireland has over 500,000 family carers, or one in three households.  They provide an essential service by allowing older people and people with a disability to live in their own home and in their own community.</p> <p>  The carer's allowance was first introduced in 1990 and has been a valuable support to family carers throughout the country.  While the pandemic has been incredibly difficult for family carers, it has shown us how vital their care is in order to protect our most vulnerable citizens.  The pandemic has also demonstrated the speed at which our social protection system can be transformed and adapted.  The members of this committee and Members throughout the Oireachtas, in Government and outside it, supporting the Government and those in the Opposition, are all of the opinion we must work towards a financial support system for family carers that is designed around the care given and not dependent on the bank account of the spouse of the full-time carer.  This committee has already received evidence of a carer with three profoundly disabled children who is ineligible for the carer's allowance.  This clearly indicates to me the current eligibility test for the payment is little more than a means test that denies people financial assistance to support them in providing such vital services in our society.  At present there are 116,000 full-time carers in Ireland but only 80,000 are able to access the carer's allowance as the current means test assesses all income coming into the household and not just that of the family carer.  Of that 89,000, almost half do not get the full amount because of other household income.  It is important we recognise the carer's allowance was not designed solely as an income support but to also recognise the importance of supporting as many older people and people with a disability as possible to remain in their own homes.  This benefit was even more pronounced as a result of Covid-19.  We must ensure the vital role that has been played during the pandemic is reflected in a proper support structure to protect our most vulnerable citizens.</p> <p>  Today we will hear direct evidence for the very first time from three family carers.  Some of them will be addressing the committee from their own homes because up to now their roles as family carers did not facilitate them giving direct evidence.  The committee is reviewing the current means assessment system to ensure carer's allowance supports all those who make such a vital contribution to society by performing the work of acting as family carers.  We look forward to discussing the potential changes to the carer's allowance and changes to the means assessment system amid rising costs and inflation.  We especially welcome the opportunity to hear directly from three family carers.  They are Ms Anna Budayova, Ms Niamh Ryan and Mr. Damien Douglas.  I thank members of the committee for raising these important issues as a priority item in our 2022 work programme.  A briefing from the Department to the committee secretariat was issued to members and I particularly thank the committee's policy adviser, Ms Haley O'Shea, for her work on this.  As we continue in this regard I welcome our witnesses from Family Carers Ireland to the meeting.  In addition to Ms Budayova, Ms Ryan and Mr. Douglas we have Ms Catherine Cox, head of communications and policy, Mr. John Dunne, CEO and Ms Clare Duffy, policy and public affairs officer.  All are very welcome.</p> <p>  Before we commence I must give a note on privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or any other way to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses&rsquo; statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with this direction.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I call on Mr. Dunne to make his opening statement on behalf of Family Carers Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1364" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051800002#B00200"><p>I thank the Deputies and Senators for the opportunity to speak to them about our suggestions for a radical review of policy on income protection for family carers, in particular the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance was first introduced in 1990 and it has benefited from periodic improvements since then.  We believe, however, that the fundamentals of the scheme, which have remained unchanged for 32 years, now fall well short of current best practice.</p> <p>  The State recently launched a pilot basic income scheme specific to the arts sector.  This will provide a basic income of &euro;325 per week for people over three years.  By way of comparison, had the State decided to introduce an artist's allowance modelled on the carer's allowance, artists would be eligible to receive a means-tested maximum of &euro;224 per week, with a requirement that they demonstrate they are working full-time at their artistic endeavours and a prohibition on them spending more than 18.5 hours on income-generating activities.  The pilot scheme was presented to enable artists "to focus on artistic production/practice without having to enter into employment in other sectors to sustain themselves".  This is quite similar to the intent of the carer's allowance scheme, which is to allow carers to focus on their caring, without having to enter into employment in order to sustain themselves.  The different income levels that are set suggest that artists have higher levels of sustenance needs than family carers.  The other point to note is that the scheme was introduced as a way of recognising "the value of time spent on creative practice" by artists.  I wish to be clear that in no way are we begrudging artists the benefit of what is an innovative and enlightened approach to income support, but we invite a reappraisal of how we as a State recognise "the value of time spent" on family caring, to use that phrase from the artist's scheme.</p> <p>  The State has reached a critical juncture in its treatment of family carers.  Even before Covid, it had been agreed that a broader discussion was needed on the role of family caring, including the rights and needs of family carers and the financial supports available.  The report of the citizen&rsquo;s assembly is resolute in this regard expressing a high level of ambition for change.  It recommends the reform of carer&rsquo;s allowance including: changes to the means test and individualisation; increasing the hours that carers can work or study; reimbursing the costs associated with care; increasing the carer's support grant; and providing a dedicated pension solution for carers.  Of particular significance is the assembly&rsquo;s recommendation to replace Article 41.2 of the Constitution to recognise the care provided by both men and women, while obliging the State to take reasonable measures to support carers.</p> <p>  I shall now address what it is that needs to change.  The classification of the carer's allowance as a social assistance payment, and therefore comparable with jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance, is problematic.  The classification does not recognise the uniqueness of family carers within the social welfare system, and it is hampering efforts to make carer&rsquo;s allowance more accessible to full-time carers who we believe should qualify.  Consistent references to the carer&rsquo;s allowance means test as being the most generous in the social welfare system, while correct, presuppose that it should be benchmarked against income supports for people of working age, which is not the correct categorisation or comparison.</p> <p>  We acknowledge and welcome the increase in the income and capital disregards for carer&rsquo;s allowance announced in last year&rsquo;s budget but the implementation of these increases has been problematic for a number of reasons.  Mr. Douglas, Ms Budayova and Ms Ryan will explain these reasons in their personal statements shortly.</p> <p>  Family Carers Ireland believes that the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme is archaic, gender-biased, overly restrictive, and no longer fit for purpose.  When the carer's allowance was introduced in 1990, it was conceived as an income support for people living with and caring for a relevant pensioner.  It was not designed to meet the very different life circumstances and needs of lifetime carers who care for prolonged and lengthy periods and who need access to an integrated income support system that encourages rather than restricts their participation in work and education.  Restricting the hours a carer can work or study is paternalistic and at odds with the Department's mission to promote active participation and inclusion.  Imposing the 18.5-hour ceiling traps carers, forcing them to remain dependent on social welfare and unable to prepare for life after care.  This is particularly anomalous with regard to education.  The inclusion of travel to and from college, as well as course work and class contact hours even where they are performed by distance learning, means the vast majority of education courses exceed the 18.5-hour ceiling.  Even more bizarrely, a family carer can spend more than 18.5 hours reading non-educational books or writing fiction but if her or she spends that time reading and writing course work it would affect his or her eligibility under the scheme.</p> <p>  Income support for family carers also reinforces the already entrenched gender stereotype of women as the primary caregiver.  It does this in several ways.  The absence of a pay-related benefit discourages the higher paid partner from leaving work to care.  This is usually the male partner.  Means testing carer&rsquo;s allowance based on the household income rather than on the individual income of the family carer reinforces the male breadwinner model and forces carers, the majority women, to be financially reliant on their partner.  As a result, the vast majority of recipients under the three care-related social protection schemes are women, ranging from 77% of claimants receiving carer's allowance to 83% of those on carer's benefit.  While other payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance and the foster carer&rsquo;s allowance are exempt from tax, the taxation of carer&rsquo;s allowance seems a fairly arbitrary penalty imposed on family carers.</p> <p>  Now is the time to reassess the value we place on unpaid care and to review how carers are recognised and supported financially by the State.  We believe this review should lead to fundamental changes in carer&rsquo;s allowance including: the reclassification of the scheme; the abolition of the means test; or the establishment of a participation income for carers, as recommended by the National Economic and Social Council in 2020.  We believe that the requirement to satisfy strict medical eligibility criteria and the requirement that applicants provide full-time care should be sufficient to protect the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme from potential abuse.</p> <p>  We acknowledge that a fundamental review of income support for family carers would be a substantial and technical exercise that would require careful consideration and reflection.  Our first call today is that such a process be initiated and a reasonable timeframe set for its completion.  Our second call, having regard to the fact that we must continue to live with the current carer's allowance system for a few more years, is for a significant increase in the levels of carer's benefit and carer's allowance in this year&rsquo;s budget.</p> <p>  Research by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice published in April shows that even before the cost of living crisis, income supports for family carers caring for a child with a profound intellectual disability were inadequate in supporting low-income households to meet the minimum essential standard of living.  These households, which are representative of many caring situations, incur additional weekly costs of &euro;244 per week compared to a similarly composed household with no disability or care needs.  The research also shows that the disadvantage experienced by caring households does not end as income increases.  Even caring households with higher income levels have significantly less disposable income to meet the need for contingencies such as car or house repairs, medical expenses, or unexpected bills.  These families, who often rely on a single income due to their caring responsibilities, face a financial battle as they are ineligible for almost all carer supports, yet face the same crippling costs of caring without recognition or support from the State.  It is untenable to think that families earning a gross household income of more than &euro;65,000 are considered sufficiently well-off to meet these additional costs themselves, regardless of their mortgage repayments, loans, children's education expenses, and other outgoings.</p> <p>  The gross inadequacy of carer's allowance when compared with the Government&rsquo;s own benchmark for artist sustainability is insulting and unjust.  The maximum rate of carer's allowance of &euro;224, which is just &euro;3.50 more per week than it was in 2009, represents a loss of &euro;25 per week in purchasing power when inflation is taken into account.</p><p>The introduction of a basic income for artists of &euro;325 and the establishment of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, at &euro;350 highlight the inadequacy of carer's allowance to provide a basic standard of living, even before the additional costs of caring are considered.  The foster carer's allowance is not means-tested and is rightly set at a rate of &euro;325 for the care of children under 12 and &euro;352 for older children, with the payment exempted from social welfare means testing and tax-free.  Furthermore, if the foster carer is caring for a child with additional needs - we must bear in mind that every family carer is doing so - the payment can increase to &euro;549 or &euro;576 per week, depending on the age of the child, whereas a parent forced to give up work to care for their own child with additional needs receives up to &euro;352 less per week.</p><p> The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, due to be commenced next month, is dependent on family carers assuming the role of a decision supporter in many cases.  While professionals appointed by the decision support service to act as a decision-making representative, will be paid for their time, family carers acting in this same role will not.  The argument is that many family members undertake unpaid roles such as executor of an estate and the State does not want to undermine such volunteerism.  However, family carers receiving only &euro;224 per week for a full working week are surely entitled to question why they should be expected to carry this extra burden in terms of time and responsibility with no financial acknowledgement.  An appropriate increase in carer's benefit and allowance would avoid any such risk to volunteering within the wider population.</p><p> Despite the additional and often unavoidable costs faced by family carers, the Government's package of cost-saving supports did little to mitigate the cost-of-living increases for carers.  Indeed, despite the fuel poverty many carers face, they are not eligible for the fuel allowance scheme.  For all of these reasons, the Government must urgently address the inadequacy and unfairness of carer supports by increasing the rate of carer's allowance and benefit to &euro;325 per week in budget 2023.  I thank members for their time and attention this morning.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer their questions in due course.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien Douglas" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051800002#C00300"><p>I am 65 years old and a carer.  My wife Mary is also a carer but I will not tell the committee her age.  We have five wonderful children.  Una and Ailis are our youngest daughters.  They are 27.  They are twins and have a condition called Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome.  Because of this, they cannot eat, drink, talk or walk.  They have severe developmental delay, epilepsy and are doubly incontinent.  They are non-mobile and use wheelchairs which we have to push.  That is grand.  They are PEG-fed.  They function at the level of a nine-month old baby although they are 27 years of age.  We love them to bits.</p> <p>  In 2003, Mary gave up work to mind the twins and our other children full time.  Beaumont Hospital lost a brilliant accident and emergency nurse.  Mary gave up a career she loved and forfeited a salary and future pension entitlements.  In 2013, I had to retire early from my job as an assistant director of mental health nursing because the girls were now at the magic age of 18.  I loved my job, but I love my girls more.  Being 18 meant the end of school for them.  However, no adult day services were available.  I retired early to look after the girls and fight for day services.  Eventually, we were successful.</p> <p>  Carer's allowance is a means-tested social welfare allowance that is paid weekly to people who provide at least 35 hours care to a person who needs support because of age, disability or illness.  Many carers in our situation provide far in excess of 35 hours per week.  Often, as in our case, it is nearer to 24-hour daily care.  For those who are not wealthy, the carer's allowance is essential to help them manage financially.  The new scheme coming into effect in June gives a disregard for savings and investments of &euro;50,000.  I thank the Government for that.  It is very important.  The means test cut-off will be &euro;750 per week per week, allowing an income of &euro;39,000 per annum.  For a couple, this works out at &euro;9.38 per person over a 40-hour week.  This is far below the minimum wage of &euro;10.50 per hour, which equates to &euro;42,000 if both partners had full-time minimum wage jobs.</p> <p>  In recent times, people who lost their jobs or were unable to work because of Covid were able to claim the PUP.  At one stage, this was valued at &euro;350 per week.  This would be a fair sum to have the carer's allowance pitched at.  Currently, the maximum carer's allowance payment to a carer under 66 looking after one person is &euro;224 per week.  If over 66, he or she would get the magnificent sum of &euro;262 per week.  That is if the carer is looking after one person.  Carer's allowance is definitely a social welfare payment.  It is not a payment for work done.  It does not compensate for loss of earnings or pension entitlements.</p> <p>  Some carers may have a weekly work pension or work part time.  All earnings, income, investments and savings are taken into account in the means test.  No allowance is made for the purpose for which the savings are intended.  We do not all go on exotic holidays.  If people happen to have money that puts them over the means test limit, it does not mean they are rich.  It might mean they have more than they need for today but the money is necessary for future needs.  It might be for replacement vehicles, wheelchair vans, house repairs or improvements, respite breaks or extra carers to help, especially when it is so difficult to engage in essential therapies due to the difficulty in getting assessments for physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, all of which are essential.</p> <p>  We know there are about 500,000 carers in Ireland.  Not all of them are full-time carers.  In 2021, 115,000 carers received the carer's support grant.  Only 91,000 received carer's allowance in some form or other.  We know that approximately 6,000 full-time carers who receive the carer's support grant did not qualify for the carer's allowance based on the means test, which means the annual grant is the only recognition they receive from the State.  These carers continue caring and looking after their loved ones.  In many or most cases, if they stop caring for their loved ones, there is no one else to step in to do it.  The State is not able to do it, yet the State is saved billions every year by the dedication and love of carers like us.  All we ask is to be treated fairly and with dignity and respect.  We do not want to face a future of poverty and frugality.  Our futures are bleak enough as it is, getting older and frailer and still minding our adult children when we are getting to a stage when we ourselves are beginning to need help.  I thank members for their time and consideration in listening to us.</p></speech>

We will now hear from Ms Niamh Ryan, a family carer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1369" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051800002#C00500"><p>I thank members for the invitation to appear before the committee.  I am mother to twin boys who will be 14 years old in June.  My husband is a mid-grade public sector employee.  I am also a full-time carer for our son Liam, who has a life-limiting condition.  He has severe spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy.  He is a wheelchair user, is tube fed and has epilepsy, global developmental delay, scoliosis, hip dysplasia, cortical visual impairment and chronic lung conditions.</p><p>He is on 28 doses of 18 different medications and four nebulisers every day.  This is when he is well.  It is a whole different story when he is sick.  Liam requires full assistance for all of his needs and personal care.</p><p> I have never received full carer's allowance because my husband works but we managed.  However, in March my carer's allowance was slashed by &euro;90 per week.  With inflation rising as it is, this could not have happened at a worse time.  When I brought up the fact the carer&rsquo;s allowance I get equates to 78 cent per hour, I was told that I should not look at it as remuneration.  I find this very insulting because being a carer is a job and is a very stressful job at that.  I work 24 hours a day, seven days a week with no days off and no holidays.  When family carers are told that what we do is worth so little, it really makes us feel quite worthless.  I do not have the luxury of dwelling on my feelings because the cold hard fact is the current system of means-testing carer's allowance is extremely unfair and puts families under extreme pressure financially.</p><p> If there has to be a means test it should at least be fair.  It is not right that income is the only thing considered and that outgoings are not taken into account.  The only outgoing that is considered is an allowance of &euro;15 per week for travel, and we all know how far that gets us these days.  It does not matter that, like many other families, we have a huge mortgage.  We had two salaries when we bought our house but I had no option but to give up my job to look after Liam.  It does not matter that we had to take out a big loan to adapt our house to cater for Liam's needs.  We did receive the house adaptation grant but it did not come close to covering the cost of the build.  It does not matter that we had to take out another big loan to purchase a wheelchair accessible van to be able to take Liam to all of his hospital appointments and to make sure he is not a prisoner in his own home.  It does not matter that while energy costs are at an all-time high and still rising, Liam&rsquo;s medical equipment has to be left on and charging 24 hours a day.  This equipment includes an oxygen concentrator, suction machines, a BiPAP machine, an oxygen saturation monitor, an air purifier, a hospital bed, an air mattress, a ceiling hoist, a nebuliser machine and feeding pumps.</p><p> It does not matter that our heating has to be on more than most as Liam misses a lot of school through illness.  Indeed, he only returned to school three weeks ago after cocooning at home since the start of the pandemic and he has already missed a few days due to a chest infection.  It does not matter that our light and heat are on more than most when we have nursing support at night.  It does not matter that Liam's clothes are more expensive because they have to be adapted for his feeding tube and wheelchair.  It does not matter that we had to purchase expensive medical equipment, including a ceiling tracking hoist and changing bench, as these were considered luxuries by the HSE.  Not only did we have to find the thousands of euro to purchase this equipment but we now have to bear the costs of servicing and maintaining them.  It does not matter that we have extra waste disposal charges due to all of the medical waste and incontinence wear.  It does not matter that we have to pay charges for having prescription drug sheets written up every six months so that we can avail of our home nursing package.  None of these things matter to the means test but they matter greatly to us as we struggle to pay for them.</p><p> At the end of the day, I have no choice but to be a full-time carer for Liam, so working part-time outside the home is just not an option for me and many other family carers.  As for the disregard for savings of &euro;50,000, that is just simply the stuff of fairy tales to us.  Despite this and how difficult, stressful and exhausting it is, I am happy to look after our beautiful happy boy and I dread the day when I will not have to do it anymore.  My family and many like us need help and support now.  We do not need to be told, as we so often are, that family carers are valued by our Government.  I certainly do not feel valued.  There are substantial additional costs involved in caring for a person with complex medical needs and I ask the committee to look at these seriously and consider making meaningful changes to the means test so that a family's considerable additional outgoings are taken into account.  This would truly help families who spend so much of their time worrying about the health and survival of their loved one and could really do without these extra financial worries and pressures.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

It is beautiful here in Tuam.  We do not get much sun so it is a fantastic day today.  I am a mother of five beautiful children.  My baby Esther was born with Trisomy 21 and an atrioventricular septal defect, which is a serious heart condition.  Only last week she was diagnosed with deteriorating eyesight.  This means she will need to wear glasses from now on.  Unfortunately she also has other medical complications.  I ask the committee to end the means test for carer's allowance and change the laws for parents such as me, especially when a child is born with a lifelong disability.  There are huge gaps in the system.  Article 41.2.2&deg; of the Constitution states, "The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home."</p> <p>  We came to Ireland in December 2007 when my husband's job moved him from another EU country to work here on a project.  We have been working here since then.  We never claimed social payments or benefits here.  When things got harder in Dublin with rising costs, we moved around the country several times to get better jobs and more stability for our family.  Knowing our family was growing, we have not been reckless with money and saved as much as possible for a house deposit.  We changed jobs and schools for our children and left friends behind.  It took us more than ten years to save money for a deposit to be able to buy in rural Ireland, which is where we moved in 2017.  My husband had to commute to work daily.</p> <p>  We have worked hard to provide for our family over the years.  To get these salaries we studied and paid for education several times.  We have never abused the system and we are now being punished for this.  A Down's syndrome diagnosis accompanied by additional health conditions requires more appointments, more diesel, more travel, more tools, more parking, more babysitting, more private therapies, more glasses, more money and no break.  The costs associated with this care are continuously rising.  If people have more children, as we do, it means additional childminding costs when we are away.  Even basic day-to-day expenses, such as food, heating and bills, are very high and will rise in future.  It is only May and I am already worried about how we will cover September, secondary school and the boys in primary school.  Our financial situation is causing tremendous stress for the family and pressure on our marriage.  Only yesterday we had to travel to the hospital in Crumlin for an early cardiology appointment.  This meant leaving our other four children with a childminder at 5.15 a.m. to be in Dublin by 8.15 a.m. for the appointment.</p> <p>  When my daughter Esther was born last June she was in hospital for several weeks.  I commuted to her every day.  After my husband had to go back to work, we had to organise someone to care for the children.  These were all high costs.  I was expressing breast milk every three hours, day and night, for five and a half months.  Directly after expressing, I was nasogastric, NG, tube feeding my Esther every three hours with the breast milk as this was the best recommendation from her cardiologist.  In total, I spent 35 days just expressing and NG tube feeding Esther during the first six months of her life.  I was exhausted on every level, as committee members can imagine.  Nevertheless I did it because it was the best for her.</p><p>My work as a full-time carer is not valued by the Irish Government, which is very wrong and shocking considering the Irish Constitution.  Caring for a baby with a lifelong disability is extremely demanding - physically, emotionally and financially.  To just say a person is over the limit without any regard for essential expenses associated with this care is cruel and puts families in a desperate situation.</p><p> I have only one wish - for Esther to be healthy.  I do not want hospital appointments, hospital stays, therapies or fights with Departments.  However, I do not have this choice.  Now, I feel I am being punished for accepting and loving my child, who is not perfect in the eyes of this world.  If members met my Esther, they would see she is lovely.  She is a beautiful child.</p><p> I work 24-7 with love to care for my Esther.  I want to give her all the possible opportunities in this world.  Without money, however, it is impossible.  My husband pays huge taxes each month yet we are not able to get help when we need it just because we are not abusing the system.  Every mother or father who cares for a special needs child since birth should be paid the carer's allowance in full - no questions asked.  As if it was not hard enough for parents like us.  Our lives are changed forever.  No-one asked if we wanted it.  Last November, I was awarded a carer's allowance of &euro;12.50 per week.  Two weeks ago, however, I received a letter from the Department stating that this is being reviewed, and that this payment might be removed and I will have to pay back whatever I received.  </p><p> I understand that the carer's allowance is means-tested.  However, I would like to highlight that it is not reasonable to accept means-tested calculations based on gross income and not consider other necessary expenses such as a mortgage, car repayment and other expenses linked with additional health complications if a person's child is sick.  There are other expenses our family also incurs.  We do not have a medical card or any other support.  We are completely and 100% dependent on one salary alone.  I have no idea how I can support my other children in their development going forward.  It is impossible to survive like that for more than a few months if one has savings.</p><p> I am a qualified medical scientist but cannot work due to Ester&rsquo;s care needs.  How ironic that we are hardly meeting our survival costs and using our savings with this mean test.  There is no way for a family in our situation to set any money aside for life or health emergencies, a pension or recreation to alleviate pressures linked with being a full-time carer.  This journey is so lonely.  It is important because from a long-term perspective, we are only humans and we have no break.  We have no weekend and no full night's sleep.  I want to be available for my family in good health.  I am not blessed enough to have close or extended family around to help me, even a little bit, or provide a safety net for me or my children.  Healthy children are a little different, and I know that because I have four healthy children.  They could grow up with less and one day, please God, they will all be able to take care of themselves and contribute to the system and the whole society.  Esther will not be the same, however.  Money is important.</p><p> It has to be recognised that lower-middle-class families who bring special needs children into this world will not be punished for working hard over the years and not abusing the system.  We are the backbone of society - all the working families - creating value for the future.  I thank members for their time and attention.  Have a lovely day from sunny Tuam.</p></speech>

I thank most sincerely all three of the witnesses who gave evidence this morning.  The contributions of Mr. Douglas, Ms Budayova and Ms Ryan were extremely powerful.  I know each and every member of this committee was extremely anxious that we would hear direct evidence from carers at the coalface.  Our guests have very clearly put across the challenges they are facing and they represent 500,000 people the length and breadth of this country.  They have given a wide range of the challenges and issues they face on a daily basis and the impact of the current means test rules that are in place.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh go l&eacute;ir for the evidence this morning, which was very useful, productive and powerful.</p> <p>  The first person listed for questioning is Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051800002#E00300"><p>I listened with great care to what the witnesses said.  I think we all know the destination to which we want to get.  The question for us as politicians working in the system we work in is how to get to that destination.  There are two very simple wins we should ask for straight out, one of which being that carer's allowance should not be taxable.  The taxation system on social welfare payments is quite complex.  Pensions are taxable but assistance and disability allowance and so on are not.  The invalidity pension is taxable.  It is full of anomalies but a very simple remedy here is to put carer's allowance in the non-taxable bracket.</p> <p>  The second win is to deal with the fuel allowance anomaly, which has been raised by the Chair many times.  The issue then arises in dealing with the system and the fact there are competing demands and that we will be told there are all sorts of unintended consequences in terms of how we actually progress.  Can we make the whole leap to where I think we all would like to go in one jump or do we have to take it in steps?  This is something we will have to reflect on again after this meeting.</p> <p>  One thing that comes across very clearly, particularly where people have children with a disability, is that it involves a very long period in their lives.  It is indefinite, effectively.  On the law of averages, often with older people, it is shorter-term care and could be quite finite.  Things were looked at in the past, such as whether there should be gradation on the level of care to be given or in other words, the level of disability.  There are challenges if we go down that route, however, with many appeals and the question of how we draw the line and actually measure.  It is not that simple.</p> <p>  We may outline why we made a certain pitch as a committee last year.  I stress this was not the destination but was an intermediate stop on the way.  The challenge all the time is whether we should go for broke and maybe get very little or go for something less and maybe get it and build on it.  That is something only we can judge in the circumstance at the time.  I will go very briefly through the problem with the pitch we made with our budget submission.  We suggested the income limits, allowing that our view was the Government was unlikely to abolish them in one go, would be increased to &euro;500 and &euro;1,000.  In other words, they would be increased to &euro;1,000 for a couple and &euro;500 for a single person.  The Minister did something for us on that one but nothing like we asked for.  We wanted a very significant jump in one go.  The second one particularly affects families.  It does not affect older people as much, in other words, people caring for older people and particularly older people caring for older people.  We also suggested in assessing the means that mortgage or rent costs would be deductible.</p><p>I imagine that for many families, that significant reduction would be of assistance in terms of the means test.  The idea behind that proposal was to focus on the types of people who are before the committee today, who probably have a mortgage or rent costs.  Other people I know from dealing with them in my clinic, such as older people, have gone beyond that stage of their lives.</p><p> A bugbear of mine that goes way beyond carer's allowance is the crazy issue of assessment of capital.  I would love, and I think we all would, to get in one go to a place where capital for means-tested payments is assessed on the same basis as the medical card - on the actual income that is earned from the capital, which these days is virtually nil.  However, given that we were not likely to get to the end game in one go, we suggested going from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 for the disregard.  The advantage of taking that approach was that we got the &euro;50,000 disregard.  This is the limit.  Then we suggested that after that, the next &euro;10,000 would be assessed at &euro;10 per week.  The big change we were suggesting was that after that, it would never go beyond &euro;2 per week.  This was a step on the road.  The reason for that was to prove that this will not cost the Exchequer much.  In my view, the capital assessment change would not cost much.  However, it seems impossible to me, as someone who has fought this battle with the Department for years, to get them to see that.  The only way of doing it is on an experimental basis.  We must prove our point and then take the next steps.</p><p> I am outlining what we made the pitch for last year and why we made it.  I do not think anyone who deals with people in a constituency clinic and listens to them, and who encounters the challenges faced by the three witnesses today, would not agree with the destination.  While we agree on it, how do we get there?  </p></speech>

I will speak on where we want to get to.  I will preface this by saying that we have a constructive working relationship with the Department of Social Protection, as we do with this committee.</p> <p>  Ireland does quite well in the area of income supports when compared with Europe.  That is not to say it does good enough.  There is a problem with charting where we want to go.  We have gotten to a point where as long as income support for family carers is viewed in the same context as a special variation on income supports for jobseekers, where one does not want to factor in conditionality, one does not want carers going back to work because that will cost the State more.  As long as that is the world view, we will probably struggle in many ways.</p> <p>  To us, the PUP and the artists&rsquo; scheme present an alternative way of conceiving of income support for family carers.  We completely accept that would be a big step.  Our ask in that regard is not that we rush into anything; it is that the Government looks at this seriously and considers what would be involved.  I know that there are lots of very sharp rocks just below the surface, such as exported benefits.  I know that the Commission is fundamentally not convinced by our distinction between assistance and benefits.  There are all sorts of really technical issues at play in the background.  I am not suggesting that this will be an easy ride.  It is something that is worth aspiring to and moving towards, and a strategy for that is needed.  We do not want movement on this in this year&rsquo;s budget.  We simply want a commitment to start an exercise that would tease it out.  If can be done for artists, and if it can be done when the pandemic hits, we would like to understand why it could not be done for carers, who are a particularly deserving cause.</p> <p>  I would like to address the strategy that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned of taking it one step at a time.  Frankly, I have no argument with that at all.  Making the carer's allowance non-taxable would be a help and addressing the fuel allowance anomaly would be a help.  Yet, we are still left with the issue of who qualifies for carer's allowance.  Then we get into the problem of the means test and, particularly, the disregards.  Deducting the mortgage and rent costs is completely appropriate.  We can get into arguments about moral hazard, such as when somebody lives in a nice big house.  I do not know if you realise that Ms Ryan is addressing the committee from her home.  To me, it looks like a high-dependency unit in a hospital, but it is her home.  As she said, she had to pay for that herself.  She got a contribution towards the costs.  Not only did she have to pay for it, she has to pay to maintain it all.  All of those expenses are simply not considered when one applies a means test.  That seems to be a pretty extraordinary gap in the system.</p> <p>  There are many reasonable incremental improvements that can be made.  I believe in eating the elephant one step at a time.  However, we are also asking for a look at a radical change.  I acknowledged in the speech as a frustration, but it is true, that within the social welfare system carers are generously treated.  Our point is that the social welfare system is not the correct place to be locating them.  I am not, by the way, trying to move away from the Department of Social Protection, which is a great Department to deal with.  However, it is not for income support for working.  That is my response and I thank the Deputy for a constructive contribution.</p></speech>

However, I am looking at Ms Ryan and Ms Budayova.  That long game will not sort out their problems.  We need changes in budget 2023.  This year, we need the carer's allowance to increase to &euro;325.  The changes to which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred, such as bringing the disregard up to &euro;1,000 for a couple, would bring Ms Ryan and Ms Budayova into the loop.  We need things this year, but the long game is the fundamental reform of the scheme.</p></speech>

However, what I think will happen is that a commission, expert body or whatever else will get a report.  We are talking a minimum of two, three or four years down the road.  I have been here long enough to know that.  In the meantime, the house is burning down and the pressure is on the carers.  We need a dual strategy.</p></speech>

All the carers who have spoken have made the point that they have to fight for everything, from a diagnosis to an intervention and to therapies.  A parent was on the news last night.  She has been told that she will have to wait five years before she can see a dietary specialist for her son.  To look at carer's allowance would be to remove one battle from families who are struggling emotionally and financially.</p> <p>  I did a radio interview earlier this morning.  The presenter asked me, "Do you think that everybody should get carer's allowance?  If someone has money in their bank, really should they get it?".  What I should have said to him was that is like me saying to him, "So, would you come into work every day, work every day and do 40 hours per week, or 160 hours per week in the case of a carer, and expect not to be paid for that because you have a bit of money in the bank or because your husband or partner works?".  That is what carers are doing.  They are working 24-7.  The three carers who are here today are doing that every day.  They do it out of the love for the person they are caring for.  Yet, as a society and as a Government, we take that for granted.  We need to step up and to support them.  No carer should have to do this on their own, and thousands of them are doing that.</p></speech>

We can read about it, but it does not matter until we hear about it in the raw flesh with the emotion.  The background story is so powerful.  That is the case for so many carers.  Most of us are private and we do not want to come into a room like this to bare our souls and our family&rsquo;s circumstances.</p><p>We are private people ourselves, and we speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.  My girls will never speak and they are 27 now.  Hopefully, Ms Ryan&rsquo;s and Ms Budayova's children will grow to 27 and beyond and will have a quality of life, but all of our children, whether they are children or adults, depend on us, the parents and the carers, to give them whatever quality of life they get.  They may be in and out of hospital, they may be in and out of services, but that quality is going to be severely impacted by our ability to look after them if we are burdened by debt, by worry about income or by worry about losing carer&rsquo;s allowance or having it reduced.  Our allowance was reduced to &euro;26.50 as part of a review.  While I am not allowed to use certain language here, that is not fair.</p><p> It is not even about the physical money.  It is about being recognised as someone who is doing something and as families that are giving a quality of life that nobody else can give.  We say we value the life of our children but we do not value them if nobody else does.  It is about being able to do it in real terms.</p><p> I mentioned our fear of getting older and frailer and living a life of poverty.  I used to have hair but I do not anymore.  I notice the Chairman used to have hair too.  I am sorry for that.</p></speech>

The medical card covers a lot of costs and takes away some worry.  Why is there an anomaly between what the child needs and what the family needs?  To me, as a carer, it does not make sense.</p> <p>  We talk about being treated with dignity and respect.  The words say all that but the reality on the ground is not that.  We have to fight for everything.  Even if we have a medical card, we have to fight for it every two or three years.  Sometimes we are lucky and it comes automatically in the post, but other years we have had to go back and do the whole thing again.  I have had to bring in my girls and ask people to show me what is different with them now compared with five or ten years ago or what will be different in ten years' time.  Carers are fighting the whole time, and that is taking away essential energy that we need to look after our children.  Even if our children are 27 or 37, they are still our children because the needs they have are equivalent to young babies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051800002#G00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in this morning.  It is a great shame that in 2022 in Ireland, one of the richest countries in the world, they have to come in and bare their souls and tell us stories that are so personal about their children, who they obviously love so much.  It is a great shame that they have to come in here and do that this morning.  However, I am very glad they are before us and very glad that we all got to hear their stories this morning.</p> <p>  For a long time, there have been massive issues regarding carer&rsquo;s allowance, its inadequacy, accessing it in the first instance and accessing it at very reduced rates.  In many instances, it comes down to the fact that, as is the case with many social welfare payments, it is household means tested, and that brings huge difficulty for carers where there is a family with a partner, a husband or a wife.  Much has been brought forward here this morning in regard to abolishing the means test entirely and individualisation, which would take away the household means and would look at the carer as an individual.  If a carer is not working and the means test is just looking at that carer, I imagine they would get the full rate and that would be it.</p> <p>  The foster carer&rsquo;s allowance was mentioned.  Could the carer&rsquo;s allowance follow exactly the same terms and payment rate as foster carer&rsquo;s allowance?  From what Family Carers Ireland said, the foster care allowance is paid at a rate of &euro;325 and that is increased where there are additional needs.  I am not sure how people show what those additional foster care needs are but that payment would then be increased.  Rather than looking at carer&rsquo;s allowance and having a convoluted review that could go on and on, is there a simpler way?  Should we move to what is there for foster care allowance?  I imagine it would not take very long if that was to be done.</p> <p>  The recent report in respect of the cost of disability is very welcome but, of course, there is also the cost of care.  If people are going into the supermarket as a carer or as a non-carer, we can guarantee their trolleys are very different.  There is a cost of care and that needs to be acknowledged.  The Minister of State has been clear in saying in regard to the cost of disability that the Government is looking at making a payment that is determined by the severity of the disability, and the payment will rise depending on that.  Could something similar be brought in as an addition with regard to the cost of care?</p> <p>  In regard to carer&rsquo;s allowance, it has been mentioned that outgoings are not counted, nor is the illness of the person being cared for, which, let us be honest, can vary an awful lot.  No two carers are the same and the care needs of the person being cared for vary - that is absolute and we all know that.  Is it a possibility that it could be looked at in a similar way to the medical card, where outgoings are looked at, considered and taken into account, but there is also a level of discretion for carers so, if a person has a lifelong condition, there would be flexibility whereby, like the medical card, they would put the financial to one side and grant the payment or support?  Is that possible?</p> <p>  The 18.5-hour rule is something I could never get my head around.  It is like saying to a carer that they will work full-time and they will be paid little or nothing, but they are not allowed to go out to educate themselves or work beyond those 18.5 hours.  I know that has moved from 15 hours and that is fine but, to my mind, it is something that should be abolished immediately.  If a carer is caring, we should take them at their word.  They are caring for someone and they should not be told they cannot do this and they cannot do that.</p> <p>  A lady was in touch with me the other day.  She is a home carer with the HSE, as well as caring for her own daughter.  During Covid, many carers could not go into the homes to look after old people who are getting home care and other carers stepped up.  She was one of those who stepped up.  She did additional hours over the 18.5 hours and she has been punished since, yet she did what she felt was right.</p> <p>  The other thing I find odd in regard to the 18.5-hour ceiling is where someone is doing a bit of farming and they are asked how many cattle they have and how much land, and the person in the carer&rsquo;s section behind the computer will determine the case based on the number of cattle they have or the amount of land they farm.  It is bonkers and it should be abolished.</p> <p>  It is very important that the witnesses have come in today.  The pensions solution was mentioned.  The Minister of State said in regard to the Pensions Commission report that she will bring her proposals to Cabinet in the coming weeks.  I love that term because &ldquo;in the coming weeks&rdquo; can mean anything.  I raised it with her yesterday and she said the solution for pensions has been long promised.  All of the time, carers are retiring and they are getting a State pension that is not the full State pension.  That should never happen.  They are entitled to no less than the full State pension.  The longer this is delayed, the more carers going onto the State pension will suffer.  I hope that, ahead of the budget, that will be done for this year because anything that can be done as quickly as possible should be done.  Many things can be done without big reviews by the Minister of State simply engaging with those like the witnesses and Family Carers Ireland, and then doing what she can based on that, rather than having delays and reviews.</p></speech>

As we have already said, the payment is not subject to social welfare means testing and it is not taxed, so there is much to like about it, absolutely.  I would go a step further and ask why not just abolish the means test.  Even to look at the level of severity of the condition requires huge administration in Longford.</p> <p>  Mr. Douglas referred to this figure of 6,000 people.  I have been doing a bit of number-crunching on the figures and it is not easy to get to the bottom of this, but I am getting close.</p></speech>

We are only talking about 6,000 people, and they are the people who cannot get the carer&rsquo;s support grant paid as a stand-alone payment or paid manually, as it is called, throughout the year.  If we multiply that out, it is about &euro;69 million a year, off the top of my head.</p><p>However, that is not the only additional cost because to be fair, people who currently are getting carer&rsquo;s allowance at a reduced level would automatically shoot up to the big level.  That is the kind of money you are talking about.  However, the outcome of that and what we would achieve is something that people who have been in the system for a long time have sought.  I would not mess about and start trying to measure the severity of the condition.  Get rid of it.  It will not be as bad.  </p><p> A number of years ago, a significant amount of money was put aside to give all carers a GP visit card.  It did not cost as much as we had thought it would.  I do not think that this is as awful as we think it is.  It is very doable.  Therefore, I am in favour of getting rid of it.  Again, we have a very good relationship with the people in the Department in Longford who administer this.  They are very good people.  They still will be incredibly busy if the means test were abolished, just making sure that the medical assessments are fulfilled and checking the potential requirement to provide full-time care.  Even just those two things would protect the scheme enough from abuse.  I am all in favour of just getting rid of the means test.</p></speech>

On pensions, it is very important because it is this kind of looking forward to a sense of having some sort of assurance of income.  Most carers have had to give up work.  They have lost their jobs and cannot work.  They have already lost entitlement to pension from those works, even those in the public health service, as my wife and I were.  The whole career has gone.  Sometimes you sit back and dream about what you do when you retire because you will have your pension, lump sum and all that.  Most families have lost that altogether, never mind the loss for their children.  It is like a bereavement in a sense, because your children are not the children you thought you would have.  You love them hugely but the dreams you had for them going off are not there because, to put it bluntly, you are wiping their nappies at 27 years of age, rather than sending them off to have their own children, get married and have a life.  You have given up an awful lot of your pension entitlements and everything else.  You may get something later on.  There are huge losses that most families are very aware of, but people outside caring are not aware of them.  That has to be said.  It is not just the loss of the physical money here and now, it is the loss of the prospective money people would have had because they have sacrificed their careers to look after their children or the families that they love so dearly.  Most of us do it willingly but also because there is nobody else to do it.  If they go into the care of the State, what will happen?  In most cases, the State cannot take them now.  If it does, it is at far more cost than it costs us to do it.  As the ladies have said, we are penalised.  We have all had reviews and we have all been reduced.  Yet, we are expected to keep smiling and keep doing it.  It does not make sense and it is not fair.  It really is not fair.</p></speech>

Ms Duffy mentioned the cost of care in a home.  Just to give that figure again, the study we did shows that the cost of caring for someone with a disability is an additional &euro;244 per week.  The other thing is that in the programme for Government, there were 18 commitments made to family carers as to what it would do to improve their lives.  We reviewed that and did a scorecard on it just late last year, and not one of those 18 were fully achieved.  However, the one that was nearest to being achieved was the pension one.  We absolutely need to see that over the coming weeks and we would welcome that.  Again, for family carers, as Ms Duffy said, it is now.  It is for carers here today.  It is this year and next year.  It is not three or five years.  It is today and tomorrow that they need to see these changes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1400" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051800002#H00400"><p>If the Chairman does not mind, I will keep a little bit of focus on the long-term bit.  I am not taking away from the need for action in this year&rsquo;s budget.  I like the idea of taking the foster carer approach and applying it to all carers.  It is not a social welfare scheme.  It is operated and paid by Tusla.  It is certainly a plausible way to go and quite a practical one.  However, it would require a step outside the current box of thinking and that is why I am bidding for that.  I would also say that it applies to carers of children.  The question then would be around it applying to all carers.  I do not see a reason why it should not apply to all carers, but the foster carer one applies to carers of children.  Once they become adults, the scheme changes.</p> <p>  The 18.5 hour rules were mentioned.  I want to acknowledge here that after several, if not ten or more years, we got up to 18.5.  Frankly, I think the Department is genuinely worried about going any higher because of, again, the implications with the EU of appearing to undermine the rationale or justification of the scheme in European terms.  Where that is so immediate of a concern is not actually around lifetime carers, many of whom have limited ability to go out and work anyhow, but looking at one group, we have focused on young carers who are making the transition from secondary school to college.  They are involved in a substantial caring role at home.  Effectively, to go to college, they would have to travel.  In partnership with third level institutions, we developed distance learning programmes that were specifically designed to ensure that young carers would not have to spend more than 18.5 hours in class contact time, meaning contact time on campus.  However, actually, the way the scheme is interpreted at the minute, all of the work that they do in their home is not appropriately accounted for.  For example, if they decide to do coursework instead of watching television, that coursework counts against the qualification as they are becoming adult carers.  There just seems to be something pretty egregious about that to me.  That is to explain about the 18.5 hours position.</p> <p>  On the State pension, it was already said.  We are hopeful that there will be a positive announcement.  The delay is probably in respect of issues that do not relate to the carer element of that.</p></speech>

At the start, I want to thank Mr. Douglas, Ms Ryan and Ms Budayova for powerful and moving presentations and for giving us an insight into their day and what they do.  I also thank Family Carers Ireland for its continued constructive engagement with this committee.</p> <p>  I think we should strongly endorse the proposals put forward by Family Carers Ireland.  Particularly, Mr. Dunne made the point very well on the artists scheme.  That sets a benchmark.  Carers should be at least brought in line with that.  Mr. Dunne also referenced the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, which had a baseline of &euro;350.  I think we should strongly endorse that and move the payment from &euro;224 up to &euro;325.  We should strongly campaign and advocate for that in budget 2023. </p> <p>  In terms of the means test itself and the actual cost of care, looking in at Ms Ryan's situation, as Mr. Dunne said you would think she was in a high-dependency unit but she is at her home.  She has incurred that cost and she gives that care in a loving way.  The State needs to recognise that in terms of the cost of care and looking at that in terms of the income, and trying to get a balance in terms of the means test.  Obviously, ideally, that means test would be abolished.  As Ms Duffy said, there are safeguards in terms of continuity of care and the amount of time, etc.  Those two points are the ones that we, as a committee, should home in on for budget 2023.  The points made by Mr. Dunne were constructive and achievable and we should endorse them as a committee.</p></speech>

It is heartbreaking to hear and see how people are experiencing something that we all know, because our clinics and constituency offices hear about it every day.  I have just got an email about somebody who is a carer who is looking for support.</p><p>I will not reiterate some of the points Ms Duffy made.  Obviously, that is a strong position we hold.  I would make the point, and I am not sure it was raised already as I arrived a little late, that if one needs to make housing adaptation and cannot afford it, the local authority waiting list for the housing adaptations grant scheme is horrendously long and it is also graded, and one could be waiting for upwards of four to five years for such a grant.  I had been dealing with a person who had a double amputation, was in a bed in his sitting room and had waited four years for that grant.  Unfortunately, the poor man passed away on the week the housing adaption grant came through for him.  That is wrong.  It is heartbreaking to hear of such stories time and again given that we are a wealthy country and can afford to carry out such works.</p><p> Covid-19 proved that when the State wishes to do something, it can do it.  When we thought some issues were immovable mountains, they were moved.  This is one such circumstance.  I doubt there are very few people who would not know somebody who is a carer or who has a family member who is a carer.  In my family's circumstances, there is a carer.  It is the most demanding job anybody could ever do.  People do it because, as has been said, they love the person in need of care and they will never walk away from that.  In some ways that has been exploited because people will never walk away from their mother, brother, son, daughter, aunt or uncle.  We need to show that compassion that we all know is within us.  We need to find ways to address these issues.  There is nothing that cannot be done.  We just need to have the political will to get them across the line.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for their presentations and comments.  I hope many more people see and hear what we have seen and heard today.  That would shift much of the political will we need to shift.</p></speech>

It is absolutely necessary but no family carers want it in their houses.  However, it is what is needed to be able to take care of your loved one.  We were very lucky.  We got the grant from the local council.  We took out a loan and our families and friends fundraised for us, and that is how we were able to put this in place for Liam.  The fact this is what families have to do to have the necessary equipment to look after their child is wrong.  The difference it makes to a family to have everything in place that is needed, even the simple matter of having a ceiling hoist, which members can see behind me, takes a great deal of pressure off a family.  It makes life so much easier to have the correct equipment.  It is pretty much a once-off cost.  One has to cover the cost of maintenance and servicing every year but the main cost is once-off one.  Once a family needs such equipment, they should really and truly get it because it is absolutely necessary.  It takes pressure of them.  It makes the physical side of caring for your loved one bearable and helps you get through the day.  I thank Deputy Donnelly for raising that issue.  That might be taken on board also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1410" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051800002#J00600"><p>I would make two points.  I am conscious we are wandering into the ambits of other committees.  On the housing adaptation grant scheme, which is a constant source of concern for us, generally speaking, the budget for it is underspent.  The scheme operates by requiring co-funding by the local authorities.  Local authorities democratically arrive at a position it is not something they tend to prioritise with respect to maximising their spending.  I am not trying to cut across that but, fairly pragmatically, we are exploring the idea that in some way we might act as a co-funding body instead of the local authorities to enable the scheme to be used more flexibly.</p> <p>  It becomes a real crisis in the context of something like a hospital discharge.  I have been working with carer organisations for 12 years.  When I came into this sector, there had been a "Prime Time" special investigations programme on the sector.  I still have etched in my memory the picture of an elderly woman carrying an adult man, her son, up the stairs because the only bathroom in the house was upstairs.  That is life for some people and it is extraordinary.  To be fair to everybody, there is a scheme.  It is not working in the way most people would like it to work.  I do not believe in jumping up and down and blaming everyone for bad faith.  There is a problem with the scheme.  If there is a way to tweak it administratively to make it work better, that is where I would go with that.</p> <p>  On the question of equipment, it comes more under the remit of the Joint Committee on Health and the health budget.  There is something strange about the culture of what is good enough.  We were speaking on our way into the Houses of a pre-budget submission a few years ago concerning a mother with a child with scoliosis who was in a full-body case to try to straighten her spine.  That is something a child grows out of very quickly.  Such a child would also be in a wheelchair because the child is in a body case and the child would grow out of the wheelchair less quickly.  Such a family would quite regularly have a significant expense.  This family had a discretionary medical card, which at that time had been withdrawn.  They faced the prospect that if they did not have a medical card, they would either have to pay privately for the body case for their daughter or, presumably, they would have to take off the case when it became too small and leave their daughter with none.  That is an inconceivable situation.  At the end of the day, what was probably going on at a policy level was a game of chicken with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, although I do not know that.  However, that family was put through the wringer in terms of having to worry about that right up to the day it happened.</p> <p>  Access to appropriate equipment is essential.  Ms Ryan said that it makes a difference in terms of a family's quality of life.  I would say it is more fundamental that.  It has to do with health and safety.  The use of a hoist for some people is essential.  I would refer to the number of carers who come to us having already crocked their backs, and I am putting that in a mild way.  There is no going back on that.  It can be fixed but those carers will always have that weakness in their backs.  That is an extra burden and challenge for those carers.  The idea they cannot have the equipment they need is wrong.  Many of those hoists are operated by two people if they are to be used safely.  That prompts the question as to whether somebody would be sent in to help a carer at home to use it but, of course, the answer to that is "No".  If a worker is sent in to care for a person who needs to use it, there must be two workers sent in to use it.  However, if a carer is at home alone, that is the carer's business.  What happens is behind the front door.</p> <p>  Both of those are very rich veins to be mined.  In particular, if any member of this committee is also a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, I would be more than happy to talk to them about that scheme in due course.  I would acknowledge those two points.</p></speech>

I would point to another issue we could add to our list of anomalies.  I have dealt with a few cases recently where families in very difficult situations have had people raise money through the GoFundMe platform.  Such money is assessable in a means test for carer's allowance.  For families with a child who has been diagnosed, for example, with cancer, for whom &euro;100,000 has been raised, that GoFundMe money is assessable and the family can lose their carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Anything that can be liquidated or accessed immediately is included in the means test.  I would stress the Department does not want to do that.  The people who operate the system in Longford do not want to do that.  They contacted us to advise the legislation does not allow for this relatively new phenomenon.  It is another anomaly in the system.</p><p>They do not want to do this but they have to.</p></speech>

Their testimony has been very powerful.  As Deputy Donnelly said, it is simply heartbreaking.  Everybody needs to hear what Mr. Douglas, Ms Ryan and Ms Budayova have said.  Most important, we need to remember why we are here today.  This is because of Una, Ailis, Liam and Esther.  They are the most important people we can speak about today.  They are the people we need to care for and for whom the witnesses are doing such an important job.</p> <p>  The means test should be gone.  I agree with what has been said by colleagues.  I know the committee will discuss this.  It is something we need to look at.  We have proposed a disregard of &euro;1,000.  This also had to happen.  Ms Duffy spoke about 6,000 people who may come back into the system if the disregard or means test were gone.  Are we happy this is the figure?  The replies to parliamentary questions my colleagues have received from the Minister state 50% of applicants do not receive a carer's allowance.  This is disgraceful in this day and age.  What are the figures on those who do not qualify for carer's allowance?</p> <p>  I know it is not in the remit of this committee but a review of housing adaptation grants is taking place.  It is very important that we feed into it.  This involves two issues.  The maximum grant is &euro;30,000.  I am dealing with a case were the cheapest quote for a woman coming from hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is &euro;75,000.  This means fund raising and going back to the community welfare officer to try to get additional money to accommodate the lady.  It is disgraceful this has to happen.  There is a review taking place.  Unfortunately it will take a year but it needs to happen and happen quickly.</p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly spoke about social housing.  Carers in social housing are waiting three to four years for their issues to be dealt with.  This is also a serious problem.  In Kildare there are six cases of carers waiting for extensions.  The average waiting time for these six families is two and a half years.  This is what is happening in social housing.  There is the housing adaption grant for those who are not in social housing and waiting lists for those in local authority social housing.</p> <p>  I want to mention sharing care.  I have come across two cases where people share the care of a loved one.  Unfortunately in one of the cases a social inspector knocked on the door.  The lady being cared for was just out of hospital having been there for six months.  Why are we sending social welfare inspectors to investigate this?  It is beyond me.  What this lady is going through with her medical issues is beyond comprehension.  A social welfare inspector was tasked with the job of going out and inspecting the level of care the person was getting.  It is absolutely disgraceful.  I am not sure whether the witnesses come across this but I have come across it twice in recent weeks and I do not understand it.  Perhaps the witnesses will comment on it. </p> <p>  The witnesses have my support and the support of the Labour Party.  We have raised this continuously and we will continue to do so.  I will go to the Seanad to raise it again.  As I said at the beginning of my contribution, the more people who know about Una, Ailis, Liam and Esther, the better, because they are the stories.  I thank Family Carers Ireland for all the work they do.</p></speech>

Of course, we cannot do so.  We can only work off approximates.  I am terribly bad at explaining figures and I will be squinting at everything.  The closest approximate figure we have to the number of genuine full-time family carers who provide care to someone who has been medically assessed as needing full-time care is the number of people who receive the annual carer's support grant.  It is not means tested.  The only difference between it and carer's allowance is that the carer's support grant is not means tested.</p> <p>  In 2021, 115,000 people received this grant.  There were 91,000 people in receipt of carer's allowance and 3,000 people received the carer's benefit.  We also have 51,000 children who received domiciliary care allowance.  All of these people get the carer's support grant.  There is double counting.  Many of the 91,000 who get the carer's support grant because they get carer's allowance do not get it twice because the child is also getting the domiciliary care allowance.  There is all of this double counting.  The only way we can measure how many people would be brought into the net is to look at how many of these people receive the carer's support grant as a stand-alone payment and get nothing else.  It is the one thing they get every year.  From discussing this and speaking to very helpful people in Longford the closest figure we can come up with is approximately 6,000.</p> <p>  I will break down this 6,000.  We absolutely know that 4,363 carers received the carer's support grant in June last year as a stand-alone payment.  Peppered throughout the year are manual applications that can be received until the end of the year.  They can also come in until the end of the following year.  There is an average every year of approximately 2,000.  We can say roughly that anywhere between 6,000 and 7,000, and 7000 is at the generous end, will be brought into the net.  This is the closest approximate we have but it is not a bad one.  It is not the only cost because, as I said earlier, 50% of carers on a reduced rate will have that increased.  We would need a PhD and a calculator for this one.</p></speech>

We have not picked it up as a systemic issue.  To be fair we have no argument in principle with inspections but I have no insight into how particular cases are chosen and what criteria or brief is given to the inspector.  If there is a systematic problem we will certainly happily take it up.  It has not come up organically from carers.</p></speech>

This tends to be where an inspector gets involved.  With regard to the care sharing arrangements Senator Wall referred to, on the previous occasion I got figures from the Department fewer than 50 of these arrangements were in existence.  It is where one person cares one week and a sister or brother cares the other week and there is a set arrangement.  In my experience when an inspector gets involved something has triggered it.</p></speech>

I do not want to sound in any way condescending to people but really and truly we all meet people, as I do in Roscommon and Galway, who cry because of carer's issues.  The Chair knows, and I know from my in-laws, how frustrated people can get.  It can drive people daft at times.  Then they learn to stand back and see the appalling pressure they are under.  We all recognise this.</p> <p>  I am glad Ms Duffy referred to the staff in Longford in the Department.  They are excellent.  I also deal with Roscommon County Council when emergency work has to be done on houses.  The Chair and Deputy Kerrane also know how excellent it is.  It has come on in leaps and bounds.  Sometimes it could do with more money but it deals with people in these situations very quickly and urgently.</p> <p>  One thing we must all realise is that we are now in completely different times.  Energy costs have put severe pressure on people such as the witnesses.  The call for the means test to be abolished should be followed up quickly by the Government.  It should be taken away.  We are speaking about exceptional circumstances and people in very challenging circumstances.  We are speaking about people who probably only get a few hours' sleep per night.  Therefore, the costs of running their homes have increased significantly.  As far as I am concerned we are now in a completely different place.</p> <p>  As members of parties we will bring forward the suggestions the witnesses are making to see what changes we can make.  What are the two things we should prioritise for 2023?  We will not get everything.  I ask each of the witnesses what would be the two things they would now prioritise for us to try to get changed for 2023.  All politicians recognise that Family Carers Ireland are exceptional people in fighting the case.</p><p>We deal with many groups, but this organisation is on the case constantly.  They are people who are easy to deal with and they make their case.  I know they respect our situation and we respect theirs.  What two things would they prioritise?</p></speech>

If there were one or two requests that they would like to see happen before the end of the year, what would they be?  To pick up on what Senator Murphy said regarding the support provided by Family Carers Ireland, I echo the sentiments of Deputy Kerrane and Senator Murphy about the Trojan work that is done locally.  Ms Bernie Dowling in Roscommon does phenomenal work.  She is a very strong advocate for the people she represents, to put it mildly.  Perhaps Mr. Douglas will respond first, followed by the two ladies.  What are the one or two requests that would be at the top of their list?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1420" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien Douglas" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051800002#L00300"><p>One thing mentioned by Ms Ryan was that her child does not have a medical card.  That appears to be disgraceful.  I do not know if that comes under the remit of this committee, but the fact that the medical card is not available causes big problems.  That is one thing.  Why is there no medical card?  It cannot be means tested; it should be based on the needs of the person.  Second, if the means test cannot be abolished, the bands should definitely be widened.  That would make a big difference to many people.</p> <p>  The third is specifically to take into account the huge cost involved in providing the care.  I have to replace a wheelchair van in the coming year.  It is going to cost me the guts of &euro;45,000.  That comes from money that I am means tested on already.  I have saved it because I knew this was coming.  People have had to pay for their own equipment.  That should not happen.  Why should we be penalised?  I cannot have steak on a Sunday because I have to pay for my van next week or next year or I have to put diesel in it.  I am being facetious, but one is constantly concerned about the cost of living normally, not to mind the extra costs that result from providing care, about which there is no choice.  One has to do it.  My girls cannot give me any other options.  They cannot tell me what their will and preferences are.  I have to look after them in every way possible.  If the costs involved in the cost of caring could be taken into account, that would be a massive advantage.</p></speech>

Abolishing the means test would be the big one.  If that cannot be done, definitely expand the bands greatly.  Also, the carer's allowance rate could be raised quite significantly, as was mentioned earlier, perhaps in line with the artist rate of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  There is also the cost of care, as Mr. Douglas said.  I have to correct one thing.  Liam has a medical card.  I believe Ms Budayova was speaking about that earlier.  The cost of care includes the cost of the wheelchair vans and the cost of electricity for running all the equipment in the house.  The cost of care is crippling.  We have no option but to buy these big diesel wheelchair vans and it is a huge expense.  It is the initial outlay really.  There are the diesel costs and everything else as well, but the initial outlay is very difficult for families.  If the cost of care could be taken into consideration as well, that would be a big one for us.</p></speech>

There should be an end to the means test.  We know the diagnosis of my baby who is only 11 months.  We already have five diagnoses.  That is expensive; the cost is huge.  We know what is ahead of us.  It is probably not good to say it - it is terrible - but there is a big chance she will tick more boxes and more diagnoses, which we already have to deal with emotionally.  With any visit to the hospital there is stress about what it will be this time, and one is not ready for this.  A huge thing for any parent in our situation is not to need to be worried that there will be no money for diesel or for appointments or for babysitting because they are massive costs.  That should be represented and we should be accepted as citizens.  For me, I feel as if I am a second-class citizen because I am caring and because this is not recognised.  That would be different for any one of us.</p></speech>

However, they are vital necessities.  Whether it is Mercedes or a Ford Kombi that one gets converted, one needs it because without it one's children will not go out.  Try to get onto a double-decker bus with two wheelchairs to travel from Lucan to Dublin - it will not happen.  One needs that.  They are seen as lovely vehicles, and they are because they have to be comfortable, but they cost a huge amount of money in addition to money to get them adapted for one's needs.  They cost huge money to run as well.  They are not luxuries, but vital necessities to have any kind of quality of life and to get out.  For ourselves, the girls are lucky now to have day services, but there is no transport provided.  We have to bring them up and down every day.  We have to have that for them.  One cannot depend on CIE, Dublin Bus or anyone else to do that.</p></speech>

Outgoings such as rent, costs of care, in particular, travel, dietary requirements and incontinence care should be included.  A broader issue is to stop family carers having to bare their souls through the media and coming here today and having to tell their stories, and that is what has to happen for one individual to get his or her situation fixed.  We support people to do that because the system is flawed and broken.  Rather than trying to just react to he who shouts loudest, we must fix the system.  The increase in carer's allowance and abolishing the means test would be a very significant and positive step towards that.</p></speech>

I believe it should be abolished.  I also fully support the increase in the carer's allowance.  I see at first hand in my mother's house the great work that carers do.  She is 95 years of age and the care they give is unbelievable.  Family carers cannot give the same care that these carers give.  What they do is specialised and they know what they are doing.  I have seen that they give loving care to older people and I support the call for the increase in the allowance for the family carers.  The work they carry out is incredible and they should be properly compensated for that work.  I honestly believe the means test should be abolished.  We need more and more carers.  Why should we be putting obstacles in the way of good carers who could be carrying out some very valuable work?  The fact that there is a means test deters them from doing that type of work.  I fully support the many issues that have been raised and I compliment our guests for coming here and making their contributions today.</p></speech>

However, I particularly wanted to attend the meeting this morning to hear the proceedings.  I am very glad I did.  I am glad on two fronts.  The testimony from Mr. Douglas, Ms Ryan and Ms Budayova was extremely powerful.  I am reminded of when I was a member of the finance committee and the people who were impacted by tracker mortgages appeared before it and told their stories.</p><p>That was real turning point in that campaign and in getting the financial institutions to listen.  I hope people are listening today.  I am heartened that all of the Government representatives here today support Family Carers Ireland's strategy.  They are representatives of the Government and they are saying that this must be done.</p><p> There is a commitment that has to be followed through on not only with regard to this budget, but in respect of what needs to be done in the long term.  It is very obvious to us all that the system is broken and that there is failure here on the part of the Government and the market on many different levels.  We have the evidence.  Often, when tackling a problem in government, there is not sufficient evidence to back up what is being said but we have the economic evidence and the evidence on every other front so we do not need to gather any more.  We know the system is broken and we know what needs to be done.  I can give an example of this broken system from the people I deal with.  Somebody I know has autism and is asked every two years whether they still have it.  I am not a medical practitioner but I know that, when someone has an autism spectrum condition, they will still have it later.  It is not something that goes away overnight.  Why are people wasting so much time?  There is so much wastage here.  So much money is wasted across the system in analysing, investigating and doing everything else that needs to be done.</p><p> A couple of things really stood out for me in Ms Ryan's testimony.  She mentioned that, when her carer's allowance was slashed by &euro;90 a week, with the allowance equating to 78 cent per hour, she was told that she should not look at it like that.  There is a message there.  That really resonates.  It suggests that it is somehow the carers' fault and that they are looking at the wrong way rather than the system being broken and failing them.  Ms Budayova said that carers are punished for working hard and not abusing the system.  It is not only her who is being punished for working hard, but her other children and her partner as well.  She spoke about not being valued and the physical, emotional and financial strain involved.  The physical and emotional strain probably cannot be taken away to any great extent, although something can be done for the physical strain with respite services.  I have major problems with such services not being available.  I met the autism action group in my county of Mayo a couple of weeks ago to discuss the lack of residential places available.  There is no respite for people at all.  That is something which needs to be invested in.</p><p> We and the Government make choices.  We gave a 9% VAT rate to hotels and the hospitality sector but, if you try to get a bed in Dublin tonight, you will be charged &euro;425 for a single room.  They are absolutely packed and booming and we saw fit to cut their VAT rate to 9%.  Then you look at what Ms Ryan and Ms Budayova are being put through.  We really need to examine the system.  I hear what the witnesses are saying with regard to medical cards and widening the bands.  They have provided quite a lot of evidence as to what needs to be done.</p><p> I will commend my colleagues, Deputy Kerrane - who is here and did not know I was going to say this - and Deputy Tully.  They compiled a charter for family carers for our party.  Many of the things that were mentioned today are included in it.  That goes some way towards showing our intent to tackle the issues that are there.</p><p> I have one question for the witnesses.  As bad as things were financially six months ago, will they explain the situation for family carers in the here and now in light of inflation, the cost of living, the price gouging and everything else that is going on?  Family carers are struggling and trying to get through the cost-of-living crisis.</p></speech>

Deputy Conway-Walsh was not here at the start of the meeting but I made the point then that the Minister is personally committed to this issue.  From talking to Members who are in the Government, those who support the Government and those who are in the Opposition, I know that this is one issue that crosses all party lines.  There is unanimity as to where we want to go.  We now have to find a vehicle to actually achieve it.</p></speech>

During the Covid pandemic, Family Carers Ireland set up a crisis fund because so many carers were struggling financially.  Over the two-year period, we have given out more than &euro;350,000.  That is used to put food on tables and oil in tanks.  We bought bite-proof clothing for one mum because her daughter was biting her.  Her behaviour had regressed because she had lost all of her services and supports.  We cannot imagine how challenging the Covid pandemic has been for family carers.  I refer particularly to carers of children and adults with intellectual disability and behaviours that might be challenging, but it has been challenging for all family carers right across the board.  They have struggled significantly and then, as the Deputy has said, the cost of living has increased.  Those on carer's allowance are not included among those eligible for fuel allowance.  Those pressures have been immense.  We have never seen so many carers struggling financially as we have over the past two and a half years and we continue to see that as we come out of Covid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1432" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051800002#M00400"><p>I have a very neat answer to the Deputy's question.  The study done by the Vincentian Partnership to which Mr. Dunne and Ms Cox referred was based on a basket of goods and services that were priced in March last year, before the cost-of-living crisis.  Before this crisis, the additional costs facing families averaged &euro;244 per week.  That has obviously increased.  What is really interesting about that is that Sr. Bernadette Mac Mahon and her team in the Vincentian Partnership found that those additional costs do not only come from the things we know of and have talked about today such as transport and household goods.  Families like Ms Budayova's, Ms Ryan's and Mr. Douglas's are also having to pay privately for services that are meant to be public.  I do not think Ms Budayova will mind me using her example because she has given me permission before but she has just been advised by her local public health nurse to pay privately for an occupational therapist because she has no hope of getting one through the public system.  That is the advice that is being given out.  I do not blame the public health nurse in that instance.  That is where a lot of these costs are coming from - paying privately for what should be publicly available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1433" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna Budayova" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051800002#M00500"><p>I will have to correct Ms Duffy.  Unfortunately, Esther had several choking incidents.  Up to that, no one was listening to me but when I contacted top management of the early intervention services, having sent several emails, I was able to avail of one visit from an occupational therapist and a speech therapist.  They should help me.  I never mentioned in my earlier statement but, because Esther was nasogastric tube-fed for nearly six months, she never developed muscles in her throat or those needed to chew properly so she was not able to eat.  That led me to a situation where I was desperate.  I was begging everyone because my child was choking.  At this point, Esther was assessed by someone.  She had a proper sitting.  Again, it is a long story so I will not go into detail but I was put in a situation where my child nearly died.  Only at that point was I able to get this treatment.  What was available through the public system was not enough and I had to go to a private speech and language therapist, who is helping Esther to properly develop her muscles rather than just observing how she is eating.</p></speech>

We all know there are staff shortages in many professions within the health service that are making it problematic to access services.  One of the responses to that from the HSE - we are negotiating with it at the minute but you can understand where it is coming from - is a suggestion to train family carers to do a certain amount of this at home.  That is a constructive approach involving social solidarity but the income support framework and the attitude to how we value caring sits very oddly with carers playing a key part in helping to resolve a crisis.</p><p>Many carers are nervous and unhappy about the idea that they will get a three-hour training session after which they no longer need an occupational therapist.  Clearly, we are not buying into that scenario, just in case it sounds as if we are.  The idea that people might be able to do more at home is certainly one that should always be looked at but only in the context of a system that values and appreciates them and does not leave them out of pocket for doing it.</p></speech>

I am not a member of this committee.  What we have been discussing this morning is very much in line with what we have been discussing at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, of which I am a member.  We see the same problems happening.  One of the issues that comes to mind is the individualisation of supports for people, which is a long-term ambition of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  That would be backed by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p> <p>  Ms Budayova is from my home town of Tuam.  We have been working with her and her husband.  She has described the issues her daughter Esther has.  They are different from those of other children.  The challenges that people face are different.</p> <p>  An Indecon report on people with special needs or disabilities found that costs are between &euro;12,000 and &euro;15,000 per annum on top of whatever people are getting.  That issue needs to be addressed and the Government is aware of it.  It crosses this committee, the Committee on Disability Matters and the Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Deputies Paul Donnelly and Kerrane spoke about the shortfall in the housing adaptation grant and noted that the grant amount is fixed even though costs are rising.  We need to look at that in the round.</p> <p>  When people appear as witnesses before a committee like this and bare their souls to outline what is happening in their homes, it is an indictment on us as politicians that we are not taking better care of them.  Unfortunately, there may be some things in political life that we might not be proud of.  We really need to take on board what we have heard this morning.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, we have short-term gains coming into the next budget.  We also need to try to fix this problem permanently over the next two or three years.</p> <p>  People in rural areas have major problems with transport to get them to hospitals for appointments as well as getting people to mind their other children while they might have to spend three or four hours in a hospital.  We take all this for granted when we are not involved in it.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair for allowing me to contribute.  I will endorse whatever proposals come from this committee.  Perhaps the Chairman could speak to the Chair of the Committee on Disability Matters.  Perhaps we could make a joint submission on the budget as a united approach has more impact.</p> <p>  I again commend the witnesses on their bravery in addressing the committee today.</p></speech>

I know that next month we will have a meeting with the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine specifically to deal with issues regarding carers involving departmental officials.  We are willing to work with every committee in order to facilitate these issues.</p> <p>  Some members had to leave and they have sent me messages which I wish to put on the record.  Deputy Joan Collins had to go to another meeting.  She wished to thank Mr. Douglas, Ms Ryan and Ms Budayova for their testimonies.  They have made a powerful case for fundamental changes that are needed for carers.  She wishes to thank Family Carers Ireland for its proposals.</p> <p>  Senator Garvey also indicated she had to leave.  She has read all the correspondence and it seems to her that the bottom line is that we need to increase the carer's allowance.  If the means test is to stay, it needs to be raised beyond the current threshold.  She wanted to ask if it is true that carers' work in the home is not recognised as work, in that they only qualify for a non-contributory pension, a position she believes to be unsatisfactory.  The committee and the Pensions Commission have made recommendations on the pension issue.  Hopefully we will see some positive progress on it soon.</p></speech>

She and I were also lucky enough to have an audience with the Pensions Commission early last year.  The commission's report last October took on board all our proposals pretty much word for word.  If that is accepted by the Minister, as we hope it will be, it will really address that long-standing pension anomaly that has affected so many family carers, particularly, but not only, farming families.  Hopefully, in the coming weeks we will hear an announcement to address that.</p> <p>  The Pensions Commission has proposed that for anyone who is a lifetime carer, which is defined as someone who has cared for more than 20 years - normally parents of children - those 20 years of caregiving will be recognised as if they have been in the workforce and they will have contributions paid in respect of that.  That should give them a full complement that would warrant them getting the contributory State pension at its maximum level.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Mr. Dunne mentioned that he believed that a review to be undertaken would possibly see the abolition of the means test or the establishment of a participation income for carers as recommended in the NESC report in 2020.  Will Family Carers Ireland now formally call for the Minister to abolish the means test in the budget?  I imagine Family Carers Ireland has the same issue that the rest of us have had.  We have not been able to get a figure.  It is welcome that Ms Duffy has some figures.  Our biggest barrier is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has not been able to give us a cost of abolishing the means test for carer's allowance.  It is welcome that figures are now available and we can all get on board.  It is not an either-or; it is the abolition of the means test.  Is that clearly what Family Carers Ireland will request?  I want to ensure we are all on the same page.  We will publish a report making recommendations.  I would like us to be very much in line with what Family Carers Ireland is requesting.  The carers who have appeared before the committee today have been clear that is what they are looking for and I presume it is what most carers are looking for.</p></speech>

Participation income is like a universal basic income which just recognises the contribution by the recipient.  In this case the carer is getting a guaranteed payment, the carer's allowance, in recognition of the care he or she provides and his or her contribution to society.  They are almost the same thing; in fact, I think they are the same thing.  It would not necessarily be the Department of Social Protection that would undertake the review of the carer's allowance because it must be within the broader health and social care environment.  The terms of reference should include comparing the abolition of the means test with the establishment of a participation income, as recommended by NESC.  To my simple mind, they are not very different if different at all.</p></speech>

If we do not get it, we will be looking for its effective abolition.  I always acknowledge with social protection issues the enormous technical complexities relating to the European framework in which they are created and operate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1442" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051800002#N00800"><p>I wish to pick up on a few points in the evidence given this morning.</p><p>I had a considerable amount of engagement with the former Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Senator Regina Doherty, regarding the 18.5 hour ceiling, which was increased from 15 hours.  We made significant progress on getting that over the line at the time.  The issue specifically related to full-time carers who had an older person in an adult training centre.  The case I had was that of a younger person who was in a training centre and out of the home for in excess of 20 hours per week.  This person's mother wanted to be able to continue to use home help, which she had done, but she was being penalised because of that, even though it was not possible for her to provide any care.  I can see the concern the Department has but the way around it is to have a discretionary element in respect of the 18.5 hours, where there is flexibility in individual cases on education and a young person being able to study at home, which third level institutions can facilitate and were able to do over the past two years.  That flexibility should be inbuilt to facilitate young carers in being able to gain a third level qualification with that type of hybrid model.  The Department should be able to have that flexibility.</p><p> From my personal dealings with the officials in Longford, they have been more than helpful in individual cases.  They will bend over backwards to try to approve a carer's allowance application but, to a certain extent, their hands are tied by the guidelines and regulations that are laid down.  Where I have gone to them and explained the circumstances, they have taken a can-do attitude.  I will put on record the work being done by the staff in Longford.</p><p> Deputy Canney and I have spoken at length about the housing adaptation grant.  A constituent of mine, who is from the same county as the Deputy, has received the maximum grant of &euro;30,000.  This person's only source of income is social welfare.  The credit union has facilitated this individual as best it can and granted a loan of &euro;8,000, but the cheapest price they have been quoted to carry out the work is &euro;45,000, which is &euro;7,000 short.  It looks like that person will have to go on to the local authority housing list to look for housing because the current house is unsuitable to meet their needs due to a shortfall of &euro;7,000.  The other alternative is the person, even though they are under the age of 66, goes into long-term nursing home care.  Both options are a multiple of the cost of making up that shortfall for a downstairs bedroom and bathroom.  It is something that needs to be looked at urgently.</p><p> Clearly, the call from today's meeting is we need a radical change in the financial supports for carers that are in place.  We need to consider it from a very different base and very different criteria that should not be based on the means coming into a household.  It should be based on the care that is being provided.  That is something the committee will reflect on and I have no doubt will incorporate into its recommendations.</p><p> The firm view of every single member of this committee was we were extremely anxious to hear directly and at first-hand from carers today and that their story would be put on the public record.  Today's meeting was very much about giving voice to their issues.  I particularly and most sincerely thank Ms Budayova, Ms Ryan and Mr. Douglas.  I will leave the last word from today's meeting with them, if they want to come back to make a final comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1444" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien Douglas" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051800002#O00200"><p>We each gave our story today.  We each opened our hearts to the committee and to whoever else sees the meeting.  We were constrained by the time we had to make our presentation.  If we had longer, and a cup of tea and a scone, members would hear an awful lot more harrowing things, as well as joy.  It is not all bad news but it is real news, real family life and real family dilemmas.  That might be for another occasion.  If members were to dig into any of our stories, they would get an awful lot more stuff.  Certainly, there are things my wife would not like me to say in public to anybody else because there are real things we just cannot share with anybody else, except possibly with other carers because they know it, they are living it and they know where we are coming from.  That is one point.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned somebody whose son goes to day services.  As I said, when a child who is attending a special school reaches 18 years, school is gone and there is the whole thing about getting appropriate day services.  If people are lucky, those services will be five days a week, if they are very lucky they will be six hours a day, and if they are very, very lucky they will include transport to and from services within that six hours.  It is not as though those six hours a day are theirs to go off and sunbathe or anything else.  These are the hours they spend washing, cleaning, hoovering, shopping and doing all the other stuff that needs to be done, even just eating peacefully and getting a bit of lunch.  In our case, once the girls come home at 4 o'clock in the evening or whatever, we are at it full time with them between feeding, changing, some sort of therapies and whatever else we need to do.  Even when they are in bed, we have monitors on to check whether they are choking, having seizures or whatever is going on.</p> <p>  Due to Covid, respite care is more or less gone.  Where it has come back, it is very limited compared with what it was.  If someone is unlucky enough to get Covid, he or she is still on call because if the button comes out, that person is called to go and fix it.  It is not like there is staff on duty.  If there are any problems, we have to bring people to hospital because there is no staff cover.  We spoke earlier about using a hoist.  When the girls were in school, I was involved in drawing up policies for hoisting.  Health and safety is very explicit in that there has to be two people to do it.  I have no problem with that but when I go home, those policies are totally invalid because my wife is not always there, or I am not there when she needs to do it, and it comes down to one person alone.  There is a major dichotomy between what we expect from professional services and what we as carers have to do on a day-by-day and hour-by-hour basis.</p> <p>  There are more anomalies than just money and so on.  It is about understanding what the life of a carer is.  This is not giving out, moaning or anything else.  It is trying to have people understand the real story behind it.</p></speech>

The reason I chose to sit in Liam's room was to tell a story through pictures as well.  I often think you can tell somebody a story but if he or she can actually see the situation, it makes it clearer.  As Mr. Douglas said, there is so much work involved and we are going 24 hours a day.  Even when Liam is in his special school, I have to stay around home because I never know when I will get a call that he is unwell.  We never get a full break.  This will sound a little daft, but we are actually quite lucky that Liam is under the care of LauraLynn children's hospice.  That is the only respite we get during the year.  If it was not for LauraLynn, we would never get outside our home at all.  We are depending on these charities to give us an opportunity to be able to do something with our other children.  As I said, Liam is a twin.  Sean went into first year this year, which is a big change in his life, so we are trying to look after our whole family.</p><p>As Mr. Douglas said, no two families are the same, but there is so much joy.  Every family carer wants to be able to look after their loved one in their own home.  All we are asking for is a little bit of support financially and with services.  I refer to the whole dynamic of caring for someone with special needs or with an illness and the whole package in that context being examined.  It will only be through giving family carers like ourselves the opportunities to tell our stories that we will be able to educate other people.  I say that because it is hard to know what is involved in being a family carer.  I would not have had a clue what family carers did before I had my boys.  It is very hard for people to know what is involved in being a family carer, so I appreciate this opportunity to tell our story today.  I hope something will come out of this meeting and that improvements can be made for all family carers in Ireland.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I am only sorry I was not able to hold back expressing my cares.  To be honest, I realise I have been recounting my personal story and it was hard to control that.  I am sorry.  I love my daughter and I always do everything possible in my strength for her.  I am so happy to have this opportunity to say out loud that she matters.  It is very important to say our loved ones matter to us as parents and carers, because no one sees what we are doing behind the closed doors.  The members were listening today, however, and I truly appreciate whatever support might be possible.  The committee is limited in what help it can give us now, and we know that, but it supports us in what we are trying to do, and this is the message to be taken away by every parent in Ireland.  I say that because anyone could be in my shoes any time.  I thank the members of the committee very much.</p></speech>

They have given us a real insight into another side of family life and its dilemmas.  It is important, however, to say there is also real joy in each and every one of these families.  I sincerely thank the witnesses for attending and for their constructive and positive engagement with the committee.  We will shortly discuss our next considerations of this matter in private session.  Our intention is to present a report on our deliberations to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shortly thereafter.

The meeting will be held in two sessions.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome to the first session, which is to discuss the future of the An Post network, the Irish Postmasters Union representatives: Mr. Ned O'Hara, general secretary; Mr. Sean Martin, president; and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n McEntee, vice president.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statement is potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present.  Witnesses participating from a jurisdiction outside the State should be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they be physically present in the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit a member to participate when they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  I ask any member participating via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contribution,  they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  Members attending in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. O'Hara to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by Sean Martin, postmaster in Tramore, County Waterford and president of the union; and Ciar&aacute;n McEntee, postmaster in Three Mile House, County Monaghan and vice president.  We are pleased to appear before the committee and hope our contribution will help in its deliberations.</p> <p>  The Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, is the representative body for postmasters in Ireland and celebrates its 100th anniversary this year.  We represent 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s postmasters.  Most post offices - and many people do not know this - are independent businesses run by postmasters under contractual arrangements first developed in 1907.  We are independent small and medium enterprises contracted by An Post to run post offices.  We are not State employees.  We are not paid a fixed salary but make our living on a fee-per-transaction basis.  </p> <p>  The post office network is a well-established national asset and is ever evolving.  It is the largest retail network in Ireland with 920 branches.  Some 875 post offices are run by independent postmasters who operate as small businesses and provide employment for almost 1,500 full-time equivalents. </p> <p>  The network provides a range of traditional postal, financial, e-commerce and Government services to over 1.3 million people, or 28% of the population, every week.  The key services provided through the network are mails and parcels; social welfare payments; An Post Money, involving current account, credit card and personal and green loans; everyday banking for commercial banks, involving lodgements and withdrawals for Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland; Government services such as television and dog licences, Garda fines and passport express; financial services for the National Treasury Management Agency, including prize bonds, fixed-terms savings, regular savings and deposit accounts.  In the commercial arena we provide retail products for bill pay, money transfers, Western Union, national lottery, gift vouchers, mobile phone top-ups, iTunes vouchers and the Postmobile service.</p><p>We serve a valuable social purpose and play an important role in local communities.  We act as an anchor providing a local government, business and social presence.  It connects family and friends, fosters democracy and is a key part of our emergency and national infrastructure.  We provide an essential public service in urban and rural communities, helping to address financial and social exclusion as we fill the gap left by retreating banks, Garda stations and struggling high streets.  We operate in places where other retailers do not and we offer services that other retailers do not.  We are one of the last institutions offering five and a half days of face-to-face service.  In many communities, the post office is the last remaining entity for financial services as retail banks reduce their branch networks or withdraw from the market entirely.</p><p> Throughout the Covid19 pandemic, postmasters defined the essence of public and community services, keeping the network open to ensure the continued distribution of cash to customers and the economy.  We operated without interruption providing a full range of financial services, vital social welfare payments and much needed business continuity that supported the national economy.</p><p> It is hard to put a price and value on this service - indeed, it is actually priceless - but the social value of the post office has been independently valued to be at least &euro;344 million in a report by Grant Thornton that was published in 2020.  The union recently published a new report by Grant Thornton, which found that the network has the capacity to provide solutions to modern challenges.  It identified a range of Government services that can be provided through the network that will support Government in achieving its central policies, including rural development, remote working and climate action.</p><p> On the provision of everyday banking services, approximately 540 post offices in Ireland are located in areas where there are no banks within 5 km.  Accessible banking for everyone should be a basic right and it can be met through our extensive network.</p><p> In the same way, with Garda stations closed in many communities and to alleviate the administrative burden on garda&iacute;, identification services for passports and driving licences and the maintenance of the electoral register can and should be provided by local post offices.  The network is ideally placed to ensure that people have the option of person-to-person offline access to vital services, particularly for those who do not transact online.  Covid-19 has highlighted that significant numbers of people are not online and many leaned on their post office for services, information and advice.  There is an opportunity for the network to become a green hub for the processing and delivery of retrofitting grants and delivery of vital services and actions to achieve our climate targets and a low-carbon economy.</p><p> A re-think of how the post office network is being funded for its role in supporting wider social and community goals is now urgently required.  The Grant Thornton report recommended that the Government invest with urgency in the post office network and pointed to a &euro;12 million funding gap which needs to be met by Government investment in order to retain the valuable services provided by postmasters.  This funding gap, which was previously estimated at &euro;17 million, has been reduced by &euro;5 million through the efforts of postmasters investing in our businesses, working with An Post, getting trained, securing additional services and responding to community needs.</p><p> We are reaching a crisis point.  That is the stark reality.  The Irish post office network is at a critical juncture.  We now need a firm commitment from Government that it will pay a contract fee of at least &euro;12 million for the delivery of essential services and we need that commitment in the coming weeks or post offices will close.  We receive calls daily from burnt-out postmasters in all areas of the country who are seriously considering their immediate future.  Many local post offices - large and small, urban and rural - will likely be forced to close if the financial conditions under which they operate do not change.  If Government does not take action and take it very soon, large scale resignations - the term we use is "unrestrained resignations" - and closures will be inevitable.</p><p> Throughout the pandemic, postmasters never once shut the doors.  We more than proved our worth and our importance to society but we are now left fighting for our own survival.  The post office is one of the most trusted brands in Ireland.  It is hard to think of another business that offers as many essential everyday services while at the same time providing a vital service to the community.  Allowing post offices to fail would harm the national economy while devastating many vulnerable households and communities.  We are calling on the Government to recognise the national asset it has in the post office network.  It matters as much today as it did 100 years ago and will be even more critical in the future.</p></speech>

I thank the Irish Postmasters Union for being here.  It has appeared before this committee and its predecessor on many occasions.  I compliment the witnesses again today on the very straightforward presentation they provided us with.  I do not think they are asking for anything other than what they are entitled to and to which the State is entitled.</p> <p>  The post office network provides a hugely valuable service.  There is no doubt that over recent years, the demand for the services has reduced and that will continue over time in the way in which people are living their lives.  They are transacting much more online.  Notwithstanding that, a very considerable cohort of people out there use the services that are currently available.  The postmasters have rightly identified on many occasions that it would be wrong to deprive those people of that service.  They have challenged us now and in the past, particularly Government, to identify a suite of services that could be delivered through their offices and unfortunately, that has not been forthcoming.  If that was in place, it would make their service more viable on the basis that they are contracted on a per-click basis, if you want, or a transactional basis, and they have done really well at that.</p> <p>  First, I want to express my continued and ongoing support.  In a previous role, I prepared a paper on this particular matter in which we looked at the idea of having a public service obligation on the post office.  That has not materialised, unfortunately, but if we even pull back from what the actual solution is or what the particulars of it might be, the overarching requirement in my view is to provide a stream of funding to An Post to contract with it to provide services, whatever those services might ultimately be.</p> <p>  From my perspective on the committee, I fully support that approach.  I would hope that the committee will be able to take a decision at the end of this hearing.  I propose in a formal way that the committee endorses the witnesses' recommendations today and that we send a strong message from this committee to the Government that we want to see an amount of money.  I estimated it in the past, and there will have been inflation and all of that, which the witnesses will know about and with which we are all coming to terms, somewhere between &euro;10 million and &euro;12 million as the amount of money that would be required to address the deficit, if you want, or moneys that would be needed to ensure that no further offices close.</p> <p>  In my constituency and others, we have seen smaller offices close, which is regrettable.  I know there is not a capacity to turn those back but we want to protect and preserve what we have.  If we are serious as politicians, then we should be prepared to recommend to Government that an amount of money yet to be determined, which in my view is somewhere between &euro;10 million and &euro;12 million, should be made available to An Post with the very strict instructions that the money goes towards the preservation and protection of the existing network.  In parallel with that, let us all work to try to ensure there is a greater suite of services in a changing society that would make some of the offices viable.</p> <p>  I will go back to a point I have often made before, however.  We should not be just talking about the viability of a service provider.  Nobody looks at a road and asks whether it is viable.  To me, the post office is as important in a village as the road that gets a person to the village.  In many cases, it is the harp over the door.  It is the only element that says the State still values this village.  I can tell you as a rural representative traversing the county, as I do every week, that as a State and as an institution, Government and Parliament, we were damn glad of those villages when people could not travel any more than 2 km from their homes during the pandemic.  It was the post offices and small shops that kept the whole show on the road during that time when those of us who travel around more and go to centres to do shopping were not able to do so.  Thankfully, the post office and the shop were there.  The witnesses know better than I that when the post office goes, it is not long before the shop goes as well.  It  starts a rot, unfortunately, on which we have to turn the tide.  On the positive side, if there is any positive to come out of the pandemic, it is the fact that people now see an opportunity to work from home and live in rural areas and villages again.</p><p>Thankfully, the post offices have stayed the distance.  I hope we can start with the roll-out of broadband, which is now at an advanced stage, so that more and more people will be able to live in villages and their surrounding areas in rural Ireland.  Therefore, it is vital that we retain that key piece of connectivity.  The presentation has been on the money.  I do not need further explanation, and I expect that will be the case with most people.  I have little further to say other than I am committed to that.  I hope we can take a unanimous approach.  I propose that we send a message from this committee to endorse everything the postmasters are doing.  We want the Government to provide a stream of money, between &euro;10 million and &euro;12 million - but it can be determined - to support what they do.  We will also ask that the work on what further services they can provide is expedited.</p></speech>

We have also sent an invitation to An Post.  We take what Senator Dooley said very seriously and we as a committee support it, but we want to be proactive about it as well.  I invite Mr. O'Hara to respond to Senator Dooley's comments.</p></speech>

I put on the record that he has long been a supporter of the post office network.  Today, I came across a picture of him from 15 or 16 years ago supporting the post office network.

In recent months, our members have been out meeting people and the support and courtesy they have got from all public representatives has been heartening.  While we are getting the help and support, we now need action.  That is what we are here for today.  We are here to call on the Oireachtas to ask the Government to act on the Grant Thornton report and to deliver, as our general secretary said, the &euro;12 million that is needed.  Anything less, even &euro;11 million, would probably put 100 post offices at risk.  For the sake of between &euro;1 million and &euro;3 million, we must ensure that it is &euro;12 million at a minimum.</p></speech>

We have two sets of witnesses today that embody something that is rare in this country, which is trust.  Mr. O'Hara referred to it in his opening statement.  The people of Ireland trust our post office network and they have every reason to do so.</p> <p>  I am only a Deputy for two years, but I was on the staff here previously.  I am still scratching my head as to why we are in this perennial position of crisis and being about to fall off a cliff and having to ask the Government for what is essentially a modest amount of money in the overall scheme of things to protect a service that is nationwide, massively trusted, and provides a plethora of vital services.  In addition, the postmasters are not asking for money to stand still with the services they have or to prop up outdated and antiquated services, they are offering solutions to modern challenges and problems and saying not only will they continue to do the work they are doing, but offering services relating to passports, drivers' licences and daily banking.  We have spoken at length about the problems we had with driving licence renewals and the very thin regional spread of the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, centres, the fact they do not take cash and that they are closed, yet we have a network that is spread all over the country with people willing to do this service and with the expertise to do it, but the Government never seems to pick up the phone to ask them to do that.</p> <p>  I fully endorse and support what Senator Dooley asked.  We should do that.  I have one question.  Why are we continually here?  As a representative body, the IPU is asking for a modest amount of money for a service that is trusted.  A post office is essentially a one-stop shop.  We want that to be the case in each community.  Why are we in a perennial crisis?  Why do the witnesses think the issue has never been resolved?  Why are post offices always left behind and the representatives have to continue to turn up at the committee year in, year out with the same asks?</p></speech>

It needs a centralised Government decision, either at the level of the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste.  It needs to be a Government decision rather than an individual departmental decision.  We do provide services across a range of Departments.</p></speech>

We also deal with TV licences and Garda fines.  The Department of Social Protection is the biggest one.  That is four Departments.  We understand that the Government's agenda or even the people's agenda is digital, and we think that the officials who plan are just planning in digital mode: they are not looking at the transformation or the number of people who continue to use and need to use offline solutions.  That is part of it.  The issue is the lack of a champion, rather than any ill will towards the post office network.  As Mr. Martin said, every Deputy and official we meet support the post office network, but somebody needs to grasp the nettle, make the decision and do something.</p> <p>  Postmasters are exasperated.  We do not want to be seen coming with our hand out.  We offer the services that we can provide.  We say we can provide more services.  People say they want to use us.  They say An Post is the most trusted brand in Ireland.  We say that the postmasters, who are the people who provide the service, are the people who provide that trust.  It is not an organisational thing.  It is about the experience when people come into post offices.  I cannot fathom why it has not been done up to now.  It seems to me at one level that it is just a case of making a decision.  If people are concerned that investing in the post office network would become a black hole, we have said on numerous occasions that we are agreeable to have any plan reviewed over the normal business planning cycle of three to five years.  We recognise that the world is changing.  We are around for 100 years.  We are not providing the services now that we were providing 100 years ago, but we are still providing services and we are still used each week by 1.3 million people.  I do not know why somebody does not just do it.  Perhaps it needs to be a Government decision.  We hope that is what is going to happen.</p></speech>

I represent a constituency in Dublin that is part urban and part rural.  I acknowledge that members of the IPU visited me in my clinics, who were fantastically articulate and passionate about the job they do and the service they provide.  The threat that they will not be able to do it for much longer is very real.  We are talking about postmasters and postmistresses who are in towns that have already lost Garda stations and local banks and it is really only post offices that are left providing services in terms of facilities with a trusted harp above the door.  I believe we will endorse what Senator Dooley said, as a committee, but rather than just sending it up the chain, so to speak, how do we go beyond that and try to grasp the situation in a way that is different?</p></speech>

Probably the most relevant question that has been asked over the past number of years is why are we still in the same position we have been in considering how important the post office network is to the economy.  We hand out &euro;6.7 billion into local economies.  Jim Power put a multiplier of two on it.  That is hard cash that sustains businesses locally; it creates jobs locally.  In the context of the climate and a green agenda, we keep services local.  There are fewer carbon emissions and there is a smaller carbon footprint.</p> <p>  We provide access to postal services and financial services for the most vulnerable in society, for the marginalised, for the less well off and for the people who are living hand to mouth.  That is a considerable service we give to the Government, and we probably give that free.</p> <p>  Many of our postmasters feel frustrated and annoyed that the Government still has not made a decision as to whether we are valuable enough to invest a small amount of money in.  We are not looking for money for nothing.  There are extra services we can provide.  We named them, not this year, not last year but over the past number of years.  We have said we can do form identification for social welfare, for passport express, for the electoral register.  We also said we can do form generation.   This, we believe, can save the taxpayer millions of euro because we can do it on an only-when-required basis.</p></speech>

I engaged with them last evening at the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.  I want to state publicly my support for the IPU in its campaign to achieve the ultimate aims that are set out in the Grant Thornton report.  The Government needs to step up to the plate and provide the &euro;12 million that is required.  I certainly believe that we need to get a decision on this urgently and that we need a positive decision from the Minister of State.</p> <p>  Many of the questions I intended to pose have already been asked.  They would have been in terms of the type of engagement the union has had with Government.  Mr. O'Hara confirmed that the last meeting with the Minister of State was before Christmas.  Has Mr. O'Hara sought a meeting since then with the Minister of State to get an update?  The committee will be meeting with the Minister of State next week.  I am engaging with her on a one-to-one basis and have written to the her.  I met members of the IPU in my office in Ennis.  They put across a robust case.</p> <p>  The post office is at the heart of every community.  It is an integral part of community life.  It would be a retrograde step if we were to dismantle that critical service in our communities.  Twelve million euro is really a small sum to pay to sustain all those post offices.</p> <p>  I strongly endorse the union's stance.  I ask the Chairman that the committee do so as well, and make it clear to the Government that we want a positive result on this and we need it urgently.</p></speech>

We bring, as I said, the &euro;6.7 billion in relation to the economy, we bring - Grant Thornton put this figure on it, not us - in excess of &euro;344 million in the context of social dividend and social cohesion, and we bring the green agenda in respect of keeping carbon emissions down by keeping services local.</p> <p>  There is an amount of extra that we said we could do.

I think that is the reason we lost.</p> <p>  We are not looking for sole exclusivity of any product or service.  What we are saying is that we should be an omnichannel.  We should be an offline solution for the Government to enable it to deliver any sort of a service.  I was at the public forum on banking the other day.  Someone made a major contribution in stating that if one can make it easy for the elderly, one makes it easy for everyone.  That is a hugely important point.  By making it easy through the post office which we do, the last thing one wants to do now is to take that service away from the community and to be left with sleeper towns.</p><p>That is what we will face if the Government does not make this decision over the next couple of months.</p></speech>

When people who cannot fill out a passport application form go to the post office in the North and in the UK for assistance in filling out the form, they are charged a fee.  In Ireland it is digital only, so the assistance is provided via a tutorial on the website.  That is a service we could provide.  It could be a supplementary service.  The point Mr. McEntee is making is that we provide assistance to people to fill out forms that they cannot do themselves.  We do that on paper.</p></speech>

That is what I think needs to happen.  Until that point, I would have concerns about this issue.  I had concerns coming here because we are all on the same page on this issue but we have not seen movement on it.  To me, that sets off alarm bells.  I am concerned that there is an unspoken plan in place whereby 900 post offices are considered not viable and we are going in the direction where a figure in the region of 500 will face closure.  I firmly believe that is the wrong track.</p> <p>  Senator Dooley and others have spoken about the impact of an anchor institution with a State presence.  The figure of &euro;344 million was raised.  I do not know what kind of calculation goes into that.  This committee went to Shannon Airport on Monday.  I drove back up through Clonalvy, County Meath, a small place of which most people will not have heard.  It was one of the places that lost its post office in 2018.  On Monday night, we were talking about how to save the school there.  That is the type of thing that happens in rural areas.  We lost other post offices and we do not want to lose any more.  </p> <p>  One of the points I want to raise is that there is a perception that it is the small, rural post offices that are under threat.  That is not my sense of the situation.  I represent a number of what would be considered larger urban areas.  Can I get the Irish Postmasters Union&rsquo;s perspective on that? </p></speech>

Again, I thank him for his support.  We have met him before.  He has supported us, and he speaks in favour of us.  The issue we have in relation to post offices is that there is a commonly held view that the small, rural post offices that are under threat.  The answer that has been given to me before has been interpreted as a case of unrestrained closures.  We do not where they will take place and we do not know how many of them there will be.  We expect that the urban post offices, particularly given the recent increases in costs, will likely be most under threat.  That is the fear.  If the big post offices close, then the model will become unsustainable.  We are not differentiating between large, medium or small post offices.  All we are saying is that every post office is on the economic margin its own right.</p> <p>  Mr. McEntee made this point a few minutes ago.  Every post office is different.  They are the same, but different.  They are all on the economic margin for different reasons.  There could be a selection across any town or any village in Ireland.  It also includes the cities.  Large post offices in Dublin could be at risk.</p></speech>

They ask what would happen if they retire.  I pass them on to An Post.  Because of GDPR, An Post then deals with them directly.

Separate to that, there is the argument, which I think is a very clear one, that there are more services that post offices should be providing.  There is also the interdepartmental issue.  How do the two issues relate?  Is it the case that post offices need to provide additional services for the &euro;12 million?  Could the figure of &euro;12 million be based on existing transactions or on the services that are already provided?  Do they need additional services to be diverted to post offices?</p></speech>

It identified the commercial revenue as &euro;52 million.  The gap was &euro;17 million.  We feel that there are services there.  We do not want money for nothing.  We feel that we currently provide services and we do them unpaid.  We feel that there are more services, as Mr. Martin has pointed out, that are available.  We therefore feel that the Government should make an investment and that it should allow us to provide the services that people want, and that people say they want, rather than just supporting the post office and giving it a PSO for nothing in return.  We feel we have something to provide in return.  We want to provide the services.  The people for whom we provide services want our services.</p> <p>  On the issue of the contract fee, rather than the Government giving money for nothing, they should give money and we will provide services in return.  We provide many services at the moment for which we are not paid.  There is the service of giving advice - Mr. McEntee has just given an example of people coming into the post office to look for help with filling forms.  Many people find it difficult to fill forms.  Mr. Martin made a point in relation to form generation.  We could help people to complete forms, either physically on a piece of paper or online if it makes life more simple.  These are services that people want.  I would like help filling out some forms that I get from the Government.  They are very complicated.</p></speech>

The extra services that we provide to our community are probably unrecognised and unrecompensed.  We just do not get paid for them.  Mr. McEntee named one of them.  The Department of Social Protection gives people forms and we do a lot to help people to fill out those forms.  We do a lot in relation to bereavement.  When somebody loses a family member, we are the people who pick up much of the slack in that area.  We do much work in giving out tourist information and we do not get paid for that.  We do a lot of caring for our community.  If M&iacute;che&aacute;l, Leo, &Eacute;amon or Hilda do not turn up on a particular day at a particular time, we make sure someone contacts them or someone calls them.  We do an awful lot of work that people do not see us doing.  However, we are happy to do it.  What we are saying to the Government is that we are looking for an overall solution here.  We can deliver more services, but we need that &euro;12 million in order to be able to stay viable and sustainable.</p></speech>

In particular, I compliment Mr. Martin, because he has rallied the postmasters to contact each and every Deputy.  They came to all of our offices, sat down and laid out their cases.  They actually looked to take a photograph afterwards.  Normally it is the job of the politician to make sure that the photograph is taken, but the postmasters did that.  We all support this.  There is no doubt about that and that can be heard here.  In the conversations that I had with those postmasters, they outlined the point that Mr. O&rsquo;Hara also raised about the social value that they bring.  I note that the report puts that social value at &euro;344 million.  That is sometimes hard to quantify.  It is sometimes hard to put a finger on what the social value is.</p> <p>  I raise a question in the context of the figure of &euro;12 million.  The figure had been &euro;17 million, and it went to &euro;12 million.</p><p>Is that figure of &euro;12 million based on services that post offices have now started providing or is it based on all the other services they could provide, which would mean the Government support would be reduced by that figure of &euro;5 million?</p></speech>

For instance, there are new Bank of Ireland services.  An Post won a Bank of Ireland contract to provide agency banking for Bank of Ireland, so that is some of it.  In addition, new customs services arrived because of Brexit.  There are new services we provide that nobody would have forecast three or four years ago.  Much shopping is now done online.  If a person imports a parcel from England, for example, there is duty involved, so the customer goes to a post office and pays the duty that is due.  Customers are expected to complete a customs declaration when posting a parcel.  The postmaster helps with that and there is a fee included in that.  In the past 18 months or two years, we have generated additional revenue that has helped to reduce the deficit that Grant Thornton originally quantified.</p></speech>

The figure we are looking at now is &euro;12 million, and I think that is entirely good value to protect the post office network, all it is doing and all it potentially can do.  To look at it from the viewpoint of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, however, one needs to consider whether there is more that could be done, more productivity achieved and more services provided to bring this figure down.  I presume the figure we are considering is a multi-annual one.  Let us say the figure is to be &euro;12 million.  The IPU needs to know that will be there for the next three to five years.</p></speech>

It seems to me that in the context of a closed digital system, once you are in, you are in.  The gateway to access to those systems can be guarded by postmasters.  If a person wishes to access a system, he or she would have to present proof of identity to a postmaster.  It may be that postmasters need to be made peace commissioners to do this.  The postmaster would be the verifier of identity for people entering closed digital networks or, for instance, entering their name on the electoral register.  All present know the electoral register is not currently accurate.  I have been living in Dublin for almost 30 years and I have been visited only once to see how many people live in my house.  If I was required to attend the post office with photographic ID, such as a passport, to get onto the electoral register, we would have a better electoral register.  We have identified several services we can provide for the contract fee.  That is one of those services.  Mr. Martin referred to form generation.  The green agenda is something we can do.  We can provide services locally.  We already provide a certain amount of services of which people are not aware locally.  We can justify the &euro;12 million in the context of value for money for the Government.  As I stated, we do not want money for nothing.  We can provide services and have identified them.  There is an interdepartmental group examining the number of offline services that can be provided.  The findings of that report have not yet been produced.  We can do all of those things.</p></speech>

They were only produced 18 months ago.  We got an update.  I am not sure another Grant Thornton report is needed at this stage.  There is enough information available.

We firmly believe that.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Hara stated that we can do something relating to the green agenda, and I hope the committee would endorse that.  It relates to being a conduit for retrofitting nationally.  We are a trusted organisation.  If a person asks us to send a trusted person to look at his or her house to see what he or she can do in respect of retrofitting it and upgrading the insulation, we can do that.  We believe we are well placed to do it.  We could then set in motion the person to actually deliver that service.  It is difficult to put a price on that, however, because of the amount of time and effort that may be involved.  That is why we are kind of saying it needs to be a whole-of-government approach.  It cannot be a case of an individual Department giving us &euro;1 million from its budget because it thinks we can offer a particular service.  The Government as a whole has to say that this is value for money and an important national asset that we have to ensure survives not for the next three, four or five years, but for the next 100 years.  We have been there for the past 100 years and I think we have something to offer for the next 100 years.</p></speech>

There was evidence that transformation was working before the pandemic.  The pandemic impacted our efforts to transform ourselves.  We made an agreement with An Post that it would support us for another 18 months because of the pandemic.  Our transformation agreement, if one likes, was extended by 18 months to allow us to transform ourselves from being service providers to being agile retailers, if members will pardon the clich&eacute;s.  That runs out at the end of the year, so we will be on our own two feet.</p></speech>

I was following the proceedings from my office and I have read the written statement they provided.  I will get to the finances in a moment because that is why they are here.  It is what will save the network.</p> <p>  First, I wish to touch on the human aspects of this matter.  I have homed in on two things Mr. O'Hara's opening statement.  He stated that postmasters are "independent small and medium enterprises contracted by An Post to run post offices".  They are not State employees and they are not paid a fixed salary.  He later stated: "We receive calls daily from burnt-out postmasters in all areas of the country who are seriously considering their immediate future."  In recent months, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has heard of soldiers who have had to sleep in cars and of nurses who could not pay their mortgage.  Are some postmasters - pillars of the community who provide a vital service in rural Ireland - impoverished by the current model of payment they receive?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1579" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ned O'Hara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022051800002#G00100"><p>I am not sure I can answer that question.  As I said, every post office is different.  It is my experience in dealing with them on a daily basis that they are all on the economic margin.  Are any of them sleeping in cars?  I do not think so.  They run businesses and why would they stay in business if it is not sustainable?  I do not understand the question.  They are under pressure economically but they are not sleeping in cars, if that is the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022051800002#G00200"><p>No, I referenced that as an example.  We have heard from other groups and people come before the Houses of the Oireachtas and they explain how they are pressurised.  I used the example of our armed forces and members of the Defence Forces sleeping in cars, which they referenced.  In this very room just a few months ago we had representatives of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, telling us their members - front-line nurses - were under savage financial pressure and some were unable to afford their mortgages and had gone into arrears.  I was asking about postmasters, given they are not on a salaried system but deal with transactional payments.  In certain rural post offices, transactions may be slim enough and footfall might be pretty low, so are some of them struggling to a point where they are pretty much impoverished?</p> <p>  In my rural county, one or two postmasters have told me they stay open because of family tradition.  It is quite similar to the case of the rural pub and it is not that they are making any great wage packet or income out of it.  There is, instead, a cultural obligation to the community and surroundings to stay open.  Does Mr. O'Hara feel some of those which he represents are in that category of being on the bread line?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1582" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022051800002#G00400"><p>I can answer that and they are.  The difficulty they have has been expressed by the Deputy.  Over the next couple of weeks they need to make the decision of whether they will let down their community or incur debt.  It is the big decision they must make.  It is now becoming unviable for many post offices.  We probably have 200 post offices throughout the country and when we strip costs from them, the people in them are working for less than the minimum wage.  The Deputy is right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1583" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022051800002#G00500"><p>It is the very point I am trying to get to.  We are supportive of the delegation's position, which Mr. O'Hara explained really well in his opening statement.  We are supportive of this financial model and it must be actioned.  The postmasters need certainty on this in the next two to three weeks.  We are fast approaching June and the uncertainty that brings for all of the witnesses' colleagues throughout the country.  It concerns me.</p> <p>  The delegation is representing a national organisation but I know of individual cases where I am concerned for people's welfare because the post office struggles.  It must offer more services and income streams and in its current form, it does not.</p> <p>  There is the idea of somebody retiring and resigning a contracted position with An Post.  Some of the contractors are under huge pressure because the current rationalisation model in a county like Clare means there should be a post office at every 15 km of map radius.  It is worked out from the GPO and circles are drawn on maps around each post office.  Some of the circles overlap and some do not.  There is much pressure if a postmaster or postmistress decides he or she has had enough and wants to pack it in and go for an easier life.  There is much pressure on the retirement, whether it is on age or health grounds or because of financial pressure or family reasons.  When they retire, the rationalisation process kicks in and the post office closes.  Very often, that contract is not awarded to somebody else and it becomes a survival game.</p> <p>  When Broadford post office in Clare closed, there was an unintentional and inadvertent consequence of making Kilkishen post office over the road stronger because of the ludicrous rationalisation rule.  Has the postmasters' union a position on the 15 km rule?  It should not be operating and it is shutting post offices that should be viable and remain open.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1584" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ned O'Hara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022051800002#G00600"><p>We have no view on that.  It is a policy decision for either the Government, the Department or An Post.  The protocol was brought in by An Post in 2018 and before that there was no protocol.  Before that, post offices closed as postmasters retired whether or not the service was required.  At least now there is some structure in that regard.  The current protocol is that there should be a post office for every population centre of 500 people or one for every 3 km radius in an urban area or 15 km in a rural area.  The union has no view on that protocol.  We recognise that there cannot be a post office for everyone in the audience.  Is 500 a good number?  I have no view on that.  There is a census this year and it may lead to a review of the protocol.  I presume that number will go up.</p> <p>  We know there are 750 post offices and if their postmaster retires, they will stay open.  There are approximately 130 or 150 other post offices and if their postmaster retires, it would not be advertised.  We are not involved with that protocol.  We have no view on the size, for example.  We see it as either Government or An Post policy.  We welcome the structure it gives because before it the process was totally unstructured.</p></speech>

The union may not have a position currently and feel it is beyond its realm but in County Clare that 15 km rule can be damning.  Deputy Matthews is beside me and if he and I were postmasters and I decided to retire, it would make his position stronger.  In my local village the service for that 15 km radius would be gone.  It does not work and it is slowly shutting things.  Postmasters are then working until their late 70s or early 80s because they feel the minute they turn the key in the door and walk out, the service will be gone, not just in their village but in the 15 km radius around it.  It is doing major damage in rural areas.  I would love an analysis of that in due course.</p></speech>

If the post offices of Deputies Crowe and Matthews, to use the Deputy's example, were within the protocol, the service would not be closed.  Both would be advertised.</p></speech>

On the Grant Thornton report, the postmasters' union engaged on that a few times over the years.  The most up-to-date report recommending Government intervention dates to September 2020.  Given Covid-19 and everything that has happened in between, is that report current or is it slightly outdated?</p></speech>

Inflation has kicked in since.  We got an updated report in April and it has identified the gap from our perspective as being &euro;12 million.  The costs may have gone up from &euro;70 million but we have got no pay increase.  The cost of providing the network remains at &euro;70 million.  The revenue was &euro;53 million.  We get additional revenue from Bank of Ireland and the customs service, arising from Brexit, as well as one or two other things.  The gap has been closed by &euro;5 million but the network now needs a minimum of &euro;12 million.</p></speech>

I do not know how many postmasters would do that and I do not know where those postmasters would be.  In his opening remarks, the Deputy referred to the economics of each individual post office and each post office is an individual business.  It is down to those postmasters on the economic margin.  Those who do not see an economic future for themselves will tender their resignation.  It is an unrestricted number.  Could it be 100 or 200 postmasters?  It would be in that order.

The Deputy spoke about post offices struggling.  Some post offices have three staff and the postmaster may be getting less than a staff member.  It is a big problem and that will happen.  I have a small post office and survive because I run it by myself with my wife in a rural area.  Some offices have three staff and there is no backup.  A neighbour of mine closed the post office and gave it up, leaving somebody else to take it up.  That happened because she had no wages for herself after she paid staff.</p></speech>

If I go to a post office, it is for a parcel, stamps or whatever.  There needs to be a greater range of services available there.  People have turned away from getting their passports through the post office because that process takes too long.  Last July, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, committed to unveiling a suite of offline services that people could avail of at their post offices.  To save the sector, we need to see those now in tandem with the financial package.</p></speech>

I also thank them for their leaflets.  I receive their IPU updates every two months or whenever the case may be, and those are informative and helpful.</p> <p>  In his statement, Mr. O'Hara outlined that An Post, of which post offices are the customer-facing part, was one of the most trusted brands in the country.  It is probably more trusted than any bank or other financial institution.  There is a great deal that is positive about it.  Equally, though, I just asked a couple of people in their 20s upstairs about when they were last in their post offices.  One could not remember and another said it was last Christmas to buy stamps for Christmas cards.  What is the age profile of the people who come in the door every day and every week and where is that going?  I get the impression that it is mostly older people.  My mother uses the post office regularly and thinks it is a fantastic service to have.</p> <p>  I could probably name seven or eight post offices within two miles of me in my area of Dublin, but two have closed.  One had a bakery in the shop as well and probably achieved higher margins by making that part of the shop bigger and getting rid of the post office.  The post office is much more essential in less densely populated areas because the next one is so much farther away.</p> <p>  I was listening to the earlier contributions from my office.  The witnesses are asking for &euro;12 million on the one hand and, on the other, saying that they do not want money for nothing and that they are looking for other services.  What other services can we deliver?  I do not understand why An Post's tender for the driver licence service included 300 facilities if the tender process was only seeking 30.  I do not know why it did not compete on what the tender process was seeking.  Nor do I know why we need to set up a driver licence system when the post office could have provided the service across the country.</p> <p>  What is the future of the business in terms of transactions?  I worry about broadband, in that, as broadband becomes available across more of the country, more services will go online and people may use post offices less.  Where is the area of expansion and what can we do, as a Government and as a committee lobbying the Government, to give post offices more services that they do not currently have?  The customer profile is changing, as is the business profile.  Since the pandemic, I presume that the number of cash transactions in post offices is down.  What else can we give the post offices to improve the viability of their business and allow them to generate that &euro;12 million through services as opposed to just giving each office a lump of cash?</p></speech>

We understand the strain they are under.  None of us is familiar with the situation unless we know a postmaster or postmistress.  The funding model is per transaction.  Presumably, some post offices in urban areas are doing well because they have many transactions.  I do not know the range.  When the Vintners' Federation of Ireland appeared before the finance committee three or four years ago, it stated that half of its members had a turnover of less than &euro;200,000 per year.  Do the witnesses have that breakdown as regards their members?  Do 20% of them have turnovers of less than &euro;10,000 or &euro;30,000 per year and a couple are making more than &euro;500,000 per year?  Do we have those figures?</p></speech>

For the vast majority, the amount is less than &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000.</p> <p>  Regarding services, it depends on how one views the network.  Someone could say that there will be no post offices in ten or 15 years&rsquo; time, but we are looking at the next three to five years.  There will be a post office and services provided for the next three to five years.  The agreement we reached with An Post in 2018 saw us transforming from being service providers into agile retailers, if the committee will pardon the clich&eacute;s.  We depend on An Post to provide the services to us, and I had to ask about some of them myself, for example, the Gift Voucher Shop, One4All service and chip and PIN gaming.  I do not understand what they are, but they are for young people.  We also handle mobile top-ups.  An Post is working hard to develop new products and services aimed at all sections.  It looks at the age profile of customers and realises that it has to get younger customers-----</p></speech>

We call it banking for everyone, which is being able to do AIB and Bank of Ireland business.  We are still doing Ulster Bank business even though they are pulling out of the country.  This is of great importance for us from the point of view of access to a branch, to a person or to cash.  I attended a public forum on banking during the week and cash, we are told, is not going out of the system.  Approximately 20% to 25% of people are still using cash exclusively and are not using a card and there is also a mixture of both usages.  Cash is of great importance for communities because it is the cash that we hand out locally that sustains the local communities.  It is of great importance, therefore, that we continue our use of cash.  Agency banking can certainly be an opportunity for us where banks are pulling out of rural Ireland and out of the country.

It is a challenge for us to try to get new people and younger people into the business but we are working hard at it and agency banking is bringing in that younger generation.  One of the issues that came out of the banking forum in the Behaviour and Attitudes survey that it conducted was that it asked consumers what they wanted out of their bank, not their post office.  They said that they wanted value, access, trust and security and we can deliver all of those four requirements and are well placed to fill the gap that some of the banks-----</p></speech>

The issue in banking and serious loans is a capital issue.  For instance, 40,000 or 45,000 mortgages were issued in the country last year.  If one mortgage was done by each post office per month, approximately &euro;2.7 billion would be needed; that is 12,000 mortgages a year.

I am not going to repeat what has been said.  We all accept the fabulous work that is done and the complete necessity of the post office network, whether that is in urban settings - what the union is saying about post offices in urban settings being in danger of closing is frightening - but it is an absolute necessity and is a major part of rural infrastructure.</p> <p>  We are talking about the necessity of the &euro;12 million, in a perfect world, for the services that the post office is offering at this point in time.  On the issue of any other services, such as the wider banking services referred to, or if the post offices are offered State services, is that money on top of that &euro;12 million, which would make the system more sustainable?  I know that the union will not engage in a negotiation here, and certainly not with this speaker.</p></speech>

I will put another solution to the committee, which is around banking.  We all understand the importance of banking in a functioning society.  We are saying now that we have the biggest branch network out there with 900 post offices.  We have that access of being available in every community.</p></speech>

The State receives a banking levy at the moment in the region of &euro;90 million.  The banks are pulling out of rural Ireland and some are pulling out of the country.  Let us say to the banks that we use a portion of that money so that people can access everyday banking in our communities throughout Ireland for the next three, five, six or ten years, and we are only looking at &euro;12 million of that levy.  The Government is not now paying anything towards the survival of the post office network but the banks are paying it to ensure that communities still have banking.</p></speech>

While I might not like to let banks off the hook, the fact is that we are dealing with the reality that they have left and are leaving a significant number of even sizeable rural towns.</p><p>The post office, as Mr. Martin said, is trusted, is there and has the capacity, so it makes complete sense.  It may be a solution at both ends, for want of a better phrase, and something we probably need to do a piece of work on.  I thank him for that.  We had heard constantly everything was going to come from this interdepartmental review process.  Is that now imminent?</p></speech>

Everything I wanted to say has been said.  The important point is we listen to the contributions today, recognising the four pillars of a post office network in the context of reliability, reach, resilience and relevance should be at the forefront of everything we do.</p> <p>  Mr. Tom O&rsquo;Callaghan from Limerick, whom the Chairman knows, of the Independent Postmasters Group made an important point to us, stating: "There must be a focus on new products, capital investment and government services for the network".  I support the post office network.  We all live in challenging times.  A modern approach is needed, as Mr. O'Hara has said and I look forward to meeting the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  I have a question on the &euro;12 million.  It is a per annum figure.  Is it the minimum or the maximum?  Is it just about enough?</p></speech>

The gentlemen are very welcome.  As a leader of a trade union in a former life, I only wish I had the commitment the IPU officers have.  Their work on behalf of the members is second to none.</p> <p>  The more questions we have heard this afternoon the more depressed I have become.  I am almost about to go over to our guests and tell them to do themselves a favour by shutting down, going home and forgetting about it because it is just not going to work.  I look at the services post offices provide.  Mr. O'Hara made the point there about the community services post offices provide.  I have been lost in rural Ireland and called into the local post office to get directions.  Whoever gave me those directions gave me their time and got nothing for it in return.  I certainly did not put my hand in my pocket and ask how much per hour I should pay for that.  There is tourist information and everything else that was mentioned.  There is the bereaved family.  The first place they can go is the postmaster who will sit down with a widow or widower after a funeral and help them through the complexities of dealing with Government.  Has the IPU at any stage quantified the effort in time post offices devote to those type of activities in order that it could be valued?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-18a.1706" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ned O'Hara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022051800002#K02100"><p>No, we have never done time and motion on it.  We have not because it just gets too complex.  It is about the size of the network.  People need to understand the scale of the network as well.  When we are talking about solutions, we used to talk about if we had the CAO forms, of which there are approximately 70,000 each year, and if we got half of them.  It would not even be one transaction per week for the year for 1,000 post offices.  It is about the scale of this.  We know we provide the service.  We have not tried to quantify it because we try to keep on a level about that.  We are trying to get a macro solution rather than go into the nitty-gritty of each individual service we provide.</p> <p>  It is provided willingly, as Mr. Martin said earlier.  It is not that we do not want to do it.  We provide the service willingly.  Most postmasters will say they like their job.  I do not get depressed when I think about it because most postmasters, when I deal with them, are positive people who provide a service and they look forward.  They assume the thing is going to get fixed up.  They assume somebody in government will have enough sense to say this service is important and we do not need to lose it but there is danger it will be lost through inaction.  I said to the Chairman earlier that what we want is a decision.  We do not want a "Maybe" decision.  We want either a "Yes" or a "No" decision.  It is not a forever decision.  It is something that needs to be reviewed.  The world is changing.  We are celebrating our 100th conference in two weeks.  We are providing completely different service now than we did 100 years ago.  Will we be around in 100 years?  None of us will be around to know but we will be around for the next five to ten years.  I expect there will be post offices.  We just need to plan for them and have somebody make a decision and say this is a service and it is worthwhile.</p></speech>

We talk about social value.  I ended up going to a funeral of one of our social welfare recipients recently.  The daughter of the person who died came to me and said her mother would have been delighted I had come because I was the only person she had seen outside her family for the past year.  That is the sort of service we give that is not recompensed or not recognised.  We are valuable and we are just hoping the Government sees that and works on it and actions it.</p></speech>

If we are going to give post offices &euro;12 million we want to see what we are going to get back out of it.  However, some things in life simply are not quantifiable.  Mr. O'Hara put his finger on it when he said the IPU never assessed this and there is no way, really, to assess it.  Mr. Martin made the point of attending the funeral of somebody whose only point of contact with the outside world was him.  I am sure Mr. McEntee and his wife have a key position within the community where people can trust that if they go down to the McEntees with a problem they do not know how to resolve, he will have an answer for it.  He might spend three quarters of an hour with them trying to assist them in working their way through the system.  There is no way to quantify that service to the public.  In a way it is a sort of social service and all sorts of other things.  Sometimes we must be willing to put capital into those things that keep communities together.</p><p>We are losing banks and petrol pumps in local villages.  We are losing everything in the drive for profit.  Some things cannot be based on profit and must be recognised as a public service.  In keeping communities in rural Ireland together I believe, as I have always believed, the post office is the central key point for all of them.</p><p> I do not know how this works, but if I want to get an An Post credit card or one of its other services such as a current account or whatever, I assume I can process my form through one of the witnesses' post offices.  Do they get anything after my form is submitted?  I am sure they get a payment for the form but what happens after that?</p></speech>

I appreciate what Grant Thornton did and the macro view from a purely commercial point of view, but there is a side to the post office that is not commercial and cannot be quantified.  I do not know how we can square that circle, and there is no answer the witnesses can give me today.  I have listened to their answers and everything else.  Mr. O'Hara has been very clear there things that cannot be quantified, yet Mrs. Murphy knows that next Thursday she can go to the local post office and, when she walks in there, she will get the same welcome as she has always got, and if she has something she needs to be sorted out, the staff will always find a quiet corner in which they can talk to her and solve the problem.  That situation is worth a damn sight more than &euro;12 million to the economy as far as I am concerned.</p> <p>  I will not waste the time of these men by asking questions that have already been asked.  I appreciate their time and envy the commitment from their members.  It is tremendous.  They are some guys because they rarely ever leave a month go by without making some contact.  Well done and congratulations.</p></speech>

The post office is for young people.  People would want to get it into their heads that not everyone has a car.  If the husband is out working during the week, the wife and children can come from school and go into the post office, get the children's allowance or even take money out to do the shopping.  Around where I live, it is all young people and people in their 30s who have families who are using the post office.  We do not have many old age pensioners now and a lot of young people use post offices now.  As Mr. O'Hara has said, young people use the post office far more for banking because they need money for the school, football and others things, so they are in and out of the post office as well as using it for parcels and sending different things.  There is a young generation who use post offices now.</p></speech>

I think it was stamps at the time, if I am not mistaken.  We used to buy penny stamps or something and we would save up a fiver for Christmas or whatever.  Do children use the saving services of the post office or do they all use the bank?</p></speech>

This morning I had to ring Mr. Martin as a lady had contacted me to learn what to do with an account as she had put away money for her daughter but now her daughter had reached 21 years and the account has matured.  So there are a lot of people using this service.  All of our members are self-employed so we promote post office services to people all of the time.  Many people open a POS book as a means to save money for their children's college or secondary school fees.  There is a young generation and if we get the chance, we will market post office services.  We are self-employed so we must sell services.  If we want to get people into post offices, we will go out and sell it.</p></speech>

The post office savings bank book is a manual book, so it is not electronic, there are no charges and we take cash, cheques and coins for free from everyone.  The number of people who use that service on an ongoing basis is growing because they have access.  Plus, it is harder to get money out of it because it is now a savings product.  If I am out having a few jars, I cannot go to the ATM and take out &euro;20 that I was saving for a holiday or Christmas.  It is harder to do it.  More and more people are beginning to realise that and, thankfully, that is a huge help.  I thank the Senator for bringing the matter to our attention.</p></speech>

I am a Deputy in Limerick city and I cover the area of north County Tipperary.  I am also an accountant by training and I have looked at this on a practical level.  I am aware this is causing difficulties for urban, rural and city areas regardless of their size.</p> <p>  A critical dates is 30 June because that is the date by which postmasters must decide and must give six months' notice, while the pandemic supports from An Post will last until the end of December.  We will have the Minister before the committee on 1 June, which is two or three days prior to the annual conference, and we are looking for representatives of An Post to attend as well.  I know there have been difficulties getting new people to take up the contracts as people have retired or are retiring.  People setting up as a postmaster cannot do it in a hole in the wall, as it were, anymore.  They have to rent, and in many cases rent good premises.</p> <p>  A question we did not touch on today is how many people are employed in the post offices run by the members Mr. O'Hara represents.</p></speech>

On the question of dismantling it, we dismantled the railway network and now we are trying to restore it.

The problem for the Irish Postmasters Union is that if something is not put in place, it runs the risk that one in four postmasters will terminate their contracts.  In my experience, the bulk of those will not be taken up by new postmasters under the current arrangement.  Is that a fair comment?</p></speech>

Everyone accepts that the post office network must be maintained.  The question is one of finding the solution or conduit which enables the network to get to that point.

Mr. O'Hara will be aware that the negotiations here are about finding the fit in order that everyone can effectively say money is being given for activities.  We all know how great the post office network is and what services it provides.  I was an accountant in a past life.  When someone was setting up in business back then, I would want to see a post office, a school, a bank and a church.  Church numbers are down.  What is left?  The post office.  I would have had clients such as chemists who were looking to set up.  We wanted to see footfall.  Post offices gave a significant indication of footfall.  They were vital.  That goes without saying.</p> <p>  However, the clock is ticking.  The post office network is facing into what will happen in a short number of weeks.  My worry is that something is being missed in the services postmasters are providing for which they are entitled to be paid.  Mr. O'Hara made reference to the UK in terms of postmasters being paid.  I am not saying the Irish Postmasters Union has not done so, but I ask that it cast a cold eye to see whether services are being provided by An Post for which it is not being paid.  We know all about the community service that postmasters provide, but we are down to ensuring that &euro;12 million comes forward from the Government to ensure the post office network can survive in rural and urban areas.  What is being missed is that city post offices, in many cases, are under just as much pressure.  I ask those present to recap on the services.</p></speech>

We need to show that all postmasters are being paid on the same model and that rather than it being a lump sum, the service is basically based on transactions.  I know I am asking a lot but for me it is very simple.  We have to find a mechanism whereby post offices get the money and the State can show value for money.  That goes without saying.  The post office network's model has always been around transactions on items.  Can it find a way of getting the &euro;12 million to fit into that?</p></speech>

Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate if he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be reluctantly asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member partaking via MS Teams to confirm he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting.

I thank the Chairman and other members of the committee for the invitation to appear before them today.<br/><br/>I was born and grew up in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and attended the Christian Brothers school in Eblana Avenue.  I have lived all my life in Dublin and am very proud to have been given the opportunity to be the chairperson of Dublin Bus over the next five years.<br/><br/>I have served as chief executive in the financial industry and technology and disability services and, more recently, as interim chief executive officer for the Football Association of Ireland.  As a non-executive director over many years, I have served on national and international boards and was chairperson of audit and risk committees of large companies at both local and global levels.  I am a chartered insurer and have attended both Columbia and Wharton universities during my career. <br/><br/>I am currently chairperson of Diona, chairperson of the risk committee and independent director of LeasePlan Insurance, and chairperson of a general insurance business called Icare Capital Partners.<br/><br/><b></b>I am conscious, as chairperson designate, that I am a custodian of what is a strategic State asset and a Dublin institution.  As I assume this role, I would like to thank the outgoing chairperson, Mr. Ultan Courtney, who worked closely with the chief executive and board of directors over the past seven years to successfully position Dublin Bus as Ireland's leading transport provider.  Today, the company is Ireland's largest public transport provider, carrying 70 million customers in 2021, and we hope to get back to over 150 million customers travelling per year as our society recovers from the pandemic.<br/><br/>Dublin Bus is a vital part of our domestic economy, with over 3,600 people employed in good, secure jobs.  The stories of how companies are responding to these changeable and uncertain times are still emerging.  Our employees responded exceptionally well in difficult circumstances and their resilience is at the heart of everything we do in Dublin Bus.  I really look forward to meeting them in our depots across the city to thank them for their hard work and listen to their views and hopes for the future of the company. <br/><br/>At all times, our focus is on providing customers with safe, comfortable and efficient journeys, putting them at the centre of everything we do.  That is why we recently bolstered our operational excellence and network resilience by introducing two new 24-hour routes, which will provide all-day and all-night services to customers in west Dublin and north Kildare.</p><p>The company is also assisting the National Transport Authority, NTA, with the implementation of the BusConnects Dublin area network redesign.  The successful delivery of BusConnects is vital to the future aspiration of a sustainable Dublin city.  It is also critical to achieving the company's goal of being the State's delivery partner of choice.</p><p> Over the centuries public transport in Dublin has grown and evolved, and the periods when it has thrived the most are the times when it has embraced change.  With this in mind, we recently worked with Transport for Ireland, TFI, on the roll-out of a new 90-minute fare.  This is a significant enhancement to our customer offering.  The new 90-minute fare, when combined with fare reductions and, in particular, the 50% reduction for young adults, will incentivise the use of our services and help deliver on our ambitious modal shift targets.</p><p> Despite this progress, the gains made by Dublin Bus and public transport need to be further reinforced.  One of the key advantages of using a bus is its ability to quickly adapt and accommodate additional customer demand in a way that no other transport mode can.  As the economy began to recover from recession in 2014, Dublin Bus was able to quickly provide the additional services required to meet customer demand and deliver retail spend to the city centre.</p><p> The operating environment during the pandemic offered us a glimpse of what is possible for our city.  With the optimal operating environment, we can have fast, reliable and sustainable bus services to the city centre.  During the lockdowns, with fewer private modes of transport on the road, we saw sustainable public transport journey times reduced, bringing essential workers to their destinations more quickly.  We can have a city where priority lies with the sustainable public transport user and those using active travel.  We have seen that Dublin does not have to be a car-dominated, congested city.  Sadly, however, as normality has returned so too has congestion.</p><p> Another key issue is sustainable urban development.  New residential developments do not need enough car parking spaces to provide each household with the capacity to park multiple cars.  Residential development should encourage the use of the local public transport links, which should be invested in to ensure there is sufficient capacity and frequency to handle this increased demand.  It is 42 years since the introduction of bus lanes that transformed bus services across the capital.  Today, they need to be protected and improved.  When it comes to bus lane enhancement, we believe it would be appropriate to move away from time-specific bus lanes and towards 24-hour designation for all bus lanes on all days of the week.  If we do not take these steps, we will inevitably see congestion get worse, commute times get longer, and emissions rise in line with population growth.</p><p> Over many years we have seen the benefits of embracing technology in our lives and in business.  At its purest form, technology makes things easier to use and by design, better.  We have seen the benefits of technology in the transport industry over many years leading to greater accessibility of our buses with zero tailpipe emission buses on order, traffic light priority for public transport and timely information for customers.  We are now at a time where the technology and transport industries are significantly integrating.  If we can plan together and capture the benefits that technology and transport can offer, we can facilitate modal shift and achieve our climate change targets.</p><p> Short-term initiatives include the use of account-based ticketing, for example using a token to pay a fare.  The token can be a smartphone, smart watch, debit card or QR code.  In March, the Government agreed funding to progress under the next generation ticketing project of BusConnects.  Account-based ticketing can provide faster boarding times, allow for dynamic pricing to manage demand, provide a single payment system for the whole transport system, and can provide the cheapest fare given the journeys and modes taken, in real time.</p><p> Technology will also provide a platform for enhanced reliability and efficiency of service provision through greater use of data, analytics and artificial intelligence.  Historically, traditional companies have not been imaginative enough with their assets and the benefits technology can bring.  There is an opportunity for Dublin Bus to further build on its reputation through the early adoption of new technology to create and capture value for our customers and the State.  Examples include the use of predictive maintenance to increase reliability and real-time capacity deployment to meet customer needs as they arise.</p><p> Technology is also an enabler for the sustainable development of our city by assisting with increased movements by way of an integrated multi-modal transport system.  Many public transport users are also car users and there will always be a need for public and private modes.  We must ensure priority is given to high capacity transport modes but that it works in harmony.  We need to achieve modal shift in an appropriately managed fashion.  This will require a consensus on the introduction of demand-management principles in our city, which technology can facilitate.  The technology and innovations are there to deliver if consensus can be achieved.</p><p> I am pleased to report that when it comes to environmental sustainability, Dublin Bus is well on its way to achieving our long-term goal of zero emissions and being net carbon positive by 2050.  We have big ambitions, because we deeply understand our part in creating meaningful and positive change in our city&rsquo;s environment.</p><p> As chairperson designate, I want to see significant modal shift from private car to bus because I know it is vital to building a truly sustainable Dublin.  Every time one of our customers chooses the bus, rather than taking the same journey by car, they are reducing their own carbon footprint and making a positive contribution to the environment.  Every full Dublin Bus means a 92% reduction in carbon emissions for every kilometre travelled by our customers compared to the same journey taken by car.</p><p> As the largest public transport company in the State, we know it is our responsibility to embed sustainable practices in every aspect of our business, from the vehicles that carry our customers, to the energy and materials we use throughout the organisation.  This collective responsibility is why we, in conjunction with the NTA continue to expand our hybrid-electric fleet, which now stands at 213 vehicles.  The company is under no illusion of the enormity of the task ahead of us all in fighting climate change.  It will take hard work, dedication, and commitment to achieve.  We are doing this because it is the right thing to do for our company, our communities, our city and our future.</p><p> I know that Dublin Bus has a long-standing reputation for trust that is built on the solid foundations of strong leadership and good governance.  It is my firm belief that robust governance underpins a healthy culture and good corporate behaviour, and I know that trust and transparency will continue to define the company in the years ahead.  If appointed, during my tenure as chairperson Dublin Bus will continue to take a disciplined approach to strengthening our capabilities, including innovation and operational excellence, continued focus on inclusion for all, the digitisation of our company, and the advancement of technology for our customers' benefit.  Equally, as one of Ireland&rsquo;s largest businesses, we recognise that we have a responsibility and an opportunity to act on some of the most pressing social and environmental challenges in the world today.  With our unparalleled reach across the capital, in thousands of communities, we are acutely aware that we have a real opportunity to create change.  We will seize this opportunity.</p><p> Although we know that the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and other challenges will not be simple or straightforward, my greatest source of confidence that we will emerge even stronger and smarter is the strength, adaptability and dedication of the 3,600-strong Dublin Bus team.</p><p> I thank the committee members for taking the time to listen and I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

Although I am aware that he is not quite set up yet, I congratulate him on his pending appointment.</p> <p>  As I mentioned in my contribution to the previous witnesses, we have two trusted organisations in front of the committee today.  The previous session was with An Post, and now we have Dublin Bus.  I loved to see Mr. Owens focus in his opening statement on continuing building the trust the people of Dublin have for this wonderful company, in which we feel invested and feel ownership of.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a number of points.  Obviously, this is a period of change in Dublin Bus.  I am not sure if we will see him at this committee before he departs so I want to put on the record that Ray Coyne will be moving on as CEO after seven years of operating Dublin Bus.  He led on and brought forward climate and accessibility considerations, with great strides and great work, in his time at the company.  I am sure a lot of this will be built upon, and that Mr. Owens will be part of the team to build upon that in his role as chairman.</p> <p>  His background is in disability services.  I have been working with Dublin Bus on that in the past couple of years and a lot has been done in the standardisation of bus stops and level access.  I have, however, been dealing with a number of wheelchair users who have larger wheelchairs - some wheelchairs are bigger than those used previously - where manoeuvrability on and off a bus is very difficult.  In the context of wheelchair users and other people with limited mobility or other disabilities, and given Mr. Owens's experience and where he is coming from, what will be his area of focus for changes or improvements made?  That is my first question.  I might come in for a second.</p></speech>

He has done an excellent job over seven years and has been very impressive and helpful n my brief encounters with him so I echo the Deputy's point.</p> <p>  People with disabilities are close to my heart.  When I left the private sector, I went to work with Down Syndrome Ireland so I would have had considerable interest in that.  My PA, who had Down's syndrome, was concerned about the changes to buses as part of BusConnects so I get that.  I know 100% of our buses have wheelchair access.  I do not know the detail of what is in the plan.  I have not seen it yet because I have not had access to all the information.  I have significant interest in trying to make sure people with disabilities are catered for.  If I learned anything when I worked with people with Down's syndrome, it is that people with disabilities face significant disadvantages so I would like to see the issue at the top of our agenda.</p></speech>

If Mr. Owens could push that to make sure it is always a focus, it would be great.</p> <p>  I am a big fan of BusConnects but it must be rolled out if it is going to dramatically improve public transport in Dublin.  I am not making a political point but where I feel things fall down slightly is outside the M50.  I represent Dublin Fingal.  While there are some changes in BusConnects, it looks like north County Dublin will have a route and model very familiar to the one that has existed for decades.  Fingal has a slightly lopsided nature in that the DART does a lot of heavy lifting on the coast while Dublin Bus does a lot for the middle, from Swords down, but then has real competition in the form of private contractors.  That said, Dublin Bus still provides an unbelievable service and is always striving to improve.</p> <p>  Journeys are a lot longer in respect of those areas outside the M50.  As good as the buses are and as improved as they have become over the years, long journeys are never entirely comfortable on double-decker buses.  I would like to see a bit of focus because we could be waiting for a metro link for years.  There are people who are public operator-minded and want to use Dublin Bus - their State-owned service - but they are under intense competition from private contractors with their fancy coaches.  I would like to see some more innovation and extra effort to provide an increased service.  My family lives on the Ballymun Road corridor.  It does not matter what day of the week it is, they do not even have to check the bus timetable.  They just walk out and they know they will be waiting four or five minutes and a No. 4, 13, 11 or 155 bus will come along.  It does not matter.  That is the way it should work.  We do not quite have that outside the M50.</p> <p>  I wish Mr. Owens well.  Dublin Bus is a great and trusted company.  Be it during the pandemic where everyone's backs are to the wall and we need services that Dublin Bus or An Post provided or a concert at Slane, Dublin Bus is always there and I hope it will always be there in the future.  When we are looking at new forms of transport, public bicycle schemes and possibly public scooter schemes, we need to ensure that Dublin Bus always leads and that if we put stations anywhere, we will put them where bus services congregate or have critical mass.  I wish Mr. Owens well and thank him for all the work he will do in the future.</p></speech>

We are quite confident.  A significant consultation process was involved in BusConnects and a lot of thought has gone into it.  I believe it can be transformational.  For Dublin Bus, it is all about getting more people to use buses, increasing frequency, learning and reviewing as we go along and making sure we meet the increase in customer demand wherever that comes from.  It is a most exciting project.</p></speech>

Mr. Owens spoke about 24-7 bus lanes.  These can be tricky local issues for politicians but that is when people on our side of the table need to be strong and say we are going to back public transport in a real way.  We need to be strong when these tricky issues come up because they are not tricky.  We need 24-7 bus lanes, tailor-made cycle lanes and traffic lights dedicated purely to them.  This is how journey times are reduced and journeys become comfortable for people coming from the north end of Swords to where we are sitting today.</p></speech>

I will pick up on the point made by Deputy Smith about the staff in Dublin Bus.  I worked in the company a long time ago.  I started my apprenticeship with the CI&Eacute; Group so I spent a lot of time working in the garages.  I have seen real advancement in the service, the fleet, the technology and the reliability of the buses.  It is rare to see a bus broken down on the side of the road, whereas that was a familiar sight many years.  We must acknowledge the investment and the staff throughout the service, not just the drivers but also the back office and maintenance staff, and the vital service they provide us day in, day out.  There are only a few 24-hour routes.  I support the expansion of more 24-hour routes where they are feasible and deliverable.  I hear talk of the 155 route becoming a 24-hour route.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Owens to consider two issues during his time as chair.  One is the provision of a 24-hour bus service.  Many people would avail of such a service and it would be really helpful to have it.  The second issue is the safety of passengers.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland appeared before the committee to discuss its report entitled Travelling in a Woman's Shoes.  It is not just travelling on the bus and in-journey time.  It also concerns bus shelters.  The shelters can be well-lit and maintained but it also involves the surrounding area.  Will Mr. Owens discuss where passengers wait for or disembark from buses?  We heard stories of women getting off at a different stop from the one nearest to them because they felt it was safer to walk that particular journey as they just did not like that particular stop.  There is so much to discuss, including BusConnects and moving to an electric bus fleet, of which we are all supportive.  Passenger safety and the expansion to 24-hour services would be really beneficial to everybody involved.  I wish Mr. Owens the best of luck in his time as chair.</p></speech>

I have limited access because I have not been appointed but anybody to whom I have had access has really impressed me, much more so than I would have thought, to be honest.  I use the bus and find the service to be excellent.  I am lucky enough to be on a good route.  We have had one or two issues relating to safety.  It must be paramount in terms of what we do, both for customers and staff and we need to make sure we protect both.  They must be two key inputs in any strategy at which we are looking so they will be.</p></speech>

The placement of shelters is a planning issue.  The roads section in the local authority would be involved in that.  It is about making sure everybody is looking at this issue, not only in terms of sight lines and where the bus driver can pull in and pull away safely b<font color="#242424">ut looking at it fully from an aerial perspective and asking where are the safe walking routes to the bus stop and where can people feel comfortable walking.</font></p><p>We must use the landscaping and lighting in that general area to make it attractive for people to use the bus.</p></speech>

I also read it.  I did not hear the contributions others have made because we were voting in the Seanad.  I recognise some of the content of the speech because some it was the same as the speech Ray Coyne made two weeks ago.  It also referenced 24-hour bus lanes, the Covid pandemic and other things.  This meeting is as much about Mr. Owens as it is about Dublin Bus.  The fact he has taken the role as chairman-designate is why we are all here.  For my benefit and that of the people who may be looking in, he said in his statement he was honoured to be asked by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, to become the chairperson.  Perhaps Mr. Owens will take us through how that came about.  Was there a phone call from the Minister or what was the process?</p></speech>

The fewer cars we have in cities the better.  The evidence is pretty clear.  Even from a consumer point of view, there is less demand from people in cities.  Fewer people in cities want to buy cars.  The mobility, from a leasing perspective, is facilitating customers to lease cars for one or two days.  They only have cars when they need them in the city at weekends.  That has been the big shift in terms of what is going on.</p></speech>

I am not accusing him of plagiarism or anything but much of it was similar to what Mr. Coyne told the committee.  That information is probably coming from Dublin Bus.  There was reference to 24-hour bus lanes.</p><p>There is much overlap between what Mr. Ray Coyne said two weeks ago at this committee and what Mr. Owens said.  It makes sense that the chief executive and the chairman have similar thoughts about transport.  The point about daytime bus lanes is very valid.  The lanes running from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and for a few hours in the evening do not really work.  The 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. lanes are in places like the N11.  Having gone to the school on Eblana Avenue, I am sure Mr. Owens is more than familiar with the 46A, which is a successful corridor.  If one is asking the general public for 24-hour road space, one will have to offer them 24-hour bus services on that road space.  I do not see how any of us can tell constituents that they cannot use a bus lane at 1 a.m. when there are no buses on that bus lane.</p></speech>

Let us get 24-hour services and then have 24-hour bus lanes.  The 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. lane on the N11 has worked quite effectively.  Many people still do not drive in the bus lane after 7 p.m. anyway.  The dual carriageway goes the whole way through what would have been my council area, from Belfield to Cabinteely church.  People do not park in that bus lane and, by and large, they do not squat in it after 7 p.m.  It is not unfair to say that if there are to be 24-hour bus lanes, there need to be 24-hour services on those corridors.  What scope is there for 24-hour bus lanes?  We have a huge problem with taxis as the night-time economy picks up.  We will have more activity at night-time when licensing legislation changes.  What ambitions do Dublin Bus and Mr. Owens have relating to 24-hour services?</p></speech>

The Senator would be surprised if we did not.  The Senator's point is solid.  If we are looking for 24-hour bus lanes, we need to have a service to go with them.  That comes back to the NTA's overall strategy.  We consult it all the time.  Part of the strategy is to provide a 24-hour service.  We have already started that and it has been successful.  The challenge that there is no point in having 24-hour bus lanes if we do not have the service is valid.</p></speech>

For me, as incoming chairman, the most important appointment that I will make is of a CEO.  The top priority is to have a good new CEO, who can sustain the type of progress that Mr. Coyne has made, in place as quickly as we can.  In two years, if we have successfully implemented much of the BusConnects project, we will have made a lot of progress.  It is all down to the number of people travelling on the buses.  If we can get more people to travel on the buses with confidence, it will ultimately be successful.  That will be a priority strategy.</p></speech>

That is a big issue for every business now.  That is the number one risk, which we need to manage carefully.  We need to make sure that we remain cost competitive in a high inflationary environment.</p></speech>

That happened again, but I was much more conscious the second time.  I was looking out for the bus that was not coming and it arrived.  Is Mr. Owens familiar with challenges with RTPI?  It seems to be less reliable now than previously.</p></speech>

We do not have as much say as people might think.  We can bring Mr. Owens in to have a chat with him, but I do not think we have ever said no.  I wish Mr. Owens well on the journey, if he will pardon the pun, with Dublin Bus.  It is an important provider of public transport systems.  I did not grow up too far away from Mr. Owens, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is fair to say that the Dublin Bus product on offer now is far superior to the old CI&Eacute; product that I had when growing up and going to school.  The quality of the buses and of the services is pretty good, most of the time.  There are blips, which I have taken up with Mr. Coyne and others in the organisation.  I wish Mr. Owens well in his term as chairman, subject to him actually taking the position.  Hopefully we will see him back here shortly to report on progress in BusConnects and how he is managing the challenges of operating the system across the city.</p></speech>

I am sorry that he was here, then we were gone and now we are back.  That is the nature of committees.  I am deeply impressed to hear that he was educated on Eblana Avenue.  I spent 25 years right next door to him in the Senior College D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which later had classrooms on Eblana Avenue.  There has been some change to the buildings in that sector.  I have to put this on the record and it is nothing to do with Mr. Owens at all.  Bringing him in here to make a submission to the committee is a waste of time, when all we can do is thank him for coming.  We have no jurisdiction or say as to whether he is a good or a bad chairman.  His curriculum vitae is impeccable.  The only thing I would say is that during the Covid-19 pandemic, his members served the State really well.  They turned up for work every day and drove around the city, making sure that people got to their workplaces, knowing all the time that they themselves were in danger of picking up whichever strain of Covid-19 was prevalent.  Dublin Bus has a tremendous workforce, running the transport system in Dublin.  As he takes over as chairman, I ask him to embrace that type of commitment.  It is not often that one sees it in public service, but they pushed themselves way beyond what is required of any public servant at a time of an emergency.</p> <p>  I do not have anything else to say to Mr. Owens other than to wish him all the best as he moves into a challenging time, with the green agenda and so on.  I thank him for coming here.  I hope the Chairman takes notes on my negative comments about wasting Mr. Owens's time and our time.</p></speech>

It is a subject we have discussed more broadly as a committee.  I get the train up from Limerick a lot so I sometimes use Dublin Bus, although not always, getting from Heuston Station to Kildare Street.  It is a very good service, very punctual and very easy to use.</p> <p>  Why would someone from Mr. Owens's background go for a job as chair of the board of a semi-State body like Dublin Bus?  What does he see the role of a chair for such a State body being?  How would he distinguish between himself as chair, the board and the CEO?  What will he be looking for in a new CEO?</p> <p>  On the green agenda, Mr. Owens referred in his presentation to a more sustainable Dublin.  He wants to be carbon-neutral with zero emissions by 2050 and to expand Dublin Bus's hybrid electric fleet, which now stands at 213.  Has he had an opportunity to get an update on that?  What stamp would Mr. Owens put on the board?  The chair has a pivotal role.  I would like to hear Mr. Owens's thoughts on what he thinks the chair should do.</p></speech>

I have worked in the private sector all my life.  I have enjoyed working in both the disability sector and the sport sector.  I wanted to put something back in and I wanted to have some sort of semi-State role that would keep me informed, keep a good network going and allow me to put something back in after all the experience I have had on the private side.  Dublin Bus appeals to me because I think it will be pivotal in the city.  Having a very vibrant Dublin Bus will be important in getting the city going again post Covid.</p></speech>

I believe in the sustainable agenda so I feel I can contribute something there.  I have chaired loads of committees and boards in the private sector.  There are three fundamental things in this area.  First, the strategy has to be right.  Second, there must be as much intelligent input into the strategy as possible, with good data analytics, good research and good competency around the table.  Third, one needs to set ambitious strategies.  I have always wanted to be part of an ambitious strategy and I think this one is.</p> <p>  As part of the role as chairperson, it is important to have a good, open and transparent relationship with both the directors and the CEO.  That is an important relationship.  The most important thing is the appointment of the CEO.  Ray Coyne has done an excellent job.  He has a brilliant track record and everybody I have met has been hugely complimentary of him.  The committee has heard that here today.  I need to find somebody who is as good as him.  I would have loved to retain him but he is beyond the seven-year term.  I have been very impressed with the board members.  They are very experienced people and they have the same ambition we all have.  When we get to the next award tender, we want Dublin Bus to be in a very strong competitive position.  We want a lot more customers using the facility.  We want to implement the strategy we have agreed with the NTA and we all want to be proud that we have delivered it.  That is what I would hope to achieve as chair for the next five years.  I want to be part of it because I am a Dub.  I believe the city can be much more vibrant without cars, or with fewer cars, and the only way to do that is to have an integrated transport system that involves buses, bikes and walking.  I am fully committed to that and I believe in it. </p></speech>

We have to deliver our commitment to that and we have agreed the steps all the way up to 2050.  Electrification of buses and the infrastructure to support that is a key part of it.  To be fair, we have the capital to deliver this.  It is in the programme.  It is up to us.  We are the executors of the Government policy and the NTA policy, which are very committed to making sure we achieve those objectives.</p></speech>

Let us say ten years, because a lot of the policies Mr. Owens will be looking to implement at board level would probably not come to fruition until a couple of years later.
