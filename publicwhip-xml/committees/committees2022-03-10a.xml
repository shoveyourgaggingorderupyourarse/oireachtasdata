    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-10a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022031000002#A00300"><p>I welcome everyone to the meeting.  Deputy McAuliffe sent his apologies and Deputy Catherine Murphy sent her apologies in regard to this afternoon's session.  In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the Service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear a face mask when moving around the Leinster House campus and when in close proximity to other people.  I ask members and witnesses to respect social distancing.  Covid-19 has not gone away just yet.</p> <p>  Members attending remotely must continue to do so within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is accompanied by Mr. Andrew Harkness, director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the HSE and  examine expenditure on mental health services in the context of the HSE's 2020 financial statements, with a particular focus on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  The HSE has been advised that the committee may also wish to examine the following matters: expenditure in terms of the Owenacurra Centre in Midleton in County Cork; and HSE recruitment targets, budgeting delivery and departmental oversight.</p> <p>  Attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House are the following HSE officials: Mr. Paul Reid, CEO; Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvaney, chief financial officer; Mr. Jim Curran, national director of capital and estates; Ms Yvonne O'Neill, national director of community operations; and Dr. Amanda Burke, child and adolescent consultant psychiatrist and executive clinical director for Galway Roscommon mental health services.  Also attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House are the following officials from the Department of Health: Ms Louise McGirr, assistant secretary; Ms Margaret Campbell, principal officer; and Mr. Seamus Hempenstall, principal officer.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I will ask those attending remotely to mute their microphones when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are either in silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-10a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022031000002#A00400"><p>The annual financial statements of the Health Service Executive are presented in the form directed by the Minister for Health, as provided for in the Health Act 2004.  The direction requires the HSE's expenditure to be split between what is referred to as "revenue" or current expenditure and "capital" expenditure.</p> <p>  Within the revenue income and expenditure statement, spending is broken down into pay and non-pay, with further analysis of non-pay spending under a mix of resource type and national scheme categories.  However, the amount spent on mental health services in 2020 is not disclosed in the audited financial statements.  Separately, the HSE&rsquo;s annual report discloses an unaudited figure of just over &euro;1 billion of current spending on mental health services in 2020.</p> <p>  What is referred to as an indicative appendix to the revised Estimate for the health Vote includes some budgetary information by service type.  This indicates that for 2020 there was an original budget of &euro;1.057 billion in Exchequer funding for mental health services, including a capital allocation of &euro;26 million.  The capital allocation was subsequently increased to &euro;44 million.</p> <p>  The indicative appendix also sets out a range of output and activity measures and performance targets for the mental health services.  However, the appropriation account for the Vote does not report the outturn for the mental health services, either in terms of delivery performance or of service-related expenditure.  Reconciling the budget figures for mental health funding to the HSE&rsquo;s annual report spending figure for mental health is further complicated because of the different bases of accounting used.</p> <p>  The framework of accountability for public expenditure on our health services is therefore very complex.  The committee may be aware of a briefing paper prepared by the Parliamentary Budget Office in 2018 which examined the systems in place in the HSE and the Department of Health for budgeting, performance measurement and financial reporting.  That paper concluded that there is a requirement for a significantly better alignment of the programmes of Vote 38 with the HSE&rsquo;s internal allocations, to make the relationship between what the Oireachtas approves and what is spent on the ground more transparent.  The HSE will be able to update the committee on developments in that regard.</p></speech>

As detailed in the letter of invitation, he has five minutes for his opening statement and I ask that he tries to keep to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-10a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022031000002#A00600"><p>I thank the Chairperson and members for the invitation to attend today&rsquo;s meeting to discuss expenditure on mental health services, including on CAMHS, in the context of the HSE financial statements for 2020.  The Chair has introduced my colleagues so I will not repeat the names.</p> <p>  The range of mental health services delivered by or on behalf of the HSE is extensive and ranges from promotion of positive mental health, HSE-funded services provided by our partner organisations and mental health in primary care, to specialist inpatient and community-based mental health services.</p> <p>  As requested by the committee, I refer to the briefing notes submitted in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting, which provide a detailed breakdown of all HSE expenditure on mental health services and associated governance and oversight arrangements, as well as expenditure and associated spending decisions with regard to the buildings at Owenacurra Centre in Midleton in County Cork.</p> <p>  Owenacurra Centre currently provides mental healthcare, rehabilitation services and accommodation for 11 service users.  The building is, regrettably, no longer fit for purpose and it is not viable to bring it to a standard that will meet the needs of our service users and staff.  Mental health services in Cork Kerry community healthcare organisation work in close collaboration with the affected service users and their families to find more appropriate accommodation.  The process will be handled with sensitivity and with regard to the wishes and preferences of each resident.</p> <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s annual financial statements for 2020 reported total expenditure of &euro;20.2 billion for the provision of health and social care services while also dealing with the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic.  Mental health services expenditure in 2020 was more than &euro;1 billion or more than 5% of total expenditure reported.</p> <p>  Over the past decade, mental health services have seen a significant budget increase.  Since 2012, &euro;325 million have been made available to support priority service enhancements.  These targeted investments have been directed by national mental health policy in Vision for Change 2007, Connecting for Life 2015, and Sharing the Vision 2020, and in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.</p> <p>  Developments have, in broad terms, been aimed at modernising services that historically were centred on institutionalised care by building our workforce and investing in fit-for-purpose infrastructure; promoting positive mental health; intervening early when problems develop; and providing accessible, comprehensive and community-based services for those who need them and supporting the recovery journey of each individual, based on clinical advice and best practice, while recognising the importance of lived experience.</p><p>Funding for new developments has been invested in building our community teams for children and young people, for adults, and for older persons; expanding youth mental health services; developing specialist services and clinical programmes; driving forward our national suicide prevention strategy; strengthening mental health services in primary care; empowering service user involvement; and modernising forensic services.</p><p> The availability of skilled staff is a significant issue in mental health services where demand outstrips supply and where our workforce, particular younger staff, are availing of employment opportunities outside of Ireland.  We continue to have a strong focus on mitigating these risks, among other things by building a service that is attractive to work in, by offering flexible working arrangements and by fully utilising opportunities offered by telehealth solutions.</p><p> Notwithstanding our recruitment challenges, this continued investment has enabled mental health services to progress the shift from institutional to community care and to improve the overall quality of services.  Since 2012, mental health services have seen a net growth of 1,441 wholetime equivalent posts, while increases in agency staff and overtime equals an additional 789 wholetime equivalents into the workforce.  In parallel, significant capacity has been built into primary care and community services to relieve pressures on specialist mental health services, including CAMHS.</p><p> The clear outcomes from this investment can be seen in the following: an additional 18 CAMHS teams since 2012, and generally enhanced capacity in CAMHS; between 2020 and 2021, the number of accepted CAMHS referrals increased by 21%; enhanced inpatient CAMHS capacity and reduction of young people admitted to adult acute units; enhanced capacity within our adult community mental health teams, which has significantly reduced admissions into acute inpatient units; an additional ten community-based teams for older persons; more developed upstream mental health services, including funding for partner organisations such as Jigsaw; greater access to talking therapies, including establishment of counselling in primary care, which has seen more than150,000 people referred for treatment since 2013; development of a new national forensic mental health service in Portrane, which will incorporate a new ten-bed forensic CAMHS unit; design and implementation of four national clinical programmes; establishment of a mental health engagement function nationally and within each community health organisation, as well as recruitment of peer support workers; and expansion of suicide prevention, mental health promotion and health.</p><p> An additional &euro;24 million has been made available to enhance and build new mental health services in 2022.  This will allow the HSE to continue our implementation of the national clinical programmes, build out-of-hours services, crisis response teams and crisis caf&eacute;s, and bring forward a recovery approach into all services.</p><p> In collaboration with the Department of Health, next month we will launch a three-year implementation plan to drive forward delivery of Sharing the Vision, which will complement the Connecting for Life implementation plan already in place.</p><p> These detailed multi-annual plans will provide a clear roadmap for the continued development of mental health services in Ireland.  Implementation will be driven by a strong outcomes focus and a shared commitment to report on progress against these plans in an open and transparent manner, among other things by making progress reports publicly available.</p><p> In delivering these work programmes, the HSE will work in partnership with staff, service users and families to achieve our goal of a modern and fit-for-purpose mental health service that meet the needs of those who require our services.</p><p> This concludes my opening statement.</p></speech>

In his opening statement he said the availability of skilled staff is a significant issue in mental health services.  He said the demand outstrips the supply in the workforce and pointed to difficulties in trying to recruit.  I have a couple of questions on recruitment and budgeting.  What were the HSE's recruitment targets for each of the years 2020 and 2021?</p></speech>

This year it sets out a funded net increase of 10,000.  I will look back briefly to where we have been over the past two years.  Between January 2020 and December 2021, we had a net increase of just over 12,600 staff in total in the health service.  Just for the net increase of 12,600, we have actually recruited 35,000 staff into the HSE in that period.  That is about 9,500 staff every year just to stand still, which we call a natural churn.  That is people retiring, people leaving the service and having to fill those posts just to stand still.</p></speech>

If we take the two years in question, obviously our main allocation of funding was absorbed by Covid-specific funding.  The process is that we would work closely with the Department where the allocation for certain activities such as recruitment looks like it is not going to be used.  With agreement with the Department, we would fund other activities.  Particularly in 2020 and 2021 that went specifically to Covid-related funding.</p></speech>

Indeed, in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform there is a group called the health business oversight group, HBOG, for the oversight of the allocation of funds to health and to the HSE in particular.

I do not want to take too much time on this.  I have a question for Ms McGirr from the Department of Health.  Is the Department happy with the level of oversight it has when budgets are reallocated or reassigned?</p></speech>

In an organisation the size of the HSE I think there always will be overspend in some areas and underspend in other areas.  Obviously, it is a complex and at times demand-led organisation.  Where we have variances and where there are underspends, we work with colleagues and obviously we have to sanction the rerouting or reallocation of money.  This happened a lot in 2021, perhaps not a lot but it certainly happened in terms of Covid-related spend where there was some underspend on core funding, largely due to recruitment in some areas not being met.  That money was, with our approval and at times where appropriate the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's approval, moved to Covid-related spend.  That is a practical example of it.  That would not be unusual in an organisation the size of the HSE.</p></speech>

The paper examined the process of disbursal of voted expenditure under Vote 38 in the Health Service Executive's national service plan.</p><p>It goes on to comment on the integrated financial management system and the delays in that regard.  I raise this in the context of the considerable disquiet and frustration within the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Committee of Public Accounts about the fact that situation does not appear to have been fully addressed.  What progress has been made on addressing the issue?</p></speech>

It is complex and can be difficult from a transparency perspective, but we work closely with our colleagues.  I might set out what happens and what the financial reporting requirements are.  We get monthly financial reports, which set out the budgeted expenditure within the HSE and the variance between what was budgeted and the actual expenditure.  We also get detailed financial commentary and this happens throughout the year.  I will not go into the budgetary process at the beginning of the year with the planning and the allocation of funding, which happens across government, although I can if the committee wishes.</p> <p>  In respect of the ongoing monitoring, we get detailed financial commentaries and there are specific reports on Covid, which have been introduced over recent years.  We get monthly run rate files, which show the trends for each of the areas of the HSE.  We have a significant and reasonably elaborate process within the Department around performance reporting, including financial and recruitment oversight, which runs in each of the service areas and goes up to CEO and Secretary General levels.  In addition, the HSE provides a profile of its cash requirements and its projected expenditure on an accruals basis.  The profile is submitted to the Department and much work is done to understand the cash and the I&amp;E spend and where they sit together.  Obviously, the HSE also provides draft annual financial statements to the Minister for Health.  A significant volume of work goes on throughout the year.</p> <p>  As for improvements relating to financial transparency and the visibility of information, I am on the board relating to the IFMS, the new financial management system.  The Department and the HSE work closely together on the development of the new systems, which are crucial.  I refer to both the HR and the financial management systems.  In addition, many improvements have been made and much work done with colleagues in the HSE, despite some of the limitations on the systems, to improve the reporting.  We are continuously engaged in that process with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to improve transparency.</p></speech>

Our guests might respond very briefly to my final question.  The need for an integrated financial management system was highlighted in 2014 and there have been several deadlines for its completion.  The last one I heard about was for 2024.  Is it still the case that our health system does not have an integrated financial management system and will not have one until 2024, ten years after the need for it was first highlighted?</p></speech>

The statutory piece is the largest single component of that and it has moved by about 12 months, for the reasons I mentioned.</p> <p>  If I could clarify in regard to the recruitment targets, the development moneys are ring-fenced for the purpose that is intended.  We centrally hold development moneys for posts until we have confirmation the posts are in place.  Any offsetting, or use of them on a once-off basis, does not take them out of that purpose and, therefore, they are available the following year when the posts are recruited.  The money is not lost and has been retained.</p></speech>

It is probably the single biggest change system in the country at the moment.  Along the way, to be clear, we have put some of our more legacy systems onto a version of a systems, applications and products, SAP, system.  Each of them, in its own right, is a major implementation.  The mid-west region was put onto an SAP system, the north west to Crumlin hospital and the corporate office to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, CHI.  Along the way, we are making substantial improvements in the overall process, but we are nonetheless frustrated, like the Chairman, by the fact it is a large, complicated process.  It is not just the system; it is the roll-out of a single national set of processes, including a global shared services for healthcare.  It is a very complex project and the risks need to be managed appropriately.</p></speech>

What is different since 2019 is that the HSE has a board in place and there is an audit and risk committee, which meets monthly, oversees all expenditure and risks and makes certain approvals for certain delegations to spend.  It is quite a thorough process.  Along with that, quite a thorough process of internal financial management controls has been put in place across the organisation, which I oversee as CEO.  As outlined by Ms McGirr, there are also various other channels between us, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is much enhanced and strengthened oversight since the placement of a new board within the HSE and the focus we now put on finance.  Nevertheless, we appreciate some of the frustrations regarding the financial system.</p></speech>

We are elected by the people and we approve the expenditure, and the HSE spends the money and has that relationship with the Department of Health and the line Minister of the day.  Ultimately, there is an accountability mechanism here.  The Comptroller and Auditor General holds a constitutional position.  If he is making reference in his opening remarks to that specific report, that report has to be taken seriously by the HSE.  It is important.  Let us not make light of it.  It is a vital transparency mechanism.</p></speech>

That has been the primary driver of the significant oversight process that I, as CEO, and the new board have put in place since 2019.</p><p>With a view to getting the allocations right, we are well over and understand the issues around income and expenditure, cash management, accruals, regarding which we are mandated under legislation to provide a system in the HSE, and the challenge in terms of matching against cash management.

It was a very simple question and the response I got was comprehensive, which was to the credit of Mr. Ryan.  The response was that the total number of persons waiting for CAMHS nationally was 3,357.  When I submitted a further parliamentary question, asking for a breakdown of services provided by CAMHS, specifically the number presenting to CAMHS who were waiting for psychology services, the reply, which was from Mr. O'Regan, the head of operations, gave a universal figure of 9,554 for psychology services alone.  If I break it down further in relation to CHO 4, the CHO I am most familiar with, I get a total of 682 people waiting.  For psychology services, I get a figure of approximately 3,000 for CHO 4.</p> <p>  What is deeply frustrating for us in representing families and children awaiting appointments or trying to get into the system of CAMHS is that it is very hard to get accurate information in real time in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  When we table parliamentary questions, it is very hard to give families real-time information based on their children's needs and their expectations.  I have no criticisms whatsoever of the individuals who work in CAMHS, who are trying to do their best and work through all the needs of families daily, but Mr. Reid has to acknowledge that there is a serious issue in respect of CAMHS and his datasets in respect of interrogating figures in that regard.  It is Kafkaesque that systems within the HSE organisation are not talking to each other properly.  If Mr. Reid cannot even come up with proper figures for me when there are glaring contradictions, how can we expect to have confidence in his approach?  In fairness to him, he has taken a national lead on the Covid pandemic, but we want him to devote the same energy to dealing with CAMHS, its management and, ultimately, the delivery of services to families.  We remain to be convinced that appropriate resources are being deployed.  From Mr. Reid's level of management down, more needs to be done.  How does he answer this critique - I do not call it a criticism - of how we as politicians interface with the service?</p></speech>

I will answer the governance and oversight question first and then ask my colleague Ms Anne O'Connor to deal with some of the lists and correlations he referred to.</p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's frustration as an Oireachtas Member, parliamentary representative and local representative in relaying some of the figures that he set out that cause him frustration.  I will briefly describe - I do not want to over-labour this point - the circumstances related to oversight of all our services.  The executive management team reports to our board setting out not only the targeted objectives in our corporate plan but equally the targeted objectives in our national service plan every year.  One of the strengthening processes that I, as CEO, put in place with the executive team is one whereby, on a monthly basis, we report monthly to the board with a national scorecard for every aspect of our national service plan, every aspect of all targets in the national service plan, our progress and the issues and risks in respect of each of the targets.  That is new and different.  I reassure the Deputy that it is not just about oversight in respect of Covid over the past two years.  Throughout the process and since 2019, we have had very strong oversight of all aspects of our services, including mental health services, and direct reporting on a scorecard related to CAMHS.  I just wanted to give that general assurance.  I ask my colleague, Ms O'Connor, to give some of the specifics.</p></speech>

About half of those children are waiting for under 12 weeks.  Our target is 12 weeks.  About half are within the target period and about 1,700 are outside it.  In theory, for us the waiting-beyond target figure is the 1,700.  The larger number the Deputy referred to in relation to psychology concerns psychology for children across mental health and disability primary care.  In the mental health area, we have invested in primary care psychology to support children because we know that when we are talking specifically about CAMHS, we are talking about children who have gone into the specialist mental health service.  Our priority needs to be to support children earlier in their pathway in primary care or if they are in disability services.  The 9,000 pertains to psychology for children across the different specialties; it is not specific to CAMHS.  This relates to what has consistently been our challenge.  It is now something we are trying to work through in implementing Sharing the Vision and recommendations on youth mental health and in all that good work that is going on.  However, we are looking at how we can explain that better because psychology sits, in the main, within our primary care services, seeing children who are referred in a different way-----</p></speech>

It took us a lot longer to put them in place than we had envisaged.  Clearly, there is a lot of change occurring as a result.  We are now in a position in which the needs of all children in the country can be looked at in a more equitable way in terms of having networks and specialist supports available within networks.  They will align with our enhanced community care in terms of our primary care networks, having regard to a whole-population view.  Therefore, it is a big change for the system.  It is early days.  I know there are issues but we are certainly working through those.</p></speech>

Again, it is almost Kafkaesque that they are in this vortex of constant form-filling.  They feel extremely frustrated.  Can Ms O'Connor sympathise and empathise with their experience of children's disability network teams so far?</p></speech>

We have 91 networks around the country.  The real challenge for us and the reason we are trying to reconfigure children's disability services is that while there was a range of services that children who were getting a service may have been getting, there were children who were not getting services.  For us, it is about trying to look after all the children.</p> <p>  With regard to the approach, we had an approach that was very much based on assessment.  There was much focus on assessment but we know that when people were assessed, it did not guarantee them access to a service.  Therefore, our approach is now more intervention based.  It is about providing a service, not just giving an assessment, because the latter has attracted huge criticism over a number of years.  It is a question of change.  I am aware that people are having difficulties, and we are absolutely committed to taking those on board.</p></speech>

I am not a specialist in this field so I rely on the information being imparted to me by the HSE.  Would person-to-person intervention not have been the starting point anyway as opposed to sending people into an assessment process that some families describe as nightmarish?

It states an approved centre is intended "to provide in-patient treatment to people suffering from mental illness.  The MHC maintains a register of all approved centres."  The chief executive stated the HSE is going to move to close the Owenacurra Centre.  Will Mr. Reid reconsider that position?  I am not convinced, and I imagine I speak comfortably for all the Members of the Oireachtas who represent the Cork East constituency, there is a proper, fit-for-purpose local alternative solution to respond to the centre&rsquo;s closure.  Mr. Reid made reference in his opening remarks to Glenwood, but from what I can see in the planning application, that is not to be designated as an approved centre.  In fact, there was no mention of the fact it would become an approved centre.</p> <p>  Right now, there are 11 people who do not know where they are supposed to go, yet they have expressed a clear will and preference.  Mr. Reid used the expression "will and preference".  I would contend that as long as they continue to express a will and preference to stay at the Owenacurra Centre, they should be allowed to do so for as long as is necessary, in accordance with their will and preference.  I do not believe our guests have presented to us a fit-for-purpose and local alternative for them.  Sending them 30 km up the road is not a solution.  That is not how we treat people in this day and age.  If they continue to express a will and preference not to move, that must be respected.  Furthermore, the moneys the HSE has spent on improving the Owenacurra Centre have to be taken into account.  I understand more than &euro;359,000 has been spent there since 2016.  There is no alternative for the residents at present.  Our guests have presented the Carrigaline centre as an alternative, but it is not an approved centre.  The residents &ndash; 11 souls - are almost being cast out.  I ask Mr. Reid to please reconsider and to have a bit of heart in respect of these people.</p></speech>

It is, potentially, a specific solution for a wider set of service needs we have in the community.  In regard to the Owenacurra Centre, we have given a detailed and thorough evaluation and assessment to determine the most appropriate options.  It is not the appropriate location for residents for the future.  We will continue to work with residents, as we have done to date, and with their families to find the most appropriate solution.  My colleague, Ms O'Neill, might wish to comment further.  I assure the Deputy we have real heart in respect of this issue.  We fully sympathise and are fully committed to finding the right solutions.</p></speech>

It states:</p> <blockquote> 	Within the revenue income and expenditure statement, spending is broken down into pay and non-pay, with further analysis of non-pay spending under a mix of resource type and national scheme categories.  However, the amount spent on mental health services in 2020 is not disclosed in the audited financial statements.  Separately, the HSE&rsquo;s annual report discloses an unaudited figure of just over &euro;1 billion of current spending on mental health services in 2020. </blockquote> <p>Nowhere can I find any reference to capital spending.  It looks to me like a melange, mixed together in a bowl.  Ms McGirr stated that, on foot of the framework from the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, there has been improved reporting and transparency.  Where exactly is that improved reporting and transparency in the context of the mental health budget?  Will the representatives from the Department of Health outline how the Department satisfies itself that the resources provided to the HSE for the provision of mental health services are being utilised as they were intended?</p></speech>

We are constantly told there is no problem with money and that money is not the issue.</p><p>A number of articles in the <i>Business Post </i>in recent weeks chimed with my experience with some of the services and, in essence, the idea that we do not have granular information available to us and we cannot rely on audited figures.  I want to see the evidence.  Looking at the evidence is what this committee is about.  The evidence is not there for us to interrogate because it is a non-audited figure.  It is completely unacceptable.<br/><br/>I have a very short period of time.  I will ask about problems with adult services.  Most of the focus today will be on child and adolescent mental health services.  I will ask about all the community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas.  We talk about a figure for recruitment of staff and where there are gaps.  We talk about that in a very global way.  I do not expect the HSE representatives to give this to us now, but will they provide the committee with a document about all nine of the CHO areas, specifically in respect of child and adolescent mental health services?  What vacancies are in each of those areas?  How long have those vacancies been there?  What efforts have been made to fill those vacancies?  I ask them to come back to us with that because I expect we will have to have further sessions with the HSE and this may well be one issue.  I just want to satisfy myself on that.<br/><br/>Equally, will they give us the structure of, and where there are gaps in, adult services?  Are there currently children in adult mental health approved facilities at this stage?  Is the HSE satisfied that 88 places are sufficient?  If not, what is the number that is required?</p></speech>

We can also fill the Deputy in on current recruitment plans or gaps.  We know we have very specific challenges in some parts of the country, not just in CAMHS recruitment.  We have a particular focus on increasing the pool or panel of resources coming through, especially for our specialist clinical resources, and clinical psychiatrists in particular, in CAMHS.  We will provide that.  I will ask my colleague to respond on the particular focus we have had on reducing the number of adolescents or children in adult mental health service resident places.</p></speech>

My colleague here has just informed me that we have had no admissions to adult units yet in 2022.  Even in previous years, our admission numbers need to be contextualised by the fact that most of the young people who were admitted to adult units were there for very short periods because of geography.  For example, if somebody gets sick in the middle of the night, they might be admitted to Letterkenny, while they are waiting for a bed in the unit at Galway but at the moment we are actively managing the waiting lists.</p></speech>

We have seen a change in the profile of young people who have been admitted to inpatient units, particularly over the Covid period.  There has been a very well publicised increase in the number of young people with eating disorders.  In our unit, where we previously may only have had one or two patients, we have had up to 50% or 60% occupancy with eating disorders.  We are working very hard on standing up the eating disorder teams, which provides a real alternative to inpatient care.  The work that is being done is in increasing the day hospital services and specialist services to obviate the need for inpatient admissions.  At present, bed numbers are enough for the young people who are coming through.</p></speech>

As a public healthcare provider, you would imagine that the HSE would be eternally grateful to people who flag what is, at the very minimum, a substandard in care.  You would imagine that Mr. Reid, as the head buck cat if you like, would be very grateful to those people and they would be treated properly so they would not end up feeling they had no option other than to walk away from their employment.  You would imagine that, at the best of times.</p> <p>  Following Mr. Reid's appearance in front of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health last week, it was again reported that the HSE's probing reports indicated the whistleblower was mistreated.</p><p>Is that the case?

Does that not indicate a system that is in utter chaos?  This was a very serious case that was in the system for two full years and there had not been a full diagnosis despite the begging and pleading for help of the girl's mother.</p></speech>

If I noted it correctly, Mr. Reid has described the situation that occurred in south Kerry CAMHS as a complete failure across multiple areas in terms of oversight, governance, clinical management, duty of care and other areas.  That is a very frank and honest assessment of what happened.  I wish to probe precisely how it happened and what was done to address it at appropriate times.</p> <p>  As I understand it, the issues of concern were first raised in 2018.  Could Mr. Reid state precisely when this was brought to the attention of the HSE?  Who was the highest in the management chain in terms of those who were informed at that point, and at subsequent points, regarding the concerns about the diagnoses and treatments in south Kerry CAMHS?</p></speech>

The timelines are set out in the Maskey report.  Where issues were raised, they were raised at a local level.  The first significant intervention was made by a newly appointed executive clinical director back in September 2020 when she initiated a look-back at 50 files, which then triggered a very significant process at a local level.  The chief officer who leads the community healthcare organisation, CHO, then commissioned the look-back review following that.  That is when it was triggered at a local level at a senior level.  Ms O'Connor might want to add something.</p></speech>

When the concerns emerged from that, it was notified to the national system in June last year.  At that time, Ms O'Neill, as national director, was notified.  It then came through to me and Dr. Henry and the safety and quality subcommittee of the board was advised that there was an issue.  It has monitored the situation throughout and it has been updated on the progress in respect of the review since then.</p></speech>

I have mentioned the patient experience strand.  The second strand is the review of compliance with the operational guidance, which is recognised as very good guidance.  We know from the Maskey report that in that area they were not adhering to the guidance that is in place.  That is the second strand of work.  The third strand of work relates to prescribing practice.  We are looking in depth at ADHD prescribing.  As the Maskey report sets out, the issues arose in this area in respect of ADHD prescribing.  The clear recommendation of Dr. Maskey is that we start there.  However, the Minister of State has been clear that she wants us to look at broader prescribing practices and we are now finalising how we will do that.</p></speech>

The Maskey report refers to the need to develop standards in line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, guidelines.  We will be doing that.  We are starting with ADHD because that is where the initial concerns are.  We will have standards developed in respect of ADHD and we will also examine prescribing practices relating to non-ADHD.

We have to remember that the issue here was a red flag in a specific area and relating to a specific set of circumstances.  We do not have cause for concern across every service and it is important to state that CAMHS continue to provide essential services to children with severe mental illness today, tomorrow and this week.  It is important that people continue to have faith in those services.  We will be doing an audit to assure ourselves that the prescribing practice is okay.

It is important to thank all those working in mental health services.  It is a challenging job and the vast majority of the staff work extremely hard and are dedicated to their job.  I saw that when I visited the facility at Sarsfield Court on Monday.  The commitment of the staff is superb.  It is important to acknowledge that.</p> <p>  I wish to return to the issue of CAMHS in Cork and Kerry.  I have raised previously the issue of checks and balances.  In the context of the process, there is a team in each area yet the incorrect prescribing went on for four years.  It was then identified that the person who was doing this was not a consultant.  The issue I have raised relates to where a consultant is in charge and incorrectly prescribes.  From the answers I have received to date, I am not satisfied in respect of the checks and balances that are there.</p><p>The reply given to me previously stated that there is a team in place there and, therefore, if someone was not managing a patient properly, it would show up.  However, in the case of this particular junior doctor, nothing showed up.  When it comes to consultants, what checks and balances are now in place in CAMHS teams and what processes will be put in place in that regard?</p></speech>

First, on the checks and balances at consultant and doctor level, there is data oversight, not just in CAMHS and mental health services but across all health services, and performance discussions happen in terms of correct application of people's skill or specialty.  We value that oversight process all across the health service and it is put in place on a regular basis.  Indeed, decisions by a senior consultant-----</p></speech>

I am asking whether it is possible there could be a very well qualified medical consultant in a particular area in a situation where there are no checks and balances.  I am not convinced those checks and balances are in place.</p></speech>

They are the most qualified and most experienced medics we have, upon whom we all rely to lead their teams and deliver fantastic services around the country.  There has not been a red flag put up around consultant prescribing.  We are not putting up a red flag about consultant prescribing.</p></speech>

We have said previously that what made this situation different was that there had been no consultant there for so long.  We have occasions where consultants go on leave or we have short gaps.  In this case, there was no consultant for years and that is something that we, as a system, need to ensure does not happen.</p> <p>  In terms of how consultants work together, they engage in extensive continuing medial education.  They have education sessions and work with each other in teams within settings.  They call each other out.  They have rounds, grand rounds and all of that.</p></speech>

When I was in St. Stephen's Hospital in Sarsfield Court on Monday, it was outlined to me that there is now only one mental healthcare facility that is really up in standard in the Cork region, which is the one attached to Cork University Hospital, CUH.  If we take Portlaoise hospital, for example, when Covid broke out, there were 26 patients in a particular facility.  I know of one staff member there who was out for two weeks as a result of getting Covid in the hospital, during which 11 people died because there were six patients per ward.  In fairness to the staff, they did everything they could.  There are inadequate facilities for mental healthcare.  The Cork region has only one that is up to standard.  What is being done in terms of prioritising facilities like that to ensure they are all meeting the required standard?</p></speech>

We acknowledged a number of years ago that the supply was not going to be enough.  As we grew our mental health services in line with A Vision for Change, we just did not have enough capacity coming through so we are now seeing those cohorts coming through as a well and, as Mr. Reid noted, we have invested in higher specialist training, nurses and the employment of assistant psychologists.</p></speech>

It is good to have them before the committee again.  I thank them for the information provided to date.  I will start with Mr. Mulvany on the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening remarks concerning the annual report, which discloses an unaudited figure of more than &euro;1 billion of current expenditure.  This was spoken about earlier but I was not here at that stage.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated:</p> <blockquote> 	[T]he appropriation account for the Vote does not report the out-turn for the mental health services, either in terms of delivery performance or of service-related expenditure.  Reconciling the budget figures for mental health funding to the HSE's annual report spending figure for mental health is further complicated because of the different bases of accounting used.  The framework of accountability for ... expenditure on our health services is therefore very complex. </blockquote> <p>Is there a way to streamline that for next year so the committee can get a better picture of the expenditure broken down by section under the mental health heading?</p></speech>

That is because our annual financial statements are part of an overall document which includes an annual report, which will have some figures in it, and the operating and financial review.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does not audit those two parts of the document in the normal sense of the word.  He simply checks them for consistency with the annual financial statement.  That is what "unaudited" means in that context.</p> <p>  The appropriation account, which the Department looks after, is based on certain legal requirements, as is the HSE's annual financial statement.  The Minister sets out the type and format of that.  I reassure the Deputy that the monthly performance reporting, as Ms McGirr mentioned, is based on much more detailed information, which goes across all the care groups, including acute, mental health and primary care, and all aspects of the HSE, both in terms of programme-type areas and kind of cost.  That information plus commentaries on it is available and the HSE does publish its-----</p></speech>

Effectively, it says there are two different systems at work.  The HSE is accountable to the Department and, ultimately, the Minister and that track is in place; however, as an oversight committee of public bodies, we need to be able to distil down the information, as we do for all public organisations.  Is there a way to make sure the systems talk to each other?  Will that happen in the next 12 months?  Is that part of the plan for the HSE?</p></speech>

We are talking about two different things.  One is how to link the HSE's accrual-based accounting reports with the Department's cash-based.  The only way to do that at a detailed level is through the IFMS system, which we will have for the whole of the HSE's statutory services by 2025, subject to the current tender process.  On reconciling the two in the interim, we provide an annual reconciliation of our income and expenditure accounts to our annual financial statements and those statements can be reconciled overall to the Department's appropriation account.  More detailed information is and will remain in our monthly accounts, which are published.  That information can provide details on costs, outputs, staff numbers and grades, total costs and all the different types of costs across mental health and other care groups.</p></speech>

I am conscious of my time.  I turn to the CAMHS issue.  Ms O'Connor is welcome back to the committee.  I heard what she said about Kerry CAMHS to the effect that it is specific to that area.  I do not want to dwell too much on it because it is an active, ongoing case.  However, it would be remiss of us not to touch on it while we are talking about CAMHS in general.  I will only touch on items that are in the public domain.  I understand from what Ms O'Connor is saying that there will be learnings from  the Maskey report.  How sure is Ms O'Connor and the HSE that it is specific to that area?</p></speech>

It was very specific.  The individual was a doctor, not in a training programme.  We will know more and the assurance will come from the processes we are now embarking on.  There are a couple of important points in the Maskey report.  One is that the operational guidance that exists nationally is sound.  It was not being implemented.  We have to start there and say that if we have guidance that took a lot of development, we have to assure ourselves it is being used by the teams.  That is one step.  The prescribing practice was a specific issue in that area and the audit will give assurance that it is not a systemic issue.</p><p>We do not believe that it is.  The audit will hopefully tell us that but we will obviously have to wait to see what the outcome is.</p><p> It is important to remember that in our health services we employ professionals who are, in the main, registered in their own right as practitioners.  They have to complete a range of different types of continuing education in order to maintain registration.  There are other bodies that oversee the registration.  There is an assurance that comes through that as well in the context of people coming through those processes.  As stated at the outset, I cannot guarantee 100% that there are no issues that we have missed.</p></speech>

That is where the structures of the national office and the national lead - and I know that Ms O&rsquo;Neill is on the call and can deal with this as well - are essential.  Irrespective of the professional bodies that individuals may belong to, internal structures obviously failed here.  They failed significantly over a number of years.  I have met with some of the parents in regard to the Kerry CAMHS.  To say that it is distressing is an understatement.  It is very upsetting as a parent to hear of the issues that they have faced over several years in respect of so many different failings.  To me, Dr. Sharma has done the people of Kerry and, indeed, the people of the country a great service.  I commend him on his work because, without it, this issue would have rumbled on I fear.  I take what Ms O'Connor is saying that it is isolated to that area.  I hope that is the case, but I ask Mr. Reid to ensure that there is a full audit across the country, as the Minister has requested, in order to make sure it is just an isolated incident.</p> <p>  What services and supports have been offered to the families, parents and, ultimately, children in Kerry since this issue entered the public domain?  My information is that not much has changed, even with everything else that we now know.  I hope that is incorrect and that it is not the case.  If it is the case, I hope that the matter will be rectified as of close of business today because the families feel that there is a great deal of discussion going on in the public domain but that there is not a great deal of change within the HSE.</p></speech>

I will deal specifically with where Ms O&rsquo;Connor qualified this point earlier and where the Deputy states that we are reflecting that this issue is isolated to Kerry.  That is the full reason we are doing the national audit, which is to give us assurance that it is just isolated to Kerry.  It was highlighted there.  Dr. Amanda Burke is here.  She is a professional in the area and knows that it is not a prevalent issue, but we want to assure ourselves and that is why we are going on a national basis to work with the Minister on that.  Specifically on the scope of the full and complete audit we are carrying out, we are finalising the details of that at the moment with the Minister in the next number of days and we will be able to speak further on that but Ms O&rsquo;Connor can give a broader outline-----</p></speech>

The point the Deputy is raising is a valid one in respect of challenges around service provision.  That is, one might argue, what got us into this situation in the first place, namely, ensuring sufficient capacity in Kerry.</p> <p>  The chief officer and his team have been working with families but they are putting a clinical support team in place that will work, in effect, on a case management basis.  Part of the challenge for people when they look into our system, as we have previously flagged, is the complexity of it and ensuring that people&rsquo;s needs are met.  There are people who are no longer in CAMHS, who have moved into adult services or who are not in services at all.  It is critical, and I fully accept that we have to ensure that services are available.  There are vacancies in that area.  It is difficult to recruit and we are looking at all of the options that are available to us to ensure that the appropriate supports are put in place.  That work is under way and, as I said, that clinical liaison team is being put in place if it is not there already.</p></speech>

My understanding is that prescriptions have not been reviewed and that the clinical support team needed to be in place certainly prior to our guests' appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I ask that resources be deployed through the national office, from elsewhere if necessary, in order to ensure that the families are engaged with at the very least today or by the end of the week.  I cannot fathom that if my child had been impacted since 2016, nobody would have made contact with me as of today to say that everything was going to be reviewed and supports offered.  It is not just the children any more but it is their entire family who need the supports and services.  I am not asking Ms O&rsquo;Connor to comment on that but I am asking Mr. Reid, through all of the staff that he has available and are at his disposal, to ensure that there is a targeted approach to the families who have been impacted since, arguably, before 2016, but certainly since 2016 up to today, where we need to ensure that they get the services.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

Good morning everybody.  I am unsure who might answer this question but a pilot programme was announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for a crisis resolution team to be set up in Waterford.  It was regarded as a mental health pilot scheme.  Is that up and running?</p></speech>

One of the things is that mental health has had the benefit of having a clear policy direction for staffing.  We know nationally in respect of staffing compliments by each CHO how they benchmark against what A Vision for Change might say and whether these levels are particularly low or not.  We also know that with regard to particular populations, there are different needs.  It is important, therefore, to know that mental health over recent years has broadened out from just core adult child type services.  We have a whole range of other services around addiction, dual diagnosis, ADHD, etc.  There is a whole broadening based upon clinical programmes and evidence around mental health.</p><p>We have clinical programmes that set the standards.</p></speech>

There was an exponential increase, in the region of some 300%, in young people presenting with anorexia in Wexford during the Covid period.

I have been asking for two years why we only have an allocation of 0.5 of a paediatric dietician, yet we have a 300% increase in cases of anorexia.  I have asked this question of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and CHO 5.  I have written to everybody I can think of asking why our allocation has not been increased to one full-time equivalent, in which case we might be able to recruit.  Can Ms O'Connor tell me why even the half-time position has not been filled?</p></speech>

I gave some figures earlier on a national basis, showing recruitment numbers of 12,500 over the past two years.  We still have challenges, particularly in terms of mental health.  We are trying to strengthen the pipeline in terms of training.  We are trying to target specific areas and Wexford may be one of them.  We have some real challenges in some areas and some parts of the country in recruiting specialists.  That continues to be a real challenge for us.</p></speech>

Early intervention is regarded as the primary factor in dealing with any of these issues.  Mr. Reid really should look it up and see what it means.  We have gone beyond the ridiculous.  Since I last brought this up in the D&aacute;il, we have a waiting list for dentists in Wexford that is increasing exponentially.  We have medical card patients who might as well not have received those cards.  They can access neither doctors nor dentists.  It is just getting worse and worse.  Then we read reports of &euro;350 million going in to fix a waiting list, but that is not the problem.  Somebody is the problem and I know it is not me.</p></speech>

We know that, in terms of psychology, we have children coming in through primary care services and through our disability services.  They are not necessarily children who would ever attend CAMHS.  That is the grey area in terms of mental health with children.  It is not as clean cut.  Children who need psychological services do not necessarily need access to CAMHS.  This is why we acknowledged that a number of years ago, as I said, and invested in the development of primary care psychology.</p> <p>  Ultimately, a model that we are aiming for and something that has been supported in terms of the vision, etc., is that children should be supported as close to their homes, their schools, etc., as possible and only when they really need a specialist service should they end up there.  We have to build the supports for children at a primary care level.  That is why, through enhanced community care, etc., and that whole approach from Sl&aacute;intecare, we are trying to support children away from our specialist services.  Ultimately, we would like to develop a range of responses that would see CAMHS business going down in a sense because we find children defaulting into CAMHS in the absence of other services being available to them.</p></speech>

In effect, they are triaged and assessed.  Dr. Burke is better place than I am to talk about how a CAMHS team works.  From a HSE perspective, in the context of how we have developed other supports, we have invested in the development of CAMHS teams in terms of that multidisciplinary approach across the health and social professionals, nursing and medical, but we have also then looked at other supports.</p></speech>

If we were to look at this going forward, in terms of how we are investing in agencies such as Jigsaw focused on young people where we have significant investment now, people would be able to receive supports without needing to go to a CAMHS team.</p> <p>  Ultimately, in relation to any clinical teams, we will always triage on the basis of clinical prioritisation and it will be the sickest children who are seen first.  There is always a risk, therefore, that the people who are not in such significant need will be waiting longer.  That is why we need to have other supports in terms of our tiered approach to the delivery of services that we have, a whole population approach and building it up from there to that very specialist point in CAMHS.</p></speech>

In 2020, there was a capital plan from the HSE that assigned &euro;145,000 to bring Owenacurra up to standard.

Is there also asbestos in the buildings at St. Catherine's and St. Stephen's?</p></speech>

As anyone who has worked in the construction industry knows, asbestos, once it is disturbed, is highly dangerous.  There is no suggestion the Owenacurra asbestos is open and dangerous currently.</p></speech>

The HSE recently announced that it will close Owenacurra but redo wards in St. Stephen's and that it will redo St. Catherine's.

Owenacurra was a 24-bed facility and two of the rooms were three-person rooms.  Let us bring it down to 20 individual rooms.  Mr. Curran's contention is that a 20-bed facility at Owenacurra, which is located in the middle of Midleton on a very valuable site might I add, would cost &euro;8 million to build.</p></speech>

Was it aware of the situation relating to Owenacurra?  It seems that this has absolutely nothing to do with residents.  It is a measure to centralise service costs in St. Stephen's Hospital and St. Catherine's ward.  We have decided to move 19 people 30 km away from their homes.  I spoke to a man on Monday who was crying because he is so distressed.  He has never left Midleton and never lived anywhere else.  None of the people are going into community settings as far as I can see, despite the fact that community settings are being used as a reason to close down Owenacurra.  At the end of this process, only one person will be in a community setting.  The other 18 people will be in congregated settings or nursing homes.  Is the Department overseeing this?  Is it happy with this type of capital cost decision-making?  Is there any accountability in the east Cork area?  Is there any accountability for the decision-making on mental health facilities in Cork in the Department?  East Cork will now have not one 24-hour high-support bed, not one.  The two respite beds it did have for two people every week, which is 100 respite placements a year, are all gone.  Is the Department happy with this decision-----</p></speech>

Colleagues in the HSE have outlined the decisions they have made and how they have taken those decisions on foot of the Mental Health Commission action in the best interests of residents.  I can say the Department is satisfied that the HSE is still acting in the best interests of residents.  We are staying in touch with the HSE on progress to ensure the residents are safe and their interests are taken care of.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is also very interested.  I was speaking to her about it only last night.</p></speech>

Mr. Curran's colleague from HSE estates was there.  It was a reasonably positive meeting.  In excess of &euro;4 million went into the Abbeyleix nursing unit, we are told, or what is referred to locally as Abbeyleix hospital.  There are 42 or 43 staff and the site is five acres.  Up to last week, seven beds were occupied.  That has increased this week.  I want to say very directly to Mr. Reid that we have to get better at using resources in this State.  The HSE has to get better at it.  Here is a fine facility on a large site with a very committed and dedicated staff.  Those in the county who are looking to get people into nursing home beds would give their right arm to get their relatives into that facility.  That needs to be brought back into full use with the staff used.</p><p> Will Mr. Curran respond on the utilisation of those beds and of the full premises?  Will he address the situation around the day-care centre?  It was closed during Covid, understandably, but then a decision was taken during Covid to move it away from Abbeyleix hospital where it was located for years.  There was an integrated healthcare hub there.  The plan was to relocate it in a separate building and perhaps even a different town.  I know that the HSE had looked at buildings in Mountrath ten miles away.  However, I am saying clearly that the place for it, and it has been agreed to reopen the unit in the second quarter of this year, is the hospital site in Abbeyleix.  That is important.</p></speech>

On estates, we have supported the investment to upgrade the Abbeyleix hospital.  We are also doing a master plan for the site where the day centre is.  The are a number of residential beds.  We are also looking at the possibility of putting a primary care centre on that site too.</p></speech>

This really is a pressing issue.  When places are closed it can be hard to open them again.  At the meeting last week, the day-care centre in Monastrevin was mentioned as a case in point.  It is really important.  HSE management were present at that meeting and I do not want to misrepresent what they said.  The case was made very strongly that that site would become an integrated hub of community care for the elderly in particular.  I want to emphasise that if a primary care centre is going in you have a nursing unit there too along with speech and language therapists and physiotherapists on site and all the services.  It is really important.  Does Mr. Curran agree that the way forward for Abbeyleix is for it to become that hub?  The site is there.  The HSE needs to provide infrastructure and buildings but it is ready and almost in the centre of the town, exactly where it needs to be located in the county.  Does Mr. Curran agree that this is the opportune time and that the site is a prime location for that integrated hub?</p></speech>

Ms O'Connor was discussing the supports that would be put in place for the families and children in Kerry CAMHS.  She might send us a note on the updates when she replies to the committee.</p> <p>  On overall mental health services, we recall the terrible attack on the HSE and Department IT services.  Can we get an update on that?  Mr. Reid said that approximately 80% of the HSE's services were impacted.  What level of services have been restored?  Are they fully back?  Has the system been updated?  Is the HSE  satisfied with the security arrangements that are now in place?</p></speech>

Since the cyberattack, we commissioned PwC to do a broad assessment of what happened, what our weaknesses were and what the recommendations were.  Right now, we are in the process of overseeing those recommendations and bringing them to implementation through the Department and on through Government.</p> <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question regarding whether we have weaknesses, I would say that, most certainly in the current geopolitical environment, there are huge threats in the context of cyber.  We are all well aware of that.  The actions we have taken since the cyberattack have primarily been around security 24-7, increased access controls and increased authentication controls where people might have to type a double entry to access a system.  There are some specific recommendations around the recruitment of, in particular, two key specialists.  This is a role around a chief technology and transformation officer and a chief operations officer with a speciality in cyber.  We have set out the process to recruit for those two roles.  That will probably take some time.  We have issued a tender for someone to come in and support us in that process in the meantime.  We are just finalising that detail.  In summary, it will be a significant recruitment of resources and strengthening of 24-7 monitoring, which we currently have place now and which was not in place previously.  There will be a whole set of increased controls in governance and oversight.  There is one particular recommendation around business resilience or, in our case, service resilience in terms of strengthening capacity to the best extent we can when something like this happens.  However, it always remains a threat, particularly in the current environment.</p></speech>

I would say publicly that this was not a weakness in the attack.  However, the Deputy is correct that it is a factor that gives us an exposure.  There has been an ongoing mutli-year replacement phase on those.  A number of them rely on one of our national integrated medical imaging system, NIMIS, systems.   We have to replace the actual basis system, NIMIS, and then we can get rid of the remaining ones that rely on it, which are interfaces for that level of software.  However, there is a multi-annual ban on it.  It is an exposure.  We have set out a plan to replace it.</p></speech>

In the minute or so that is left to me, of the 73 CAMHS, I have three in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area in the CHO 6 area.  Recruitment has been a perennial problem, particularly for CHO 6 and for the south-eastern part of south Dublin.  I ask Mr. Reid, and he can send in a note on this, on the increase in in-patient public beds and, indeed, the increase in private, in-patient beds for CAMHS and for mental services overall.  I ask not just across the country, but specifically about CHO 6.</p> <p>  I raised the issue of respite yesterday in the D&aacute;il.  In CHO 6, a respite house has been allocated to an individual after legal proceedings.  That has left 88 individuals who rely on that property for respite in the lurch.  That will take some time to replace.

I have raised this with Mr. Reid previously.  We are now at a crisis point.  I will give my home town as an example.  There is not one dentist in Drogheda, which is the largest town in Ireland, available to take medical card patients.  This is happening right across the State.  I understand that there was a meeting last Wednesday, 2 March, but there is a lack of urgency.  This has been going on for over a year now.  In fact, it has been longer than that.  We are at crisis point now.  That meeting was held on 2 March.  There is nothing scheduled again until June.  Where is the sense of urgency in getting this sorted?  It is as if medical card patients do not matter.   It is as if they are irrelevant.  The scheme, as we know, is not fit for purpose.  We see that there has been a reduction in funding for dental services since 2017.</p> <p>  There is a separate issue.  There are more 100,000 children in primary schools across this State who are waiting for their first dental appointments.  At what stage will this complete chaos stop?  It is has just gone beyond what is acceptable.  When will the dental treatment scheme be sorted so that medical card patients and those who are very ill, such as kidney transplant patients, patients with cancer and people with diabetes, apart from everybody else on top of that, cannot access dental appointments.  The same is true for schoolchildren, for whom it is important to have their first dental appointments because seeing a dentist is a preventative measure.  There is utter chaos.  When is it going to be sorted?</p></speech>

Given these schemes are funded by the Department, I ask that Ms McGirr would come back to the committee with an update on them.  The adult dental services scheme for medical card patients has collapsed right across the country.  There is not a dentist in County Laois or, as mentioned by Deputy Munster, in Drogheda who will take on that scheme.  I raised it last week in the D&aacute;il with the Taoiseach.  Other Deputies raised it as well.  There needs to be a sense of urgency about it.  I am concerned in terms of what has just been pointed out by Deputy Munster that the next meeting is not until June.  </p> <p>  Separately, on the school dental scheme, those of us who are over 40 will have been seen by a dentist in second and third class.  My granddaughter will be 16 soon.  Some of the children in her class are 17 and they have not yet been seen under the school dental scheme.  That is widespread across the country.  I ask that Ms McGirr would come back to the committee on the school dental scheme, including where things are at with it and what exactly the problem is.  For example, is the pipeline of training and recruitment the problem?  Oireachtas Members need information.  This has to be fixed.  As I said, the scheme has collapsed and that is not acceptable.  I do not expect the witnesses to have the answers to everything today, but for committee members and Oireachtas Members, I want the witnesses to come to the committee with a detailed note on the matter.</p> <p>  I note Deputy Hourigan wants to come in.</p></speech>

Last August, I made two freedom of information requests for all correspondence relating to Owenacurra between the local senior managers over a defined period of time.  Up to November, I had not received a response to those requests and so I applied for an internal review and was informed over the Christmas recess by the FOI decision-maker, Mr. Hugh Scully, that no records could be found.  My colleague, Liam Quaid in Cork, submitted a similar freedom of information request and he was informed that those records do exist but release of them will incur a &euro;600 administration fee.  I ask Mr. Reid to explain why there might be no email correspondence about such a significant closure between local area managers.</p></speech>

As the witness's feed cut out in the process of the response to my original question, I want to review the answer.  We seem to have decided to close a centre of excellence in terms of Owenacurra, Midleton, a centre that is exemplary of fully-integrated 24-hour high-dependency beds in a local provision setting, which is exactly what we are meant to be aiming towards.  In the period since the closure decision was made, no information has been provided on the building that is relevant to the closure.  The building faces no more or no fewer challenges than most of the other healthcare provision facilities in the area.  We have decided to move most of the 11 residents 30 km down the road into Carrigaline and Glenwood, at a cost of &euro;1.25 million.  We have no planning permission for that building.  </p> <p>  I remind the witnesses that our national policy documents state that we should have in the region of 30 placements in every region.  The area of east Cork had 24 placements in Owenacurra.  It now has zero placements.  By comparison, north Cork, which has almost the same population at 93,000 in 2016, has 42 placements.  I understand there is a waiting list of local service users for those placements.  </p> <p>  It is important to make the point that the HSE has cited a significant conflict of interest in its representations to this committee for this meeting.  It states: "At a very early point, a potential conflict of interest was declared by a senior manager in the CHO mental health service as that person had a family connection to this property."  </p></speech>

To continue reading from the HSE document: "On the service side, and to ensure there was no conflict of interest, all matters in relation to the proposed purchase was dealt with by a different senior manager and the chief officer."  Given the decision to close Owenacurra is absolutely contrary to our national policy and the best interests and wishes of residents, and it seems to be part of a procurement and decision-making process around capital spending, which I have considerable questions about and which we will be continuing to review and follow up through this committee, is it the Department's view that the Department and the Minister have no questions about the decision to close Owenacurra?</p></speech>

The building was deemed unsuitable.  It is in the interests of the residents that they have suitable accommodation.  As I understand it, all the efforts of the HSE have been directed to finding appropriate accommodation for the residents.</p></speech>

A clear audit opinion was given for the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The Loughs Agency, which is a North-South body, was given a clear audit opinion.  The audit given for Children's Health Ireland was qualified on the grounds of the accounting treatment for pensions.  Attention was also drawn to significant non-compliant procurement.  A clear audit opinion was given for An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  For the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, a qualified audit opinion was given in relation to the accounting for pensions.  Attention was also drawn to a potential conflict of roles.  A clear audit opinion was given for Ordnance Survey Ireland.</p></speech>

A number of those North-South bodies tend to have very good audit procedures.  It is good to see that.  They were set up under the Good Friday Agreement.  Can we agree to note the accounts and statements?  Agreed.  As usual, the listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of our minutes.</p> <p>  We do not have too many items of correspondence.  As previously agreed, items that are not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence will be recorded in the minutes of the committee meetings and published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is C, which is correspondence from, and related to, private individuals and any other correspondence.  At last week's meeting, we agreed to hold over No. 1091 C, correspondence from Deputy Dillon dated 21 February, which is a request to the committee to consider scheduling a meeting with Eir.

The request can be made.   That can be done but, certainly, there can be no means of compelling its representatives to attend because it is a private company.  Once upon a time, it was a semi-State but even commercial semi-States are not compelled, although if that was the case, there would be a greater level of expectation that it would attend.  At this stage, however, Eir has been a private company since 1999.  I suggest, to be fair to Deputy Dillon, that we put it off until the next meeting of the committee and we deal with it then, finally, one way or the other.  I do not want to defer it any longer.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is the work programme.  Next week is a non-sitting week due to L&aacute; le P&aacute;draig.  The week after that, on 24 March, we will engage with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  As usual, if there are any particular matters of interest to members that they would like to receive a briefing on in advance of the meeting, please let the clerk know.</p> <p>  On 31 March, we will commence a series of justice-related meetings for which the following engagements have been confirmed: An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 March, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission for the morning of 7 April and the Policing Authority for the afternoon of 7 April.  There are then two non-sitting weeks scheduled for Easter, which means that the next meeting after Easter will be on 28 April.  That will be with the Department of Justice - there are a good few justice-related issues coming up - and will examine the appropriation account of the Department and the Irish Prison Service.  That is the last confirmed meeting.</p> <p>  We previously agreed that we will engage with the University of Limerick, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform after the meeting with the Department of Justice, but these meetings have not yet been scheduled.  On matters in the public domain regarding the Department of Health and the HSE, we previously agreed that we would examine any prior year's adjustment to the HSE&rsquo;s accounts once the Comptroller and Auditor General has audited the HSE&rsquo;s 2021 financial statements and they are laid before the House.  The committee did that for a good reason.  Some of the stuff in the media did not reflect that or the intentions of the committee.  The committee's intentions were not represented and, to some extent, were misrepresented.</p> <p>  In respect of other issues we have identified from reports in the public domain concerning the Department of Health and the HSE, we have yet to decide whether to address them as part of our engagement on the HSE&rsquo;s 2021 financial statements or to hold a separate hearing before the summer.  The next available date is 5 May.  We could look to schedule the University of Limerick, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance in May as well.  I will open it to members, including Deputies Dillon, Carthy or anybody else who wants to come in on that.  What order do members wish to take those meetings in?  Does anybody have any views on that?  Okay.  The next available date is 5 May.  We could schedule a prior hearing with the HSE and the Department of Health for that date, if it is the wish of the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We then have the University of Limerick and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance in May as well.  I will request the secretariat try to schedule those meetings.</p><p>Obviously, it will depend on their availability as well.  We had quite a strong engagement with the HSE and the Department of Health this morning so we will check that.</p><p> For the month of May, we will have the HSE and the Department of Health on the same day.  We will try to schedule a meeting with the University of Limerick because there are a number of issues relating to it that we want to examine.  We can try to schedule meetings with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance.  We will leave that with the secretariat and ask it to get dates that are suitable for all involved and that fit in with our work programme.</p><p> Are there any other matters members wish to raise regarding the work programme?  If not, that concludes our consideration of the work programme for today.</p><p> The final item is any other business.  Do any members wish to raise any other matters?  No.  The committee will now go into private session before adjourning until 24 March 2022, when it will engage with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland regarding its 2020 financial statements.</p></speech>

In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  This meeting has been convened to consider the Patient Safety (Notifiable Safety Incidents) Bill 2019.  I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, to the meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-10a.540" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2022031000002#A00300"><p>I thank committee members for the opportunity to present the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 on Committee Stage.  The Bill is extremely important and it will change the culture in our health services in a very positive way.  I acknowledge the broad support the Bill received on First and Second Stages.</p> <p>  When things go wrong, patients and their families expect at least three things.  They expect to be told honestly what has happened, what can be done to deal with any harm that has been caused and what will be done to prevent a recurrence of such harm to anybody else.</p> <p>  In every health service the world over things will, of course, occasionally go wrong, and what matters when they do go wrong, when mistakes and errors occur, is how the health service responds and deals with these situations.  Much has been done to advance open disclosure in our health service.  The HSE introduced a national open disclosure policy in 2013, and there are many examples of open disclosure occurring as it should in our health service.  Unfortunately, it does not always happen.  All of us here today are aware of these tragic cases.  This Bill provides for mandatory open disclosure of serious patient safety incidents.  It provides for the notification of those reportable incidents to the relevant regulator and extends the remit of HIQA to private hospitals.  It also contains provisions supporting clinical audit in the health service.  This Bill will lead to a safer, better health service by placing patients and their needs front and centre.</p> <p>  As my colleagues are aware, the Government approved this Bill in December 2019, subject to certain amendments, and it passed First and Second Stages in the D&aacute;il on 12 December 2019.  It was due to proceed to Committee Stage in early 2020 but events overtook us with the arrival of Covid-19.  I would like to outline a number of amendments, some of which were part of the Government decision when the Bill was approved in December 2019.  I will first seek to clarify the amendment to section 9 of the Health Act 2007, which will strengthen the ministerial powers to request an investigation by HIQA into ongoing patient safety risk in Ireland&rsquo;s health and social services.</p> <p>  I am also proposing an amendment to section 12 of the Bill, which addresses openness and transparency.  As previously drafted, section 12 set out that both health service providers and health practitioners, when making an open disclosure under this Bill, must provide all relevant information to the patient or their relevant person.  Where appropriate, they must also inform other health services of a notifiable incident.  I have now added further draft provisions to section 12 that expand the impact of this section and ensure these provisions are enshrined in the relevant policies set by the HSE and national standards set by HIQA.  It also ensures they are enshrined in the codes of professional conduct or practice set by the relevant regulatory authorities.</p> <p>  Schedule 2 to the Bill contains a list of amendments to the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017.  These amendments are purely technical.  They aim to align the two pieces of legislation with specific reference to the organisation of the open disclosure meeting, the provision of information to the patient and their family, and the procedure to follow should a patient not wish to participate in an open disclosure meeting.  These amendments do not introduce any new substantive provisions to either Bill.</p> <p>  These three amendments are given effect in a number of sections throughout the Bill and I will outline the detail of the amendments as they arise.</p><p> I wish to flag two amendments I will be introducing on Report Stage.  First, I propose to give the HIQA chief inspector of social services a discretionary power to carry out a review of certain serious patient safety incidents that occur during the provision of healthcare where some or all of the care of the patient is carried out in a nursing home.  This proposed amendment will seek to support patients and their families when something goes wrong with the clinical care they received in a nursing home.  It will ensure appropriate external processes are in place to review serious patient safety incidents.  The amendment follows the report of the Covid-19 nursing home expert panel recommendations that call for suitable structures to be put in place for external oversight of individual care concerns arising in nursing homes.  This power will not replace the responsibility of nursing homes to address concerns that are raised by patients and families.  It will put in place an appropriate escalation pathway to ensure these concerns are addressed in a way that will provide answers to families and patients.</p><p> Second, the overarching intention of the Bill is to embed and support a culture of open disclosure.  It is fair to say that many aspects of the Bill have been informed by the learnings from CervicalCheck, particularly the need to ensure accountability by service providers and clinicians in carrying out open disclosure to patients and families.  I, together with my Department and the national screening services, have given a significant amount of consideration to these learnings and the work of the expert reference group on interval cancers.  These expert reports were commissioned as part of the Scally review in 2018.  They set out a new and comprehensive approach to reviews of interval cancers in people who have been screened by the breast, bowel and cervical cancer screening programmes.  I intend to introduce a notifiable incident directly relating to cancer screening services.  These measures are currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.  I will introduce this amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I certainly will be supporting the speedy passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  All present know its importance.  There are many related issues with which we also need to deal, including safeguarding legislation, which I hope the Minister will be in a position to bring forward this year.  There are issues relating to the rights of social care teams and safeguarding teams to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect.  There are issues of accountability at management level when there are failures.  Such failures have been highlighted time and again.  All of these issues are related to what we are trying to achieve in the Bill.  I welcome this element of it.  Mandatory reporting is important.  I wish to put on record that my thoughts are with Vicky Phelan, R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy and many other men and women who were victims of a lack of mandatory reporting and mandatory disclosure.  In my view, we are here today to improve systems for them.</p><p>The Minister made a point in his opening statement that is relevant to the amendment I am proposing to the Bill.  He stated the Bill should ensure safer and better health services for patients.  Of course, I hope that is what the Bill will do.  Any improvement in that direction is welcome.  The patients, however, will be the judges of whether it does what it needs to do, whether the Bill, once implemented and operational, will make health services safer and more fit for purpose and, as the Minister stated, engender a new culture of reporting within the health service.  All present hope that is what will happen.</p><p>The amendment seeks to establish a patient council.  The reason for that is obvious.  Patient advocates and patients themselves should have a voice in respect of the supervision of the Bill when enacted.  It calls for, at minimum, a report to be published each year by the patient council.  Obviously, it will meet as often as it deems necessary to review the operation of the legislation, but also to make recommendations.  As the Minister stated on Second Stage, the notifiable incidents under Schedule 1 may well be changed.  The Minister has the power to do so as time progresses.  If there are other incidents that need to be included in that Schedule, that can be done.  Surely, however, patients should have a voice in that process as well.</p><p>I tabled the amendment in good faith.  I know many patient advocates and patients who have been through a very difficult time.  It pains me to say it but there is a significant amount of distrust in the system simply because many people quite rightly believe there is not just a lack of a culture of open disclosure but also a lack of a culture of accountability within the health services at a senior management level.  I am not pointing a finger at any individual; it is a culture issue.  One just has to look at all the scandals there have been.  I will not go through them all.  We know the full range of scandals involving patients being let down and becoming victims of a failed process.  Establishing this council would be a very important message to send in the context of giving them a sense that they will be part of this process and journey.</p><p>I will leave it there.  In the spirit of getting through all the amendments, it is important that I do not labour the point.  I have made the argument for the amendment and I ask the Minister to consider accepting it.</p></speech>

I agree with the intention of the amendment and everything he has just said.  I will not be accepting the amendment because there is an independent patient safety council in existence.  The council provides advice and guidance to the Minister for Health on a broad range of perspectives on the development of patient safety policy.  It was appointed by the then Minister in 2019 and held its first meeting on 27 February 2020.  By engaging a broad range of perspectives in patient safety policy, including those of the patient and the service in question, the work of the council leads to enhanced policymaking.  The council members bring a wide variety of expertise and experience, which is important, including citizens, education, patient safety, health policy, healthcare leadership and more.</p><p>The council is chaired by Ms Noeline Blackwell who we are all very aware of.  She is a person of excellent standing and CEO of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  To the Deputy's point, the council obviously needs to meet and does so two to three times a year.  It also agrees on an annual work programme.  As part of the 2020 programme, the council was asked by the then Minister to carry out some work in the area of open disclosure.  Last year, it provided me with recommendations on a national policy framework for open disclosure in healthcare in Ireland.  I would be very happy to share that report with the committee.  I will check if it has been published, but I certainly see no reason why we should not provide it.  This framework is very much to assist organisations and clinicians to apply the principles of open disclosure and to communicate with patients where healthcare does not go to plan.  The framework is now being drafted and it will sit along this legislation to give guidance to healthcare organisations.</p><p> In short, I agree with the Deputy's points.  We have quite a robust council in place under an excellent chair that is already looking at open disclosure.  I propose, because I agree with everything the Deputy said, that the committee or I could write to the Independent Patient Safety Council and ask it in whatever the appropriate period is, possibly a year after operation, to do a review and report back to the Oireachtas and me with its findings.  Would that work?  </p></speech>

I do not see why.  I cannot see how the amendment would have incurred a cost to the Exchequer to the point that it was ruled out of order but that is not for the Minister and I to have a discussion on.</p> <p>  I will speak very briefly to this point in the section and on what I was seeking to do, which is that any individual who is employed by the health services should be mandated to report incidents under Schedule 1.  If it is left to only some clinicians and not others, the difficulty is some of them may not report.  There are robust procedures and processes for failure to report but it is possible some incidents may not be captured in instances and situations where others working in or around an individual who is mandated to report are also aware of a notifiable incident, which should be reported by that individual.  It is very important we get this right and that any individual who has a sense that something is wrong and works in the healthcare service should be mandated to come forward.</p> <p>  I have spoken to a number of advocate groups on this matter and we do not want a situation where there is over-reporting.  I appreciate there is a balance to be struck but, at the same time, we can put safeguards in place to protect the rights of healthcare staff who may well come forward, which is why the amendment allows for people to report an incident to HIQA, for example, as an alternative and added protection.  Nobody should have any fear about coming forward in respect of his or her job or standing in the health services.  We are doing this because it is about patient safety and it is the right thing to do.  Incidents should be reported and followed by fair processes to investigate any notifiable incidents or complaints made under the mandatory reporting process.  Anyone in the health service needs to be properly protected when he or she comes forward.</p> <p>  The point I am making is what I was seeking to make in the amendment.  As that has been ruled out of order, I can only speak to it in the section, namely, that we should broaden the scope of who should be making reports and who should be mandated to make reports.  It should be all those who work in healthcare settings.</p></speech>

That is very important because we know how difficult it can be for some family members to work through all of this.  For someone who has no experience of advocacy or of how to navigate through what can be the maze of the HSE, the system, reporting systems and so on, the role of a patient advocate, as the Minister knows, is very important.  With this amendment we seek to place an obligation on the provider to ensure that it is mandated to provide information to a patient on how to engage the services of a patient advocate, rather than simply leaving it to a patient to have to try to find all of this out, sometimes by having to employ the services of legal representatives and incurring more costs.  It is to aid patients in accessing a patient advocate and placing an obligation on the provider to do everything possible to enable that to happen.  </p></speech>

The good news is we now have a patient advocacy service that is growing.  The Patient Advocacy Service, PAS, was set up to provide exactly what the Deputy is, quite rightly, calling for, which is free and independent advocacy for users in the acute system who intend to make a formal complaint regarding the care they receive.  The complaints come through the HSE's Your Service, Your Say process.  PAS is also there to help those who have been involved in a patient safety incident, which is obviously the topic of the legislation before us.  It was established for public acute hospital users.  However, since June of last year, we have extended that to HSE-operated nursing homes as well.</p> <p>  Since its establishment, the service commenced operations nationally.  There are hubs in centres with the highest activity, namely, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, the midlands and Galway.  The service goes to all locations to meet patients and service users as required.  Currently, 20 staff are employed by PAS and recruitment is ongoing.  Last year, it received 1,200 new contacts so it is doing an awful lot of work.  That is required advocacy arising from more than 3,300 separate complaints.  PAS is there, it is very active and it is working around the country.</p> <p>  While I will not accept the amendment, since we already have the service in place, I am happy to commit to asking my officials to engage directly with the HSE to make sure there is a very wide understanding that PAS is there, that it is free and that it is very responsive.  I agree entirely that there are many cases where patients need advocates.  PAS provides that expert advocacy service.</p> <p>  Section 7 is a very important section.  It establishes the obligation of mandatory open disclosure.  While amendment No. 4 has been ruled out of order, I will address some of the issues through discussion of the section.  The view is that it is very important a clear responsibility and accountability is placed on the service provider and the most relevant senior clinician.  That is what this is about.</p><p>The Deputy referred to protected disclosure.  He is correct.  Those protections are afforded under different legislation, namely, the Health Act 2004 which was amended in 2007.  The protections for people coming forward are very important and real but covered under separate legislation.  I looked at what other countries do.  We cannot find any other country where there is an obligation on everybody.  There is a concern where there could be someone in a hospital ward, for instance, with no clinical training or not the right level of clinical training who might see something that they are not really qualified to know whether it was a serious incident or whether should it have happened.  It might be that it is part of normal care or maybe it is not but it could create anxiety for them that they feel legally obliged to report all of these.  That is why Ireland and other countries keep it to the organisation.   This would introduce an offence with serious penalties.  The legislation lays out who the lead person is and there is back-up for the next person if that person is not available.  That is how the section is structured.  That is the right way to go rather than putting an obligation on everybody.</p></speech>

First, the patient advocacy service is very good but it is under-staffed.  I hope the Minister will move quickly to recruit additional staff.  The Minister also made the point that it does not work in private nursing homes.  Given the extent to which the State depends on private nursing homes and that they are largely funded by State money, is there an intention to extend the remit of the patient advocacy service to private nursing homes?</p> <p>  There is a wider point on the section relating to clinical accountability.  Separate to this, there is a recommendation in the context of the regionalisation of the HSE to introduce legally binding clinical accountability where there would be regular reviews.  The Minister referred to what happens in other countries.  I remember Professor Tom Keane talking about this in relation to his own role in Canada, for example, where at the end of each year there was a kind of performance assessment which he and all other consultants had to undergo.  Is it intended work will start on that proposed legislation, which would be part of a piece with this legislation, to ensure it is not only when there are adverse events but that clinical assessment would be carried out on an ongoing basis by the hospital concerned?</p></speech>

First on the patient advocacy service, yes, it is a service that is available.  As Deputy Shortall rightly said, it is under-resourced.  It does not apply to private nursing homes.  I accept the Minister's bona fides that he will engage with the patient advocacy service in the context of the passage of this Bill and will look at resourcing and staffing issues, but I will press the amendment.  However, I will not call for a vote on any of the amendments because I want the Bill to pass as quickly as possible for the obvious reasons.</p> <p>  Returning to the broader point around the section, the Minister spoke on who would be obliged or mandated to make a report.  I accept much of the logic of his response.  That is why I said we have to be careful.  There has to be a balanced approach.  I tabled an amendment and I am pleased the Minister has looked at the matter to see how it operates internationally.  However, we must also be honest.  I do not want to prejudge reviews, processes and audits which are now in place around CAMHS in Kerry.  However, some of the senior officials were before the committee some weeks ago.  There was a failure in clinical supervision at the very top.  It is accepted by the HSE.  There were failures at management level and at very senior clinician level.  I understand that in CAMHS in Cork it was a social worker who made disclosures, not because she was mandated to do it but because she felt it was the right thing to do.  I just have a fear here.</p> <p>  While there is some logic in what the Minister said and you do not want to create the anxiety that he spoke about where everybody feels they have to report everything, that is not what the Bill does.  Schedule 1 sets out very clearly what is a notifiable incident.  Clearly any mandated report has to be under that Schedule by using this Act.  We can improve in this area.  This goes back to where I sought a separate patient council that would look at the operation of this Bill given its sheer importance that this is something that as part of that review process would be looked at.  I hope it is not the case, but I fear that we could end up, after the passage of this Bill, in one, two or three years' time, where we have had a number of incidents where those senior clinicians or relevant senior clinicians the Minister spoke about may not have reported what should have been reported.  Then there will be a failure in that area.  Yes, there are processes to deal with that but there may be other staff members in and around that clinician who were aware of incidents but were not mandated to report them.  We will then ask why not?   We will find the reason they were not making the reports is that they were not mandated to do so.  If that is the case, then the Act will have to be amended.</p> <p>  I very much hope this Bill will work and that we do not have those kinds of situations but the possibility of those arising is very real.  We can look at examples of failures at management and senior clinician level.  It very rarely happens.  We have excellent staff in our health service.  The senior clinicians are really good at what they do and it is very rare that we have these kinds of failures.  However, they occur and when they do and there are failures on the part of a senior clinician, there should be responsibility on the others to come forward.  My amendment might not have been the best way to do it and maybe there is a happy medium or a balance between what I was proposing and what is in the Bill.  For the purpose of moving this debate on, I will leave it at that.  I welcome the Minister's response but I fear it is an issue that we may have to return to in the future.  I hope that is not the case.</p></speech>

Yes, we will.  We want to extend it to nursing homes for all the obvious reasons.  A tendering process is now under way.  On the need for a bigger service, yes, we are expanding the service with more funding and staff and a wider remit.  I fully agree.</p> <p>  There is much overlap in the points made by Deputies Cullinane and Shortall on the really important question of clinical accountability.  I will try to decouple them slightly.  When I was discussing the Bill with Department officials, we were teasing out some of these points.  It was put to me that they are linked.  We are trying to strike a very delicate balance between fostering a culture of openness, which is what this Bill is all about - it is all about mandatory open disclosure  - and a culture where people are afraid, whether they should or should not be, to disclose because of what might happen to them.  The advice we have from looking around the world at systems that do this better than we do is to try to keep them separate insofar as possible.  For example, this Bill rightly contains requirements around apologies.  However, they cannot be used as part of court cases or admissions of liability.  My understanding is that Canada, for example, had a similar system.  We are trying to strike a really delicate balance.  First, we are telling people that under the 2004 Act they have protections if they want to come forward under protected disclosures.</p><p>Second, there are clear guidelines in place regarding mandatory open disclosure.  Now this Bill adds another serious layer to that.  It states it is a legal requirement and it is an offence if one does not do what one is meant to do in terms of mandatory open disclosure.  At the same time, to refer to the points of both Deputies, which I fully agree with, there has to be accountability.  There has to be clinical accountability and there has to be managerial accountability.  We can refer to numerous examples, including south Kerry.  We are trying to find a very fine line, or trying to walk the right balance, and get this balance right.  This Bill is about the mandatory open disclosure part, not the accountability part.</p><p> However, we are proceeding with the regional health areas, RHAs, for many reasons.  I was in Galway last week looking at the emergency departments and various other services.  The case for the regional health areas from a patient service perspective is clear as day.  We have many patients with delayed transfer of care and delayed discharge.  Patients in emergency departments need those beds, yet there are separate organisations running the hospitals and running the community side of things.  Obviously, it should all be the one organisation.  The RHAs are very important from a continuity of patient care perspective.  It is also through the RHAs that we will put the systems of accountability in place at the clinical level and at the managerial level.  That work is ongoing.  Not only is the work ongoing, I have also appointed an advisory group to me on the implementation of that.  This is one of the areas on which that group will be providing feedback to me, to make sure that we get the right balance and that we have accountability, which we must have, but it does not come at the cost of creating a culture where people are afraid to step forward and admit when things have gone wrong.</p></speech>

That is the contradiction that has to be addressed.  There has to be a system whereby the person is encouraged to come forward and that everybody else agrees as well.  If a decision is made and people think they will all be in trouble if it is disclosed, to my mind the answer is that they will all be in trouble if it is not disclosed.  We have to find the right level at which to intervene and the right level of incentives to ensure that the purpose of the Bill is served.  The culture is not going to change overnight and we could be here six months hence, a year hence and five years hence.  The Bill is as good as it operates and works and identifies the issues as they come along and are dealt with.  Some issues have been dealt with in various institutions over the past six months, but some issues have spectacularly not been dealt with.  I believe we have to get an equilibrium as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I realise we are talking about accountability in respect of mandatory open disclosure, but I will outline my experience of the HSE.  When the Minister was in the Opposition and on this committee, he had to deal with a lot of scandals and crises in health.  Many people who have come before this committee have had to testify to failures at management level, clinical governance management, standards, quality care and so forth.  There is a sense that nobody is held to account at management level.  We have reviews and processes, but at the end of it people do not see that there has been accountability at senior management level.  Obviously, we will have separate conversations on the wider areas in that regard when the Minister comes forward with his plans for regional health areas.  We have all sorts of concerns in that regard as well, to which we will return.  Everybody on the committee wants that to be right.  However, to get accountability right, there must be accountability at senior level at the core of an organisation.  If there are very senior clinical failures, nobody is ever held to account that I can see.  I will not attempt to talk the Minister through all the incidents.  I referenced some of the most recent ones but we could go back over many years.</p> <p>  Can the Minister talk through - people will want to hear this to better understand from the Minister's perspective how this is going to work - what the sanction is if a senior relevant clinician does not report something that the authorities then deem should have been reported and there was an obligation on the clinician to report it?  Separate from that, the Minister might take the opportunity to talk about his view on accountability at management level.  When I deal with organisations such as the Irish Association of Social Workers, Safeguarding Ireland and others, the one issue they continually come back to is that if one does not deal with cultural problems where there is a lack of accountability at senior level in the HSE, we will have these incidents happening repeatedly.  I know that it is a tricky area and I appreciate it is not an easy area to resolve, but it is one we have to start addressing.  We can start to do it in this Bill, certainly when it relates to mandatory open disclosure.  Can the Minister outline exactly what the sanctions would be for somebody who fails to report and who should have reported?</p></speech>

In this Bill there is clear accountability for not disclosing.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  If somebody is deemed to have not complied with the mandatory open disclosure requirements for the serious patient events as laid out in the Bill, which can be added to by regulation, the person will have committed an offence.  We are jumping ahead as it is section 49, but if the Chairman wishes, I am happy to speak to that now.</p></speech>

A health service provider which fails to comply with the obligations to make an open disclosure of a notifiable patient safety incident without reasonable excuse shall be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.  A health service provider that fails to comply with the obligation to report a notifiable patient safety incident externally to the appropriate body will be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.  A summary offence is one which can only be dealt with by a judge sitting without a jury, that is, in the District Court.  Under the Fines Act 2010, since January 2011 there are five categories or classes of maximum fine applying to summary convictions.  If somebody is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine, the fine is up to a maximum of &euro;5,000.  The health service provider must in its defence make all reasonable efforts to ensure compliance with the relevant provisions.</p></speech>

Deputy Cullinane referred earlier to our experience in this committee with the south Kerry CAMHS issue.  At that meeting, we were trying to get to the point where we could identify who was in charge and who was responsible.  It was impossible to do that because there was no clear chain of command at all.  There were various different management bodies.  There was the administrative one within the CHO, but then each of the different disciplines have their own management structure and they report up through that, whether it is physiotherapy, public health nurses or whatever.  The RHAs will assist in devolving power and responsibility down through the service.</p><p>The existing management structure is completely dysfunctional even within each of the CHOs.  The Minister made the point about having a single budget and that it makes sense as it means we do not have delayed discharges because there is no money for home care.  All of that is very important but equally important is having a clear chain of command and a management structure so that when something does go wrong, the buck stops with identifiable people.  When the Minister quotes section 49, he refers to how a health service provider that may have committed an offence can end up being fined and so on but what is a health service provider?  The HSE is a health service provider but there is no point in fining the HSE.  It must be tied into legal accountability for named posts within the management structure.  This is what concerns me.  I have made this point a few times when problems have arisen within the HSE.  You get the sense that everybody is responsible and yet nobody is responsible.  I think the term "health service provider" is a very wide and ambiguous one.  It does not fill me with confidence that there will be a way of identifying whether that the buck stops with "X" be that at a clinical or administrative level.  This is what we need to do.  If people are employed on very high salaries, responsibility must come with that.  This is the only way.  There must be consequences for individuals concerned when the job is not done properly or responsibly.  The fact that it is still quite loose concerns me.</p></speech>

It could be an individual hospital, for example.  While I understand the points being made, I think they are probably beyond the scope of this legislation.  This legislation is around trying to instil in law an obligation for mandatory open disclosure.  It is one that will be taken very seriously by the healthcare providers and clinicians.  What it is doing is backing up.  It is another layer of defence because the HSE mandatory disclosure guidelines are already in place and are taken seriously.</p> <p>  There is a broader conversation into which we have very understandably moved around accountability generally.  As I said earlier, the process by which that needs to happen, and I agree with the Deputies that it needs to happen, is through the regional health areas because we will be creating the one organisation in each region that is responsible for end-to-end patient care.  I go to Galway, meet the nurses, doctors and managers and look at a situation that is not acceptable for patients or our healthcare workers.  I am meeting some emergency medicine nurses shortly and I know the committee has been engaged in the same thing.  As Deputy Shortall rightly said, the CHO has some responsibility in terms of stopping people from going into hospital in the first place and the GP network has some responsibility in terms of out-of-hours GP cover.  Some community hospital care that is under the CHO has responsibility to ensure beds are available.  The hospital group has a responsibility to make sure there is correct load balancing and so forth across the different hospitals.  The individual hospital is responsible for patients coming in the door but it is reliant on the CHO and nursing homes to a large extent to make sure patients can be discharged.  There is no single organisation that I and the committee can meet to ask what the head of organisation is doing and what its executive team is doing to sort this out.  I agree with Deputy Shortall but it is well beyond the scope of this legislation.  However, I would be very happy to discuss it with the committee on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

Deputy Shortall spent much time at that meeting with Kerry CAMHS trying to work through the maze of the different management layers to find out who was accountable for what.  Her presentation of the responses we got back is accurate.  It was impossible for us to work out who was responsible.  It seems everybody was and nobody was, as has been said.</p> <p>  As it is not relevant to the scope of this Bill, it might be useful if the Minister could give a commitment that some time over the next number of months, he will come back to this committee regarding the regional health areas, specifically the area of accountability and the changes that might come about.  We all had concerns.  I know the Minister rejected some of the concerns we expressed when the two senior officials in the Department and the HSE appeared before us concerning regionalisation.  I have concerns about that process, as have other members, but accountability is critical to it.</p> <p>  Integration of healthcare is critical but accountability is also critical.  It speaks to one of the areas of this Bill.  It is one area of it with regard to mandatory reporting but accountability is much bigger than that and it is a much broader debate that we should have.  I ask that we put it on our work schedule.  If the Minister is prepared to come in and discuss regional health authorities, accountability and the changes that can and should be made to improve accountability, it would be a really useful and constructive session of the committee.  I am pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

These additional provisions intend to expand the impact of sections 12(1) and (2) under openness and transparency in the Bill by ensuring these provisions are enshrined in the relevant polices, national standards and codes of professional conduct or practice set by the relevant organisations.

It will change the definition of &quot;incident management system&quot;.  HIQA has flagged with us, and I am sure also with the Minister, that it has concerns about the national incident management system, NIMS.  We may well have to change the system, and I believe we will.  The amendments will mean that, if that is the case, we will not need to amend the Act.  Rather, it will be able to be done by way of a regulation brought in by the Minister, as opposed to an amendment to the Act itself.  It is better from the point of view of the legislative process to give the Minister that flexibility in order that if there is a change in the type of management system that is in place and if NIMS is to be changed or replaced, the logic of this group of amendments will mean that can be done by way of regulation, rather than require an amendment of the Act, which would not be a good use of our time.</p></speech>

There are a few issues to consider, one of which relates to how the current system is going.  The reports that have come back are good.  The Deputy rightly referenced the HIQA review of May of last year.  It examined the information management practices for NIMS throughout the HSE.  It recommended improvements in the system, as the Deputy highlighted, and the review acknowledged the importance specifically of the NIMS.  The review states:</p> <blockquote> 	  	Incident management plays a vital role in patient safety surveillance and learning.  NIMS, as the system underpinning incident management across the public health and social care system in Ireland is therefore an extremely important national health data collection. This review recognises the progress made by the HSE in its efforts to embed NIMS as the single designated national information system for incident management, patient safety, and learning across the HSE and HSE-funded services. HIQA also acknowledges the examples of good information management practices highlighted throughout this review, particularly in relation to information governance and use of information.  </blockquote> <p>The Deputy quite rightly pointed out that there is more to be done.  HIQA carried out a very good report on NIMS last year and the HSE is looking to expand it.  My concern with the amendments, which is why I cannot accept them even though I fully appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s intent, is that they could undermine the prospect of us having an all-encompassing national system to be used throughout the country.  It is important that the entire HSE and all the publicly funded services use the same system.  There is a concern that one unintended consequence of the amendments is that they would give service providers freedom to say they will use something else.  I appreciate that is absolutely not what the Deputy intends, but it is a concern.  One of the main challenges we have, as has been discussed by all of us at previous committee meetings, relates to the importance of having a single integrated national data management system, rather than the multiplicity of systems we are currently using throughout the health service.</p><p>Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments, although I fully appreciate the intent of them.  It is essential to ensure there is no room for individual providers to decide they will adopt a new system, in order that everyone will use the same one.</p></speech>

I thank him for pointing them out and thank his officials for having studied the amendments.  More broadly, NIMS is very important and will continue to be important once the Bill passes and becomes operational.  The Minister mentioned the HIQA report of last year.  In constructing the Bill and taking account of the issues I have flagged by way of these amendments, has he or any of his officials engaged with HIQA specifically on its views regarding NIMS?</p><p>I understand it has concerns.  Whether those concerns can be addressed through changes in how NIMS operates may be the issue of debate.  If that is the case, that is fine.</p><p> This amendment provides for a time when a different system may be put in place.  I may be wrong but my understanding is that HIQA would have a view on that matter.  I will not speak for HIQA as it is important it speak for itself.  Has the Minister or his officials engaged with it?  If so, what changes are we looking at with regard to NIMS?  What changes will be made to address the concerns raised by HIQA?  If those concerns are being addressed, perhaps the amendment is not relevant.  Will the Minister outline what proposed changes arise from discussions he has had with HIQA and when they will be made?</p></speech>

It will reconvene later this week to conclude the work.  I will ask the Department to send a note to the committee on the status of that work.  The short answer is that HIQA has basically said this is the right way to go but changes are needed.  A multi-stakeholder group will meet to ensure that happens.  I will ask the Department to provide a technical note to the committee to that effect.</p></speech>

However, this is more about the Minister's acceptance that HIQA has flagged concerns relating to NIMS.  The other stakeholders on the multi-stakeholder group may also have concerns.  It would be useful for the committee to get a note on what, if any, concerns the group has.  I understand it has concerns. The issue then is what action will be taken to address those concerns.  It might be more useful to get that clarification from the stakeholder group.  We could then get a follow-up letter from the Minister outlining what action may or may not be taken arising from the concerns expressed by the group.</p></speech>

I understand the standard practice across HIQA for notifying incidents is already three days as opposed to seven days.  Given the urgency of this, perhaps the Minister will agree that the quicker the notification, the better.  Will he explain why the Bill provides for seven days rather than a shorter period?  We are seeking to bring in a level of consistency with what already happens and which I believe is standard practice across HIQA and the Mental Health Commission.  The amendments seek to reduce the time within which a provider must notify HIQA or the Mental Health Commission of a notifiable incident from seven to three days.</p></speech>

The providers must comply with some serious obligations.  There was extensive discussion with health service providers on this matter.  The issues raised included staffing over weekends, people being off, shift work and so on.  In order that all those who need to make an input can do so and all the information needed for compliance can be gathered, seven days was deemed to be the right balance.  It will still be done very quickly while taking account of working patterns.</p></speech>

Many patient advocates have their own views about the council, which include the view that it does not work.  I will park that for one second.  This is an area that should also be kept under review.  When we agreed mechanisms and a review of the operation of the Act, we agreed that the Independent Patient Safety Council would do a report at the end of the year or perhaps 12 months after the passing of this legislation.  We cannot force it do so but we can certainly ask it to do a report.  I assume it would do so and would also look the number of days.  If it believed it necessary to reduce the period of seven days, that could be considered.  If the Minister is happy to include that in the letter he is sending to the Independent Patient Safety Council, I will be happy to withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

I am introducing an amendment to section 9 of the Health Act 2007 to clarify and strengthen the powers to direct an investigation into Ireland's health and social services by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  Section 9 of the Health Act 2007 gives the Minister for Health and Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth the power to direct HIQA to undertake a statutory investigation to address serious ongoing risks to patient safety in Ireland's health and social services.</p><p>In the National Maternity Hospital <i>v</i>. the Minister for Health in September 2018, the court quashed a decision by the then Minister for Health to direct HIQA to carry out a section 9 investigation into a maternal death that had occurred at the hospital.  The central difficulty in this case addressed in the judgment and by counsel throughout was the very high bar set by section 9 of the Health Act for ordering such an investigation under this section.  It is clear from the judgment and from legal advices received that the current discretion for the ordering of an investigation under section 9 is extremely limited and impractical in terms of allowing for an appropriate response to ongoing risk to patient safety within our health and social services.</p><p>The proposed amendments to section 9 of the Health Act 2007 will ensure that when directing an investigation into Ireland's health and social services, the Ministers and-or HIQA must believe on reasonable grounds that there may be serious risk to the health or welfare of people receiving services that will be the subject of investigation.  This replaces the previous requirement for a belief there is a serious risk.</p><p>Second, there may be a section 9 investigation into a specific service, notwithstanding that a similar risk may exist in another service.  Third, the purpose of the investigation will include a public interest element where a need for learning and improvement of services will form part of the rationale for requiring an investigation under section 9.  The provisions are repeated for both the Minister for Health and Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  References in the Bill are to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and these will subsequently be updated with the new title.</p></speech>

We had two very stark examples in the recent past of reports being produced on poor practice, let us say.  The reports, namely, the Grace report and Brandon report, have not been published.  People are still waiting for those.  We were told both of those reports could not be published because they were being referred on to the Garda.  They were referred and then the recommendation was that no action would be taken.  I think in one case, the recommendation was from the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p> <p>  What would change that in terms of what the Minister is proposing in these amendments?  Does he see grounds for not publishing a report in any circumstances where there have been adverse incidents or particular scandals?  We are trying to get our hands on those reports and it is very hard to understand why neither of those have been published to date.  What is the Minister's view on that?  Will these amendments allow for those reports to be published?</p></speech>

We should always err on the side of transparency.  Obviously, we must protect individuals.  Many of these reports are very sensitive but that can be done largely through redaction and anonymisation.  I am not comfortable with important reports that have a public interest not being published as soon as possible.</p> <p>  These amendments help and would speak to any section 9 HIQA report.  I am very happy to provide the committee with a note as to exactly which reports they would be.  These amendments move some way in the direction the Deputy outlined in that they strengthen HIQA's ability to do exactly what she referenced in terms of the reports.  I will need to check on the two very specific reports the Deputy referenced.  If she bears with me, I will check if those specific reports would be covered.  If it is okay with the Deputy and Chairman, I will ask the Department to furnish a more detailed note to the committee on exactly the scope of the reports that would and would not be covered.</p></speech>

As the Minister will be aware, some incidents might not be a priority for the Garda or other bodies.  Obviously, not all incidents are referred on to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  HIQA is the expert and regulatory body in the context of these incidents and it should be the body that is able to prosecute offences under the Act.</p><p> The amendment also provides for the Minister to prescribe a body, whether that is HIQA or another body, to prosecute under various sections of the Act as may be appropriate and, where such an alternative body is not prescribed, to ensure it falls by default to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that where incidents are not reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it does not fall to it to prosecute, it appropriately falls to HIQA or another body as prescribed by the Minister to do so under the Act.  That would be an appropriate way to deal with these issues.  I will be pressing the amendment.  Obviously, I am interested to hear the response of the Minister.</p></speech>

I do not intend to accept it, not because I disagree with much of what the Deputy has said but because I carefully considered this and the advice I have is that the specific provision is not required in the Bill to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prosecute the offences under the Act.  Regulators such as HIQA, the chief inspector and the Mental Health Commission all have distinct roles and responsibilities, as the Deputy outlined, in terms of regulating health and social services and they already have functions set out in the Bill.  It is important there is clarity in respect of the functions and respective roles of the regulators.  It is particularly relevant in this context as no one regulator covers all of the health and social service providers that are subject to the Bill.  Prosecution of these types of offences would represent a significant increase and change in their respective functions and, with that in mind, the advice I have and with which I agree is that the Garda is best placed and has the appropriate powers to carry out investigations and bring proceedings in the event of an event having been committed under the Act.</p></speech>

It is not that I do not believe An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should carry out such prosecutions.  Rather, my concern is that some of the incidents may not be a priority for the Garda.  In terms of scale, some incidents will be more serious than others.  I believe a better, more effective and more efficient way to do it would be for HIQA and other bodies to also have the power to prosecute.  In my view, that would strengthen the operation of the Act.  I have a concern that the only prosecuting body will be An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It remains to be seen how it will work in practice.  The Minister has given his rationale.  I accept that is the position of the Department.

Is the Minister comfortable with delayed diagnosis not being one of the notifiable incidents?  For me, it is an obvious area that should be included.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's reasons for it not being included.  I am not sure why the amendment was ruled out of order on the basis of putting a cost on the Exchequer.  That does not make sense to me.  The Minister cannot respond on the amendment but I ask that he provide his rationale for delayed diagnosis not being included in the Schedule as a notifiable incident, given what happened in CervicalCheck and that delayed diagnosis was so central to many of the concerns and failures relating to open disclosure.</p></speech>

I carefully considered the amendment and whether this particular incident could be included as a notifiable event.  We looked around the world and could not find any system that includes this specific incident.   The rationale is that it is vague.  Many of the notifiable incidences are quite binary.  They relate to things that clearly happened and it is clear to see what they are.  Delayed diagnosis is quite vague.  Its inclusion would essentially create an unsupportable administrative burden on the entire system.  It could cover anything from relatively minor delays to much more serious ones, including those such as the ones the Deputy referenced.  As it stands, the current list of notifiable events is specifically designed to cover the most serious reportable events, that is, those that cause death or serious injury.  These notifiable patient safety events set out currently in the Bill are clearly defined and provide clear direction to health service practitioners.</p> <p>  However, as I stated in my opening remarks, I will bring forward on Report Stage an amendment that deals with the incidences we all discussed at great length and that were flagged through everything that happened with CervicalCheck.  The advice I have is that it is legally and technically very difficult to do.  A significant amount of work has been done to figure out a way to do it and there are ongoing discussions on it.  I am seeking to address this issue through an amendment I will bring forward on Report Stage.  As regards the specific question of whether we could just have added it to the Schedule, the advice I have is that would not work.  It would not be practicable for all the reasons I have laid out.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we have direct experience in this State of how women were failed.  One of the reasons open disclosure and mandatory reporting is on our agenda is because of what happened to many of those women in terms of failures to report and issues relating to open disclosure.  There have been many more incidents.  Obviously, it was not only related to CervicalCheck, although it was cited in Dr. Scally&rsquo;s report in the recommendations he made that we move to implement in this area.  I accept what the Minister is saying that he has got advice, that it would not be appropriate to add it to the Schedule and that he will bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage that will deal with this and with broader issues relating to the failures that happened in CervicalCheck.  I look forward to what that means, what it will look like and what it will do.  We will evaluate that when we see it.  For me, this is a really important area.  If I were to push any amendment to a vote, it would be this one.  On the basis of what the Minister said, that he will bring forward an amendment on Report Stage, and to be fair to the Minister and his officials, they appear to have done much good work in this area, reluctantly, I will withdraw my amendment.  If the Minister was able to forward to the committee, as soon as possible, a note on what that amendment may seek to do or a copy of the amendment when drafted, it is important we get sufficient notice of it in order that we can go through it.  The amendment the Minister will bring forward is a critical one.  On that basis, I will withdraw the amendment or, apologies, it cannot be withdrawn as it was ruled out of order.</p></speech>

It is an exceptionally complex area to legislate for.  In preparing the Report Stage amendment, can the Minister indicate if it will deal with the specific area of screening or is it a wider issue?  In terms of trying to be specific about shortcomings in screening programmes, it is hard to do that.  There are many implications then for the viability of screening programmes.  Is that what the Minister has in mind, that he intends to legislative specifically for screening programmes?</p></speech>

That is right.  I have had lengthy discussions with the Department on this.  It does not fit neatly with this Bill.  The serious patient safety issues which result in death or serious harm are very clear.  They are binary, for example, where someone had something done to them in an operation which should not have been done or whatever it might be.  As the Deputy said, legislating around delayed diagnosis screening support is complex.  It does not fit neatly in this Bill.  However, my view, and I imagine it is one we all share, is that the non-disclosure that happened in CervicalCheck, even though it does not neatly fit here, should still be legislated for.  I have asked the Department to find a way to do that.  Extensive work has been done already and very extensive work is going on now.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Cullinane's point, I will share the thinking I have on this with the committee.  It is something of an add-on, to be honest.  It does not fit with the framework we have here.  This is  our opportunity to make sure we are very clear under law that the element of non-disclosure that happened in CervicalCheck will now be covered under legislation.</p></speech>

The expert reference groups on interval cancer are involved in this.  It is tricky because there can be a discordance that was flagged.  The discordance may or may not have been due to negligence.  It might be just, unfortunately as we have all become painfully aware, due to the limitations of the system.  A discordance, in and of itself, is not necessarily a patient safety incident, which is why it does not neatly fit here.  Essentially, what we are seeking is that where a discordance has been identified, where it is an identified patient - it cannot be done on the anonymised audits - and that patient seeks a look-back and a discordance was found, it would become a legal obligation to disclose to the patient that a discordance was found.  The reason it does not fit neatly in here is that discordance may or may not end up having been a patient safety incident but for all the reasons we are very aware of, this is the opportunity to specifically address what happened and say that cannot ever happen again.</p></speech>

Is the Minister saying that it would only be covered in circumstances where there was  a patient safety issue in terms of an actual event as opposed to a diagnosis not happening due to perhaps shortcomings in the screen programmes?  I would have thought the key issue is not that something goes wrong, which it can do from time to time, but how it is handled and the need for open disclosure on information that comes to light subsequently to, say, a screening programme?</p></speech>

It is going much further than having to have established that a patient safety event happened.  It comes before that.  I ask the members to bear with me because there is a lot of work going on to figure out exactly how this will work.  Essentially, what I have asked the Department is what the Deputy has just laid out.  If we have an identified patient on an interval cancer where a look-back is done and a discordance has been found, regardless of whether that discordance subsequently happens to be a patient safety incident - it may or may not be - open disclosure is required under law.</p></speech>
