Today we are discussing the issue of live exports.  I welcome the officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine: Ms Paula Barry Walsh, deputy chief veterinary officer; Mr. Dermot Murphy, principal officer; Ms Maria Dunne, principal officer; Mr. Rob Doyle, senior superintending veterinary inspector; Mr. David Nolan, senior superintending veterinary inspector; and Mr. James Casey, veterinary inspector.  I thank them for coming before the committee to discuss the issue of live exports today.</p> <p>  Before we begin I bring to the witnesses' attention the fact that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the House or an official, either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-29a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Paula Barry Walsh" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019012900002#E00500"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation.  Live exports are a critical part of the infrastructure of our livestock industry.  They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and provide an alternative market outlet for farmers.  They are, however, commercial transactions which can be impacted by various factors.  The live trade of animals is acknowledged to be a sensitive issue subject to societal, geopolitical and socio-economic influences.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine facilitates this trade, recognising its importance to the agriculture sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.  The Department takes its obligation to supervise the industry very seriously, ensuring compliance with these standards and exercising strict controls on the transport of live animals for export.  All ships transporting animals undergo inspection and licensing by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The handling, lairaging and loading of animals is carried out under veterinary supervision.  All animals undergo health inspection prior to departure, and certification is issued by the official veterinarian only if the animals are deemed fit for transport and free of disease.</p><p>In 2018 live exports totalled 246,226 head of cattle, up 31% from 188,334 in 2017.  This change was driven by a significant increase in calf exports to other EU countries.  Calf exports to Spain increased by 66% to over 72,500 head in 2018.  Exports of Irish calves to Italy and the Netherlands also increased last year to over 12,500 and 48,500 head, respectively.  Calf exports to Belgium increased from 4,200 to 13,000 head from 2017 to 2018.  Almost 13,000 head of cattle were exported to Turkey last year despite the currency challenges faced in that country.</p><p> I turn to ongoing work on market access for the livestock trade.  In April 2017, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine outlined a seven point action plan to increase international market access for Irish food, drink and live exports.  This focused on the development of new third country markets as well as ongoing work to maintain access to existing third country markets and improve the terms of our existing access, which is also crucial.  The maintenance and expansion of EU markets is also recognised as critical to the live export trade and Ireland works closely with Bord Bia on live export issues.  In the context of market access for livestock, the Department has engaged in the last 12 months at political, diplomatic, official and technical levels with a number of delegations from third countries, including Turkey, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Kazakhstan and Qatar.  New certificates were agreed with Libya and Qatar which are now more favourable to Irish exports whereby animals may be drawn from a larger cohort and are aligned with bilateral certificates with other member states.  I clarify that Egypt's certificates are still being finalised.  Revised certificates were also proposed to other markets.  While awaiting their responses, the Department is optimistic about a favourable outcome.  In August 2018, a Libyan delegation visited Ireland.  Following this, the Department reached agreement with the Libyan authorities on veterinary health certificates for the export of cattle.  The Minister's decision to reduce the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves less than three months of age from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20 has brought about greater equity in respect of fees payable per consignment.</p><p> I turn to animal welfare and compliance with legislation.  The Department provides strong oversight of the welfare of animals being exported over land and by sea from Ireland through a comprehensive legislative framework, namely the Carriage of Livestock by Sea Regulations 2016, SI 356 of 2016, and Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations.  In addition, and as already mentioned, veterinary inspection is carried out on animals prior to loading to ensure their fitness for transport.  Irish legislative standards for sea transport are recognised by the EU Commission as among the most effective and stringent in force.  Under the European Communities (Animal Transport and Control Post) Regulations 2006, the Department requires exporters to provide satellite navigation records and return all journey logs on completion of the journey.  Furthermore, the Department does not approve journey logs from exporters for road transport for any livestock export where the destination country has an orange or red weather alert in place or where a significant part of the transit route goes through an orange or red alert area.  This is in addition to the annual ban on road transport of livestock to Greece, and North Africa during the months of July and August.  The Department does not allow road transport to Turkey due to potential delays at border posts which might impact on animal welfare.</p><p> Ireland continues to work closely with other EU member states and the World Organisation for Animal Health, OIE, with a view to improving animal welfare practices worldwide.  In this regard Ireland has reaffirmed its ongoing commitment to animal welfare through additional OIE multiannual financial assistance to support its activities to enhance animal welfare worldwide.  This additional support to the value of &euro;75,000 per annum over the period 2017 to 2020 is focused on OIE initiatives in the area of slaughter in eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa and in the area of "whole journey scenarios" by land, sea or both involving inter-regional journeys.  In addition, Ireland hosts technical assistance and information exchange meetings with third country representatives with a view to achieving improved welfare outcomes.  Ireland is currently making arrangements to host such a visit in February 2019.</p><p> Challenges are to be expected within the live export trade.  These challenges include that of capacity in lairages in France.  Lairage capacity in Cherbourg has already been increased in recent years from approximately 1,500 calves per day to 4,000.  Departmental officials are in ongoing communication with Irish exporters on the need for their co-operative management with each other to ensure lairage capacity at Cherbourg is optimised.  Industry has been advised to make contact with business partners in France to explore options around the increase of capacity at Cherbourg.  Departmental officials continue to meet with ferry companies to explore new routes to mainland Europe as well as on the carrying livestock on existing routes to ensure that the greatest facilitation possible is afforded to livestock exporters in the important spring period.  The pending approval of a new ferry will assist in addressing these issues.  Departmental officials also engage with French counterparts on animal welfare matters and the lairage capacity in Cherbourg.  The establishment of an exporter representative body would be a useful development in improving planning and co-operation between exporters.  It would enhance their engagement with their French counterparts and especially with the existing owners of the facilities in Cherbourg, where additional capacity may exist.</p><p> The Department continues to work with the Egyptian and Algerian authorities with a view to finalising health certificates for these countries.  I will be glad to keep the committee apprised of progress in these matters in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-29a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019012900002#F00300"><p>I thank Ms Barry Walsh and the team from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for attending today to make a presentation and answer questions from members.  Live exports are critical to the health of the beef sector, in particular given the pressure it has been under for the past number of years.  It is ever more essential.  The strength of trade and the prices paid at marts reflect the health of the livestock market.  We have an issue currently around the size of the kill in the country, which has been reaching up to 40,000 head per week and putting pressure on the prices farmers are getting.  It is crucial to ensure at policy level that the pathway to live exports is as smooth as possible while remaining at all times cognisant of the need to ensure the welfare of the animals being exported is accorded a high priority.  Nobody will wish to ensure that more than farmers.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses in particular about the live export of young calves over the recent period.  As the dairy herd grows, it is important to ensure the calves it produces are exported at a young age so the domestic market is not overwhelmed by beef entering at slaughter age.  Given the numbers last year, what is the Department's assessment of how those numbers will hold up or improve?  Is the Department satisfied in the context of approvals for boats to export those calves?  On the Department's engagement on licences and in particular having regard to the issue of lairage in France, will we be able to build on the numbers achieved last year to increase exports this year?</p><p>On the export certificates with countries for live export, and especially for northern African countries, Ms Barry Walsh indicated a number of countries where revised licences and new certificates had been agreed in the last period.  In her presentation Ms Barry Walsh referred to Egypt, Libya and Qatar in particular and that the Department is continuing to engage in Turkey, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Kazakhstan and Qatar.  With regard to the certificates that were revised to give farmers more favourable terms for export, can the witnesses highlight what changes were agreed that facilitate that?  In my engagement with the beef sector there was previous feedback that some of the terms and conditions that would have been in those prior export certificates were too onerous - such as restrictions in advance and holding periods for cattle prior to export - and that these made the viability of the exports less attractive than for other exporting countries, which would have had certificates with the same countries.  That covers most of my questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-29a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019012900002#G00200"><p>Like Deputy McConalogue I thank Ms Paula Barry Walsh for the presentation to the committee and I welcome the other members of the delegation here today.</p><p>Live exports were never of such critical importance to us.  As the number of black and white calves increase this safety valve is absolutely essential.The numbers went up in 2018, which is testament to the satisfactory standards Ireland has in place.  If our calves were not arriving in a healthy state to the Continent, we would very soon lose our customers there.  The standards that have been put in place by the Department are there and working well.  We have to ensure they are.  The live exporters, obviously, had to reform their job and they want to do to as economically as possible but it is essential that the calves arrive in a healthy condition.  That is happening, otherwise the figures would not be on the increase.  In the past we had problems with our weanlings going to the Continent, but we ironed that out.  I was with Bord Bia at the time.  There were definitely health issues with weanlings and it was going to destroy Ireland's whole reputation.  Action was taken on having weanlings weaned before export.</p><p>We have had a lot of markets opened for our older stock and a lot of work has been out into that.  As has been said previously, however, there is no significant amount of stock moving into those markets.  We have to re-examine that with regard to the conditions in place.  Are conditions too stringent for the live exports to operate? I refer to such aspects as the quarantine before animals move.  While Ireland has to maintain its standards we also have to look at the economic viability of moving stock.  Putting conditions on the market that are too onerous is self-defeating in its purpose.  Ireland is disadvantaged in that we are the country that has to travel by sea to get to mainland Europe.  Do we know how many cattle travel from country to country in Europe, such as to the feedlots in Spain for example?  I have been on feedlots in Spain in the past and they had animals on the feedlots from four or five European countries.  How far are other animals travelling by road to those feedlots?  From our perspective it would be interesting to see how many cattle are moving from different countries on the Continent.  We definitely feel that the whole focus is on our sea transport journeys.  Is there the same emphasis on other exporters around the Continent who travel by land?</p><p>This spring there will be a record number of black and white calves on the ground.  While calving season is getting into full swing in all spring-calving herds it is absolutely essential that we consider the consequences of a potential period of stormy weather with a resulting backlog in the system and in the lairage capacity on the Continent.  Could it have a serious or detrimental effect on the number of calves we could export in any given week in the spring?  I believe that the market for these calves would be completely dependent on live exports this spring and our beef market in two years time is going to be dependent on it also.  The Irish capacity is one issue and an allowance should definitely be made for bad weather and a significant build-up of stock on this side waiting to get across.  I am worried that the capacity figures highlighted in the presentation would not be enough to cater for the huge volume of calves we need to get onto the Continent.</p><p>I hear from live exporters that they have markets that could cater for an increase of 50% in calf numbers to travel to the Continent this spring.  Would the Department be happy that the facilities in place would be able to cater for that increase in numbers, that we could do it very seamlessly and that the lairage facilities would be able to cater for such an increase in numbers? I believe we can stand over our record.  We would not be holding on to our customers on the Continent if we were not doing the job correctly or if calves were not arriving in a healthy condition.</p><p>The Department feels that it would be useful for the exporters to have one representative body.  It is an interesting comment from the Department.  They are competing against each other for markets and it would be hard to get them under the one umbrella.  I can, however, see reasons it would be needed for the operational aspects of moving livestock.  The exporters should use common sense and have the one umbrella body that would come and voice the concerns and issues facing the sector, rather than coming in to the Department in an <i>ad hoc</i>manner.  That would be useful.</p><p>I commend the Department on the regulations we have in place but it is essential to look at the regulations for the older cattle to see if we are being overly strenuous.  Some of our customers might demand certain conditions, but if stock does not move it becomes self-defeating.  We should go back to examine why no business is happening with some countries where we have negotiated to trade.  In any country with which we have an agreement on the movement of live exports, if nothing is happening on the movement of stock after a six month or 12 month period then we should go back to re-examine the agreement to see what is wrong and whether an economic reason is causing the non-movement of stock.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-29a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019012900002#G00300"><p>I welcome and acknowledge the representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The live export trade is a very important leg of our beef industry.  In my part of the world the black and white calf is the big name of the game.  Bandon Mart, which is only a few miles away from me, is now proposing to have two sale days, which has never been heard of.  They are talking about having two sales a week, one on Monday and one on Thursday.  This shows the demand and output that mart is predicting in the next few weeks.  Such large numbers of black and white calves need to be exported off this island.  Trying to get routes for this export is the biggest issue.</p> <p>  It must be acknowledged that 250,000 animals were moved last year, which is a very significant figure and up 31%.  A lot of them would have been black and white calves.  There is, and was, talk around Irish Ferries, especially in Rosslare, and a route being changed before Christmas.  What analysis has the Department done on that route change?  In the presentation the Department has said it is waiting for a new ferry to be looked at.  Will the witnesses elaborate on where we are with regard to ferry services?  I might be wrong but I do not believe that any of the live calves go through Cork Port.  I do not believe that Brittany Ferries currently take them and they mainly head to other ports.  Is there a possibility that calves from the Munster region would have to go to Dublin Port to be exported?  Would that create a significant barrier in getting calves to the market?  What is the market line that is planned out for the animals?</p><p>In the next six weeks, between 2,500 and 3,000 black and white calves will go into Bandon mart and other marts in my district.  We need to ensure we get those animals moved off.</p><p> Deputy Cahill mentioned weather conditions having an impact on getting calves off the island.  We saw the impact of bad snowfalls in southern counties last March.  These caused major disruption to the livestock trade for two or three weeks, with a major backlog affecting the price and age of calves.  How can we work within the time constraints of calve movements?  Will leniency be shown should we experience bad weather?  How can we ensure calves are moved off the island if there is an issue of time?  Is there a way around the issue and has the Department thought it through?  We may have another period of bad weather.  It happened at a terrible time for farmers last year, around the 8 March to 10 March, and caused major disruption for three weeks.  People trying to get animals off the island found that ferries were cancelled and road conditions were bad.</p><p> Where do the officials see growth in the market?  There was significant growth last year.  Will there further growth and greater access to markets this year?  What are the Department's target markets?  Where will pitfalls arise for those trying to get calves off the island?  The two main issues are transportation, both roads and ferries, and lairages on the Continent.  Is there capacity in lairages and do the ferry companies have the capacity to ensure we can get access to markets abroad?  Without such access, I would be fearful.  Last year was an exceptional year and we need to maintain or improve on last year's figures.  While we are probably a week behind in calving as a result of the way the weather broke and other factors, I think we will have exceptionally high numbers of black and white calve movements in the next four to five weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-29a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Paula Barry Walsh" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019012900002#H00200"><p>I will respond but I may amalgamate some of the questions.  I may also refer some to my colleagues.  The first question was on the outlook and the growth of trade in the next while.  The Department works with Bord Bia, which is involved in assessing the trade and the forecast for the trade for 2019.  It is considered that a strong trade will emerge in 2019 for live exports.  There may be growth both in the calf element and we would hope also in the other weanlings and store animals.</p> <p>  To give members an idea of what happened last year, the principal markets for Irish calves were Spain, which took approximately 71,000, the Netherlands, which took 48,000, Belgium, which took 14,000, and France, which took 9,000.  As members said, getting animals across to these countries is a critical issue.</p> <p>  The Department actively supports the live trade.  It works with the exporters and it will support the exporters in their endeavours to manage the access to Europe in respect of getting the calves out.</p> <p>  One of the questions related to details of lairage capacity as well as ferry capacity to France?  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Rob Doyle, to respond. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-29a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rob Doyle" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019012900002#H00300"><p>My colleague, Mr. James Casey, has been to France to visit our French colleagues and inspect the lairage.  The European Union has already funded a considerable increase in lairage capacity from approximately 1,500 to 4,000 calves per day.  Our assessment is that there is potentially space to increase capacity in one of the lairages should the operator wish to do so.  So far, he has not been particularly inclined to do so, but we have met representatives of the IFA and given them the contacts and details.  They will visit France next week to engage directly with the lairages.</p> <p>  We have also engaged on numerous occasions with our French colleagues so they understand the issues.  As Ms Barry Walsh said, the Department supports the trade and we understand the issue.  However, developing further lairage capacity in France is a commercial issue and we expect that Irish exporters will engage directly with their service providers in France and ask them, as commercial entities, to increase capacity.</p> <p>  The ferry sails three days a week and there is more than enough capacity to meet what is available in Cherbourg.  We expect a new ferry to be approved shortly.  It has been inspected and there are some issues to be resolved but it has been already approved for pets and horses and we expect approval for cattle to follow.  We understand from the ferry company that this ship will begin to sail to France in late March.  The good news is that it will sail on a 48 hour schedule.  Currently sailings are on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  The new ferry will sail seven days a week every second week, which will increase capacity from 12,000 to 28,000 a week if all the lairage capacity is used.  That will be a very significant increase in capacity, which should take much of the pressure off the system. </p></speech>

A question was asked about what changes we are looking for in certificates.  We tried to increase the age limits on the certificates.  We look at the weight limits and we have tried to have those increased as well.  We also look at limiting the quarantine or holding period that has to apply in Ireland.  We have also removed testing requirements for diseases from which Ireland is free.  We have to remember that the negotiations for certification is customer driven and customers tell us what they want.  Sometimes what we would like to achieve is not obtainable.  With that in mind, we have had some successes in certain markets in particular.  We have agreed a new certificate with Libya for breeding animals, which has been separated from slaughtered animals.  That was a combined certificate previously and it was proving very difficult.  Again, we got the age increased in the new certificate and we had many diseases on the old certificate removed.  Thankfully, that was agreed in November 2018.</p> <p>  We had also has some success in Qatar with which we have agreed a new certificate for sheep.  This makes it easier to supply sheep to the Qatar market.  The changes are primarily related to disease conditions.  We have had some level of success with Kazakhstan, although the process is not yet incomplete.  There is an agreed EU certificate for that part of the world.  We have just sent a new certificate for a disease called Schmallenberg virus and we await a response from the authorities in Kazakhstan.  We have political agreement from Egypt for the certificate but it has still not been signed off at official level.  We expect that to be done shortly.</p> <p>  A great many changes have been made to the old certificate.  The main reason for the changes is to ensure the exporters can draw from a larger cohort of animals, making them more competitive in the market.  After all, this ultimately comes down to price and if one is not competitive in certain market, one will not operate in them.</p> <p>  We have had a great deal of interaction with Algeria.  It needs to be borne in mind that if we engage with these foreign countries, we make proposals that suit the trade.  We try to align conditions in our certificates with the certificates they have with other member states, for instance, so that there is a level playing pitch.  That is our goal, but sometimes other countries do not come back to us on it.  We intend sending a technical mission to Algeria this year, with a view to examining and agreeing the wording in the certificate.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether we are successful.  I have given members a flavour of the work that is being done, which is ongoing.  It is time-consuming but I am an optimist and I would say we will get more favourable certificates for Irish exports going forward.</p></speech>

These things sometimes depend on currency exchanges and various economic issues in particular countries, but Bord Bia and the Department, in the shape of the international trade division and the milk and meat policy, are vigilant and keep an open mind on where new markets may arise.</p> <p>  We also keep possible new routes under examination, but ferry companies have to account for various things as part of their business models.  We will keep engaging with them, but there may be times when nothing happens.</p></speech>

The sensitivity of the market demands that we only ship animals when it is okay to do so.  When there is bad weather such as snow or storms, there may be a back-up of animals.  As Mr. Doyle said, with the new ferry coming on line, we will have a capacity of approximately 80,000 per month and, along with the support we have given to farming bodies and exporters to facilitate expansion of their lairage in Cherbourg, we are underpinning trade and facilitating getting animals out, even in bad weather in winter time.</p></speech>

One ferry company has made a commercial decision to sail from Dublin.  We have spoken to the company but it feels that overall trade is more advantageous, so it has made the decision.  We have also spoken to ferry companies about sailing to other ports in France to try to alleviate the pressure on Cherbourg, but they have said it does not make sense just for livestock trade.

We are very open to whatever model they would want to use for a representative body and we would work with them.  In the context of an expansion of their lairage in Cherbourg, a united voice to represent calf exporters would be an advantage.  It would also be an advantage to get exporters to talk to each other and to publicise their high welfare standards as well as the investment they have made in the trade to achieve positive animal welfare results.

If 80,000 animals were to be shipped per month for 12 months, it would be a fourfold increase on the present figure.  I believe 246,000 were exported last year, which shows there is already huge capacity.  What is the number of calves being exported?  I assume a lot go to feedlots.  At what stage do they go to the feedlots?  The majority of the destinations appear to be in Europe, to the same countries to which we export beef.  What is the level of live exports relative to the finished beef product that we export to those countries?</p> <p>  Most farmers would prefer the animals to be bought by factories here and slaughtered in Ireland and the work to be here rather than elsewhere.  The existence of the live export trade is, to some extent, a solution to a problem that should not exist.  We should have competition and the necessary capacity to process as much as possible here.  What are Ms Barry Walsh's comments on that?  There will always be a need for some level of live export, but I was quite taken aback by the scale of the capacity, at 80,000 per month.  It would be a huge number of animals if it were to be utilised.</p></speech>

How many exporters are there?  Are there huge numbers or relatively few?  I imagine there are relatively few and that we would easily get them all into this room.  We have a small number of factories processing meat and they have a representative organisation.  It may benefit the overall industry, but I wonder how much benefit it is to the primary producers.  When they get together, do they work for their own interests or those of the primary producer?  I would ask the same question of any organisation set up to represent exporters.</p> <p>  The other question is where we are going to go.  Egypt, Nigeria, Turkey and such places involve long journeys and it is clear that the people who buy the product want to buy a healthy animal, so we have to make sure that a healthy animal arrives at those destinations.  Ireland has a very good reputation in this area because the calves and other animals produced here are produced to the highest standards.  They are healthy while they are here and healthy when they leave, and we need to maintain that.</p><p>In regard to much of the criticism of the live export trade, will the Department's representatives provide some truth about the reality of animals' journeys and about their health when they arrive at their final destinations?</p></speech>

When one looks at the reality of the oversupply to the meat factories, the stark economic reality for farmers is that we cannot look to curtail markets, rather we have to ramp up live exports and find new markets.  That is brought into sharp focus by figures provided by Bord Bia which show 40,000 extra calves in the dairy herd.  Last year there was an increase of 60,000 in live exports.  I understand from people in the business that we need to look at an increase of 100,000 to ensure that farmers who supply to factories at the moment have an alternative and do not go out of business.  Things are pretty dismal in that regard.  The question of markets in which there have been increases has been covered but is there further scope?  What are the Department's projections for increased exports?  Where might we realistically see new markets and increases in existing markets to take up that glut of animals that are in our own market at the moment and that need to be moved on?</p> <p>  My other question is about Northern Ireland.  Cattle that have Irish tags are going into factories in the North and people are being paid less for them solely on that basis.  Are steps being taken to address that issue?  What is the situation as regards Irish cattle being brought to Northern Ireland?</p></speech>

It has been very interesting.  I have a couple of questions.  One relates to the dairy industry and an issue that has been mentioned already.  The growth in the dairy industry is obviously creating a problem in terms of live exports as calves that are surplus to requirements are moved out.  How much of an impact is that having?  Dr. Paula Barry Walsh said that live exports play a significant role in stimulating price competition.  If live export capacity is taken up dealing with calves from the dairy industry, the price competition aspect of the live export trade will be undermined.  That is a negative step.  How do the representatives see that issue being worked out through the process over the coming years?</p> <p>  Ms Barry Walsh also said in her contribution that exporting to Turkey by road was stopped as a result of welfare concerns arising from delays at the border.  Will any similar delays arise here as a result of the dreaded Brexit, which comes into everything?  Will there be any similar concerns in respect of delays at points of export that might arise after Brexit?  How would that be dealt with?  What are the Department's intentions in that regard?</p> <p>  A focus on Libya came up fairly often in Ms Barry Walsh's contribution.  With which Government in Libya have we done these deals?  That might have an impact.  Does the Department monitor where live trade animals go, especially in respect of countries such as Libya which are war-torn at the moment?  I would be interested in hearing about that.</p> <p>  In Ms Barry Walsh's presentation, she also mentioned that the price for inspections was reduced from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20.  That is a very significant reduction in price.  Does that have any impact on the actual examination of cattle which takes place?  If not, why was the price so high in the first place?  Perhaps it is a signal relating to increased trade that this fee has been reduced.  If that were the case it would mean the Department is also playing a role in impacting on trade.</p> <p>  Ms Barry Walsh also mentioned that the Department does checks on health grounds and so on.  How many animals have been stopped on health grounds in the last year?  I know the Department has given figures as to how many have been exported, but have any been stopped on health grounds?</p></speech>

I had another engagement.  My reading of scrutiny in the EU at the moment is that it is based on the animal welfare conditions in the non-EU countries of arrival.  I am very impressed with the report.  I know from experience that we are on the top of our game, that the Department scrutinises everything in its fullness, and that the health, welfare, and travelling conditions of the animals are 100%.  When the Department is negotiating certificates or licences, how far beyond arrival at the designated destination does it go before it comes to agreement on a certificate or licence with regard to where the animal ends up and the welfare issues thereafter?  As I have said, that seems to be the issue flagged in this regard.  How much knowledge do we have of that?</p></speech>

I emphasise that figure relates to calves for the seasonal period.  It does not reflect a capacity to export 80,000 weanlings and other animals.  We probably have the capacity to export a maximum of 5,000 such animals weekly throughout the year.  That is what it works out as on average.  The capacity of 80,000 is a response to the possible demand this year.  It is a response to the needs of industry.  We support industry in trying to enable exports of calves but, as I have said, that figure does not reflect all exports.</p> <p>  Feedlots and where calves are going were also mentioned.  I will refer to my colleague on that matter.</p></speech>

It refers to male dairy calves.  They are exported for one of two types of veal production, milk veal or ros&eacute; veal.  The countries involved are mainly Spain and Belgium, which are the big importers.  Dairy cows are calving now.  By the end of February approximately 500,000 will have calved.  Compact calving has been the aim in recent years.  We have a short period in which high volumes of calves are born.  At peak season, with ferries sailing seven days, we would expect to export 28,000 calves a week.  At other times, when ferries sail three days a week, the figure is 12,000.  Combining those figures gives an average of 80,000 a month.  We will be at full capacity from March.  At full capacity we should be able to export in two months the equivalent of all the calves exported last year, and we will have capacity over and above that.</p></speech>

The Minister has put forward an action plan regarding support for market access.  Within that plan there is a willingness to expand the markets for both meat and live animals.  There is a dual process going on.  The Department is engaged in opening the markets and negotiating the most favourable certificates it can.  That enables the trade.  At that point the industry itself responds to the market forces.  If there is a meat trade, the industry will avail of it.  Equally, if there is a live animal trade, it will be availed of.  Sometimes the balance between the two fluctuates.  It differs wildly between countries.  That is the way it is approached.  We enable trade and industry responds and is active commercially.</p> <p>  On the issue of the number of exporters, it is a small number.  There are 15 or fewer, but behind them is an industry of assembly owners, transporters, haulage companies and various other groups, so the trade does support the agriculture sector and is of value to the sector more widely, not just to the livelihood of 15 people.</p><p> Reference was made to a representative organisation for exporters.  In terms of its value for such a small number, the feeling is that it would have value if exporters got together, had a person who could speak about their welfare standards, make their case and engage with the industry in other countries.  We see that value in exporters being active to try to expand the lairage capacity available in Cherbourg.</p><p> Another query was raised about the long trips made and the truth surrounding the issues raised.  I will hand over to Mr. Doyle to answer it.</p></speech>

Ireland is well recognised as having the highest standards in the world.  We have specific legislation under which we approve ships.  There are two veterinary inspectors and we work with marine engineers to approve vessels.  All of the trade is from Irish to Turkish ports and the number of cattle involved depends on the size of the ship used.  One interesting point is that exporters are paid by weight of the animals delivered.  For a couple of weeks before they are exported to Turkey, the cattle are generally put on a special diet while in quarantine.  They are also fed on the ship.  A lot of the exporters have reported that cattle actually put on weight while on the ships.  If cattle welfare is compromised, they do not thrive.  For the long trips to Turkey, it is currently the only form of transport the Department will approve.</p></speech>

Currently, the labelling of meat is governed by EU rules that are origin-based.  The label must indicate where an animal was born, reared and slaughtered.  If an animal was born, reared and slaughtered in Ireland, one can include the term &quot;origin Ireland&quot;, or equally it could be &quot;origin UK&quot; as the only other jurisdiction.  If animals are moved to Northern Ireland, the label will indicate that they were born in one jurisdiction, reared in another and perhaps slaughtered in another, but the commercial operations do not favour the use of that type of label.  They prefer it to use an &quot;origin UK&quot; label.  In that context, the EU legislation prevails in labelling.<br/><br/>Mention was made of the decrease in the fee for calves from &euro;480 to &euro;120.  It was considered to be an issue of equity.  The payment of &euro;480 was originally for a bovine, at which point, going back many years, there was not a particularly big trade in calves.  As the trade became more active, it was pointed out that proportionally, relative to the amount of work and time involved, it was very expensive.  For the sake of equity, the differentiation was made in prices.<br/><br/>Committee members raised the issue of Brexit.  I cannot specify in what form Brexit will happen and will not go there today - I will not reveal it - but perhaps it is very easy.  When we are talking about calves, weanlings and stores, Brexit will be irrelevant because they leave the country in intra-community trade and will continue to do so.  There will be no impact in that regard.  Equally, in the case of the ships that sail to Turkey, for example, Brexit will have no impact <i>per se</i>.<br/><br/>To respond to the question of how many animals are stopped, I reiterate that in line with standards ensuring the welfare of animals is the top priority.  Prior to loading, all animals in the lairage are inspected by the veterinary inspectors on duty.  There are documentary, identity and health checks.  Unless it is to be deemed fit to travel and free of disease, no animal is allowed on a vessel.  If animals are rejected, it is primarily because of some documentary issue such as an incorrect card, the current owner is not registered or perhaps the results of bovine disease tests might not have been included.

On the overall issue of animal welfare, we currently engage with the OIE.  In my earlier statement I referred to Ireland's support to the OIE of &euro;75,000 per year in the period from 2017 to 2020.  The money will go towards enhancing animal welfare standards in third countries.  Our officers engage in technical assistance and information exchange programmes which involve personnel coming from third countries to look at our systems.  We can show them best practice.  There will be such a visit at the end of February by personnel from one of the third countries with which Ireland trades.  We are very active in supporting the European Union in promulgating best practice, while ensuring we meet those very same standards.</p></speech>

It was the same gentleman who entered into negotiations with Ireland on the old certificate before the turmoil started in that country.

Welfare organisations have paid significant attention to what happens at that border crossing and there have been multiple reports of animal welfare violations, including of cattle being held for long periods without water in areas with very high temperatures.  The risk to the animals and the reputational risk to Ireland are simply too great for us to approve the transport of animals on that route.</p></speech>

There is a significant market in the United Kingdom for breeding dairy stock, in the southern part in particular.  It depends on currency exchange rates.  There might be nothing one year and a big fluctuation the next.  On moving in-calf heifers and dairy stock to the United Kingdom, what will the impact of Brexit be?  Has it been thought through?  What preparations have been made in realigning our markets in the event that there is a hard Brexit?  Even though there are no calves going there, the dairy industry has a significant interest in securing access to the UK market for breeding Friesian heifers.</p></speech>

It is already obligatory in intra-community trade to certify animals, whether they are being moved between the North and the South or whether they are going to or coming from the UK mainland.  Any animal coming here will be certified.  The reason for certification is protection of animal health and welfare, as well as protection of public health in the context of any transmissible disease.  For now Ireland is able to trade freely with Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I cannot speculate about the arrangements after Brexit, but one can say without speculating too much that the risk will largely be the same and that, if certification will be a requirement, it is likely that Ireland will continue to be able to provide it.  Equally, Ireland will have to ensure it will be able to offer its own guarantees on animal health and welfare.  I cannot speculate about what will happen after Brexit, but the current situation gives good reason to believe there will be no risk.</p></speech>

This is an opportunity for members of the committee to discuss with Mr. Hayes his vision, priorities and experience in the short to medium term and any challenges facing the council.  On behalf of the committee I am very happy to welcome Mr. Hayes.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite him to make a brief opening statement of approximately three minutes, which will be followed by engagement with members of the committee.</p><p>Before we begin, I draw Mr. Hayes's attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any opening statements made to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting. </p><p>I advise members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

I am from Thurles, County Tipperary.  I retired from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 2014 having served in the foreign service for more than 40 years.  I am married to Deirdre and we have four adult children, the youngest of whom, Eavan Kate, has a range of special needs and is intellectually disabled as a consequence of a profound illness shortly after she was born.</p> <p>  During my time in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I served in a wide variety of overseas assignments.  Our children came with us on all of our postings.  I was ambassador to China, to the Czech Republic, to Denmark and, most recently, to Singapore.  I also covered a variety of secondary accreditations, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Timor Leste, Ukraine and Iceland.  I served in Irish embassies in Moscow, London and Bonn.  For a brief period, I was based in Armagh as the Joint Secretary of the North-South Ministerial Council.</p> <p>  Eavan Kate was born in 1989 shortly before I was despatched to our embassy in London.  As the extent of Eavan Kate&rsquo;s impairment became clear, the issue for us as a family was whether we could provide for her the necessary support and care and whether I could, at the same time, manage an assignment which, back then, required full-time and hands-on commitment.  There was never any doubt.  Eavan came with us to London.  We were there at the height of the Thatcher government which had a strong public emphasis on wealth creation and rampant individualism.  During our four years in London, nonetheless, Eavan Kate received an outstanding level of medical and educational care and support.</p> <p>  Several years later I was sent to China.  Again, we never had any doubt that Eavan Kate would come with us to Beijing as a family, despite what we were warned about the very obvious challenges of bringing an eight year old special needs child to China.  It would be socially and culturally challenging for us to adjust, not to mind for a western child with special needs.  There would, we were warned, be no access to schooling, no support, and no understanding of her disability.  It also transpired when we arrived that the expatriate international school community did not recognise special needs.  We were thrown back on our own resources and on the support of the Chinese system.  In the event, our most fulfilling posting was our four years in China.  Eavan went to school, was deeply loved and supported by a succession of Chinese carers, and lived a happy, contented, colourful and fun-filled life.</p> <p>  Of course not everything was perfect.  It would be wrong to use our positive experience with our special needs daughter as a benchmark for generalised judgment on Chinese attitudes to human rights and fundamental freedoms.  During our time in China, it helped that disability carried a particular badge of honour since the son of Deng Xiaoping, Deng Pufang, had been a wheelchair user since 1968.  He had been thrown off a high building by Mao&rsquo;s Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.  Despite China&rsquo;s single party authoritarian system, our vulnerable daughter was accepted, included and respected.  Due to that, I learned one enduring lesson.  I came to realise that one singular mark of a civilised society is its ability to acknowledge and care for the most vulnerable, for the voiceless, and for the disabled.  A society which ensures equality and respect for its children with special needs is, for sure, a worthwhile one, whatever might be the deficiencies of its political system.</p> <p>  That, in summary, is the background to my readiness on my retirement to become involved with the area of special needs.  There was never any doubt in my mind that this was the way to go, the best way of using whatever few talents I have to return something to the State which had employed me for four decades.</p> <p>  To my mind, the NCSE is symbolic of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to equality and fairness, a commitment endorsed by successive Governments and one which, despite failings and imperfections, reflects the very best of our society.  If the committee ratifies my appointment as chairperson to the NCSE, I will work particularly to ensure the parental perspective plays a formative role.</p><p>I also have to continue the excellent work of my predecessor, Mr. Eamon Stack, who directed the council with the flair and skill that he managed in a lifetime of experience as a teacher and senior schools inspector.  Mr. Stack had the support of a talented, experienced and supportive council, which operated as a strong and united team.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time and attention.  Unlike my distinguished predecessor, I have no background in education, no particular skills in the area and no professional insights.  However, I have a lifetime of experience as a parent and an abiding belief that the most important person is the child, the adolescent and the adult recipient of our services.  They are the heart and centre of everything we do.</p></speech>

The many diplomatic skills he has will certainly be used.  I am very familiar with Dunshane House, which was mentioned by Mr. Hayes; Eavan Kate is there and it does absolutely wonderful work.  Do the members have any questions to put to Mr. Hayes?</p></speech>

It is not technically required but if somebody gave a bad account before us, he or she would probably be on a road to failure.  We do not have official status to accept or reject the nomination but Mr. Hayes has made a very good case.  He certainly fulfils all the requirements.  It is very welcome that he has personal experience.</p> <p>  I place on record my thanks to Mr. Eamon Stack, although I only had a few interactions with him.  I have not seen the chairman of a board of any organisation that would have a handle on the level of detail that he had on the various matters within the NCSE.  He met me and my party leader on occasion to discuss major changes happening at the NCSE.  Notwithstanding his background in education, I was very impressed to see a chairman doing that and getting involved with executives in an organisation.  It was very useful and helpful.</p> <p>  I have no doubt that Mr. Hayes recognises that there are many parents with negative experiences dealing with the State.  In general, I have very strong praise for the NCSE and my interactions with the council are extremely positive.  One area where the system fails - I am not blaming the NCSE in particular - is when support is refused, not given or only partial support is given.  I find parents are usually very disappointed and they feel let down.  There does not seem to be a way for them to channel it, get reasons or to have some kind of interaction relating to a refusal of support or allowance of support they do not deem sufficient.  Often the communication on the ground is not fantastic in those circumstances.  I urge the witness to consider that.</p> <p>  Again, I generally have nothing but praise for the NCSE.  It is effectively an independent organisation.  I offer a word of caution, as Mr. Hayes has come from officialdom.  Now he is on the other side of the fence as chairman of a State board so he must battle with some of the officials he may know personally.  I strongly urge him to do it and I know he will.  It will be a different perspective to his fight for resources and to implement some of the ideas that have been put forward by the NCSE.  I have highlighted the need for nursing supports for complex medical needs.  The NCSE has highlighted it and I have followed up but nothing has happened.  It is important there would be a battle with officialdom to ensure it happens.  I say that with all due respect to officials, who all do a particular job.  Mr. Hayes is on the other side of the fence, to some extent.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the work of his predecessor, Mr. Eamon Stack, and the important work he has done in the role.  I am quite moved by the presentation, which was not typical of what we get.  It is a breath of fresh air.</p><p>It is what Mr. Hayes will lend to the role.  I thank him for sharing his personal story of Eavan Kate and his whole family with us.  It struck me when he said the singular mark of civilised society was to care for the most vulnerable, the voiceless and the disabled.  At the very end Mr. Hayes said the most important person is the child, the adolescent and the adult recipient of the services, and they are at the heart and centre of everything the council does.  If that is the case, I do not see how the NCSE can go wrong with Mr. Hayes at the helm.  I thank Mr. Hayes for his invitation to the research conference and I am sure if members are free, the committee will send a representation.  What are the two biggest challenges facing special needs education and how should they be addressed?</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Hayes for his presentation and welcome him to the role.  I also pay tribute to Mr. Eamon Stack, whom I know going back a long way, as he was principal of a school my son attended at one stage.  He had a very wide educational experience but Mr. Hayes is coming from a different perspective.  As others have said, that is very good, as we need that perspective.  The importance of the child is central to all of this.</p> <p>  I pay tribute to the work of the national council; it has done some very good work, sometimes under very difficult circumstances because resources are limited.  They may have been more limited in the past but they are still limited.  There is a constant need coming before the council and there is variation in what is appropriate to certain children, whether it is integration in mainstream with supports, special classrooms, particularly for children on the autism spectrum, and special schools.  Depending on the needs of the child, all of those need to be provided.  There is a constant and growing demand.  I am sure this will be a challenge for the witness as I am sure he will want to do everything possible, as all of us would.  There will always be a certain limit on resources.  What is the view of the witness in this respect?</p> <p>  As a committee we would like to continue to have an ongoing conversation with Mr. Hayes and the council.  If, now or at any stage in the future, there are particular areas we should examine as a committee or where it would be useful to do so, we can call in people to make presentations and write reports.  As a committee we are interested in continuing to engage with Mr. Hayes and the council on this very important matter.</p></speech>

There was reference to a conference in the correspondence, and if it is at all possible, we would be happy to attend.  Regardless of whether we can or not, it may be useful after the event to have some engagement with Mr. Hayes about the themes that emerge from the conference.  The area of special needs and intellectual disability is something that we as a committee have focused on quite a bit.  No later than last Thursday, we discussed with the Minister in the context of one of our reports on children with special needs and children in disadvantaged areas.  Mr. Hayes is certainly pushing an open door if we can do anything to help him on his journey.</p><p> Deputies Martin and O'Sullivan asked what Mr. Hayes viewed as the challenges, but I would like to ask him about the priorities and vision he will set for his first 18 months.  Obviously, the council's remit will be extended as the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 - the EPSEN Act - is fully commenced.  While certain sections have already been commenced, the implementation of key sections that confer statutory rights to assessments, educational plans and appeal processes has been deferred due to economic circumstances.  The council will be committed to working towards achieving the Act's ambitions, but is there any particular provision of it that Mr. Hayes would like to see commenced as a priority?</p></speech>

When I became a reluctant volunteer for this role, it struck me that, after 40 years as a civil servant, I would find myself on the other side of the line, as it were.  One of the advantages of approaching my 70th birthday is becoming less bound by the frontiers of bureaucracy and more capable of saying what comes to mind.  It will not be a problem for me, but the Deputy raised a valid point and I thank him for doing so.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin asked what the challenges would be.  I thought of two, and my answer will apply to everyone's contribution.  One will be to keep the current level of funding and resources.  With issues like Government spending on special needs, I often find that we are rarely in the front seat when those debates take place.  Funding for special needs is not something that jumps forward and, when a recession comes, it can easily be sacrificed.</p> <p>  Second, I am struck by the fact that, of the total education budget, almost one fifth is allocated to special education.  That &euro;1.68 billion is an enormous amount of money.  The challenge will not only be to retain that level of funding, but to ensure it is spent in a meaningful way.  It is not just about resources, but how one uses them.  That is what I like about the NCSE.  This is an organisation with a great deal of independence.  Initially, I worried that it was so close to the Department of Education and Skills, it was actually a part of it and all we would be doing was bolstering the conventional wisdom.  To its great credit, though, the NCSE does not do that.  It has an independent research arm that is well worth listening to and one of the best in the world.  It is important that we keep the resources and use them properly.  For example, I feel strongly about the fact that there will be special classes, not in all schools, but where children live locally.  While my next comment may be radical, the new school admissions Act will present some interesting scenarios where all schools are faced with the reality of admitting and caring for special needs children instead of passing the buck, as it were, to other schools.  I hesitate to say more, as I am so new to this, but there are some hot potatoes ahead of us, and handling and dealing with them will be interesting.</p> <p>  I am happy to be with the NCSE, as it takes inclusion and equality seriously.  We need political support and attention.</p><p>Do come and visit our research centre.  Please give us support.  We need it.  </p></speech>

I have no doubt that his experience as Eavan Kate's father will bring a new fresh perspective, which is probably needed.  He has a personal legacy.  By that I mean, his efforts will ensure that other children will have the same opportunities enjoyed by Eavan Kate.  It was interesting to hear about his journey around the world with his family in tow in terms of how society treated people with intellectual disability.  I, too, speak from a personal perspective.  I have a brother who lives in Kildare and he has Down's syndrome, which always informs me in terms of the issues that are presented to the committee.</p> <p>  We will, as a committee, notify the Minister that we have had an engagement with Mr. Hayes and we will wholeheartedly recommend Mr. Hayes for the position.  On behalf of the committee, I thank him for coming before us today and for his engagement on this very important topic that genuinely occupies us quite a bit in our work programme.  I ask him to ensure that the next NCSE annual report includes any issues that he would like us to engage on, as a committee.  I ask him to forward the report to us when it is published and assure him that we would be more than happy to engage.  We wish him well with the task ahead.  We have no doubt about his commitment and dedication to the matter.  We will now go into private session to deal with housekeeping matters.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health and Ms Fionnuala Duffy, principal officer in the Department of Health.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any opening statements that have been made to the committee may be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>This is our third meeting on this issue.  We met with the development board of the hospital and, last week, we met the Department and the HSE, amounting to almost nine hours of evidence in total.  The issue relates to cost escalation.  It has been explained to us that the complexity of the process was at the heart of some of the cost escalation.  The proposal is to build the best hospital in the world, a digital hospital that will be environmentally friendly and appropriate for patients and parents.  The fundamental factor relates to the two-stage process, which did not properly determine the total cost of the project.  It would appear that the Government did not put a total cost on the project so the overall impression is that it has gone out of control and this will have a knock-on effect on the capital programme for years to come.  It is not just about the children's hospital but other elements of health reform and expanding capacity.<br/><br/>We had requested the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to present to the committee and we continue to make the invitation.  The Department has not yet accepted the invitation but we are hopeful it will come before us as we feel it has a responsibility in allocating the extra funding of &euro;450 million.  It would also have had a part to play in the drawing up of Government contracts so we feel it should attend.<br/><br/>My only question to the Minister is to ask him for his overall impression of what has happened, so that we can get a sense of what the Department feels is responsible for the cost escalation.</p></speech>

I have watched nearly all the hearings of this committee very closely and I am very much aware of the extensive engagement it has had and will continue to have.  The Committee of Public Accounts will also engage on the issue later this week and I will be back at this committee next week with senior HSE management for our quarterly exchange.  We will continue to scrutinise this issue for quite some time.</p> <p>  When the overrun became apparent to me, it would be an understatement to say I was very disappointed, very concerned and very frustrated.  These are serious sums of taxpayers' money so it is right and proper to get to the bottom of exactly what happened and to seek answers.  That is why the Government did not decide to simply proceed with the project.  I will get to why we made that decision because it has been a little bit lost in the conversations I have been following up to now.  We decided that we would proceed with the project but we also decided that, while doing so, we would also have an external review.  That external review will be published and brought to Government.  It will be shared with this committee and I expect everybody to come before the committee to answer questions.  I will not, however, pre-empt the outcome as regards where accountability lies, which is something I have seen creeping into the debate on the issue.  We have seen what happens when the Oireachtas does not afford people due process and I do not think that is a very good way of carrying out parliamentary business.</p> <p>  I will make three brief points.  First, this project is under way.  I have heard people in these committee rooms describe it as a big hole in the ground at St. James's Hospital but it is not that.  The building is under way and the outpatient urgent care centre in Connolly Hospital is due to open in a couple of months, while the sod is due to be turned on Tallaght.</p><p>The project is finally under way.  It was first discussed in the Oireachtas in 1962.  Approximately &euro;40 million of taxpayers' money was wasted on the project trying to build it on the Mater site but it is now under way.  We should not lose sight of what it is doing.  I have heard very detailed discussions about bed numbers, equating the entire cost of the project to bed numbers.  I respectfully suggest that this somewhat misses the point.  For example, our children's hospitals today have 14 theatres.  This new national children's hospital will have 22 theatres.  If you look at any of the data, Chairman, more operations, day case procedures, inpatient procedures and emergency department attendances will be catered for.  There will be a new model of care.  I heard people over the weekend ask why we would be building an expensive roof garden on the top of this hospital and suggesting the children could go to the many parks in Dublin.  That level of ignorance about the project shows a lack of understanding that these are some of the sickest kids who will spend months and months in hospital.</p><p> Yes, this is an extremely expensive project.  None of what I have said is to take away from my serious concerns about the cost overrun.  Ministers are presented with options.  When the cost overrun became apparent to my Department in August, when the level and scale of it became apparent to my Department in November, when we then engaged with other colleagues across Government and brought it to Government in December for a decision, I really had three options that I could take.  The first option was to pause the project.  I am not pausing the building of the national children's hospital.  It has been paused far too many times.  There are kids who are now adults who have kids who are hoping to benefit from the national children's hospital.  The second option was to re-tender the project.  I heard somebody suggest we should have a chat with the builder.  All of the expert evidence was that re-tendering the project would have cost more for the taxpayer above and beyond the very significant existing cost and would have increased the length of time it would take to deliver this project, which is already well overdue in terms of the expectation of the Irish people.  The third option was to proceed.  That is the decision that I took.  It was one of the hardest decisions the Government has made in my time in government, certainly the hardest decision I have asked the Government to make.  If this was any other project, one might be thinking one could not go any further with it but we could not stop this project because it is so badly needed in terms of the infrastructure for our children.</p><p> The overrun is very significant and I am not in any way deviating from that or undermining its significance.  This is massive and the Chairman and members of the committee are quite right to highlight it.  However, it is not an overrun of &euro;1 billion as I have heard people reference at this committee.  That is comparing apples with oranges.  It is going back to a time of a different site without planning permission in a different time.  It is like someone trying to pretend one was building one's house on a different site ten years ago - I have heard a lot of analogies about houses.  That is not what we are doing.  The comparison, in terms of the overrun, is of the figure I brought to the Government in 2017 with the figure today and that is an increase of about &euro;450 million.  It is a colossal overrun and there is no getting away from that, but it is not &euro;1 billion.  The figure is &euro;450 million.  The committee has heard in great detail from its witnesses as to how they arrived at that point.  It has scrutinised whether the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, process was the right one to use.  I do need to point out that this was recommended by our various procurement bodies, by the Government's contracts committee and by all of the expert advice available.  The Mazars report also suggests this was the appropriate way to go, while highlighting significant concerns in terms of oversight.  I have no doubt but that when the PwC report comes back in March, there will need to be changes and improvements in how this project is managed and overseen.  There is no doubt about that.  There are powers available to me under the existing legislation that was only passed by the Oireachtas in recent weeks.  I will assess all of the options available to me when that report is published and we actually have all of the facts in front of us.</p><p> I have heard a couple of other comments made about de-scoping the project.  Again, there is very little value in doing that without actually compromising the safety standard.  That seems to be the expert view.  I have heard lots of different opinions but the committee must remember we have construction inflation.  We had a situation in respect of design fees as well, and there is absolutely no doubt but that the Government as a collective is extraordinarily disappointed, frustrated and worried about this issue.  We will get to the bottom of it.  There are learnings both for this capital project, the largest health capital project in the history of the State, and for every other capital project.  I will not be found wanting in making sure the lessons are learned, that the learning is implemented and that changes are made where necessary.  I will await the report but I will not entertain any talk of pausing or moving the project.  I have been reading articles today about moving it to a greenfield site.  This hospital is being built.  It is under way.  The children of Ireland need it.  Yes, it is expensive, perhaps too expensive, but we have now got to get this project done.</p></speech>

I am being asked three main questions.  First, how was it allowed to happen?  Second, why apparently is there zero accountability for what has happened?  Third, what can be done now that we know what we know?  These are the three questions into which I would like to get with the Minister.  </p> <p>  On the first question as to how it was allowed to happened, I disagree with the Minister on the figures.  This is not about a cost overrun of &euro;450 million.  That is just the latest cost overrun.  It is a fact that in April 2016 the Taoiseach who was then the Minister for Health stated on the "Six One" news programme that the total cost of the children's hospital, including VAT, contingencies, inflation and satellites, would be &euro;650 million.  Some four weeks later he was Taoiseach.  If we go back to the 2016 documents, that is the figure we see.  It had crept up from approximately &euro;400 million to approximately &euro;650 million.  When it reached &euro;650 million, the then Minister stated that was what the cost would be.  Two years later it was &euro;1.7 billion.  We can argue about the roundings, but the total increase between 2016 and 2018 was approximately &euro;1 billion and there will be no single extra bed provided.  In a normal hospital it costs approximately &euro;1 million to commission a bed.  In a normal country, building normally priced hospitals, &euro;1 billion would provide 1,000 hospital beds.  We are getting none.</p></speech>

My first question is as follows.  When the Minister found out that the cost had escalated to &euro;1.7 billion, why did he not instruct his officials, the board or both to design some of the cost back out, given that it was never intended to spend anything like that amount of money?</p></speech>

That is the only figure over which I can stand.  It is the one the Government of Ireland approved when the matter was brought to the Cabinet by me in April 2017.  However, I get the broader point and do not wish to get involved in semantics, but that is the figure with which the cost of the project should be compared.  It does not, however, change the Deputy's argument as &euro;450 million is still a very significant overrun.  His point about beds is one that frustrates me somewhat when I hear it because it ignores the reality.  It is an attempt to suggest there will be no additional benefit to the new hospital, other than perhaps a nice building.</p></speech>

There are sick kids today in Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght hospitals whose parents are sleeping on the floor.  In the new hospital every child will have a single room which will be <i>en suite</i>, which will be great for infection control and in ensuring basic family decency when people have to spend weeks and months in hospital.  That is the first point.  The second is that whereas we now have 14 theatres, there will be 22 in the new hospital.  That represents a very significant increase in theatre capacity to look after sick kids.</p></speech>

I have heard Deputy Kelly's point about this.  There should be full transparency.  I want that to happen.  I first became aware that there would be an overrun on 24 August.  I did not become aware of the final figure until 9 November - certainly early November.  I can check my folder with regard to that.  In the intervening period, I had been assured by my officials and indeed asked by my officials to ensure that due diligence be done regarding all of the options - looking at how we could claw back the costs of this project and whether there are better ways of delivering the project.  The Mazars report was commissioned.  A report came back through the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board that told me what my three options were after all this due diligence was done.  When we talk about the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, we need to remember that we are not talking about random individuals.  They are really serious people with expertise in the delivery of major construction projects.  A number of reports, many of which have been shared with this committee, were produced on the different options, including scoping.  I was and remain satisfied that all of those issues were looked at.  Based on the expert advice available to me, I also remain satisfied that we were to try to de-scope the hospital, it could impact on basic standards and safety standard directives.</p></speech>

Is this still the Government's position?  Is it still proceeding with the figure of &euro;1.73 billion?  Is it part of the terms of reference of the PwC report to try to de-escalate the costs that have spiralled?</p></speech>

The Government rules nothing out in terms of trying to further reduce the costs of this project.  When the Deputy talks about the figure of &euro;1.7 billion, I need to point out it is not all Exchequer funding.  I know it is a relatively small point but it is one I need to make.  The Government has not signed off on a figure of &euro;1.7 billion of capital costs for the national children's hospital.  That is an important point to make.  I am satisfied enough that I made a recommendation to the Government that we proceed with this project.  I could not think of an alternative recommendation that would be worthy of the children of Ireland so I made the recommendation to proceed with the project.  The Government considered it as a collective and decided to proceed but it was not delighted when it did so, rather it was really frustrated.  The Deputy is right; that is an understatement.  Such is the scale that the words "frustrated" and"disappointment" are understatements.  We will be led by the PwC report in terms of what further avenues are available.  I assure the Deputy that if further avenues are available, we will not be found wanting.  I do not want to eat into the Deputy's time but the Secretary General-----</p></speech>

I want to talk about accountability because what we have heard here over the past few weeks has shocked me and many people.  At &euro;1.7 billion, the cost per bed will be more than twice as much as the cost per bed of the most expensive hospitals built anywhere in the world.  Regardless of whether we use the Minister's figure of &euro;450 million or the figure of &euro;1 billion on an overrun, it is a vast amount of money to have overrun by with massive knock-on implications for the healthcare system.  Does the Minister accept that this represents a catastrophic failure of financial management?</p></speech>

I will arrive at my conclusion on that question, come back to this committee and answer the question when I see the PwC report.  Why would I commission a report if I predetermined the outcome?</p></speech>

I will not stand over factually incorrect information.  I have not known about this since August.  I have known since August that there was an overrun.  I have known since 9 November about the scale of the overrun and apprised the Government of that on 18 December when we made a decision.  It is now January.  We approved the project just before Christmas and I am awaiting the outcome of the PwC report, which is not a "never ever" report.  It will be here in March.  It will be published in full and I will come back here and answer the Deputy's questions relating to that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what else we could do to mitigate cost, which is an important point.  We have other options available.  For example, what is the future of Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, a hospital that under its own rules needs to be used for the future of children's healthcare?  That is an interesting point.  Philanthropy is another issue.  I have heard the Deputy's views on it but it is a normal part of the delivery of children's healthcare throughout the globe.  We see a lot of it in the UK so a new foundation has been established.  There are other options we are considering with regard to this.  The board is very clear from Government-----</p></speech>

To me and to many people around Ireland it is an absolute scandal what has happened with taxpayers' money that needs to be deployed for healthcare or for children's healthcare.  Does the Minister at this point have confidence in the development board and has he asked anybody to resign in light of everything that we now know happened?</p></speech>

One has confidence in boards and individuals as they do their job.  Should that position change, they will be notified first in that regard.  I am awaiting the outcome of the PwC report.  Maybe we can be slightly flexible with the time because I do not want to eat up Deputy Donnelly's time.  I referenced, under the new Children's Health Act 2018 the passage of which the Deputy would have supported, that I have powers in the future composition of the board and I will consider all of these options.  Indeed, I welcome the input of this committee and I would be happy to engage on it when I have the PwC report.</p> <p>  I have not asked anybody to resign because it is appropriate to allow due process.  Then I will certainly decide where the accountability must rest.  However, there will need to be accountability.  Something went majorly wrong here.  On that, we are not in disagreement.  I merely want to establish all of the facts in line with the Government decision and then decide how best to proceed.</p></speech>

With regard to PwC, the company the Minister will use to produce this report, albeit at this late stage, am I correct in saying PwC are also the on-site compliance managers for BAM on this project?</p> <p>  Is the Government represented on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board?  If so, who is its representative?  Can the Minister outline for us briefly, maybe rounded up to the nearest ten or 20, if that might suit, the number of meetings or communications that the Minister had with this person or how he or she communicated with the Minister?  The Minister will appreciate there is a certain amount of incredulity that the person with whom the buck should stop appears to have been in the dark for a long time about a project that is incurring a significant overrun and did not find out until August that this is happening.  At what stage was the Minister kept apprised?  Was there constant communication?  Was there any at all?  We are aware, from the chairman of the board, that he met the Minister but only at social events.  There would not have been formal meetings between the Minister and the chairman, but maybe there were between the Minister and whoever was the Government representative.</p> <p>  On page 2 of the document that we were given in advance of this meeting, the bottom table on comparison of total increased costs under 2.1, increase in quantities, includes a figure of &euro;115 million.  The Minister might tell us the exact date on which he was notified of this increase.  Likewise, under 2.3, omissions in stage 1 design-bill of quantities, there is a figure of &euro;20 million and the Minister might also advise us at what exact stage he knew about that.  Those are fairly substantial sums of money.  At what stage did the Minister know about those?  The Minister might also tell us what, if anything, he might have done to take some action at that stage, or maybe he was just waiting on another report.</p> <p>  The chairman of the board advised us that while there were significant lessons to be learned, he would not change any of the actions he had taken.  That drew a fair degree of response from the committee because the actions taken have led us to this situation where there is a significant or catastrophic - whatever term one wants to use - cost overrun.  The chairman of the board was at pains to point out that lessons were learned.  I am not convinced, but he did say that.  Has the Minister learned any lessons from this?  He might share with us what those lessons are and what, indeed, could have been done that was not done and what will be done differently.</p> <p>  This is my final question, as I have put all my questions together to give the Minister loads of time to answer.</p><p>An Taoiseach has said that projects will be delayed, deferred or possibly cancelled altogether because of this overrun.  There are people in Limerick, Donegal, Monaghan and in communities throughout the State waiting for hospital beds.  They are waiting for vital local projects to put in the capacity we all agree we need.  How will these projects be impacted by the failure to contain the cost of the children's hospital?</p></speech>

I will ask the Secretary General to deal with the Deputy's specific question to which I do not have an answer.  The Deputy made a point about not finding out about the cost overrun until this late stage.  I must refer her to the Mazars report that points out the two-stage procurement process exposed a cost overrun at an early stage of the project whereby with traditional procurement models we would not have found out until after the actual overrun had occurred.  We now know, at a fairly early stage in the project, about a projected overrun, which allows us to focus on what we do collectively to try to rein it in.</p> <p>  The Secretary General will speak to the briefing note that he circulated.  The Deputy can correct me if I am wrong but she is asking when I knew about the specific cost</p> <p>overruns.</p></speech>

It does appear to people that no watch was being kept on the costs.  Perhaps there was but we want to know at what stage the Minister was made aware of it.  The costs did not just escalate in one single amount.  They escalated over a range of amounts.  More specifically, there is a Government representative on the board.  How often did the Minister meet this person?</p></speech>

The Secretary General has reminded me it was 9 November.  With regard to my keeping in touch on the governance structures, the way the governance structure was established means the Secretary General chairs a steering committee and keeps me informed of the various components reporting to him.  The Secretary General and I have had many discussions and engagements on the national children's hospital.  A total of 12 memos has been brought to the Government on it since 2012, including a number brought by me.  This is how I was kept informed of the situation.</p> <p>  With regard to the composition of the board, the future of the board and all such matters, I will consider them when I receive the PWC report and publish it.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked why I did not take some action.  I understand the Deputy is asking the questions but people might like to know what action the Deputy would have liked me to take at this stage.</p></speech>

Expert reports were done and they gave me three options.  I outlined them in my informal opening statement.  They were to proceed, to pause or to retender.  They were the three options that existed.  Deputy Donnelly was right to ask whether there are other things we can do to claw back costs.  We are very eager to look at this and we will do so.  There was no magic option that would deliver the children's hospital with all that was meant to be in it, the various components, the satellite centres and new model of care and not be met with a &euro;1.7 billion bill.

I hate this building a house analogy because it is intentionally oversimplistic.  The Deputy has to remember we are not building houses.  We are trying to do something unique and extraordinarily complex that we have never done before, that successive Governments have promised and not delivered, and that we are going to deliver.  However, if we are to use the building a house analogy, a hell of a lot happened in terms of construction inflation and the type of house we decided to build.  There were also decisions in respect of sprinklers and VAT that I know some people wish to trivialise, and there were many different decisions and elements, all of which have been documented and many of which has been shared with this committee.  The PwC report is going to find out, warts and all, if there was a better way.  It is going to see if everything was done correctly and I am going to act on the findings of that report and will not be found wanting.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked a very important question about impacts on other projects.  There are no two ways about it.  Capital budgets are finite.  If we are spending more on one project, it obviously eats into the available resources for other projects.  The Government is aware of that.  It was aware of it on 18 December when we decided as a Government that &euro;50 million would have to come this year from my capital budget in the Department of Health and the HSE and &euro;50 million from across the rest of Government.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is to return to Government with his proposal for dividing that.  It is a matter for him.  We have been clear and the Taoiseach has been very clear on the record of the D&aacute;il that no project will be cancelled.  Will some be delayed?  Yes, that is likely.  What I am doing is working through the priority projects in my Department and prioritising issues like capacity.  I will agree with the HSE on a capital plan for 2019 in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to transparency.  From a transparency point of view, I have asked a number of parliamentary questions and the Secretary General came back to me today, in fairness.  However, I had to go to the Ceann Comhairle and directly to the Minister to get the information, which was pretty basic information.  That should not happen.  I was looking for dates of board meetings and steering group meetings.  That is a pretty basic question to ask.  I hope it is not let happen again.  I get worried when Departments do not answer specific questions.  I ask the officials to take that on board.  A number of other questions have gone in from me and I expect them to be answered.  Two weeks ago members of the hospital board were here at the committee.  They were to come back with answers to a number of questions from several of us.  I had a load of them.  However, I have not got an iota from them.  That is not acceptable two weeks later.</p> <p>  What happened between August and December is bugging me deeply.  The Minister's Department was told on 24 August and the Minister was told in a submission on 27 August.</p></speech>

There was a figure of &euro;140 million, in addition to the &euro;60 million, and the extra &euro;250 million brought it to &euro;450 million.  On 18 September the Minister answered a parliamentary question to the effect that the projected cost was still &euro;983 million, but he knew that it was not &euro;983 million because he had been informed, on either 24 or 27 August, that it would be significantly higher.  Why did he not answer the parliamentary question by saying it would be higher than &euro;983 million?  At what point after 24 August did he inform the Taoiseach, either formally or informally, that we had a problem?</p><p> There is a real issue with the structures which are quite confusing for the public.  There is a national board which, according to the delegates, reports to a steering committee which is chaired by Mr. Sullivan and then reports to a board chaired by Mr. Breslin which, in turn, reports to the Minister.  In August the Department was informed by the original board of the hospital that there were issues.  Did that board not have to report to the steering committee?  When was Mr. Sullivan told and when did he tell Mr. Breslin?  Did the board bypass Mr. Sullivan and go straight to the Department?  When was the acting chief executive of the HSE told about these issues?  Why was a meeting held in the HSE in the middle of November?  It is clear that at that point it was news to most people at the highest levels of the HSE.</p></speech>

Has the fact that costs have risen also multiplied maintenance costs?  That has to be the case.  My questions are very specific and I ask the Minister not to ignore any of them.</p></speech>

I have made it clear to my officials that they should show everything to this and all other committees of the Houses and share everything with them, as appropriate.  I am disappointed that the committee has not received the information it sought from members of the development board.  I assume that we will undertake to follow up that matter and also presume they are watching these proceedings.</p> <p>  The Deputy has asked me about timelines and what I did after my Department learned on 24 August of the emerging issues.  I was informed on 27 August.  I take the Deputy's question to be about what I did between that day and 18 November when I went to the Government.  On 27 August I was advised that there was still work to be done and that the National Paediatric Development Board had to do work with its legal and design teams as a first step, after which it would be better able to advise the Department on the next steps to be taken.  The board sought and subsequently obtained a three-month window within which to conclude its guaranteed maximum price, GMP, negotiations without incurring additional costs.  That is important in the context of the Deputy's following question.  There were significant commercial sensitivities involved.  As late as its sixth meeting which took place on 19 December, the board was told that there were still challenges related to delays in completing negotiations with the main contractor.  One of the issues is protecting and trying to get the best deal for the taxpayer.  Therefore, there was significant ongoing engagement and negotiations with the main contractor.</p></speech>

I also knew that commercially sensitive negotiations were ongoing.  The question which I have read again was quite specific as to whether the project was within profile and other such things.  The Government had not made a decision to proceed with phase B of the project and contingency planning was being undertaken by the board in case the Government decided not to proceed.</p> <p>  The first conversation I had with the Taoiseach on the issue was in November.

There was ongoing engagement between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on what we were going to do and bringing a memo to the Government to advise on the next steps to be taken.</p> <p>  I think I have answered the Deputy's specific questions.

Everything I say will be verified by the records which will be supplied.  In August the HSE and the Department were briefed on the worrying escalation in the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, process which was still ongoing and did not conclude until November.  Up until that point, as shown in Table 1, &euro;61 million had been declared as the cost escalation figure.</p></speech>

We then heard a very loud warning siren from the development board, which told us that it was seeing work packages coming back from the process, particularly on the mechanical and electrical sides, which were outside what it had expected and planned for.  It stated it was facing very serious discussions with all of the contractors and involved in a commercial process and that it was significantly concerned.  From that moment on, the Department and the HSE were concerned but not fully apprised of where it was going to end up.  We spent all of our efforts in insisting that the development board put every resource into the process, while other things such as external reviews and audits were being undertaken to validate the process.</p></speech>

My main question was related to the reporting mechanism, to which there were four layers.  The question was who knew what and when and whether somebody had been bypassed.  The second question was when was the chief executive of the HSE specifically informed.  My third question was related to maintenance costs.  The first question is very important.  There were four layers - the hospital board, the steering committee, the board over the steering committee and the Minister - on which we need transparency.</p></speech>

This is all within the responsibility of the Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  The other entities such as the children's hospital were not involved in the commercial negotiations which were being fully handled by the development board.  The Department was briefed in November, as set out in section 4 of the review of the escalation in cost.  The Deputy will see from the note circulated this morning that the steering group, which is chaired by the HSE, met on 27 August.  I came back from leave in the first week of September and was briefed at that stage.  We had a board meeting on 19 September, at which we received a verbal update on the GMP process.  We were concerned at that stage.  When I came back from leave, my first impression was that it was a case of contractors doing what they had gained a reputation for doing, that is, trying to extract significant amounts from a process.  That was my first, uninformed, view, but I set about informing myself about the process and went through it in detail with the board.</p><p>The users stated that they identified issues which had to be fixed.  However, that is not the primary explanation.  The primary explanation is contained in the figures set out to the committee today and regards the gap between the first preliminary design and the final design and the shift in quantities and omissions which then had to be costed in that process.  Those costings were only coming through as the GMP process, which ran to November, was concluded.  We were then in a position to make a fully informed recommendation to Government and did so in December.</p></speech>

There was an overrun of &euro;450 million on the existing budget of &euro;900 million.  To decrease the overall cost from &euro;1.4 billion to the original budgeted figure would require descoping the project by one third.  That was the scale of the challenge we faced.  The external expert advice indicated that it would require a redesign of the hospital.  A potential extraction of services from the hospital at that scale could have undermined the potential to amalgamate the three hospitals in the process.  However, a more modest scaling back of the project would also have involved redesigning the hospital.  It is likely that changes to the external fabric of the hospital would be required, which would entail the submission of a new planning application and retendering.  It is likely that it would take three years from that point until one could award a contract and recommence construction.  In the context of the current inflationary environment, we had 2016 prices locked in.  When one factors in 10% inflation in 2017 and 2018 and the inflation over the remaining period, the likelihood is that one would have ended up with an inferior project and hospital at a similar cost to that with which we are presented today.  In fact, it is probable that the project would have been deferred for a generation.  Scaling back the hospital would have left us in the heart of an inflationary market and would have led to a price similar to or higher than the current figure but for a project that would not deliver what it ought.  We would have ended up in a bigger mess.  The current situation is a mess and I am very unhappy with it.  However, we would not have built the hospital if we had taken the action suggested by the Deputy.  The current situation is invidious but we are going to build a hospital that has been required in this country for 30 years.</p></speech>

We must remember the reason the site was chosen, although I do not intend to reopen that debate.  This is not about building a house or a block of apartments.  We had to build the hospital in the location that would deliver the best medical outcomes.</p><p>I made the decision based on the clear advice available to me that this was about putting the hospital on the best possible site.   Deputy Kelly was a Minister in a previous Government that also considered all of these matters.  Co-locating it with an adult acute teaching hospital will provide a level of care and improved health outcomes that would not be possible on other sites.  It is still being stated that the hospital should be built on a greenfield site.  That ignores the fact that construction is under way and that we are trying to ensure we have a hospital that will improve the outcomes for children.  Sick adolescents currently travel from Crumlin hospital to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital to receive cancer care.  It would very much miss the point if one did not try to co-locate those services on the St. James&rsquo;s site.  Ultimately, the hospitals will be tri-located with a maternity hospital on a state-of-the-art campus that can look after people from birth and right through life.</p></speech>

It goes back to the question of whether the hospital should be all about beds or whether it should also have other facilities.  The theatre provision will assist in rapidly moving children through the hospital.  It is good paediatric practice to avoid keeping a child in overnight unnecessarily.  Rather, the child should return home.  It is essential to have good ambulatory theatres and outpatient facilities as well as the five MRI machines of which each constituent hospitals has, at most, one.  The investment in diagnostics, theatres, ambulatory care and the centres in Blanchardstown and Tallaght hospitals are essential to the model of care we are seeking to provide.  Theatres are not an area in which I would consider de-scoping.</p></speech>

It should probably not be considered hot desking but they will be moving around the hospital.  We are not building a hospital with copious amounts of office space and numerous meeting rooms.  On the contrary, we are ensuring that our children have modern, fit-for-purpose facilities which they do not have today, as Deputy Durkan is aware.  Rather than children spending months in Florence Nightingale-type wards with parents sleeping on the floor, we will have single rooms for infection control, en suites, proper research facilities, a school, proper recreational space for children who may not be able to get outdoors, more theatre space and MRI scanners.  A full breakdown of room usage is available and can be made available to the Deputy.</p> <p>  The hospital will revolutionise paediatric healthcare.  We would all greatly prefer for the total cost to be &euro;983 million rather than &euro;450 million more than that.  However, it will revolutionise children&rsquo;s healthcare.  When it opens, we will wonder why we have never before had such a hospital.  I am regularly and rightly asked about lengthy children's waiting lists by committee members.  The hospital will offer an opportunity to significantly impact on those lists through offering far more theatre space and many more outpatient clinics.</p> <p>  Everyone is talking about the project as though we must wait for the shiny new buildings to open.  That misses the point.  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland exists and our three standalone children&rsquo;s hospitals have become one entity.  A centralised referral system will be put into operation this year.   Previously, a child waiting for an outpatient appointment in Crumlin hospital would have to wait until an appointment became available there.  Under the new system, if an earlier appointment is available in Temple Street Hospital, the child will also be offered that appointment.  This year, we will begin to see the benefits of the hospitals working together as one entity in terms of more outpatient appointments being offered.</p></speech>

I am at a loss as to what that committee is currently investigating with regard to the children's hospital because it has no remit or function in regard to policy.  Does the Minister regard the proposal as presented as good value for money in terms of a response to the need to provide a comprehensive hospital system for sick children?  Does it offer the best value for money?</p><p>Can we afford to do it or not?</p></speech>

Not building the hospital would be a scar on our legacy as an Oireachtas and a Government.  We would yet again neglect kids who went through the last economic boom being promised a hospital that was never built because of the parish-pump politics of trying to fit it into people's constituencies on a site for which we could never get planning permission.  We wasted &euro;40 million of taxpayers' money and, more importantly, years of kids' lives by not building the hospital.  While it is extremely expensive, and while it is an extremely disappointing, annoying and frustrating situation, we will get the answers and continue to do all we can to rein in costs.  We will hold feet to the coals in that regard, but we cannot afford not to build the hospital.</p></speech>

He should enjoy her because they grow up fast - believe me.</p> <p>  Every time the Minister and, to a greater degree, the Taoiseach are questioned about the overspend, they start talking about how the children of this country are worth it and how it will be state of the art.  They use up much time talking about the obvious, but I have never heard anyone on the committee suggest that the children of this country did not deserve the best.  I would like if both of them, but in particular the Taoiseach, did not spend two or three minutes saying how great our children are and how they deserve the best every time they are asked about the overspend.  </p> <p>  The Minister said earlier that we are comparing apples and oranges because it is a different time and a different site.  If that is the case, why is he so shocked by the overspend, why did he not see it coming and why did he not say it could happen?</p></speech>

If it is so obvious, why have we never done it as a country?  Every politician of all parties has talked about it since 1962 but no one has done it.  Sometimes the most obvious things need to be said.  The other reason I say it, and I presume it is the same reason for the Taoiseach, is that I have heard well-meaning proposals in the House, which we have considered, that if implemented would delay the project.</p> <p>  On the apples and oranges comment, that was referring only to when people talk about the project from the period of 2012.  That is talking about a different site, without planning permission or tenders and it ignores what has happened between 2012 and 2019 in the construction environment.  It is fair to have a serious conversation about what happened between April 2017, when the Government signed off on this on my recommendation and sanctioned &euro;983 million, and the end of last year, when construction costs had risen to &euro;1.4 billion.</p> <p>  On how we did not become aware earlier, it shows that the governance structure worked because I became aware as soon as all the various structures became aware there was a problem.  My Department did not dilly-dally in making me aware at the end of August that an issue was emerging, but it also did what I expect Departments to do, namely, due diligence and ensuring the expert reports were there in order that it could provide me with the best possible advice when I brought it to Government.  I do not want the Deputy to think this was an easy decision.  It was touch and go because it was such a large sum of money, but the other options did not bear thinking about it.  We could have paused, and God knows where that would have brought us, retendered, which would have ended up costing us more, or variations in scoping, which, as the Secretary General explained well, would have given us an inferior hospital at a further date, possibly for more money.  I am committed to building the project, as I know the Deputy is, and I did not see another way of proceeding.  That is not to say, now that we know about the cost at this relatively early stage of the gross maximum price process, we should not consider every opportunity to rein back the costs.</p></speech>

A large part of it will be funded by current expenditure, through measures such as examining the eligibility framework, reducing the drugs payment scheme, prescription charges, general practitioner contracts - matters in which the Chairman is interested - all of which are part of current expenditure and will not be affected by the hospital.  A important part of Sl&aacute;&iacute;ntecare is funded by capital, such as the elective hospitals in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and the bed capacity.  I will prioritise the measures that will deliver Sl&aacute;intecare and increase capacity.  </p> <p>  While it is true we need to find the money across the capital budget, we need to look at the context.  I am open to correction but I think the State will spend approximately &euro;7 billion on capital projects, while my Department will spend nearly &euro;600 million.  My Department has to find &euro;50 million, as do the other Departments.  We would rather not have to find it but it must be considered in the context of a massively increased capital budget for both health and the rest of the Government.</p></speech>

I support the Minister in his assertion of the need for the hospital.  Anyone who calls for a halt to the project at this point cannot have been to one of our paediatric hospitals in the past few decades.  It is all fine turning up at the accident and emergency department with one's child who has a broken arm, but when going down the corridor to get a cup of tea, one meets children with drip stands undergoing chemotherapy with masks.  One is in contact with all sorts of bacteria, there are bits of plaster missing from walls and there is utter neglect of our children.  For anybody who thinks that the project should be stopped, I urge him or her to tip out to Crumlin or Temple Street on a Friday or a Saturday.</p><p>I come to this as someone who very much bought into the whole project, studied it and rejected the notion that it was the wrong site.  There are some people today who will still talk about a greenfield site.  I bought into the project and the need for parental accommodation, valet parking and the modern facilities a modern hospital needs.  That is why I was so disappointed when this all came out.  I had been one of those who spoke publicly about the hospital over the years as someone who has had reason to use children&rsquo;s services a great deal, albeit more for clavicles, thank God, than for chemotherapy.  That is what is so difficult about this.  We sat here in October 2017 and Professor Hardiman presented a model of the hospital.  It concerns me today that in that beautiful model we saw with the rooftop garden it appears no one thought about what was under it and the design element until stage A was in the ground.  It is almost as if someone was looking at Pinterest for a couple of years and chatting about what sort of hospital he or she might like if he or she ever got the chance to build one.  Having someone sit down to make decisions about what the walls would be made of and how many rooms would be provided appears from the evidence we have been given to be a process that did not start until 2017.</p><p> I note some of the comparisons that have been made on bed numbers.  I agree completely with the Minister that this is apples and oranges stuff.  In comparing this to other hospitals, one is looking at completely different tax regimes and different room sizes.  The accusations regarding international comparisons and data which are being thrown around are of absolutely no relevance to the current issue.  I was asked the other day why this happened and I replied &ldquo;Because it can happen&rdquo;.  I said it here last week also.  Deputy Kelly spoke earlier about the board structure and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board appointed by the Minister in 2009.  Somehow there was a change in governance structures along the way in May 2017 when the new board and steering group was established.  I could understand that happening if the first set of people were looking at Pinterest.  I could understand the need to set up a group of people who would actually make decisions and do things.  The Minister appointed that board.</p></speech>

We have the integration of three hospitals and the legislation and bringing together involved in that.  It is a major body of work to take three voluntary hospitals and put them into one statutory hospital.  Many people thought it would never happen but it did.  That was a huge body of work which consumed a lot of my time and indeed that of Members of the Oireachtas.  The second element involves the operational side, namely the setting up of Children's Health Ireland to run the children's health service.  The third element was the building project.  As such, the idea was to have a steering group to look at those three elements.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's specific question on the board, I have two answers.  She asked whether it was a competency-based board and it is very hard to define it as anything else.  When one looks at members' CVs, qualifications and professional experience, one sees it was not about tapping random people on the street on the shoulder.  That is the first point.</p></speech>

The second point I make is one I made clear in my letters to the members when I reappointed the board in 2017 for continuity as the project was under way.  I pointed out that the Oireachtas would shortly pass legislation giving me the power to appoint a different board should I choose to do so.  It is a power I have today and it is one on which I will reflect when I get the PwC report.</p></speech>

It was a reminder to them that factually the Oireachtas was about to give me a new power to reappoint or appoint a different board.  I have that power today thanks to these Houses of the Oireachtas.  The people on the board were reappointed for a term running to 2023 but they were reappointed in the knowledge that the new legislation would trump such reappointments.  I must now consider those matters when I get the PwC report.</p></speech>

I refer to architects' fees, consultants' fees and external advisers' fees.  We are comparing &euro;983 million to &euro;1.4 billion.  Can I have that figure?  I will understand if Mr. Breslin does not have it to hand.</p></speech>

In retrospect, it may be that we should not have used it.  It is very important to understand that the development board, which is the statutory body being asked to design, build, furnish and equip the hospital, has remained in place throughout the process.  It is a competency-based board and has expertise within it, including property and construction professionals among its staff.  It has appointed a design team which includes some of the largest firms nationally or internationally with the expertise to undertake what is essentially a professional task to develop a design, procure against it and implement it.  The important point is that structures above that are not about designing the hospital or procuring it, they are about a number of separate things.</p> <p>  One of those things is the oversight of how the board is delivering on the project against its budget.  The second thing, which is just as important, is that on the day the hospital opens, a number of things have to converge.  The hospital must have been built and equipped, which is where we are now, but also other important things must happen too.  We have created Children's Health Ireland to bring together the three constituent hospitals to ensure services move over to the new hospital in a seamless fashion.  The third thing is that we must have an electronic health record and ICT capacity delivered into the hospital.  The first matter, which is the building of the hospital, is the job of the development board.  The second matter of the moving over of services is the responsibility of Children's Health Ireland.  The third matter, namely the development of an electronic health record, which will be the electronic health record for the rest of the hospital system, is the responsibility of the HSE.  An important function and part of the reason those structures were put in place in 2017 is to ensure all of those things happen in the right order and complete according to the right timescale.  There is an element of the governance which is about integrating different work streams, only one of which is building the hospital.</p> <p>  The other question the Deputy asked was around the design team.  The figures we have supplied to the committee today are, obviously, an estimate and a budget.  The estimated proportion of the increase of &euro;450 million that is towards the design team is shown at No. 6 in the table on page 3.  Of the total there of &euro;53 million, &euro;28 million involves design team costs.</p></speech>

That was the point Mr. Robert Watt made to the committee.  It is a matter for it to decide how it wants to pursue that matter.  I understand Mr. Watt is accountable to committees of the Houses, including the Committee on Budgetary Oversight which I imagine will have questions about budgets.  It may be having a meeting shortly to discuss the matter.  I know that Mr. Watt also attends meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I will not get into a discussion on which Secretary General does what, but I am very clear, from a governance and legal point of view, that the appropriate Secretary General is here.</p></speech>

Given the projected catastrophic cost overruns, governmental officials should err on the side of helpfulness.  If a letter arrives from the committee, it should be taken seriously.</p><p>The Minister's essential defence is that we are now so far in it would be unthinkable or unconscionable to go back and have delays in reviewing and re-tendering.  Essentially, it is the Macbeth defence:</p><blockquote>I am in blood<br /><br />Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,<br /><br />Returning were as tedious as go o'er</blockquote> <p>It may be true.  Perhaps others who are more knowledgeable about finances than some of those who have been dealing with this issue might make a helpful assessment, but it is a separate question from whether the initial decision-making on the project is the reason we are here.  Does the Minister deny categorically, as I think I have heard him do, that the relative complexity on the St James's Hospital site is linked with the projected cost overruns?  Many will not believe him if he does.</p></speech>

We are comparing the projected cost in 2017 of delivering the hospital project on the St. James's Hospital site with the projected cost now.  We are not comparing the cost with the cost of delivering the project on any other site.  Therefore, I do not believe it is a contributory factor.  Not only do I not believe it but the evidence does not believe it because &euro;983 million was the projected cost of delivering the project on the St James's Hospital site, to which the difference of &euro;450 million still relates.</p></speech>

As a member of the Cabinet, the Minister received a detailed dossier from the Connolly for Kids Hospital campaign, as did other members of the Cabinet.  He was given detailed submissions on why there were problems with the St. James's Hospital site.

What he and others have said is that this really amounts to an indictment of the political class.  We can ask hard questions all we like of hapless officials about how this happened, where the project will go from here and where precisely did it all go wrong, but in reality is it not the case that the political class made the wrong decision and was wedded to the wrong decision right from the start and that this is connected with the projected cost overruns?</p></speech>

I do not question the bona fides of the people concerned and have no intention of getting into a conversation in which their bona fides would be questioned.  Some were of the view that it should be built on the site of Connolly Hospital, while others, including a former Taoiseach, were of the view it should be built on the Mater hospital site.  Some were of view that it should be built on a greenfield site, while others were of the view that it should be built on the site of St James's Hospital.</p><p>Politics is about making decisions and I stand over the decision to build it on the St. James's Hospital site, safe in the knowledge it is supported by the practising paediatricians in many of our children's hospitals.  Many doctors support it.  As the Senator and I know from many issues, different doctors have different views on matters and different builders have different views on matters.  The Government has made a decision.  None of the issues as to whether it should have been sited at Connolly hospital or St. James's Hospital relate to the cost overrun.  If one looks at the briefing document the Secretary General has provided to the committee, the costs do not relate to costs incurred at the St. James's Hospital site that would not have been incurred at a different site.  Truthfully, I do not believe it to be the case.  I do not doubt the bona fides of people who would have liked it to be at an alternative site but we have had the debate not only about the Connolly hospital site but, previous to that, about the Mater hospital site, and all that time a hospital was not being built.  A development at Connolly hospital will open this summer and will start serving children as part of Children's Health Ireland.</p></speech>

We had mismanagement under Fianna F&aacute;il in the past with massive overruns and the evasion of accountability for the same reasons the Minister is giving today.  I am thinking of the Dublin Port tunnel and various motorway projects.  Will the Minister give an express commitment that once the cause of this has been found, the person or people ultimately responsible will be asked to resign?  Does the Minister think the eventual cost will go over &euro;2 billion?</p></speech>

I did not come here today to create headlines on how I will react when I get the report.  I will get it, read it, publish it and take very swift action on what changes, if any, I believe are needed at that time.</p> <p>  With regard to the complete cost of the project, I will be informed by the PwC report and the various work that is ongoing.  The board has received a very clear message from me, delivered on behalf of the Government, that we are well past the outer limits of what the country can manage to spend on the hospital.</p></speech>

We will come back and share all of the information with the committee.  In my earlier answers to Deputy Donnelly, I outlined there are opportunities to try to mitigate costs.  I have spoken about the existing assets in place, Crumlin hospital being one.  I have also spoken about the role of philanthropy and there is nothing Irish-specific in that.  Philanthropy in the delivery of children's healthcare is quite the norm in many countries, including in our neighbouring jurisdiction.  A foundation has been established.  On both sides of the ledger there are issues that need to be bottomed out.</p></speech>

I am not a member of the committee and I bow to the better judgment, knowledge, experience and reading of my colleagues.  I want to make an observation.  We all know there is huge anger among the public but from an objective point of view, this anger is also about the fact we have nurses who cannot live our country because they are underpaid so we do not have enough of them; doctors are leaving; we do not have enough radiographers or occupational therapists; we have 162 consultant posts not filled; and we have people acting as consultants who have not done specialist registrar training.  We now have an overrun of &euro;1.7 billion on a hospital.  The Minister might think the issues are mutually exclusive but they are closely connected.  There is something rotten in the State.  Something is going radically wrong.</p> <p>  I have a very simple question for Mr. Breslin, the Accounting Officer.  Is the design team on a flat fee or a percentage of the cost?  Are the mechanical and electrical consultant engineers on a flat fee or a percentage of the cost?  The cost of Jones Group, dealing with the mechanical systems, has increased by 65.4% and the cost of the electrical consultants has increased by 60.2%.</p><p>Are they on a flat fee or a percentage of the cost?  The second issue was alluded by Deputy O'Reilly.  Will Mr. Breslin tell me about PwC and its objectivity?  Has it been involved in any other aspect of the hospital since the first sod was first turned - before, middle or after?  I know it is carrying out the investigation.</p></speech>

In respect of the design team, he was able to say that it is not on a percentage of the overall bill cost.  It is on an overall fee, but Mr. Pollock flagged at the committee that because the project is going on for a longer time period, the cost of its services will increase.</p></speech>

I do not want to be repetitive but I ask him to look at the reasoning behind the two-stage process that has been outlined.  When we look at what it was supposed to achieve versus how it turned out, we can see that it is contradictory to say the least.  Therefore, I would very much question the board's reasoning, particularly when it came to deciding that the best option for phase two was to award it to the phase one contractor.  Did anybody flag to the Minister that the &euro;631 million price for phase one of the job was &euro;131 million, or 20%, lower than the next bid?  As I pointed out here last Wednesday, to be 20% lower in any construction bid would ring alarm bells at any level, and I find it very difficult to understand why it did not ring alarm bells with the board.</p><p>Regarding some of the figures that were given, &euro;90 million was given for a nine-month extension of contract, including preliminaries.  I ask the Minister to investigate that thoroughly because I cannot see how &euro;90 million can be justified for increased preliminaries for nine months.  A figure of &euro;27 million was given for increased spend as a result of fire regulations.  As I pointed out last week, &euro;27 million would build a 90,000 sq. ft state-of-the-art office block.  That is just to put it into context.  </p><p> The Minister was made aware in late August that there was a significant increase in costs.  On 7 November, the board recommended BAM as the second phase contractor.  Was the Minister consulted in respect of the decision to appoint BAM for this part of the work?  On 18 December, the Government signed off on it.  Why was PwC not brought in in August, when significant increased costs were flagged to review a potential overrun of &euro;400 million that was subsequently approved?  What we are doing now is closing the barn door after the horse has bolted.  That review should have been carried out prior to the second phase being awarded that landed us in a situation where we are at the point of no return and cannot go back but must go forward.  As I pointed out here last week, the nature of the contractor is to get the work and then maximise the money it can get from it.  It has happened consistently with public contracts for years.  The way this contract was structured allowed for a golden opportunity, which the contractor took.</p></speech>

In respect of the GMP, it is important to note this was a strategy going back as far as 2014.  The Government contracts committee for construction also considered it.  While there is no doubt that the Mazars report found considerable shortcomings in terms of the lack of early warning and so on, the report still arrived at the conclusion that it was the right procurement model to use for a project of such complexity.  I do not have the expertise of Mazars in terms of arriving at that conclusion.  The Deputy asked whether I was aware that the main contractor had come in significantly below the previous bid.  From recollection, I do not believe so.  Once the Government makes the decision to award, I do not interfere in the procurement process or I would be answering much more difficult questions here in that regard.  </p> <p>  The question of why PwC was commissioned after the awarding of phase B is a valid one.  When we look at the timeline, it is important to note that on 5 September, when the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was briefed by the design team on overall capital costs, the board then sought and subsequently obtained a three-month window to conclude the GMP negotiations without incurring additional cost.  Consequently, it was up against a clock in terms of not incurring additional costs above and beyond the already agreed pricing.  In fairness, reviews were carried out.  They included the Mazars report and the DSSR report, which was produced by an international consultancy firm that looked at whether there were opportunities to de-scope or de-scale some of the issues.  </p> <p>  The Deputy also asked whether I was consulted about the decision to award the contract to BAM.  Absolutely - it was a Government decision so I brought that proposal to the Government on 18 December.  The instruction regarding the decision to award the contract was only relayed by the appropriate authorities in January after the Government decision was made so, ultimately, it was a Government decision on 18 December to proceed with the awarding of the phase B contract.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-29a.287" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1321" speakername="John Brassil" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019012900002#V00200"><p>I would contend that awarding that contract without having carried out the review was a sizeable error.  The threat of further increased costs is significant, given the &euro;400 million overrun.  I have just referred to two figures but there are five or six figures of significance, about which I have serious questions as to how they can be justified.</p><p>That was a serious error on behalf of the Government and it is an issue that is going to continue to rumble on.  That is unfortunate because this is a much-needed project and I thoroughly support it.  The concentration in respect of the project is now going to be on this particular issue and not on the delivery of the hospital which we need so much.  </p></speech>

I hope the clinical benefits, which Deputy Brassil understands more than most and of which he is very supportive, will also be an issue this committee will monitor closely.  In closing on that question, I need to say that I do not want the committee to get the impression that the Government arrived at a decision to go ahead, or the Department advised me to ahead, and proceed with phase B in the absence of expert advice.   Before proceeding, a significant amount of what I would call due diligence was done between August and 18 September, as well as engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As I outlined earlier, the three options ultimately considered were retendering, pausing, or proceeding.  The decision to proceed was the one recommended to me and I accepted that.</p></speech>

Before I go back to the members, I want to ask the Minister a question.  The opening statement of the Department of Health last week stated the Government made three decisions on the cost overrun.  One was to commission an independent review by PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC.  That is under way.   The second was a decision to do a review of the existing oversight arrangements between the Department of Health, the HSE and the development board.  I do not think that has started yet.  The third decision was to undertake a scenario analysis to identity the potential costs of any residual risks to the capital project.  Does that mean it is anticipated that the cost is going to go above &euro;1.733 billion?  Is that being anticipated in that decision?</p></speech>

In the interests of both time and the taxpayer, I decided to be led by the outcome of the PwC review, which will highlight where the problems were and the shortcomings.  I will then decide on the new governance structures as appropriate.  That is the sequence in which I have decided to take it.  On the expectation of future costs-----</p></speech>

It identifies where the exclusions outside of the guaranteed maximum price are and they are specifically listed in the contract as not being incorporated in the guaranteed maximum price.  They are listed there.  I refer to changes in scope if the development board decided to build something differently, excess national construction inflation above 4% from July of this year and changes in legislation.  The Government is asking us to perform a sensitivity analysis of what could happen to the overall price if there were movements in any of those exclusions.</p></speech>

We have heard from the board, the Department and the HSE.  I have asked all of them whether they believed that what has happened is a catastrophic failure of management.  All of them have said "no".  They stated that they would do things exactly the same and that they do not consider the financial side of this project to be a failure.  I acknowledge the Minister has referred to being deeply frustrated but I have not heard an admission that this is a gargantuan cock-up of epic proportions with massive negative knock-on effects on the healthcare system.  I think the Irish people have been had.  I think we have just been mugged to the tune of about &euro;1 billion.  The Government's own documentation states the tender bid accepted was for &euro;637 million.  That went up to &euro;890 million, then &euro;983 million and then &euro;1.4 billion.  By the way, there is also an additional &euro;300 million on top of that.  Mr. Breslin can come back in when I am done.</p><p>In the commercial world, any project manager who presented that to the ultimate client would be fired on the spot and his or her company dismissed.  Nothing of that sort has happened here, however.  Not a single sanction of any kind has been taken against anybody.  It gets worse though.  We have heard today that while it was clearly possible for the project costs to go up by &euro;1 billion, it is impossible to bring those costs down.  Mr. Breslin stated it is not really possible to bring the &euro;1.4 billion down because, for example, the external fabric of the building might have to change, thereby leading to new planning.  It is interesting that, when the &euro;1 billion was being added in, the external fabric of the building clearly did not have to change because new planning was not required.</p><p> The only real defence I have heard is that the hospital is very important and it is going to be of a very high spec.  I agree with both of those things.  The most expensive hospital ever built anywhere in the world is the Karolinska University Hospital.  It was built in Stockholm which is an incredibly expensive city and it was built to an incredibly high spec.  It has oodles of operating theatres, MRI machines, single occupancy rooms and all of those things.  It cost &euro;1.6 million per bed-----</p></speech>

I understand Chair.  At &euro;1.6 million per bed, the national children's hospital, building at the same cost as the most expensive hospital ever built with a super high spec, would be &euro;750 million.  The costs can be triangulated in all sorts of ways and we still keep coming back to a figure of about &euro;1 billion.</p> <p>  Turning to my questions, the Department found out about this in August and PwC is not going to report until March.  Do the witnesses think a period of seven months from finding out about this to getting the report is reasonable?  When was the PwC report commissioned?  Was a Mazars report not commissioned previously?  How is the PwC report different from that?  Can the committee be provided with the Mazars report?  When did the Mazars report come to the Department?  Is the Department of Health not capable of finding out what went wrong?  This committee certainly has some pretty reasonable ideas about what did go wrong.  For my final question, I want to go back to the PwC report.  I am happy to stand corrected but I believe the Minister stated PwC will be looking at ways to reduce the &euro;1.4 billion.  My understanding is that is not in the terms of reference and that PwC is an accountancy firm.  The value engineering, redesign and technical appraisals needed to look at reverse engineering out some of those costs require engineers, architects and specialists-----</p></speech>

I am not in a position to say that to this committee.  I am not saying that to this committee.  I am saying that I am going to follow the evidence in respect of what could have been done better.  I do not think Deputy Donnelly is suggesting this, but it is not true that nothing happened between August and December, or indeed August and now.  A number of reports were done.  I believe a number of them have been shared with this committee, but if they have not all been shared, they should all be shared with this committee.  I will make sure that happens because those reports do make points that, frankly and respectfully, are different from the points being made by Deputy Donnelly.</p> <p>  I hear regularly the reference the Deputy made to the hospital in Stockholm.  We had AECOM undertake an international cost benchmarking study and it arrived at a different viewpoint from Deputy Donnelly.  AECOM estimated that the cost of this hospital will come in at about &euro;6,500 per square metre whereas an equivalent hospital to be built in London, for example, would come in at &euro;9,000 per square metre.  The study also stated that the national children's hospital comes within the range for similar projects, albeit at the upper end of that range.  I am happy to share all that information.  Much expert opinion was sought, before we decided to proceed with the project, to endeavour to debunk some of those concerns people may have.</p> <p>  There is a serious and ongoing effort to make sure that costs can be reined in without impacting on the integrity of the project.  I accept that none of us wants to do that.  We do not want to end up building a very expensive hospital and taking out some stuff that would have benefited paediatric healthcare.  That is the balance we have to get right here.  We are obviously contracted at &euro;1.4 billion in terms of our capital construction costs as well.  Perhaps Mr. Breslin might like to comment as well.</p></speech>

It is important to note that the &euro;637 million tender cost in table 3 of the three contractors, namely, BAM, Mercury and Jones, is included in the &euro;983 million that was signed off by Government.  It is not that the cost went from &euro;637 million to &euro;983 million.  The cost of the three contractors forms the overall figure along with matters such as equipping, VAT and so on.  The real shift over the procurement process was from &euro;983 million to &euro;1.4 billion.  The point has been made that previous iterations of the project had other costs but that is the real shift in the procurement stage and I have not tried to lessen the importance or gravity of that.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy in regard to its seriousness.</p><p> As for learning, we absolutely need to do things differently.  My understanding is that the witnesses before the committee on the last occasion this was discussed stated they would still use the two-stage approach.  Nobody would claim that all of the actions were appropriate or that things could not have been done to try to manage this better.  We must determine to the greatest extent possible what went wrong.  I have some indications in that regard but I want to see what PwC says.  We will fully implement its recommendations.</p></speech>

An issue such as that is of sufficient importance for him to have checked it prior to his appearance.  He did not do so; he will check and revert to the committee.  That is fine.  However, if I were in his position, I would consider that an important issue on which I would be able to provide a definitive answer.  It is a very easy question to anticipate, given that there has been much public commentary on the nearly &euro;500,000 being spent on this report.  The Minister referred to public commentary.  Mr. Breslin does not have the answer but he will get it and that is fine.  We await his answer.</p></speech>

A person on the board is a staff member of the Office of Government Procurement, which is part of the Department of Finance.  Was there a meeting between officials from the Department of Health, preferably the Minister, and this person who I would perceive as almost being the Government representative on the board and who certainly is there to oversee procurement, given the office in which he works?</p><p>How many meetings were there between departmental officials and this individual?</p><p> Much has been made of the two-step procurement process.  Many people said not to compare this with building a house.  I would not build a house using that process and do not think anyone in this room would either.  In the case of a more complex project such as the hospital, it is possible that that process would not be selected if the decision were to be retaken.  I presume the person to whom I refer was appointed to oversee some of the procurement.  It is a competency-based board.  The person's curriculum vitae indicates that his competency is in the area of public procurement and that is what he brings to a competency-based board.  Did he report back to Mr. Breslin to keep him abreast of developments and to ensure he was well informed?  Was that done via meetings or reports?  How was the information communicated?  We keep coming back to the same issue, namely, that a hands-off approach was adopted and the end result of that was the catastrophic overrun.  All sorts of words are being used to describe it but we will use "catastrophic" for the moment.</p><p> On the financial statements for 2018, those for 2017 have been sent to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Are the statements currently available?  If not, when will they be available?  I ask that they be circulated to members of this committee.</p></speech>

However, procurement experts were hired by the board and the Government contracts committee was used.  That individual was not the person on the board to make the decision on the procurement processing but, rather, was there in an individual capacity for a competency-based board.</p> <p>  The Deputy returned to talking about building houses.  It is fair to state she has decided that the GMP process was the wrong way of doing it.  She said she would not do it that way and would not build a complex project or house like that.  However, the evidence available so far suggests that it was the appropriate model to use for a complex project.  That was the view taken in the Mazars report and by the Government contracts committee and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  It remains to be seen what PwC will conclude but there is currently no expert view available to me that it was the wrong approach to take.  That is not to say that there have not been significant problems.  There is yet to be an expert view that it was the wrong approach but I await the outcome of the PwC report.</p> <p>  On lessons learned, in many ways putting in place competency-based boards and new structures such as this involved learning lessons from the past.  However, clearly, things still went wrong.  The most obvious lesson we need to learn regards the lack of an adequate early warning system.  That is the real frustration for me as a Minister, for the Government and, I am sure, for committee members and taxpayers.  It was very quickly disclosed to me by my Department as soon as a problem arose.  However, the fact that there were no early warning systems or flags coming up the line through all of the various structures is my current significant concern.  We will see what the PwC report says in that regard.  I envisage that governance changes will be required and I will act in that regard when I get the PwC report.</p></speech>

I ask it purely because of the answer to the last question.  It is very clear.  The Secretary General should think about the answer.  Was there any formal or informal discussion or correspondence, in any way, shape or form, politically or administratively, with the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, or indeed any other Department, by mid-November?  I cannot see why another Department would be involved.  I know Mr. Breslin cannot account for the person who sat at the committee.</p></speech>

It is just that Mr. Breslin has now provided more information that we did not have before.</p> <p>  I was taken by the reviews that occurred between August and December, and the Secretary General's honesty when he said he would not change certain things but would change certain actions.  I am aware, from other committee meetings, that the electrical and mechanical issues here cause the escalation.  I asked Mr. Pollock to break down the make up of this figure in August 2018.  I was told that it was made up of the &euro;983 million, plus the &euro;200 million, plus the VAT, plus the urgent care centres, plus the issues with two contractors.  This brings us to the figure we now have.  There are three boards or committees involved.  There have to be groups in charge of electrical and mechanical issues and other areas.  Those groups work in particular silos and have responsibility for those particular issues.  Why did they not flag the problems?</p><p>Ultimately, if PwC does not get down to what this was, we will have all been taken for fools.</p><p> Mr. Breslin flagged the matter of early-warning systems.  Something was quite clear to me from evidence given by Mr. Costello and Mr. Pollock.  Electrical and mechanical engineering were two huge cost bases which arose, but it was amazing that once the user engagement process between the three hospitals and representatives concluded, it is obvious that the costs went up too.  When Mr. Breslin refers to early warning, does that relate to all these aspects, such as user engagement, and electrical and mechanical engineering, or does he refer to other things?  I thought Mr. Breslin's statement was very honest.</p></speech>

User engagement is &euro;21 million of the pressure.  I am not trying to limit the significance of &euro;21 million as a sum of money that could be used for other purposes.  However, in the context of the whole shift in cost, it is a modest amount in the explanation.  It is not the case that users were getting around and saying they wanted more of things, as it were.  It is more likely to be the case that they said that something had been left that was essential.</p></speech>

There is the design team membership with expertise in mechanical and electrical engineering, the build board itself and, through that process, there is quantity surveying and trying to find the cost of something which is found to have been omitted or is additional.  We were told that the costing of the mechanical and electrical work packages were the last thing to be resolved.  That was what led to the very sudden increase towards the end of the process.</p></speech>

Mr. Breslin is dead right.  People who had responsibility over those areas will have to be held to account.  I asked whether they went to tender and got costing for cabling.  They did.  There was one problem, however, in that they did not quantify the amount.  That is where many of the costs will end up and I predict that this is what PwC will find.</p></speech>

For increasing quantities alone, mechanical is &euro;31 million and electrical is &euro;23 million.  For omissions, that is things that were needed but were not in the bill of quantities, the figures are &euro;3 million for mechanical and &euro;12 million for electrical.  That is a very significant component.  Table 2 in the brief shows that the overall increase in the mechanical figure is 65% and in the electrical is 60%.</p></speech>

I thank the group for that.  The increase in costs is fully explained.  In outlining the increase in costs, it is stated that in February 2017 there was a final project brief for business costs of &euro;983 million.  In November 2018, there was a guaranteed maximum price of &euro;1.433 billion.  Can someone tell me from where is the figure of &euro;1.7 billion coming?  I think that I know but it would be useful to know this so that we do not find ourselves in a similar situation a few months down the road.</p></speech>

I will not go on as I do not want to delay the meeting but I will say one thing.  I have had some experience of similar projects.  There is a tendency, particularly when building during inflationary periods, to at least double the cost.  That is just a sad reflection.  I am sorry that Deputy Donnelly is not here.  He referred to the Karolinska Institutet project in Stockholm which went from 14 billion krona to 60 billion krona in two years.  Therefore there is a history relating to hospital projects of which we should be aware.  Last week, the Deputy referred to the Royal Adelaide which had similar problems.  Overruns are endemic in hospital projects and I understand some of the reasons for this.  Each item, be it construction, mechanical, electrical and everything else, has an inflationary tendency.  I hope that the review which is currently being undertaken will identify any fat that should not be there.  However, we should be cautious lest anyone decide that the project be brought to a halt in order to save money.  That will not save money.  That would involve spending money unwisely and would deprive children in this country of the kind of services required internationally.</p> <p>  If for some reason we did not go ahead with this project, where would we gain access to a similar standard of modern paediatric treatment?  Is it Great Ormond Street Hospital, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or what other options are available?      </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-29a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019012900002#CC00700"><p>I am very glad that the Deputy has made this point because some members of the committee, both here and in comments in the media, have suggested as the solution to the problem things that would halt the project.  The project is not being halted.  We are contractually committed to delivering the project and I am really proud that this hospital will be built.  I guarantee that in years to come when children are being treated in this hospital, and in months to come when children are being treated in the Connolly urgent care centre which will open this summer, parents and their children will start to see the benefits of this.  That is not trying to take away from the very significant issue with the overrun, and no one is trying to do so, but they cannot constantly conflate the things and try to dismiss all the clinical benefit.  If people want to continue to measure the cost of this hospital purely on the basis of beds, it shows a massive ignorance of paediatric healthcare because we try to keep children out of beds.  Measurement by square metre is the way to measure this project.  Taking the square metre measurement one can see how this project compares favourably with a similar project to be built in London and how the international benchmark shows the benefits of this project.  People are thinking up different ways to land headlines around this situation.  That is not to take away from the very serious and legitimate questions or matters of transparency and accountability, but nobody in this room will regret the decision to build this project.  We would, however, regret pausing a project and delaying it, and depriving another generation of Irish children of world-class paediatric healthcare because, to answer Deputy Durkan's second question, there is no other facility.  There are a number of adult hospitals but we do not have a national children's hospital.  This is the first time that we will do it.</p><p>There are serious questions that others need to ask as to why, during the last economic boom, there was a failure to build this hospital and &euro;40 million of taxpayers' money was squandered on a site for which planning permission was never received.</p></speech>

I have heard much commentary on this issue.  Only this morning, someone told me how much a five star hotel bedroom cost, but we are not building a hotel.  It is a completely different animal.</p> <p>  Let me refer to the cross-government committee, the Government Contracts Committee, that covered the period between 2014 and 2016.  The briefing document states the contact was the best type to deliver a project like this.  To follow on from Deputy Durkan, the position on price should have been clear at that point.  Based on the type of contract involved, the price of &euro;983 million, or the first price of &euro;650 million, or whatever it was, could never have been the final one.  It would have been much easier if, from the start, people had been clear on the elasticity in the second phase of the hospital project.</p> <p>  Let me ask a very simple question.  Will we be getting something better in 2022 than we believed ten years ago?  Essentially, are we to have a better product for our children that will lead to better outcomes than those on the table today, in March 2017 or June 2016?  I am aware that outcomes are very hard to quantify, but perhaps Mr. Breslin might be able to answer that question.</p></speech>

During the course of the process the project has been refined and clinical input has influenced the building that will be built and the facilities that will be contained in it.  That accelerated once the decision to pick the St. James's Hospital site was taken.  We have seen a massive coming together across the three hospitals of the clinical community to try to provide for best practice in the hospital.  I have no doubt that what is being built is superior to what was contemplated originally.</p> <p>  To answer the first question asked by the Deputy on the two-stage process, I will be frank.  When my Department went to the Government in 2017, we were not informed by the development board that there was potential for an escalation in costs of this magnitude.  Had we been so informed, we would have advised the Government that the two-stage process could produce a result like this.</p></speech>

To be fair to the individuals involved - I believe they have said this to the committee - it is not necessarily a question of the two-stage process.  If the design in the first stage had been approximate, or if it had approximated the final design - in other words, if it had been short in some areas and higher in others - we still would have had the hospital at a cost in or around the cost stage 1 produced or the original tender produced.  What has happened is that in some areas, particularly in the mechanical and electrical areas, about which we have talked, there has been significant under-provision against the final design.  Therefore, there was almost a systemic problem with the preliminary design in that it tended towards under-design to a significant degree.  That has led to a very sharp and sudden cost escalation as the final design is fully costed through the GMP process.</p></speech>

Does he understand the double standards the public believes are at work?  Does he believe somebody should be held accountable?</p> <p>  Does the Minister believe that whoever selected the building contractor in this case has questions to answer about that contractor's record?  This is not the first time the building contractor has massively overrun, both in this country and abroad.  Is the Department of Health aware of BAM's history?  I am not saying anything that is not in the public domain.  In Ballyfermot the company built a leisure complex and there was a major dispute with Dublin City Council over a cost overrun of &euro;27 million.  To add insult to injury, I believe the tiles of the swimming pool are falling.  In the Netherlands BAM built a multistorey car park that collapsed and then there was a protracted battle with the Dutch authorities.  A settlement had to be reached on the cost.  There was an arithmetic mistake made by BAM on a job in Ringaskiddy involving the Port of Cork Company which resulted in an additional cost of &euro;12 million.  For the Beamish &amp;amp; Crawford brewery in Cork, the price tag was &euro;53 million, but then the company asked for an extra &euro;12 million.  In Cambridge BAM issued a cost of &pound;116 million for the guided busway, but the figure came in at &euro;152 million.  Does the Minister know how a company with that record and questions to answer could have been selected?</p></speech>

The Deputy would be asking me much more serious questions if we did.  European Union procurement law dictates that companies can apply and people cannot be excluded from that procurement process.  The Deputy is correct and it is a cause of great concern for us that we see on a number of projects extra claims coming in all the time.  It would be the easiest thing in the world for me to say to the Deputy that that is what is behind these issues, but it is not a large part of the problem.  Looking at the breakdown of the cost overrun, there are significant other elements at play.  It is not as simple as in other projects, perhaps, where we could say there were many additional claims lobbed in.  I genuinely believe that.</p> <p>  There is the question of who selected the board.  The original national paediatric hospital development board was, to the best of my knowledge, appointed by the Government on the recommendation of my predecessor, former Deputy and current Senator James Reilly, in 2013.  It was reappointed by me for continuity in 2018.  When I reappointed the board, as I mentioned to colleagues earlier, I pointed out in the appointment letter to each member that we would pass the new law through the Oireachtas, which we did before Christmas.  It is the Children's Health Act 2018.  It gave me the power to replace the board if I choose to do so, and I will consider my options on the future of the board and the governance of the project when I receive the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.</p></speech>

I am worried about a number of aspects.  Who decided only five contractors were to be shortlisted?  Who decided the procurement ground rules at the start of the tender process?  That is an important question.  When one contractor was awarded the phase A part of the work, was it the only contractor allowed to tender for the second stage?  If that is the story, as I understand it, the contractor would be able to increase costs day after day because it is the only one there.  It is not fair to the taxpayer if a contractor is selected for phase A but it is allowed to proceed with phase B for whatever price it comes up with.</p> <p>  Is anybody in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform really accountable for what is happening here?  PricewaterhouseCoopers is to produce an expensive report costing &euro;500,000, and that amount would do much for the provision services in our community hospital in Killarney.</p><p>I hope it would build two of them.  It looks like a contractor, probably BAM, was awarded phase A and nobody else was allowed to compete for phase B.  Is that right?</p></speech>

The first question was why only five parties were allowed to tender.  The prequalification stage shortlisted five.  People indicated their interest, the calibre of the work and so on and then five were shortlisted for the full tender process.  The five best were shortlisted for that.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the stage B process and the contractor selected for stage A.  This was played out at the committee in previous hearings and it is important to understand that at the stage A process, all the five tenderers tendered both for the stage A work - the basement works - and the stage B works.  They did that based on a draft design with an estimate bill of quantities.  One contractor was then selected for the project.  At stage B, the contractor would have already tendered prices for each element of the bill of quantities.  The design would be finalised and the bill of quantities would have had to be re-measured.  At that stage, if there is an increase in the quantity for any particular item, it must be supplied at the price in the original competitive tender.  That price would have been judged to be better than the other four tenderers.  At that stage, a guaranteed maximum price is concluded, which is a combination of the original prices in the competitive tender and the final bill of quantities.</p></speech>

Five is a very small number and some of these contractors may be found not to be competing but rather working together.  One may know the other would not have the capacity to do the job because it is busy elsewhere or other contracts have been secured.  Does this compromise whoever is paying for this, which is the taxpayer in this case?  Is there a concern in that respect?</p></speech>

There is a really limited number, not just in Ireland but in Europe, with the capability to deliver a project of this scale.  Arguably, getting five into the race was a reflection of the amount of engagement that happened and the design of the procurement process to encourage them to come in.  I am not sure I agree with the Deputy on the point.  If this was a small project and many builders would be capable of doing it, I might agree, but very few people have the scale to deliver something of this size.</p></speech>

Does the witness agree that if the hospital had been built on a greenfield site, there would have been much lower costs in extracting materials from the site and getting materials into the site?  Many people, including me, believe that is where the exorbitant cost is.  It arises because of the confined space in which the hospital is being built and the difficulty in getting materials in and out of the place.</p></speech>

The idea of co-locating a hospital with an acute adult teaching hospital like St. James's Hospital, as well as with a tri-located maternity hospital in due course, was a primary objective.</p><p>I also do not believe, for the purposes of these conversations about overruns, that it is a relevant point.  The cost of the St. James's site was &euro;983 million, and we are still comparing it with the current costs.  That is a slightly longwinded way of saying "no, I do not believe that is the case".  </p></speech>

One of the issues with moving onto a brownfield site is that those works can run into trouble on ground conditions which can lead to a higher cost than estimated.
