    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021072100002#A00200"><p>Good morning everyone and we will start our meeting now.  Apologies have been received from Senators Hoey and the Black.</p> <p>  I will introduce our witnesses, who are going to provide an update on the roll-out of the EU digital Covid-19 certificate, DCC.  They are: Ms Liz Canavan, assistant secretary general, Department of the Taoiseach; Mr. David Gilbride, head of immigration service delivery, Department of Justice; Mr. Muiris O'Connor, assistant secretary general, Department of Health; Mr. Derek Tierney, assistant secretary general Department of Health; Mr. Damien McCallion, national lead Covid-19 vaccination programme HSE; Mr. Fintan Towey, assistant secretary general, Department of Transport; and Mr. Barry Lowry, chief information officer, Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO.</p> <p>  Before we hear our witnesses' opening statements, I need to point out to them that there is uncertainty that parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  If, therefore, they are directed by me to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  Before I call Ms Canavan to make her opening remarks - she has five minutes in which to do so - on behalf of the members I wish to state that we have just received the 17-page document from our witnesses.  It is very disrespectful to our committee members that we are only receiving this document at the last minute.  It does not do justice to the information in the document and makes it very difficult for members to ask questions on matters that may already be dealt with within the document.  I ask that that be noted.  This is bad form, and many members have expressed dissatisfaction with receipt of this document a number of minutes before we started our official meeting.  I call on Ms Canavan now to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elizabeth Canavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021072100002#A00300"><p>First, I thank the Chairman and the committee members for the invitation to meet with them today.  In respect of the late arrival of the opening statement, this is a very fast-moving situation and we are trying to give the joint committee the most up-to-date information on the situation.  My apologies for that which has occurred on my end in trying to get the latest picture for the joint committee.<br/><br/>I am here this morning in my capacity as chair of an <i>ad hoc</i>sub-group of senior officials on Covid-19 that the Government established at the end of May.  I will not introduce my colleagues as the Chairman has already done so.<br/><br/>As the joint committee is aware, the EU digital Covid certificate regulation was developed to facilitate safe free movement of citizens in the EU and the regulation became directly applicable to member states on 1 July.  On 29 June, Ireland joined the gateway, meaning that certificates issued in Ireland are recognised by authorities in other EU member states and that Ireland can verify DCCs for travellers arriving from other EU member states.  On 1 July, go live day, as a pilot run, we issued initial DCCs, including the digital signature attesting to the fact that it was issued by the issuing authority here in Ireland.  On the same day, we had a team working at our ports and airports verifying quick response, QR, codes.  On 9 July, Ireland published its travel rules.  We were one of only four countries to do so at that stage.<br/><br/>The certificate is now fully operational.  Since Monday, 19 July, the Government advisory on non-essential travel has been lifted.  Passengers are encouraged to check the public health advice and restrictions in place in the destinations to which they are travelling.  The public health measures in place for those arriving in Ireland will depend on their vaccination or recovery status and travel history.  If a person is not vaccinated, however, the public health advice remains to avoid high-risk activities, including international travel.<br/><br/>Our approach to implementation of the DCC cuts across a number of Departments and Government agencies.  The role of the group I chair has been to: develop a unified project co-ordinating respective efforts of colleagues around the system; identify potential risks and gaps; and progress mitigations and alternative solutions.  Thanks to my colleagues, we have made significant progress to date on implementing what is a large and complex programme that has required delivery in a very tight timeline.<br/><br/>On behalf of my colleagues, I will give an overview of the approach adopted and progress to date.  Our primary focus was to fulfil our EU obligations in a robust and effective way.  In doing so, we had to be very mindful of developing the certificate in a way which provides the greatest assurance in line with data protection as regards what is sensitive personal information.<br/><br/>First, considering the pressures on the HSE and particular ICT teams following the cyberattack, the OGCIO has undertaken to do the certificate-generation process on behalf of the Government.  DCCs for vaccination and recovery are being produced by the OGCIO using data provided by the HSE.  Vaccination certificates are being pushed out.  This approach has enabled us to get certificates out to as many people as possible as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Where verified email address are available, vaccine certificates are being sent out by email.  Where email addresses are not available, certificates will be posted out to home addresses.  This relates mainly to those vaccinated by GPs.  To date, more than 2.1 million vaccination certificates have been issued, 1.15 million by email and 952,000 by post.  As additional people become eligible for vaccination certificates, these will be issued automatically shortly after their second vaccination approximately five days later.  Where there is insufficient contact information to send out a certificate, the call centre is available where a vaccine certificate can be requested once a person&rsquo;s identity and eligibility has been verified.<br/><br/>Is important to note that the certificates are generated based on available information.  Data to support certification is the purview of the Department of Health and the HSE.  The HSE has multiple data sources for vaccine and data recovery and the data quality is varied.  Extensive data quality work was carried out in advance to ensure sufficient and fully accurate information was available to support both certificate generation and the issuing of them.<br/><br/>There will be circumstances where information needs to be updated on certificates and this can be done through the call centre.  Significant work on data relating to persons who have recovered has been undertaken.  Given the quality of this data and the relatively smaller numbers involved, we decided to provide recovery certificates on a request rather than on the push-out basis.</p><p>This will allow us to ensure that we can complete missing data fields, authenticate identity and ensure that address and email details for issuing of the certificates are up-to-date and accurate.  Recovery certificates will also be available on request through an online portal, which we hope to open later this week, or through the call centre, subject to verifiable evidence of recovery from a prior infection within the previous 180 days.<br/><br/>DCCs for negative tests will be provided through private operators which meet minimum entry requirements.  To provide citizens with EU digital Covid test certificates, providers of Covid-19 tests will be provided with access to the EU digital Covid test certificate service operated by the OGCIO.  Access to this service will allow test providers to generate EU digital certificates for all negative or not-detected test results, in line with national and EU regulations.  Approved access to the system is contingent on test providers being compliant with the relevant regulations and certain standards and obligations, which are detailed in the standard operating procedures.  Prior to receiving access to that system, providers are required to review and digitally sign the standard operating procedures.  A small number of private operators have already signed up to provide DCCs and further information on these providers will be available shortly.<br/><br/>An upgraded version of the Covid tracker app now allows people to upload their certificate, regardless of whether they received it in paper form or as a PDF, to a wallet on their phone.  The tracker app serves as a pandemic response tool and carries a number of functions.  These are independent of each other.  It is possible for people to disable other features and use the tracker solely as a digital wallet for their DCC on their phone if they want to do so.<br/><br/>It is worth emphasising that the issue of privacy has added to the complexity of the task and has been given paramount importance by everyone working on the project.  Data governance has been the subject of ongoing engagement with the Data Protection Commission to ensure the process is fully compliant with the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  The requisite data controller and data processing agreements are all in place.<br/><br/>Discussions are ongoing between the European Commission and third countries with a view to facilitating interoperability and mutual recognition of certificates.  The first country to achieve an equivalency decision was Switzerland on 9 July.  It should be noted that the EU digital Covid certificate is not a travel document and the possession of the certificate will not be a precondition to exercise free movement rights.  Therefore, travellers who do not have a DCC can provide other verifiable forms of proof of vaccination or a valid negative test in Ireland.  Members will be aware of media reports in respect of travellers who have travelled to EU countries without a DCC.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has been liaising with authorities and has been in direct contact with a number of affected citizens.  Our understanding is that Malta has indicated that the digital Covid certificate is a requirement on the Re-open EU website and it has indicated that it will not accept handwritten certificates.  The situation underlines our advice to all travellers that it is essential that they familiarise themselves with the rules relating to inbound travel and the process requirements for their destination.  A great deal of information is available online and I urge anyone who is travelling to check on the online resources before they finalise their plans.<br/><br/>Passengers entering Ireland must fill in a passenger locator form before they arrive in Ireland.  Failure to do so is an offence.  The Covid-19 passenger locator form is now an online form.  As of 12 July, carriers are obliged to check for a completed electronic passenger locator form, ePLF, before allowing passengers to board or embark.  Through enhancements to the electronic passenger locator form, which are being finalised this week, travellers will be required to make a statutory declaration as to their travel status, whether they are vaccinated, recovered or in possession of a negative test and form of proof.  This determines what other public health advice, quarantine or testing measures will be applicable to passengers, depending on the country they are arriving from.  Once operational, the enhanced ePLF receipt will identify those that have a certificate of a European Medicines Agency approved vaccination, recovery or negative PCR test, or who are otherwise exempt from the requirement to have a negative PCR test.  For those travelling on a vaccine or recovery certificate, no further pre-departure checks are required by carriers.  Passengers travelling with a test result will be required to provide proof to the carrier of a test taken not more than 72 hours prior to arrival or will be denied boarding or embarking.  The ePLF is not reliant on the DCC but complements its use.  The ePLF applies to all EU and non-EU passengers, with or without a DCC.  Passengers arriving from designated states who have pre-booked a place in mandatory hotel quarantine will be met at the aircraft and escorted separately from other passengers through the airport building for check-in as required.  Children aged 11 and under do not need to take a RT-PCR test prior to travelling to Ireland.  Children of any age, travelling with accompanying vaccinated or recovered adults will not be required to self-quarantine post arrival.  However, where one accompanying adult needs to self-quarantine, then all children must also self-quarantine, unless vaccinated or recovered themselves.<br/><br/>A verifier app has been developed to support checks of the DCC, which allows a mobile device to scan the QR code.  The border management unit and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are conducting spot checks of public health documentation, including the DCC, at ports of entry to the State for the purpose of ensuring the integrity of the enhanced public health regime.  The verifier app has been made available to carriers, should they wish to avail of it.<br/><br/>It is acknowledged that there is considerable complexity associated with travel at the moment given the impact of Covid-19 worldwide.  Part of the work of the group has been to provide a unified source of information to the public.  There is comprehensive information on both the DCC and international travel in general on <i>gov.ie/travel</i>and <i>www.dfa/travel</i>.  Both websites will be kept up to date with all the latest information.  I cannot emphasise enough the importance of checking on these online resources if you can in preference to contacting the call centre this week.<br/><br/>The call centre has been created at an exceptional pace to manage the required workflows and communications.  This has required an incredible effort across multiple Government agencies to put in place the people, processes and technology required.  An interim emergency line was put in place from 13 July in advance of the contact centre going live on 19 July, given the level of public interest as soon as the first certificates began to issue.  We know there have been long waiting times for many callers and the centre has not been able to meet the level of demand, which involved over 40,000 calls in the past two days and more than 34,000 calls yesterday alone.  This far exceeds estimates of call centre demand based on an assessment of travel bookings and survey or insights data on travel intentions that Government or industry have access to.  Unlike at many industry call centres, these are complex queries, with over 150 scripts developed to assist agents to answer queries.  The rapid issuing of 2.1 million certificates in just over one week has inevitably bunched inquiries to the centre into these initial few days.<br/><br/>The centre ramped up to 55 agents between Monday and Tuesday, with a further 30 to be added on Wednesday.  As agents become more familiar with the complexities of queries, we anticipate that the number of calls handled will increase.  We had technical capacity issues on Monday and increased technical capacity from Tuesday morning through a second freephone number that will cater for a significantly higher number of calls.  An increased number of agents are available to answer calls, but the call volumes are at unprecedented levels and the call centre remains exceptionally busy.  We are adding further agents on a planned basis after training over the next two weeks.  We urge people to only call the call centre if they have an urgent query and they are travelling in the next ten days.  It can only support queries about vaccination certificates and recovery certificates.  We have emphasised this in the communications but the centre is still getting calls from people with requests for certificates for PCR or antigen tests.  These certificates are generated by third party providers and details of how that system works are available on <i>gov.ie/travel</i>.  Current demand suggests that many people who are calling are not due to travel in the short term.  These non-urgent calls are adding significant waiting times to all calls and preventing many urgent calls from getting through.  We urge people to only call the contact centre if they need to and are travelling in the next ten days.<br/><br/>Between Monday and Tuesday, the call centre initially handled approximately 2,800 calls.  Many of these calls involved dealing with multiple requests so they are complex and take time.  For example, there were requests for details for a full family.  More than 1,000 certificate details have been sent for regeneration and it is expected that these will be reissued within five days.  A further 700 queries have been sent to the HSE requiring further investigation before a certificate can be issued.  The call centre will continue to evolve over the coming days with new services added to meet emerging concerns and demands from the public.  A new online form to request recovery certificates for eligible persons will be released this week.  We regret the delays some people are experiencing and we are learning and continuing to improve the service each day.</p><p>For anyone who did not receive their certificate yet who is not travelling in the short term we suggest they wait a few more days as we are working hard to clear the final batches of certificates not yet issued, which is due to incomplete data.  In addition, undelivered certificates by email and post are being reviewed and this may address some of the queries people may have.  These are being proactively managed so that we can reissue as quickly as possible.</p><p> We appreciate that any member of the public who has not yet received a certificate or has an error on the certificate that may need to be corrected may be anxious.  We are satisfied, however, that we will be in a position to resolve queries quickly and unless a person needs his or her certificate urgently we would encourage people to wait a few more days.  The likelihood is that certificates not yet issued will arrive and as the call centre further ramps up we will be a position to deal with all calls more quickly.</p><p> In summary, significant work has been undertaken over recent weeks including the technological developments that were required to be stood up at pace, complex data governance arrangements and the scaling up of all operational matters throughout the end-to-end solution.  The process will remain under on-going consideration with a view to further refining and enhancing over time.</p><p> I commend colleagues across the system for the extraordinary effort and collaboration that has allowed for the data collection, certificate generation and the issuing of more than two million certificates from a standing start in just over six weeks.  Again, I assure the public that every effort is being made to ensure that they can get certificates in good time to travel and that no effort is being spared to resolve delayed certificates and any certificate errors as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

There was a lot of information in that.  Ms Canavan referred to the 34,000 calls yesterday, and 40,000 phone calls over the past two days.  There is huge public interest in this.  The purpose of today's meeting is to try to answer some of the questions that member of the public have.  As public representatives, we have been getting many phone calls from people who are desperate for information.  Hopefully, this meeting will bring some sort of clarity in respect of some of the questions people have.  I thank all of our witnesses who have made themselves available today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021072100002#C00300"><p>I thank all of our guests and I also thank all of the people involved in the Government Departments and in the HSE for the work that has been done in trying to meet the timelines involved.  I am aware that there are many challenges, but there are also concerns among member of the general public.</p> <p>  I will open up by commenting on the issue of the call helpline.  It just does not appear to be working.  It does not seem to be able to deal with the volume of callers.  Was any consideration give to whether this could be done by email rather than by having people waiting on calls?  My office in Cork has been contacted by people who were waiting on the phone for two and a half hours and who still did not get an answer.  Can we look at a better system rather than people having to wait for two hours on the phone?</p> <p>  In media coverage this morning, we heard of the people who had arrived in Malta and who are now required to go into quarantine, a matter to which Ms Canavan referred.  They had cards proving vaccination, but that was not acceptable in Malta.  What can be done to deal with that issue via diplomatic channels?  Do we have someone on the ground in Malta to deal with the challenges involved?  It must be extremely difficult for a family to arrive there and find that they are all obliged to quarantine for the next ten or 14 days.</p> <p>  The committee has received correspondence on the breach of the whole issue of the fundamental rights, the infringement of rights, and what is contained in the app.  Perhaps Ms Canavan or one of her officials will go through that for us.  The correspondent sent a very detailed letter.  The civil liberties group raised a lot of issues, namely that we are not complying with people's personal rights with regard to the data being stored on the app.  Maybe the witness will start with those three questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elizabeth Canavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021072100002#C00400"><p>On the helpline, we carried out some analytics prior to the setting up of the call centre.  We were doing it very rapidly, so we were always under pressure with the build.  Notwithstanding that, any data we had on intentions to travel and bookings made certainly would not have given us cause to think we would have the numbers of calls that we have had.  There is no doubt that this volume is way beyond what we would have anticipated.  We were on a very tight schedule.</p> <p>  Industry colleagues who have been guiding and helping us have been telling me that it is pretty unprecedented to start up in six weeks.  That is not an excuse, it is just the reality.  We did our best to anticipate the level of demand but the indications did not give us any sense of that.  Notwithstanding that, we would like to further automate the process.  As I have said, we pushed out as many certificates as possible for that reason and so most people who wanted a certificate got one.  We acknowledge that there have been some bounce backs and we must deal with those.  There is a small number still being issued over the next day so.</p> <p>  We are setting up the recovery portal that will actually divert most of those calls online, where a person can complete the form online and fill in the data in their own time.  We can generate a certificate based on that.  We are looking to further automate the system as we work through and assess what are the kinds of queries that people have so we can process some of those calls quicker.</p> <p>  There is a lot more information available than people may realise.  We are trying to direct people to the website also.  Mr. Tierney may want to add to this on the stand-up on the all centre.  We are adding capability every day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Tierney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021072100002#C00500"><p>Good morning Chairman and members.  We stood up the call centre using a mixed model of existing call agents across our system.  We are also using support from a private partner.  As Ms Canavan said, we opened yesterday with 55 staff.  We will increase that to 85 by tomorrow and to more than 100 into next week.</p> <p>  In fairness, the Deputy has raised an important point regarding other channels.  We did look at email but our agents have functionality to fix queries at source.  We can resolve the query at source within the existing HSE data systems rather than just creating another backlog that needs to be resolved.  Where we cannot fix data it is escalated to the HSE to resolve.</p> <p>  We hope to launch a recovery portal tomorrow that will allow people to self-serve queries around recovery certificates, and over the coming weeks we will increase additional channels such as SMS, chat, and callback.  This will be over the next two to three weeks.  Hopefully, this will give other avenues or other channels by which members of the public can engage with the call centre.</p></speech>

We do not have anyone on the call this morning from the Department of Foreign Affairs but we have been assured that people are getting every assistance that can be given on the ground there.  Obviously, I will not comment on individual cases but this situation does very much underline the need for people to check.  This is a highly volatile situation worldwide.  The rules are available online about what is required.  If one looks at the rules for entering Malta, the requirements around the DCC are very clear.  They do not accept handwritten certificates.  The rules are either being updated on a regular basis by ourselves and by other countries.  We would really urge people to check with their destination before they finalise their plans.</p></speech>

The Department and the HSE have advised people to check but I am not sure whether the messages strong enough.  It is difficult now when people arrive with the family and suddenly find that they are not complying with the regulations.</p></speech>

The app was developed on a privacy-first basis.  It was developed in a format we call a decentralised solution.  In other words, Government does not know what people are doing with the app on their phone.  The data collected on location and so on is very broad so an individual cannot be identified.  The app was actually developed to meet the best principles of privacy right the way through and it was developed through consultation with the public.  As Ms Canavan said, there are three main parts to the app.  An individual can choose to switch off one, two or all of three if he or she wants.  He or she can choose to use any part he or she wants, so it is very privacy-oriented.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's first question, we looked at various channels to support the public but unfortunately most of the requests coming through the service desk are about getting certificates fixed.  Obviously the same issue applies as it is an issue of privacy and therefore some questions must be asked.</p></speech>

That is what ICCL is saying to us.  What is the officials' response to that?</p></speech>

The Covid tracker app was always more than an exposure notification app and always had multiple purposes, as Mr. Lowry set out.  It is technology deployed as a pandemic response tool and it already carries the function of exposure notification, as the committee knows.  There is also the check-in function, and it is an information platform.  What we are doing here is adding a digital wallet that allows people to carry the EU digital Covid certificate electronically.  Its architecture is decentralised and it has been built on the basis of privacy by design.  I, as well as the HSE, am in receipt of the correspondence from the ICCL and Digital Rights Ireland.  We will be responding to them and have engaged with them over the last while.  An important thing is that as a pandemic response tool, all this infrastructure will be dismantled at the end of the pandemic.</p></speech>

If the app was set out with a scope and purpose confined to exposure notification at the start then the advice from the European body would be relevant.  Instead, we set the app up very deliberately and in public, through the data protection information notices and the data protection impact assessment, as a pandemic response tool with a number of functions.  We worked very closely with Mr. Lowry, across Government and with our data protection office so that was understood.  The functions are entirely separate.  One can turn off exposure notifications, one does not have to check and one does not have to read the update information.  One can choose to carry any or all of those functions.</p> <p>  Due to the vaccine roll-out and the fact the central database was established in April and that the HSE was deploying vaccines as best as possible before that, we had to issue, as the committee knows, almost 1 million paper certificates.  The digital wallet facility on the app is very convenient.  It is completely at the discretion of the individual.  It is completely private where what every individual does is concerned but is a facility to have a digital version of one's certificate.  That was part of our obligations, as we understood them, under EU law.</p></speech>

I move to Ms Canavan's opening statement and some of what she said about call centres.  She said:</p> <blockquote> 	We know there have been long waiting times for many callers and the centre has not been able to meet the level of demand, which involved over 40,000 calls in the past two days and more than 34,000 calls yesterday alone.  This far exceeds estimates of call centre demand based on an assessment of travel bookings and survey or insights data on travel intentions that Government or industry have access to. </blockquote> <p>I am sure Ms Canavan is aware the DCC is also being used for domestic purposes.  Thus when people are calling the call centre, it is not just in relation to travel queries.  People will also have had queries about its use for domestic purposes.  Why was that not built into the officials' assumptions about how many calls were anticipated?</p></speech>

The task set before us was in the context of our European obligations, the free movement obligations and the travel between states.  That was our primary focus and that was what we built on.</p></speech>

We have had Ministers say that the DCC is also being used for domestic purposes.  We have had many people making queries about when they will receive their DCC but also about proof of recovery.  We know that was one of the reasons the helpline was being set up, or at least it was one of the uses of the helpline.  What Ms Canavan is saying that a number of weeks ago, when she and others first looked at this it was for travel purposes. However, because there have been discussions with industry we have known for a long number of weeks that it was going to be used for domestic purposes as well.  What Ms Canavan stated earlier is that we based our assumptions on how many calls we would receive on international travel alone and not on people making inquiries about the certificate's use domestically.  Does she then agree that it is no wonder the system was overwhelmed?</p></speech>

In the past fortnight the Government made a decision on the use of certification in the context of hospitality.  I acknowledge that.  Regardless of what our information was at that point, however, we could not have built the call centre faster than we did, which was within six weeks.  We have stood it up in an incredibly short period and we are continuing to add to it, but, regardless of the additional information we had in the past two weeks and the expected demand, which we could have of course anticipated in the past fortnight, it would not have allowed us to build the capability and capacity any faster than we had already planned.  We have continued to accelerate that capacity.  We put in an emergency line last week to try to spread out some calls.  We have also developed the portal for recovery certificates for later this week in response to what we now know was a much larger likely demand than we had anticipated when we started.</p></speech>

I am not putting all of this on Ms Canavan.  However, the communication has been absolutely appalling.  People anticipated that they would be able to make a call and get a response and that has not happened.  I want to drill down into the information.  Ms Canavan said that 40,000 calls were made on Monday and Tuesday.  Is that right?</p></speech>

We have a raft of different calls and we are analysing all of that to reconfigure the call centre, manage our scripts and look to see what else we can automate in order to manage that better.</p></speech>

The majority are based in Ireland across existing agencies.  They are Government and contracted staff.  Our initial call agent volumes were based on travel booking data.  The Deputy makes a fair point, and there is a wider societal debate on the use of the DCC.  We have already booked up call agents in excess of those initial demands.

My final question relates to a tweet that was put out by the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, on Monday.  He said:"... the DCC is not essential for travelling, you can still travel on your vaccine card or a negative PCR test!"  As we know, however, and as people in Malta found out, that is in fact not the case.  Those people now have to quarantine.  What is the advice from the Department?  Should people be travelling without a DCC?  Are there other countries where it might be problematic and where people might get into difficulty if they travel?  This is all part of the confusion.  To say that we could not have anticipated the volume of calls is to stretch people's patience.  To then not build into the assumptions about the number of calls that the certificate would also be used for domestic purposes, which would drive up the demand and the pressure on the system, will also stretch people's patience.  Then there are the contradictory statements coming from Ministers.  A Minister of State indicted that people could travel without the certificate and that their vaccination cards would be sufficient.  Now, however, people have ended up in quarantine.  Can one of the witnesses clarify what the actual advice from the Department is for people who are travelling?</p></speech>

We acknowledge that.  We bumped up our numbers and put in additional resources to try to respond to that.  To be clear, we anticipated that and did our best to meet that need.</p> <p>  As regards people travelling, it is very important that people do not conflate their right to travel or their right to board with their DCC.  The DCC is an accreditation that is verifiable and accepted across the EU, which tells the country into which people are arriving what their status is.  Those countries have their own quarantine rules and their own domestic policies about what they accept as verifiable proof.  What we are saying to people is that the most important thing they have to do is check what the country requires.  Most countries require a passenger locator form in advance and many countries require people to indicate their vaccination status, or test or other status, as part of that.  All countries that are participating in the DCC-----</p></speech>

No country is allowed to prevent anyone from travelling on the basis of whether they have a DCC.  What countries can do have are domestic rules about public health restrictions and what they accept as verifiable proof.  That is the difference between the two and that is what people have to be conscious of.  The Re-open EU webpage is helpful in this regard.  People can put in where they are coming from and where they are going and it will set out all the rules in detail as to what is accepted, what is not and the various quarantine, test or other rules that apply at the destination to which they are travelling.  This is a highly volatile situation and it is very difficult for us to give definitive advice on any particular country on any given day.  We ask people to make sure they check before they finalise their plans or travel to make sure they have everything they need.</p></speech>

Like my colleagues, there are a number of issues I wish to raise about the certificate and the helpline, but I will focus my questions on the Irish language and how it relates to the certificate.  I am sure the witnesses are aware that the spelling of names containing a s&iacute;neadh fada has been completely incorrect.  Scrambled versions of people's names were printed on the certificates and this has caused great upset and distress for people across the country, but particularly in Irish-speaking communities.  When will a correct version of people's certificates issue to them?</p></speech>

In some cases, there were issues with the data input from some of the GP systems.  In others, it was how the file was set up for processing for print.  The second of these has been resolved.  As regards the first, we simply do not know where data is incorrect and where it is not.  If people fall into that category and if they let us know, we can investigate and reissue their certificates.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that the vast majority of certificates that were posted, as opposed to emailed, related to people who were vaccinated at GP surgeries.  We are not always clear as to the instances where it is the data entry issue arising or where the data is correct but the error arose in the preparation for printing.  We are trying to investigate but it is a slow process.</p></speech>

As Ms Canavan explained at the start, if we could be in a position in which priority calls, first of all with regard to travel, are coming to the call centre, then we can get those addressed as a matter of priority.  The difficulty is we do not know.  We are dealing with health data and we do not know the priority of individuals when we are sending them their certificates.  Some people have no intention of travel.  Some people have urgent travel coming up, but there is no way to discern that from the data we have.</p></speech>

In light of the fact that the mistake was not made by the people calling - is due to the system and relates to both categories Mr. Lowry has identified - can I suggest that consideration be given to establishing a dedicated line for people to contact?  The DCC is not completely bilingual, as is required.  There is a big section of information, approximately eight lines in total, for which there is no corresponding Irish translation.  As it happens, the name of the country is incorrect on the certificate.  It says Republic of Ireland and we all know that the name of country is &Eacute;ire or Ireland.  Why and how did this happen?  Will these lines be completely translated going forward for any digital certificates yet to issue?</p></speech>

It is being corrected going forward.  With the Covid tracker app, if people choose to scan their paper certificates and load electronic versions into digital wallets on their phones, the error relating to the name of the country will be corrected automatically.  I take a personal responsibility for what happened here because the Department of Health is the issuing authority.  This happened as a result of the pace at which the work was being done and it is an oversight I am sorry for.</p> <p>  The structure of the form otherwise is fixed.

It is supposed to be translated in its entirety.  There are some bits of Irish but it is not completely in Irish.  While I am on that topic, the translation is not even correct and there are a number of big errors within it.  What is stated does not make sense.  The phrase "disease or agent targeted" is completely incorrectly translated.  The Irish meaning of that is that the person who holds the certificated has Covid-19.  Is Mr. O'Connor telling me that the whole form will not be available bilingually and that the big errors in the translation will not be rectified?</p></speech>

The data protection impact notice - a shorter, more accessible document - has also been updated.  We have, therefore, fulfilled all our obligations under data protection in respect of the app.</p></speech>

There is much confusion around this generally.  I full appreciate that as officials, the witnesses have been asked to do many things in a very short space of time and some of them questionable.

It cannot be a requirement to travel, just to be clear.  We do not want to conflate those two things.  It is actually a requirement under the regulation that it cannot be used to prevent travel.  It is there to facilitate travel.  It is a proof that all countries understand its validity, how robust it is and that it is verifiable.  That is what it is.  Some countries are saying that is the standard they require.  We cannot determine what other countries will say but the information on what standard they require is available on that re-open EU website.  We would say to people that it is the highest standard of proof for travel within the EU.</p></speech>

We are updating that on a daily basis, in real time, in terms of any issues that are coming up.  It is, therefore, a really good resource for people and anyone who can access the online information should do so.  It is very up to date.  That is our primary focus.

I know this is a very complex issue and we are living in unprecedented times.  The opening statement referred to certificates for persons not vaccinated in Ireland.  How can somebody from Britain who is coming to Ireland as of now, for example, access indoor hospitality as of next Monday if they have been vaccinated in Britain?  How can that person actually get a DCC in order to access indoor hospitality?</p></speech>

They are not the work of this particular group in terms of the standard that will be required.  It is fair to say that as it stands, we have been recognising the NHS certification.  A person, therefore, does not need an Irish certificate in order for it to be recognised.  It simply needs to meet a certain standard and that will be set out in regulations.  For the purposes of travel, that standard is set out in regulations.</p></speech>

Take, for example, an Irish passport holder who is living in the United States, Canada, certain parts of the Middle East or anywhere else.</p><p>If Irish people living abroad come back to Ireland, and in the context of the equivalency granted in this regard to Switzerland in July, what will the time aspect look like for them?

It will be possible, therefore, for people to meet a standard without the EU having declared that there is entire interoperability in this respect.  Our travel regulations allow us to accept certificates once we are satisfied that they are verifiable, robust and of a standard equivalent to what we are getting in the EU digital Covid certificate system.  We have the capacity to do that without waiting on the EU, but obviously interoperability gives us even more confidence.</p></speech>

Vaccines not on that list would not count towards vaccination status under the EU system.  Regarding third-country equivalence, as the Deputy is aware, Switzerland has an EU-level equivalence.  Some 40 other countries are discussing this matter with the EU and have submitted applications for equivalence decisions, so I expect there will be quite a bit of development in this area.  As Ms Canavan said, it is best that this process is done at EU level, but we do have discretion to recognise appropriate certificates.</p></speech>

Someone in that situation will then have to ring the hotline.  What process will be followed in this regard and what will the timeframe be to have such a change made?  I refer to the time from the initial phone call being made to the certificate being re-examined and reissued by email or post.  I ask this question about the timeframe involved because there is great demand and a high volume of phone calls.</p></speech>

The process may be a little faster if a situation is more straightforward, but we are aiming for five days.

However, as Ms Canavan said, there may be instances, and there may be many of them, where we can reissue certificates faster.  When people are enquiring, it would be preferable if they could give us an email address, because it cuts out the need for post.</p></speech>

However, if a fundamental change is being requested, then further investigation must be undertaken to ensure that the health record of someone else is not compromised.  That is why Ms Canavan said that some requests can be a little more complex.  In the majority of instances, if the changes required relate to something like people's email or postal addresses, as does happen, then those requests should be pretty straightforward to fix and it should be possible to get the replacement certificate sent out quickly.</p></speech>

Therefore, we would have to assure ourselves regarding such matters in cases where, for example, an identity change is required.  We must be careful in that type of situation.</p></speech>

How worrisome are situations where people's identities could potentially be compromised?  Nothing is bulletproof and that could conceivably be done, so how concerned are the witnesses about the possibility of fraudulent certificates being issued and people's identities being compromised as a result?</p></speech>

That is why one of the things we have in development is a self-help portal.  However, one of the things we must do is to ensure that the portal is not an easy target for fraud or third-party attack.  As the Deputy will be aware, health systems are often seen to be easy targets for such third-party attacks.  Therefore, part of the time required to build this self-help portal has been devoted to creating adequate security around the whole process, whether that concerns individuals making contact by phone or online.</p></speech>

Mr. Lowry may perhaps have updated figures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Lowry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021072100002#H02000"><p>No, I am using the same figures as those at the close of play last night.  The total number of certificates issued then was 2.1 million.  Of those, 1.1 million had been emailed, 950,000 had been posted and 77,000 were due to be processed overnight.  We expect that those latter certificates will go out safely today.</p></speech>

What is the shortfall remaining?  How many certificates remain to be done now?  How many have had complications?  How many emails have bounced back?</p></speech>

Of the 1.1 million certificates emailed, 7,500 have bounced back, that is, the email addresses are no longer in use.  Therefore, we know we have had a delivery failure with those certificates.  We can only assess the first 500,000 of those certificates which have been posted, but 7,920 of those were not successfully delivered.  If we double that figure up, we will then be talking about 15,000 to 16,000 certificates that did not deliver properly from the total of 935,000 posted.</p></speech>

Are protocols in place with An Post concerning what happens to undelivered letters?  Moving to those certificates that bounce back via email, then, will those certificates now be posted out to the people concerned?  I ask those questions because this is a critical piece of State documentation that gives people liberties and freedoms and access to indoor dining, etc.  I am interested in knowing, therefore, what procedures are in place to deal with issued certificates that are not successfully delivered by email or post.</p></speech>

In the case of many of the posted certificates, for example, we have been told that the addressee has simply gone away, and that might mean the person has left the country altogether or that he or she is now living at a different address.  If we do not have the new address for such a person, or his or her email, then it will be a case where we really need that person to contact the service desk and provide us with information to allow us to resend the certificate.</p></speech>

There is no way of knowing that happened.  The individual recipient may not realise it has gone into the junk folder either.  Is there any way of dealing with that?</p></speech>

It is in the communication that we put upfront as well because we appreciate that can happen.</p> <p>  We went through a very robust process to make sure that the emails that we sent would not end up being treated as spam by email servers.  There is a process of assurance one can go through to minimise the chances of that happening and we followed that process.  That is why we did not issue all the emails in one block but over a period of several hours.</p></speech>

Given that not far off 70% of the population have now been vaccinated, we are probably ahead of a lot of other European countries.  I am interested to know what communication the witnesses have with other European countries.  Given that this is an international document, is there a central office to co-ordinate the digital Covid certificate among countries?  I am interested to know if the witnesses are fine-tuning problems in co-operation with other countries.</p></speech>

We have been involved all the way through in getting early prototypes of the design of the certificate and, as Mr. O'Connor said earlier, making sure that our certificate met the EU standard.  The other big area of involvement is what is called the interoperability gateway.  What happens is that we download the latest public keys every six hours from the other states.  That enables us to read the QR code of another state.  Every time someone in the BMU or in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na switches on the app he or she downloads the newest version of the public keys, which means that if a certificate from another country cannot be read, it is an issue with the certificate not with the Irish verification process.</p></speech>

Like everybody else, I recognise the enormity of the job they have in hand.  We should acknowledge and compliment them on taking on the job, notwithstanding that there were a number of glitches, as that was to be expected.  We acknowledge the magnitude of their task.  It is not that we want to deliberately poke holes in what is happening, it is better for everybody if we can have a seamless, smooth operation of any process.</p> <p>  I commend the European Union digital certificate.  The presumption is that it would be universally recognised but that is not true because countries have the option of introducing rules of their own.  As we know, Malta, which is an EU country, has decided on a different set of standards.  Nobody goes on holidays to be quarantined in a hotel.  It was a huge blow to people who have gone on holidays and may have found themselves in that kind of situation.  Is it possible to identify countries with different interpretations of the rules and to alert the travelling public to that in advance, by way of an announcement or the dissemination of information on electronic media or by whatever other means?  That could eliminate a lot of double-checking or crossing over.</p></speech>

As we understand it, in the cases in question some of the travellers did not have a digital Covid certificate and they were relying on a paper vaccination card or other proof.  Malta&rsquo;s information on the <i>reopen.europa.eu</i>website is very clear that it does not accept handwritten proof of vaccination and that it requires the digital Covid certificate.  To be clear, Malta has done that.</p></speech>

Is it possible to identify countries well in advance so that a tourist from Ireland intending to travel to some other country can see at a glance that there are problems here and that it is not the same and he or she can go to another country?</p></speech>

It really does depend on what the countries are doing.  What we have done on our landing page on <i>gov.ie/travel</i>, is provided a link to the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which has the top ten destinations with as much up-to-date information as possible on the requirements for those countries.  We have attempted to filter out information on the most popular places but the most up-to-date information on any given day on the destination a person is travelling to is on the reopen.europa.eu website.  It is really easy to use.  One puts in the country one is travelling to and where one is coming from and it explains the rules at both ends.  The best advice we can give to people is to check that before they travel, as they are making their plans and right before they depart, because rules are changing.  The digital Covid certificate requirements are one thing but people must separately also check whether quarantine, testing or other requirements may change in different countries.  All we can do is make sure that people understand that information is available, it is being updated in real time and it is their safest bet to check those resources online before they travel.</p></speech>

When we get to a situation where the helpline becomes a need, in so far as the traveller is concerned, can we separate out the ones that require to be dealt with instantly or refer them to a position where they can be dealt with?  We hear stories of people waiting for between half an hour and three or four hours.  That should not happen.  It does not work.  We all know that calls can be backed up and it is impossible to track them with any kind of veracity.  Can we do something there?</p></speech>

We have agreed with the provider that we will review on a daily basis, and even during the day, what the level of demand is and how best to configure our teams in terms of the different types of queries that are arising so that we can filter them and put the right number of operators on the different types of calls.  We have only had a couple of days so we are analysing that as we go, but it will change.  There is no doubt that people are understandably a bit anxious if they get a State document and something on it is not correct or if they are travelling or perhaps they are calling because they worry about using it in another context in the coming weeks.  If people have not received their certificate yet, we urge them not to panic because certificates are still being issued.  We ask people to check the website and over the coming days, unless they have an urgent need, they should leave the lines free for people who are travelling urgently and who need to get their certificate regenerated or to receive it.  We will do our utmost to turn those around as quickly as possible.  We would like to get to a more steady state, but we do understand that people are anxious.  We are urging them not to panic.  We have a very good system for turnaround so unless a person has an immediate need in the next five to ten days we say people should not panic, things will settle down, we will continue to look at what is coming through in the call centre, reconfigure on that basis and we will have the online portal which will again draw people who are looking for recovery certificates away from the call centre.  That is our intention.  Perhaps Mr. Tierney could add something else to that.</p></speech>

The first advice to those wishing to travel is go to the Re-open EU website in order to understand and educate themselves on the rules that apply in destination countries.  Ms Canavan is right; we are looking at the shape of the calls coming in every day.  When a person rings the phone number, they are, depending on their query, prompted into a stream.  We monitor the shape of those calls over the day.  We readjust with extra resources.  Today and yesterday, we have put in more agent support.  As Ms Canavan stated, we have 150 different individual scripts for our call agents.  They need support as well, so we have increased both our support to our call agent staff and overall numbers.  Tomorrow, and in the coming weeks, we will add different channels to allow people to engage with the service and to meet their needs.</p></speech>

There are two parts to the process.  The first is the recognition of the QR code in a country.  The second is that they update their travel rules.  The Deputy is right.  However, we are entirely dependent on other countries to go through the process correctly.  In the early days when there were teething problems, we found that they do not always do that.  Without naming specific countries, people from some countries came in with certificates that were not correct.  We could not read the certificates with our verifier app.  When we investigated that, we found that they had not engaged with the EU system properly.  The error was at their end.  We are dependent on countries keeping the EU interoperability portal current.  There is not a lot Ireland can do, other than to make that representation by means of our health engagement through the committee, which we can do.</p></speech>

Incidentally, the opening statement Ms Canavan circulated is 17 pages long.  There is a lot of information contained in that document, yet it does not contain all the minutiae that are both available and necessary.  My broader point is that, for everyone concerned, the document will eliminate a lot of the initial difficulties.  How fast can we gather all the necessary information that relates to EU countries and put it together in such a way that will prevent the kind of thing we read and heard about in the past few days?</p></speech>

I am one of those people whose name is in Irish on their on the vaccination card.  I changed it mid-stream because I realised that was the direction in which we were going.  Many people have been in touch with me about this matter.  Their names are different on their passports and so on.  I have raised this with Ministers.  It was as if they were hearing it for the first time.  It is not unusual for Irish people to have different names on their passports, birth certificates or whatever.  Part of the difficulty is that people could have three different names and any of those could be on their documentation.</p> <p>  I also wanted to ask about people from the North of Ireland.  Questions have been asked about other jurisdictions.  Consider, for example, a person from the North of Ireland who could have been vaccinated there but who lives in the South or someone from the North travelling through Dublin or whatever.  We were told that they would have their own digital certificate which would suffice.  Do we have any more up-to-date information for those people who are travelling?  Many of them travel through Dublin, Cork, Knock, or wherever else; they travel around southern airports to get to European destinations.  Is there information for that cohort of people who regularly use Irish airports?  They are Irish citizens, but they may have been vaccinated in the North or elsewhere.</p></speech>

This is a digital certificate.  That is our understanding.  We consider that to be of equivalent standard and, therefore, we accept it.  I will check that that information is on the website.  However, we are satisfied that it is clear.  There are other issues relating to people who have been partially vaccinated or who may have received their first vaccination shot in one jurisdiction and their second in the other.  We are looking at that.  Would Mr. McCallion like add anything?</p></speech>

We will then have evidence of the first vaccination.  We provided the second vaccination so we can provide the certificate as normal.  If someone had a first vaccination in Ireland and gets the second vaccination in another member state, we would expect that member state to treat the matter in the same way.</p></speech>

There are reports that airlines that have not been checking for PCR or antigen tests.  Have you been made aware of this?  What are you doing to address it?  The system operates effectively, and people have confidence in it.  Again, the reports are from people who travelled and who were not checked for their PCR tests or for digital certificates on the Irish side.</p></speech>

Again, we have seen difficulties in respect of Malta.  There was mixed information there.  It would be, I imagine, much better for people if everything was checked on the Irish side, before they actually land in another country and are faced with all those difficulties.</p></speech>

Carriers are doing what the other countries have asked them to, in terms of their destination.  What we can tell you is in terms of what we have asked the carriers to here, in terms of anyone travelling into Ireland.  Would Mr. Towey be able to provide an update on what we have been saying to carriers, and what they have been checking for us?  After that, Mr. O'Connor can talk about the enhanced passenger locator form.  The latter will assist carriers further in filtering the passengers for whom they need to see the test results.</p></speech>

I suppose the first issue that the carriers address is in terms of the online check-in.  They require travelling passengers to complete a checklist in terms of not having symptoms of Covid and being aware of the requirements relating to travel.  At the point of boarding, all carriers are checking that travellers have evidence that they have completed the passenger locator form.  They are also checking that there is evidence that a person has a negative PCR test, which is the primary public health control that we have been implementing for some time.  Of course, the new requirements in respect of travel that have been applied since Monday mean that persons who are vaccinated or who have recovered and have confirmation of that through a DCC do not require a negative PCR test.  We are now expanding the passenger locator form to capture passenger declarations according to the specificity of the health status under which they are travelling, which could include a DCC, other evidence of vaccination that is acceptable, evidence of recovery, etc.  The airlines and ferries will continue to check at the departure that those declarations have been made and, where applicable, they will continue to check evidence of negative PCR tests.</p></speech>

What is the system there?  Is it based on the length of time since someone got the second dose of vaccine?  Some people are saying that they were only vaccinated a week ago and have got the certificate, while there are others who were vaccinated a number of weeks ago, more than a month ago or even longer, and they have received nothing in the post.  What is the system we are using?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elizabeth Canavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021072100002#L00300"><p>To begin with, we effectively had a massive backlog of everybody whom we had information on.  Some of the people who maybe were vaccinated earlier who did not received their certificate yet may either, most likely, have been a bounce back - an incorrect postal address - or be one of a small number remaining in a category that I will let Mr. McCallion talk about in a moment.  Once a person receives his or her second dose, that data is now being updated and that data file is being made available for the purposes of generating the certificates.  On an ongoing basis, we are releasing that information once the second dose of vaccine has been administered.  People are seeing a reasonably quick turnaround once that data gets into the OGCIO system.  That is where we are at on that.</p> <p>  A person is not eligible for a certificate of recovery until 11 days after being tested.  Once a person has passed that milestone, he or she is eligible and can apply.  That certificate will be valid for 180 days.</p> <p>  Does Mr. McCallion want to say a little about the other certificates we have not been able to issue yet?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.192" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien McCallion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021072100002#L00400"><p>Yes.  There are two key points.  The first is that there is a process for all those who have been vaccinated.  Every day we have new people getting their second dose and, as Ms Canavan said, it is a record of a medical event.  We turn those around to Mr. Lowry's team and the people involved then get their certificates.  There is a process in terms of any rebounds, be they email or letters, which can be dealt with from there.  Hopefully, as we get over this initially hump, that will be much smoother for people in terms of the timeframe.  If we take it that most EU member states are insisting that people wait that period, be it for 14 days, before using it, that should not present any issues on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  On the certificates we are still working on, we still have a small proportion, particularly going back to the early days of the programme when there was pressure on hospitals, long-term care, healthcare workers, etc., and where minimal information was, perhaps, provided or incorrect data may be there that we are working through.  There are approximately 150,000 of those left and we are working through them.  We have a team involved, and the number outstanding is decreasing every day.  The number would have been much larger at the start.  We take the data from GPs, pharmacies, the National Ambulance Service and community vaccination teams.</p> <p>  The public portal is much easier because we have verified email addresses for people.  We still get some rebounds from that, maybe where people have changed email address or whatever, but, in the main, it is quite a reliable pathway.  The other pathways are more complex.  Obviously, it depends on the information that is collected at the point of vaccination.  Clearly, there was no minimum data set required, for example, for the digital certificate when the vaccination programme commenced in January.</p> <p>  We are working through those fairly quickly.  There are some complex cases in terms of names, addresses and other information.  We have teams working to validate that information with GPs, hospitals, long-term care facilities and other such settings.</p> <p>  As already stated, nearly 2.2 million certificates have been issued.  That number will certainly be reached today.  The vast majority of those are out.  We will deal with those that come back through the post and email, as Mr. Lowry outlined.  We are still working through the final group with which there are issues in terms of the data that was collected.  That might be the reason, as the Chairman stated, a person who was vaccinated four to six weeks ago has not received a certificate and someone who was vaccinated in the past four or five days would have received his or hers.  That is the sort of mix.  Once we get over this hump, there is a smoother process that will allow the production of certificates to run on an ongoing daily basis.  As stated, given the requirement for that sort of period after the vaccine to be extended, that will not present any issues for people.  This is just a critical phase to get through.</p></speech>

The HSE might also consider providing an email address for elected representatives because of the volume of cases that we are getting.  We have an issue in relation to people with literacy skills, difficulties with using information technology, IT, etc.  People go to elected representatives or others.  It would be useful if there was some sort of hotline or way for people making those representations.</p> <p>  There are a couple of the members looking to get back in.  Deputies Shortall and Cullinane have indicated.  I call Deputy Shortall.</p></speech>

Following on from the previous question, I have had a few complaints from people who are in their 70s and who were vaccinated by their GPs at an earlier enough stage.  These would seem to be straightforward cases, but those involved have not yet received their certificates.  Is there an issue with GPs?  I am wondering why it would be the case that the people to whom I refer have not received their certificates yet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.195" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien McCallion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021072100002#L00700"><p>There is not necessarily an issue globally with GPs, but there, for example, be a problem with some of the details around the addresses.  We parsed all the addresses to see did we have a number of lines and an Eircode, and we released certificates where we had one address line and an Eircode.  As the Deputy will understand, we have had cases where, for example, a person might be living in Santry and where the only address line provided was Main Street.  Someone might know where that person lives, but, in terms of feeding the information through our system, the certificate would not be sent out.  Those are the types of cases we are working through and trying to get closed off.</p> <p>  People will get their certificates.  If there is an immediate requirement, as Ms Canavan and others have said, they can contact the helpline.  If not, we are still working through the cases in question.  In terms of that process that we are going through in the context of the data, the Deputy can rest assured that they will get them.  We have a team which is linking back with GPs to verify that the information is accurate in circumstances where it is not comprehensive or where it comes back into the call centre because the postal address or email address has not been sufficient.  We used some email addresses from GPs as well to try and accelerate the process.  We knew there was a slight risk that some of those would come back.  Those will be posted or we will go and try and find the postal address if there is none there by working with the GPs on that.</p></speech>

Most people who received the vaccine from their GPs expected to get letters.  That is what they were being told initially, but Mr. McCallion is saying that some of those will get emails instead.</p></speech>

The vast majority though, I would say to the Deputy, are postal.  As a general rule, the GP addresses in the main are postal, but there would have been a small proportion where an email address might have been provided and we would have used that where we felt it safe to do so.</p></speech>

They should check that.</p> <p>  There is one other point I wanted to raise with Ms Canavan.  It has been reported that in the case of hospitality the DCC on its own may not be sufficient and that consideration is being given to requiring people to produce identification along with a DCC.  Could Ms Canavan comment on that?</p></speech>

Those discussions are happening with representatives of the hospitality and the relevant Departments and when they conclude, we will have to look at regulations.

All our questions today relate to travel, and we know the certificate will also be used for domestic purposes.  Many of the details are still being finalised, but the system is to come into operation on Monday.  I ask that a briefing be given to members of the health committee, if they so choose, on the matter.  There will be many questions about how this will work.  We had a briefing some weeks ago but there have been changes in the guidelines that seem to have been agreed with the industry and so on.  There is also the question of how the app will be used.  These are reasonable questions so I ask that a briefing would be arranged for us, if possible.</p> <p>  There is the question regarding the issuing of the DCC to people who are Irish citizens but who live abroad.  There is also the matter of Irish citizens living in the North.  I have heard the witnesses indicate that a citizen who lives in the North and who has an Irish passport will get an NHS proof of vaccination.  That does not answer the question as to whether such people can avail of a DCC here.  Is the latter possible?  The EU website indicates that EU citizens who have been vaccinated in a non-EU country can request certificates from the member state of their nationality or residence.  It also indicates that certificates will be issued if there is proof of vaccination and if the structure of the health system allows for it.  Is that possible here in respect of citizens in the North?  What will be possible for people who live outside the State?</p> <p>  I made an important point earlier.  It was not a criticism of any of the officials, who are doing their best.  In answering questions on advice for people who are travelling, the witnesses gave very good advice that people should check the website and travel advisory criteria for the countries they are travelling to.  The witnesses indicated that this is complex and that while there is a DCC system in place which should ensure that people are not prevented from travelling, each member state will have its own criteria for points of entry.  I go back to the messaging from the Government, and not necessarily just the tweet that was mentioned.  It seems to suggest that if a person does not have a DCC, he or she will be okay with just a vaccine card.  It seems incredibly risky for people to take that advice and travel with just a card.  To be clear, is it the view of the witnesses that people should really look at travel advisory criteria for the country to which they are travelling, rather than take it for granted that a vaccine card will be accepted?  Is that the advice from the Department?</p></speech>

The possibility of issuing certificates is there.  We have not yet put in train an option for citizens residing elsewhere.  We just have not got to it.  From a logical point of view, we are conscious that a vaccination is a medical event and that those who can certify that medical event are the authorities in the state in which it occurred.  We have not yet had the chance to look at the possibility of issuing certificates to Irish citizens where we can verify that the event happened in another state.  We intend to look at that, but we just have not got to it yet.</p></speech>

That is absolutely the case.</p> <p>  On the second point, I stated earlier that people should be very clear that this is complicated.  On the one hand, there is the standard of proof that a country might require, which is the problem in the Malta case.  The second issue relates to the rules applying on arrival into a country, depending on a person's status.  These are two different aspects and people must be really clear in their minds about the requirements, whether they are vaccinated, recovered or certified with a test result.  That is the first point.  People must also look at what proof a country requires.  Some countries do not accept test results, for example, and they only let in people without quarantine if they are vaccinated.  They do not accept people who have recovered from the virus.  If a person is relying on one of these elements, he or she must determine the standard of proof.  It is all there on the Re-open EU website, which is very helpful.  That is my best advice to people.</p></speech>

This has been very helpful and much information has been given today.  If we have a message for people thinking of travelling, it is that they should not think of travelling without a DCC.  People may be able to travel but might have to quarantine and we must get that message to people.  The information is useful.</p> <p>  There is a request for additional information as this rolls out.  We have touched on some of the issues but the situation is unfolding, as everybody has admitted.  Part of the difficulty is that this matter crosses a number of Departments and that different Ministers were giving different information on who is in charge, including the Department of the Taoiseach and the Departments dealing with health, travel, etc.  If the witnesses could have a briefing for elected representatives - it does not necessarily have to be for health committee members - it would be useful when there is some sort of clarity, particularly with regard to indoor dining and so on.</p> <p>  There will still be many questions about the possibility of people travelling and so on.  The demand is there, and we have seen the number of phone calls.  Any criticism is not of the officials.  We could be critical of the Government if we are trying to determine who is in charge and how it is being rolled out.  Ultimately, some really useful information has been imparted this morning.</p> <p>  We will be adjourning now until we meet again in public session when the D&aacute;il resumes after the summer recess.  I wish everybody a happy and safe summer.</p></speech>

This is very much in line with some of the parliamentary questions we have received earlier, such as the debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth.</p> <p>  I hope to answer most of the Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s questions and will answer them in order.  In reference to the purpose of the Irish language panels, the first key point is about ensuring that we meet the demand for Irish language posts in the civil service.  The Deputy pointed out, based on the report from An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, that circa 0.4% of roles require Irish at the moment.  We believe &ndash; I am sure Dr. Mac Cormaic while come in on this point later &ndash; that as the Bill comes to fruition there will be more Irish language posts available across both the public and civil services.  We also said that we hire about 1% of people on the Irish language side, therefore, we more than meet the current demand.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, he is correct that the CO and EO grades are where most of the roles are.  That typically accounts for nearly 50% of civil service positions.  In terms of the opportunities, it is not just about the roles that are available.  I would ask that we consider the level of applications.  On a like-for-like basis on the CO panels, English-bilingual versus the Irish-only, there is about a 1:93 difference in the applications.  We believe that by offering people the opportunity to apply for both, aids people who have the Irish language.</p> <p>  In terms of the next question about where one is most likely to get promoted out of, that is both a-----</p></speech>

One is, by offering both panels, we are giving more opportunities to Irish speakers.  Also, in the English panel, people can sign up to be considered for Irish.  In terms of the statistics provided, 2.3% of applicants said they had Irish proficiency.  That has not been tested on those applications.  We look to ensure we can meet the demand by having an Irish-only panel and by having an opportunity from the bilingual panel.  Panels are there to meet demand.  They also run over a certain timeframe.  They are not always filled all of the time.  Our first goal is to ensure we have people available for Irish language roles.

As I understand it, the practice in the past of awarding in or around 10% worth of extra marks for successful applicants who could speak as Gaeilge was felt to be quite discredited in that it did not recognise competency in the wider sense and perhaps gave a bias to people who could speak Irish but who may not necessarily have been able to do the job.  The sense now is that it would be important that people would actually be able to do the job.  While I would not necessarily agree with the Senator that everybody should be proficient in Irish, it would be highly desirable that they would be, which is part of the aspiration in the Bill.</p></speech>

We absolutely accept that the pool coming through is far too low, which is essentially our main challenge.  It is not that there is no opportunities as there clearly are.  From a wider Civil Service point of view we need to be speaking to potential aspirants to Civil Service careers at the decision points in their journey.  Clearly, that is people who are coming up to do their leaving certificate and to qualify in college.  Even from the point of view of recruiting the kind of skills that the Civil Service is going to need, we need to be targeting those cadres anyway at those particular points in their decision-making process.  That also affords us the opportunity in the context of what career opportunities may be available to indicate what those possibilities in Irish language posts are or posts in which we would welcome people who can converse in the Irish language.  That will be part of a strategy we will be deploying in consultation with the Public Appointment Service which is in turn part of the Civil Service ten-year renewal plan.</p> <p>  I cannot speak specifically for what is happening in education but my colleague, Dr. Mac Cormaic can.  My understanding is that there is some thinking within the educational system about aligning the teaching of Irish with the accepted standardisation for the speaking of foreign languages which would seem to us to make a lot of sense in terms of our ability to recruit people with that level of proficiency to the Civil Service.  This is assuming, of course, that we can convince people as we speak to them at the decision points in their careers about those opportunities.</p></speech>

A key component of that action plan is the recognition of the targets that will be set out in this Bill, assuming it is passed, which I have no doubt it will be.  In the manner of the Civil Service renewal process, Civil Service Renewal 2030, the expectation is that cross-Department and cross-office there will be an action plan which will identify where the key levers are in creating that awareness and desire that the Senator has just referred to.  Clearly, as I said earlier, the aim is to then target people at decision points in their careers.</p> <p>  The other thing, taking on board the Senator&rsquo;s point, is that we have in a sense a captive audience of 41,000 civil servants.  The indication is that from looking at the take-up of opportunities in our OneLearning Civil Service training initiative, there seems to be an increasing desire on the part of civil servants for their own developmental purposes to pursue learning and training in the Irish language.  There are therefore a number of opportunities which we hope to leverage in the context of our ten-year plan.</p></speech>

Formally, the Department has no structure in place in that regard.  Looking again at the wider diversity challenge in the Civil Service and indeed in the public service, that is again a key call-out in our Civil Service Renewal 2030 strategy.  We will certainly be seeing to how we can leverage that desire on the part of people again to create and support networks which will obviously include people who would wish to converse as Gaeilge, even if it is just socially in the course of their work.</p> <p>  Returning to the target issue which is very much the focus of our thinking, no one solution is going to solve this particular issue.  There needs to be a multiple range of initiatives in order to achieve this quite challenging target.</p></speech>

This is not necessarily to do with their career etc. although it clearly would help, but it is to encourage them to speak Irish.  The indications are that the take-up of that opportunity over recent years is increasing.  This would seem to suggest to us that there is a desire on the part of civil servants across the board to speak the language.  One of the key things that we need to do in our strategy is to discover how to leverage that.  One of the challenges that we have, as I set out in the statement, is that there is a nervousness on the part of the civil servants who have a fluency in Irish that if they put their hand up and ask for that to be recognised, they end up in a situation where they become the go-to person for every Irish language query in a Department.  If that image is very much to the fore it will not encourage people to come forward so we have to break down that particular culture also.  The fact that take-up is occurring in OneLearning, notwithstanding that concern, is a pretty positive situation.</p></speech>

The Deputy&rsquo;s question is to show us the benefits - statistically I am interpreting - of that approach.</p> <p>  As I said to the Deputy earlier, on the 20% aspiration, we see that there is a short-term, medium-term and long-term approach.  We have talked about the long-term approach regarding education.  Since I appeared before this committee under the chairmanship of the Deputy we have put in place a number of initiatives as to how we advertise, communicate and, obviously, deal with the competition process.  We are not getting the numbers so we need to go back and look at that again.  My concern based on all of the evidence and some of the research that is available to me is that it is the pipeline coming through that is the main issue and not the competition status although I absolutely accept that we should look at everything, including the competition status and the suggestions made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p></speech>

I cannot speak for that Department.  The Deputy made a point on proficiency.  Level B2 on the common European reference framework for languages is the most widely cited standard for demonstrating basic proficiency in any language in a professional context.  It is also the level which the Public Appointments Service requires for general posts in the Civil Service.  I believe the question the Deputy is raising is that, given that people are stating they do not feel proficient despite having come out of secondary school in recent years with perhaps even an honours qualification, could the leaving certificate incorporate the European framework levels, allowing future civil servants to recognise their own proficiency?  I am not certain where the Department of Education is in that regard.</p></speech>

The Deputies and Senators will be aware of the recent Government decision to encourage strongly the take-up of blended working across the Civil Service and public service.  My Department is leading the negotiations on that with the relevant social partners.  Without going into the detail of those discussions, which are due to commence formally next week subject to a couple of governance issues being resolved, the approach that is likely to be taken is to allow individual Departments and offices to determine their own approach to blended working.  We will not be prescribing what it should look like in various offices.  A number of organisations have asked if we have an issue with Irish speakers working from home.  Subject to the organisational requirements of the Departments, we do not.</p><p>We will be actively encouraging Departments to devise arrangements that suit their business models.  If there is a challenge associated with hiring people who are proficient in Irish which relates to location or the cost of living in the city, blended working would seem a very appropriate option.  The Deputy also made reference to hubs.  That is not on our immediate agenda.  There does not appear to be any immediate need for that within the Civil Service but that situation could change as we roll out blended working arrangements, which it is intended to do over the course of autumn, winter and the first quarter of next year.</p></speech>

The Deputy also asked about a wider issue in the context of blended working.  I will take that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.335" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rob O'Toole" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SC12021072100002#J00600"><p>There are two points to mention with regard to the mobility scheme.  The first is that it is for the Department to decide where roles are based.  The more senior roles, such as principal officer and assistant principal level for example, are advertised and sent out.  The location is decided by the organisation.  The Deputy is correct.  Moves under the mobility scheme are permanent.  That is an important point.  With regard to mobility at the level of clerical officer and executive officer, if there is a requirement for Irish, it is possible to move down the panel.  At those levels, your position on the list is based on length of service.  That applies to the lists for all areas across the country.  However, if there is a specific requirement for Irish, it is possible to move down the list to someone who is available.</p> <p>  To go back to a point Deputies have made on recruitment, we said we would take Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's points away with us.  With regard to defining competitions, there are two separate streams.  One is the dedicated Irish competitions about which I have spoken.  The other is the non-bilingual competition, which is focused on English.  Candidates for this panel are able to express a preference for an Irish role.  Those are better definitions but that does not take away from us coming back to answer those questions at the next level.</p></speech>

While we have come out of what might be termed an experiment, which is unsustainable in many respects because of the demands it placed on people, we are going into quite a new environment with blended working.  The current thinking is that your right to a blended working arrangement is by reference to your role.  It is not personal to the jobholder.  If somebody decides to move to Letterkenny when opportunities arise under blended working and his or her role or aspirations for promotion change, we will have to tease out the commitment he or she has made in locating in Letterkenny.  Those promotional opportunities may not arise there.  These are the kinds of issues we will be working through with our colleagues in the trade union movement as we work through what a blended working model is going to look like.  There is no easy solution to the point the Deputy has made but, with regard to the Irish language, it has been recognised there should be a real opportunity for people who are fluent and who wish to remain working within their home environments, which are in Gaeltacht areas in many cases.  A number of queries have come across our desks in that regard recently.</p><p>We have to work through the longer-term implications for those people and for their organisations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.339" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Cagney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SC12021072100002#K00300"><p>I absolutely empathise, as most people would, with those of us who could only engage with colleagues over Zoom, Teams and so on for a long time.  One of the issues we will be teasing out as we roll out blended working is how to manage that really important interface that maintains the culture of organisations and that encourages collaboration and the innovation that is an output of collaborative activity.  It very much enhances the role of the people manager.  All of this has been recognised as presenting a real challenge but it can be addressed through training and support.  I am pretty confident that those issues around new inductees and so on can be resolved pretty effectively over the course of the roll-out of blended working.  I hope I have understood the Cathaoirleach's question correctly.</p> <p>  With regard to where we are likely to be with blended working, while the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will not be specifying what blended working should look like in each office, with the exception of the key principles that will apply across the Civil Service and public service, we will be encouraging Departments to make decisions that make sense with regard to their operational requirements.  From the conversation here today, it is very clear that, if people working in Gaeltacht areas have an interest in working in the Civil Service, there should be no serious objection to them working in a blended working environment in those Gaeltacht areas.  There are potential medium to long-term career issues involved which have not been worked through at this particular point in time and arrangements also cannot be made that are personal to the holder of the post.  Leaving those caveats aside, blended working is potentially an important lever - I will not say game-changer - in encouraging fluent Irish speakers to work in the Civil Service.</p> <p>  In terms of the Cathaoirleach's point on various initiatives, I do not want to pre-empt the recommendations to emerge from the committee being set up under the legislation or the initiatives which may emerge over the course of the ten-year plan, Civil Service Renewal 2030, as to how to support and encourage people to speak Irish through various initiatives.  As I said earlier, there is no one fix here.  We are going to have to hit this challenge with everything we have in our armoury.  The suggestions the Cathaoirleach has made will certainly have to be considered.  However, I am not in a position to make any further comment in that regard.  These decisions are wider than the remit of my Department.</p> <p>  With regard to the requirement for translators, while it is not within my area specifically, the Department is conscious of the challenges in that area.  Among other things, these relate to starting pay.</p><p>I would be reasonably confident that a sensible approach will emerge from my Department where there are clear business reasons associated with the challenges of attracting translators.  I am not in a position to say anything more about it because it is outside of my remit but I would be reasonably confident that practical resolutions to those challenges can be found.</p></speech>

Mr. Cagney has talked about recruitment.  Does he have any idea how many Civil Service posts will be filled this year?  I know there has been an embargo for many years and small numbers have been coming through but I presume that Mr. Cagney has some idea of what will be happening over the next while.  It is just so we would have some measure of how many extra people will be hired if we are talking about 20% of new hires being proficient in Irish.</p></speech>

If we have given the impression that we think this 1% is good then I want to point out that we are not saying that and I apologise if that has come across.  That is reflecting the demand in the system, as articulated to the Public Appointments Service, which does the recruitment.  I am not making comments as to whether that is good, bad or indifferent.  We are very keen to support the aspiration or legal obligation that would be set out in the legislation and we are fully committed to do that.  I would not like the Deputy to interpret those statistics as something we are happy with.  Perhaps it is down to the way I expressed them.</p> <p>  I will go back to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question and it is much the same issue.  We do not determine what the demand is within the system.  That is a matter for individual Departments and offices.  I am subject to correction on this but I understand that under the rules and regulations on the Irish language, the onus and obligation is on Departments and offices to identify those roles for which they believe there should be fluency in the language and to recruit for those roles.  It would appear from the statistics we are seeing that there is a very low level of demand in those areas.</p></speech>

I welcome any opportunity to talk about "Nuacht RT&Eacute;", not least to say how proud I am of the whole team for what they have achieved during the pandemic.  As the director general made clear in last week&rsquo;s RT&Eacute; annual report, the mission to provide the people of Ireland with an impartial and comprehensive news service is at the heart of what we do, in Irish and in English, and never more so than during a public health emergency.</p> <p>  RT&Eacute; is firmly committed to supporting the Irish language and to delivering on its public service obligations.  Section 114 of The Broadcasting Act 2009 charges RT&Eacute; with the responsibility to &ldquo;provide programmes of news and current affairs in the Irish and English languages&rdquo;.  Under section 120 of the Act, RT&Eacute; is obliged to provide TG4 with &ldquo;the equivalent of one hour ... [daily of] programme material" in the Irish language.  "Nuacht RT&Eacute;" forms a substantial part of the provision formalised between RT&Eacute; and TG4 in the 2018 to 2022 protocol agreement.</p> <p>  RT&Eacute; employs more journalists working in Irish than any other news organisation in Ireland.  RT&Eacute; makes more than 250 hours of television news and current affairs in the Irish language every year, built around a multi-platform nuacht service broadcast on RT&Eacute; One, the RT&Eacute; news channel and TG4, online and on mobile via the RT&Eacute; news app.  The staff are employed by RT&Eacute; and "Nuacht RT&Eacute;" is part of RT&Eacute; news and current affairs, led by its pr&iacute;omheagarth&oacute;ir.  The service is broadcast from TG4 studios at Baile na hAbhann.  In addition, RT&Eacute; also produces "7 L&aacute;" for TG4.  RT&Eacute; broadcasts news bulletins in Irish every day on RT&Eacute; Radio 1, 2FM and Lyric FM, while Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta has been a lifeline service for many during the pandemic.</p> <p>  The financial challenge facing RT&Eacute; remains as acute as ever, despite the temporary surplus reported in 2020, which was a direct consequence of the pandemic.  Journalism relies on people, and our people are our biggest cost.  The scale of the financial challenge means it will touch every part of the organisation.  Like every organisation and every family in Ireland, Covid-19 means RT&Eacute; has had to explore different ways of doing things.  The pandemic has exacerbated the challenges for impartial and independent journalism.</p> <p>  Together, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, and "Nuacht RT&Eacute;" have given voice to Gaeltacht and Irish language communities.  While they told their stories, we reminded them they were not alone.  Through Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and "Nuacht RT&Eacute;", RT&Eacute; directly supports the employment of 113 people in the Gaeltacht.  Over the past four years, in partnership with TG4, RT&Eacute; has relaunched "Nuacht RT&Eacute;", given it a new identity and moved it into a bigger studio.  It has also invested substantial funding in extending "7 L&aacute;" to a 42-week run and adding two additional posts to the team in Baile na hAbhann.  For the first time, "Nuacht RT&Eacute;" has a single identity across both broadcasters, evidence of Ireland&rsquo;s two public service media organisations working together for the benefit of Irish audiences.</p> <p>  It is a service that is valued by viewers.  Earlier this year, TG4 commissioned research from the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, and Red C, which found that 82% rated the service provided by RT&Eacute; as &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; or &ldquo;good&rdquo;.</p><p>Encouragingly, the support was strongest among viewers aged 18 to 34, 83% of whom rated the programme highly.  Due to the importance of the service, RT&Eacute; has consistently sought to protect Irish language journalism from the consequences of the organisation's broader financial challenges.</p><p> Since the TV licence fee was last adjusted by the Oireachtas, RT&Eacute;'s income has fallen by &euro;100 million.  In 2021, there are 32 fewer journalists in the Dublin newsroom than there were a decade ago, a period in which RT&Eacute; news has also become a digital-first news organisation and built its presence online and on mobile in addition to existing radio and television services.  During that same period, five posts have been closed in "Nuacht RT&Eacute;".</p><p> Such is RT&Eacute;'s commitment to Irish language journalism, that in 2021, the budget for "Nuacht RT&Eacute;" is higher than it was in 2018.  However, when it launched its revised strategy in November 2019, RT&Eacute; was clear that it had to find &euro;60 million in savings against projected costs, and the need for public funding remains as acute as ever.  RT&Eacute; employs camera operators on staff and several companies are contracted to supply crewing for "Nuacht RT&Eacute;".  Currently, in any one week, "Nuacht RT&Eacute;" has 28 days of dedicated crewing and a further five provided by video journalists.</p><p> Earlier this year, RT&Eacute; decided to reduce this number by three contract crewing days in Dublin and, instead, continues some of the pandemic-era innovations, such as Zoom interviews and utilising some of the existing RT&Eacute; staff crews working in Dublin.  The crewing changes represent less than 10% of the dedicated crewing video capacity currently provided to "Nuacht RT&Eacute;".  Its journalism and focus on S&uacute;il Eile comes from the journalism of its team, the stories it chooses and the contributors it interviews rather than who is behind the camera.</p><p> The proposal is not to stop the provision of crewing for "Nuacht RT&Eacute;" in Dublin.  It is to provide it differently, consistent with operational changes within RT&Eacute; news and current affairs.  The new crewing system has now been in place for a couple of months and is working well.  The real threat to "Nuacht RT&Eacute;" and to much else that RT&Eacute; supports comes from the financial unsustainability of RT&Eacute;'s funding model and the persistent annual loss of more than &euro;50 million per year through the broken TV licence system.  Far from endangering "Nuacht RT&Eacute;", greater collaboration between the news desks in Dublin and Baile na hAbhann is essential for its survival.</p></speech>

Chomh maith leis sin, n&iacute;or &eacute;irigh linn, le 25 bliain, leis an rud ar thug Jon Williams "digital-first" air.

I am perfectly competent to talk about news and current affairs.  I run news and current affairs in English and in Irish and that is what I understood the committee wanted to discuss.  If I have misunderstood, then I apologise, but we have come here in good faith.  As I said in my opening statement, notwithstanding the concerns both Deputies and Senators may have, the staff of "Nuacht RT&Eacute;" work incredibly hard and I am incredibly proud of what they have achieved over the past 16 months.</p><p>I had hoped I might be able to express that to the committee today.  If I am not able to, then of course I understand, but it would be unfortunate.  I will completely understand and accept the decision of the committee.</p></speech>

Is an rud is l&uacute; a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfaid&iacute;s a dh&eacute;anamh a bh&iacute; ann ach, ag an am c&eacute;anna, ag cinnti&uacute; go raibh muid ann.

Caithfear a r&aacute; freisin gur rud casta &eacute; a bheith ag pl&eacute; le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; nuachta mar teasta&iacute;onn saineolas.  I ndeireadh na d&aacute;la, d&rsquo;&eacute;irigh le RT&Eacute; &eacute; sin a bhun&uacute; leis an tallann a bh&iacute; ann agus le tallann nua.  D&uacute;radh linn nach raibh tallann ann sa Ghaeilge, sa Ghaeltacht n&oacute; i bpobal na Gaeilge, ach ag gach pointe d&rsquo;&eacute;irigh linn &eacute; sin a chur ar f&aacute;il agus, dar liomsa, t&aacute; na hiriseoir&iacute; raidi&oacute; agus teilif&iacute;se at&aacute; againn faoi l&aacute;thair ar chomhch&eacute;im leis na hiriseoir&iacute; at&aacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; i mB&eacute;arla, agus cuid acu n&iacute;os fearr.

T&aacute; Alan Esslemont ag r&aacute; anois go bhfuil s&eacute; sin d&iacute;reach cos&uacute;il leis an nuacht 20 n&oacute;im&eacute;ad ar RT&Eacute; 1 ag 5.40 p.m. roimh an Angelus.  Sin difr&iacute;ocht.  T&aacute; 20 n&oacute;im&eacute;ad ar RT&Eacute; agus 15 n&oacute;im&eacute;ad ar TG4, agus chomh maith leis sin t&aacute; nuacht eile go minic ar RT&Eacute; i rith an lae.  D&aacute; mbeadh TG4 in acmhainn, an bhf&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; bulletins a chur ar f&aacute;il?</p><p> L&eacute;igh m&eacute; an aighneacht a chuir TG4 isteach &oacute; thaobh an bhuis&eacute;id de agus an f&aacute;th go bhfuil tuilleadh airgid agus acmhainn&iacute; &aacute; lorg aige.  T&aacute; s&eacute; leagtha amach go hiontach &oacute; thaobh daoine &oacute;ga a mhealladh agus c&uacute;rsa&iacute; digiteacha a l&aacute;idri&uacute;, go h&aacute;irithe &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; nuachta.  De r&eacute;ir mar a thuigim, t&eacute;ann bulletins n&oacute; feasach&aacute;in breaking news amach c&uacute;pla uair chuile l&aacute; i mB&eacute;arla.  N&iacute; th&eacute;ann siad amach beag n&aacute; m&oacute;r i nGaeilge.  An dtagann an rud seo faoi ch&uacute;ram TG4 n&oacute; an mbaineann s&eacute; leis an sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir &oacute; RT&Eacute;, at&aacute; le teacht os &aacute;r gcomhair i gceann c&uacute;pla seachtain?  T&aacute; m&eacute; measctha suas agus t&aacute;im ag iarraidh eolas a fh&aacute;il ach t&aacute; s&eacute; deacair.  T&aacute; difr&iacute;ocht mh&oacute;r idir an d&aacute; theanga agus i bhfad n&iacute;os l&uacute; b&eacute;ime &aacute; chur ar an nGaeilge.  Chonaiceamar &eacute; sin i rith na paind&eacute;ime maidir le comhartha&iacute; agus chuile rud ar TG4 agus RT&Eacute; i nGaeilge.  B&iacute;onn na news alerts, breaking news agus an rud uilig tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla, agus de r&eacute;ir mar a thuigim, t&aacute; ciorruithe ann ag an deireadh seachtaine freisin agus n&iacute;l nuacht ar f&aacute;il le linn an deiridh seachtaine.  An bhfuil m&eacute; m&iacute;cheart?  N&iacute;l a fhios agam.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; ceart go bhfuil muid ag brath ar ph&iacute;osa eolais anseo agus ansi&uacute;d chun pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an rud mar t&aacute;imid in am an gh&aacute;tair i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  Ba mhaith liom &eacute; sin a r&aacute; i mbealach n&iacute;os dearfa&iacute;.  Ba mhaith linn cabhair a thabhairt do TG4 dul i ngleic leis na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in.  Bheinn bu&iacute;och d&aacute; bhf&eacute;adfadh Alan Esslemont c&uacute;pla rud a r&aacute; faoi na point&iacute; sin.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; mar aighneacht r&eacute;amh-bhuis&eacute;ad freisin.  T&aacute; plean ansin don nuacht agus t&aacute; roghanna eile ann, ach i ndeireadh na d&aacute;la is roghanna n&iacute;os airde iad sin a bhaineann leis an Rialtas.  Tiocfaidh m&eacute; ar ais aige sin.</p> <p>  T&aacute; muidne ag feidhmi&uacute; taobh istigh den reachta&iacute;ocht at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair, so t&aacute; dualgas orainn oibri&uacute; amach c&eacute;ard at&aacute; m&iacute;cheart le TG4 agus c&eacute;n chaoi gur f&eacute;idir linn feabhas a chur air.  Sa phlean sin, t&aacute;imid ag moladh gur cheart go mbeadh an fhoireann at&aacute; fostaithe ag RT&Eacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; mar fhoireann ITN, a chuireann ar f&aacute;il Channel 4 News agus Channel 5 News.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go nd&eacute;anfadh siad dearmad ar an m&aacute;thair-bhranda agus d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach go hioml&aacute;n ar an mbranda seirbh&iacute;se, is &eacute; sin, TG4.  Faoi l&aacute;thair t&aacute; siad tarraingthe idir an d&aacute; rud agus n&iacute;l s&eacute; sin ag feidhmi&uacute;.

Go minic, tagann briseadh nuachta suas ar an bhf&oacute;n.  T&aacute; f&oacute;n ag chuile dhuine agus sin an &aacute;it go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh briseadh nuachta a fheice&aacute;il.  N&iacute;l aon strucht&uacute;r digiteach nuachta againn agus ba cheart go mbeadh.  Sin an rud at&aacute; sa phlean a th&aacute;inig &oacute; bhord TG4.  Caithfidh TG4 ceannas eagarth&oacute;ireachta a bheith againn &oacute; thaobh f&iacute;s na nuachta a leagan amach.  Caithfimid cur leis na hacmhainn&iacute; at&aacute;imid ag cur i dtreo na nuachta, agus caithfimid an strucht&uacute;r seo &oacute; thaobh an aip dhigiteach a chur ar f&aacute;il.  Is f&eacute;idir oibri&uacute; ar an mbealach sin.  T&aacute; roghanna eile ann agus t&aacute; siad cloiste agam &oacute; chuid de na Teachta&iacute;.  D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; f&aacute;il r&eacute;idh leis an uair an chloig sa l&aacute; &oacute; RT&Eacute; agus an t-airgead a thabhairt do TG4.

This meeting has been convened to discuss, with representatives of Safety Over Stigma, the general scheme of the online safety and media regulation Bill.  I thank our guests very much for joining us virtually for our meeting.  This is not the way we would like to be doing things but we are getting closer to being able to do in-person meetings.  We very much appreciate our witnesses giving of their time and their generosity of spirit regarding the information they are going to share with us.  I welcome Ms Alicia O'Sullivan, founder of Safety Over Stigma, and Professor Louise Crowley from University College Cork.  The format of the meeting is such that I will invite our witnesses to make an opening statement and that will be followed by questions from members.</p> <p>  As our witnesses may be aware, the committee may publish the opening statement on the website following today's meeting.  Before I invite our witnesses to deliver their opening statement, which will be limited to three minutes, I wish to advise them of the following in respect of parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If an opening statement is potentially defamatory in respect of any identifiable person or entity, the witness giving it will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  As our witnesses are attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, they should please note that there are some limitations in parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members finally then of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines here of Leinster House in order to participate in today's public meeting.  I cannot permit members to attend if they are not adhering to that constitutional requirement.  If a member is not within the precincts of Leinster House, I will have to ask him or her to leave the meeting.  I ask members to please identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of assisting the staff of the Debates Office involved in the preparation of the Official Report.  Members might also mute their microphones when not contributing in order to reduce the background noise and feedback.  I also ask members to raise their hand button when wishing to contribute and I also remind all members joining today's meeting to ensure that their mobile phones are in silent mode or, better again, switched off.  I thank those in attendance for bearing with me for all of that housekeeping advice.</p> <p>  I ask Ms O'Sullivan to address the committee now, please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.520" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alicia O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021072100002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chair.  To start, it is quite difficult to be virtually, even though not physically, before the committee today.  In a way, I am also glad that it is me here now rather than someone else further down the line.  I am grateful that this general scheme exists and that Safety Over Stigma can play a role.</p> <p>  Briefly, a fake Instagram account was set up in my name a while back and the perpetrator posted multiple explicit images of another woman&rsquo;s naked body and gave the impression that it was me.  The horror experienced when realising what was unfolding was amplified by the uniform, dismissive and victim-blaming reasons I received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In addition, the initial reluctance by Instagram to remove this account, while simultaneously deleting my personal Instagram account, further aggravated the situation.  Evidently, both the response and the governing laws were inept.  From my experience, the perpetrator was more protected than I was at all times, from the moment they were allowed to sign up under my name to the present day where there are few repercussions for this.  Every day I see another girl that I know facing the exact same situation on Instagram.</p> <p>  That said, we welcome the proposed establishment of the media commission and the acknowledgment of respect for democratic values but think that, in addition to the rightful liberty of expression, explicit reference should also be made to the privacy and good name rights of citizens.  We also recommend that in addition to allowing for the establishment of advisory committees, a specific committee on online safety and media regulation be established.</p> <p>  A huge factor in my experience was the lack of public awareness to the relevant law, given the fact I was told that someone posting illicit photographs purporting to be me was not illegal when, in fact, it was and is.</p><p>A solution to this would be the development of a specific helpline or support network for online abuse and cybercrime in which the law and procedures to take can be explained and support can be offered.  This would go a long way to create greater public awareness and improve legal and media literacy.</p><p> Thankfully, the fake page was taken down in less than 24 hours, but many women privately told me that the same had happened to them and the account was not taken down for about a week.  I imagine that these victims did not have the same amount of people reporting it as I did and suffered further because of that.  From my experience, it should be standard that when a complaint is made about the veracity of an online account or claims that it contains illegal or harmful content it should be subject to an immediate take down procedure, and this material be reviewed promptly and further reviewed if it is put back up.</p><p> Someone pretending to be you online is frightening and damaging.  An obvious protective step would be the requirement for some form of identification or identity, which can be traced and verified, to be provided when setting up an account.  This could be done by requiring unique identifiers for users signing up to accounts.  </p><p> I started this campaign for one simple reason.  I remember feeling such distress, discomfort and dismissal.  I want to play a role in not only putting an end to image based sexual abuse, but for there to be repercussions and accountability for the perpetrators.  Most important, victims should be treated with the respect and empathy they deserved at every point.  I am simply asking each committee member to do everything in their power to ensure that we, as a country, can do this.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

It cannot have been easy for her.  She has already been through some trauma.  We appreciate her sharing her experience with us because it will be very helpful.  We aim to protect users, such as Ms O'Sullivan, on social media.  I will invite my colleagues to speak.  I am conscious that Professor Crowley is on the line.  Perhaps she would like to come in following the questions from some of our colleagues.</p></speech>

I thank Ms O'Sullivan, in particular, for sharing her story again.  A lot of us have had the honour of hearing her story.  She has shared it and has been exceptionally brave.  As she said, she is just one person.  This is a challenge that many individuals are facing.</p> <p>  As a committee, we deal with laws and regulations.  Things can get very technical at times.  Ultimately, our challenge is to ensure that Ms O'Sullivan's rights, reputation and dignity are respected.  This is what we have to achieve from this Bill.  I refer to Ms O'Sullivan's experience with social media companies, in this case Instagram.  What does she believe companies can do in order to specifically address this problem? </p> <p>  In establishing an online safety commissioner, we are considering the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism.  If somebody like Ms O'Sullivan went to Instagram, Facebook or Twitter and the company failed to take action, how would she like to see an individual complaints mechanism work?  Ms O'Sullivan has spoken about her experience with the Garda.  What additional training and resources does she believe garda&iacute; need to have in these circumstances?</p></speech>

In terms of Instagram, from my experience it was quite difficult to make a complaint.  It was a very difficult platform to manoeuvre across.  It was like a help centre online.  It was not obvious which boxes to tick in terms of what had actually happened to me.  One option was for people who were pretending to be me, but it did not go as far as what I experienced.</p> <p>  Identifiers are a subject of conversation in the UK at the moment.  On a platform like TikTok, something is taken down straightaway and reviewed.  In our submission we suggested that in cases of bullying where someone is purposefully trying to get a person's account taken down, there should be a mechanism whereby he or she can check the complaint and for the complaint to be traced.  The user about whom a complaint has been made could check the validity of the complaint. </p> <p>  Professor Crowley can take the second question.  In terms of training for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we welcome the comments of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, that there would be further training for garda&iacute;.  To be honest, what was lacking most, which is quite a sad affair, was empathy for me as a young woman who went into a Garda station to complain about something I was very upset about.  There was a lack of sensitivity and help.  I left the station visibly upset and nobody offered me any sort of support or provided me with a telephone number to call.  I was not aware that the divisional protective services unit could have helped me at that point.  I do not think the average citizen would be aware of that, and I definitely should have been told about it at that point.</p></speech>

In respect of his suggestion on an individual complaints mechanism, we need to think about the role of lawmaking within an individual jurisdiction.  That is crucial because without that we are beholden to the policies of individual platform owners.  They have their own interests and priorities in the commercial world.  If we are creating a framework to respond to the needs of all citizens who might be affected by this type of behaviour and asserting Ireland's position as regards the importance of protecting service users from the abuse  experienced by Ms O'Sullivan, a complaints mechanism could be established within the proposed legislation to give power back to Ireland and lawmakers.  It could be a very proactive, positive statement by the Government that the opportunity to make a complaint to an Irish body, established with a view to protecting individuals, is a very meaningful and accessible mechanism.</p> <p>  A key issue, as Ms O'Sullivan said, is knowing what box to tick and what category a person comes under.  We could be very considered in creating an individual complaints mechanism that we have spoken about.  We would present it in a way that is compassionate to the person who is probably going through one of the most traumatic moments of his or her life and is looking for answers.  The challenge with that, as is the case for any support guidelines or rules that might exist, is that people are trawling through volumes of information to try to find an answer.  A very accessible and clear means of making a complaint to an Irish body charged with ensuring protection for users would be a very important statement and mechanism for those seeking support.</p></speech>

They spoke about the individual complaints mechanism.  I am delighted to hear they are supportive of that because unless it is included, the legislation will not be as effective as we want it to be.  It is vital that is included in the Bill.</p> <p>  Does Ms O'Sullivan think it is important for legislators, the Department and all of those who will ultimately be responsible for the implementation of the legislation to take into account of the lived experience of young people?  For example, should there be a youth advisory committee to the media commission?</p></speech>

Within that, there should be youth representation.</p><p>My generation certainly experiences the online world very differently to my parents or possibly even people in Government.  Therefore, young people must be represented.  As Professor Crowley touched on, when this happened to me, and as we are all inclined to do, the first thing I did was to look it up.  I am a law student as well, but there was not much out there in this context.  Coco's Law is very new and has only come in since the end of February.  Therefore, experiences like mine have never really been spoken about before.  I refer again to this type of dismissive behaviour that we as a society have displayed to issues concerning the Internet.  The Internet is a very dangerous thing in the hands of the wrong people.  It is also an amazing thing.  We must move on now to consider how we can best protect people in this context and it is always important to have young people's voices heard at the table in these types of endeavours.</p></speech>

There can be a "Yes" or "No" answer to this question to save time.  Does Ms O'Sullivan think young people should be involved in awareness-raising activities, such as through youth work or other avenues, in respect of Internet laws and protections in that regard?  Would that be a crucial element?</p></speech>

I thank Ms O'Sullivan and Professor Crowley.  I commend Ms O'Sullivan on her bravery and determination in following up her cause.  It is good to see young people taking up this type of initiative and Ms O'Sullivan is an example to all young people in the country.  How important is it to have a go-to support service for young people who have gone through an experience similar to Ms O'Sullivan?  How are the existing services failing young people?  Regarding the helpline suggested by Ms O'Sullivan, how important would it be for the protection of young people?</p></speech>

As I mentioned already, the staff of the divisional protective services unit have been nothing short of incredible.  However, the problem which exists is the lack of awareness of these supports.  Again, as I said earlier, in essence, I was not told of any of these services when I first went to report this crime.  The average person in society is not aware of these supports.  These are not new problems, but the supports available are not widely known.  This is the big hurdle we must overcome.</p></speech>

I will be brief because I have only a minute remaining.  I thank Ms O'Sullivan for her work in this respect, for being an advocate and for appearing before this committee.  One of the most important aspects is how she has highlighted the point of contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of reporting crimes like this.  In Ms O'Sullivan's case, that was a serious sexual crime which happened on the street.  I refer to the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in being able to deal with a case like this and, as Ms O'Sullivan said, showing empathy in doing so.</p> <p>  Turning to Instagram, and Ms O'Sullivan's interaction with that platform, does she believe that a helpline would be more helpful, instead of going through a series of exercises to tick boxes?  My experience of these social media giants is that it is very hard to get contact with humans.  In her interaction with Senator Byrne, Professor Crowley touched on these tech giants and their interests in the commercial world.  This goes to the nub of the issue.  When representatives of those companies were before this committee, what seemed to come through from the meeting was those companies seeking to protect what they perceive as their freedoms because it is obviously in the advertising space that those companies are going to make their money.  From a legal point of view, how far should the Oireachtas and society in general be pushing to get a greater balance in this sphere?  I ask that because I think the situation now is totally unbalanced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.540" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alicia O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021072100002#C01100"><p>Starting with Instagram, it was very difficult to manoeuvre around.  Regarding how the company responds initially to someone reporting something very damaging, such as illegal content, those types of reports must be taken more seriously than other categories of reporting.  Regarding a helpline, it is very difficult to have one in the context of a social media company such as Instagram.  However, the company's responses to cases such as mine and my experience must be different.  Something obviously went wrong when my account was disabled, and there certainly seems to be a lack of human involvement behind the kind of artificial intelligence involved and that does not help the situation.  Regarding whether there should be a helpline, then, I do not know if that is entirely possible.  However, I certainly think there should be a certain number of people behind these screens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.541" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Louise Crowley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021072100002#C01200"><p>I will be brief given the time left.  A helpline needs to work side by side with a body that has a capacity to do something about what is reported via that helpline.  A helpline cannot just be about listening and supporting, it must also have the teeth required to do something about what is reported.  Regarding how far the Oireachtas can go, as someone who works in the area of seeking to address all forms of sexual harassment and violence, I believe the Oireachtas should go as far as it needs to go in this regard.  All forms of harassment and abuse, especially sexual harassment and abuse, constitute a huge societal challenge.  Ultimately, the key role and responsibility of the Oireachtas is to identify the issues and to govern and regulate in a way that supports and respects all our people.</p> <p>  If a platform has the capacity to ignore a situation such as that experienced by Ms O'Sullivan and many similar situations experienced daily by other women and men - and we have knowledge and evidence of these experiences - then the obligation on our lawmakers is to take action to prevent this happening and to make these platforms accountable for they are doing.  It is not enough to allow them to just create their own rules with their commercial interests in mind.  Those companies have a social responsibility, but it is the responsibility of lawmakers to create a framework that will require those companies to comply with their responsibilities in this regard.  Therefore, I urge the members of this important committee to take all the steps they feasibly can, based on the constitutional right to privacy for all our people, to ensure that rights are respected and that our laws allow that outcome to be achieved.</p></speech>

I thank Ms O'Sullivan for her bravery, honesty and determination in championing this issue, not only for herself but also for thousands of others right across the country and possibly the world in respect of the work we are doing here.  Professor Crowley is right that it has been proved repeatedly that self-regulation is no regulation for these giant technology companies.  Once we finish the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill, we will then have a major responsibility to ensure that we are in a much better place and that people will be safer on the Internet and on social media.  I again thank the witnesses for joining us.  I also thank my colleagues for their questions and for being so timely in this regard.  I appreciate their co-operation.

I welcome the Australian eSafety Commissioner, Ms Julie Inman Grant.  She is joined by her colleague, Mr. Toby Dagg, executive manager in the investigations branch of the eSafety Commissioner.  Both of our guests are joining us remotely in committee room 4 via Microsoft Teams.  The format of today's meeting is such that I will invite our witnesses to make their opening statement, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statement on its website following our meeting.</p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to make their opening statement, which is limited to three minutes, I want to advise them about parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.</p> <p>  Witnesses participating in this session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should be mindful of the domestic law and how to apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  We are delighted to have the witnesses with us and I thank them for taking the time to do so.  As my colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne, said earlier, we are having an Australian summer these days and we do not know how to cope with the heat but we have plenty of air conditioning so we are all fine.</p> <p>  I call on Commissioner Inman Grant to deliver her opening statement.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to talk to the committee today and I congratulate members for delving so deeply into these laws and considering how to best protect their citizens online.</p> <p>  When I was preparing for this hearing, I reviewed some of the debates the committee has had for this Bill.  I noticed that the committee has heard from industry and civil society, and understandably their views have differed on the recommended approach and timelines for online regulation.  One thing is for certain; we may never achieve full scale consensus because these issues are challenging.  Balancing a free and open Internet with the protection of individuals and societies, where national laws have bounds but where harms know no borders, is a hard regulatory and policy posture to introduce, and more importantly, to deliver.  It requires commitment, education, perseverance and a fair degree of cultural change.  As members know, the issue of online harms and keeping people safe online is more important than ever as we rely on the digital environment to learn, work and even socialise.</p> <p>  Here in Australia during the pandemic, where we are still in lockdown, we have seen a surge in reports across all of our regulatory schemes.  In the fourth quarter of the last financial year compared with the same time in the previous year, reports about illegal content, primarily child sexual abuse material and some pro-terrorist content, increased by 96%.  Reports of image-based abuse or the non-consensual sharing of intimate images and videos increased by 255%.  Adult cyber abuse, for which we do not have a scheme, increased by about 53%.   The most moderate increase was in child cyberbullying, at 19%, which did not surprise us because most youth-based cyberbullying tends to be peer-to-peer and an extension of conflict happening within the schoolyard.  When kids were separated, there was less cyberbullying as an extension of that conflict.</p> <p>  As the world&rsquo;s first government agency solely dedicated to tackling online abuse, we provide an important safety net for Australians when reports to social media sites, which may miss culture or context, tend to fall through the cracks.  Last month, a more robust and modernised Online Safety Act passed both Houses of the Australian Parliament, providing me and my office with more expansive powers to help protect all Australians from the most serious forms of online harm, and we are happy to talk the committee through some of those provisions.  The Act will take effect in early 2022 and it will enhance our ability to provide greater services and support for citizens, in line with our core functions.</p> <p>  We have an important leadership and co-operative role to play in the international arena, as other governments, such as the Irish Government, look to establish online content regulators.  We have landed on an effective model in Australia that is working by focusing on three major sets of interventions.  These are as follows: prevention; protection; and proactive and systemic change.  We invest in our own research, education and awareness campaigns to prevent online harms from happening in the first place and through our regulatory and complaints schemes, we protect our citizens by taking down seriously harmful content as well as employing a range of powers and remedial actions to hold both perpetrators and platforms to account.  We also seek to minimise the threat surface for the future by staying ahead of emerging tech trends and by shifting responsibility back onto the platforms themselves through initiatives like #SafetybyDesign.  We accept that each country will approach online safety in line with its own perceived needs and regulatory structures but we hope to achieve a significant synergy in a collective approach.  In the near future, just as we have network of data protection authorities, we will likely also see a global network of online safety regulators.</p> <p>  As the committee moves through future debates on its Bill, it is always helpful to remember the citizens for whom the committee is carrying out this reform.  It will be providing them with vital protections that they do not currently enjoy.  It could be a person that members know: a child; a person at risk or disadvantage; an older person in their lives; or a colleague.  Online harms can affect anyone at any time.  While digital harms may not leave visible scars, we know the damage can be significant and enduring.  We are pleased that the committee understands this and that it is working towards the best possible solution for Ireland.  I look forward to members' questions.</p></speech>

The Office of the eSafety Commissioner in Australia is leading the way globally in the protection of people online.  We are excited to have their contribution today and hopefully we will be able to do the same in Ireland.</p><p>Some Members have indicated that they would like to come in and ask questions.  I will begin with Senator Malcolm Byrne. </p></speech>

As the Chair has said, they have taken the lead in this area.  The evidence, as I know from speaking to people in Australia, is that they are having an impact.  I have a couple of questions.  One of our challenges here is the threshold for reporting of individual complaints.  We are going to have to build that into legislation.  I might ask the commissioner to talk about the thresholds that are used in her individual complaints' mechanism.  One issue she might touch on in is the question of extra-territoriality.  How does she deal with social media companies and platforms that are not based in Australia?  Finally, she might talk about changing behaviours, because this is not all about regulation.  Can she give instances of, since her office has been set up, how the tech companies' behaviour have changed?  Also, has she noticed a change in behaviour of Australian citizens online as a result of her work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.550" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julie Inman Grant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021072100002#E00300"><p>The Senator raises three good and important questions.  As I mentioned, we have about four regulatory schemes.  We are now working through an additional scheme around adult cyber abuse.  Definitions can be tricky for policymakers.  The key is to get enough precision and understanding of the general consensus across the major social media sites, and where their policies lie.  To give the Senator an example, serious cyberbullying of a child is anything that is intimidating, harassing, humiliating, or threatening.  This is a high enough threshold, but it gives us some latitude to look at the content and context.  One of the values of the citizens' service we provide when we interact either with the child, a guardian, or an educator, is that we can get the full story from them.  This is where we can help serve as a safety net and bridge that inherent power imbalance that exists between the tech companies and the users.  If the tech companies say that a report does not meet the threshold, there is not much recourse for that child to go through.  Does Mr. Dagg want to give any specific examples of how he applies that latitude?  Where does he see the importance of pitching that language and threshold?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.551" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Toby Dagg" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021072100002#E00400"><p>The role of the plaintiff in the context that the commissioner explained is a crucial one.  It is backed by some clear legal thresholds in the Act.  They set out a high bar for us to meet, in relation to child cyberbullying.  Importantly, where the definition of child cyberbullying is concerned, we can also taken into consideration the characteristics of the child.  These are essential.  A child who presents with particular vulnerabilities may be effected badly by a degree of harassment or intimidation that may be below the threshold for serious distress in the case of another child.  When we explain the full circumstances to the social media platforms, we are able to bring into that conversation facts that might be apparent to a moderator, or an officer that just assesses the material on its face.  We serve as a safety net.  The first thing a person needs to show when they come through our doors is that they have made a complaint to the social media platform about the relevant material.  This is so the social media platform can consider that complaint against their terms of service.  When we have that conversation with the social media platform, we often talk about cultural, social, or individual factors that will likely have been missed at a first pass through.  This is simply because of the volume and velocity of matters that those moderators need to assess.</p> <p>  I will give the committee a good example to illustrate what I mean.  We were dealing with a matter a couple of years ago that involved some video footage that had been provided on a social media platform.  It depicted girls from a remote community in Central Australia; it was an Aboriginal community.  It is common in Aboriginal communities to be careful about naming deceased people.  There is a strong cultural prohibition against that.  This video had presented images of the deceased person.  The video also named that person.   The video was trying to cause distress part of the community and specific individuals in the community.  To a person who is not familiar with the Australian context, the significance of that material would have been missed.  It caused immense pain within the community.  The person who was depicted had taken her own life.  She was only a 15-year-old girl.  By explaining this to the social media platform, we were able to have that material taken down.  When it comes to the question of the "behaviour", that Senator Byrne asked about, part of our job is to educate the social media platforms about the significance of our local context, notwithstanding any sheer application of regulatory principle.  </p></speech>

We, as the eSafety Commissioner, have only been established for six of those.  As a result, less than 1% of the content that we deal with is actually hosted in Australia.  It is almost all hosted overseas.  It depends on the regulatory scheme.  For instance, with the image-based abuse scheme, we have had what I would regard as a relatively high degree of success, in terms of getting intimate images and videos taken down from overseas sites.  There are thousands of different sites, and we have about an 85% success rate.  It helps to have the government crest behind us, as well as a strong set of remedial actions and powers to hold either perpetrators or the platforms to account.  There tends to be image chan boards and rogue porn sites that are hosted in permissive environments that are not likely to take that content down.  One of the newer forms does make it clear, in our new Bill, that our laws and regulatory schemes will have extra-territorial reach.</p></speech>

We are delighted to have them both here.  It is interesting to hear the Australian experience and the work they have been doing over the past six years to regulate this whole online world.  I will start with a question for Mr. Dagg.  We have just had a young law student at committee.  She was here just before Mr. Dagg joined the meeting.  She had the experience of having her image taken and used.  The image was of a naked woman's body and it was posted on an Instagram account.  She related to the committee the difficulty of the complaints' process.  Since the e-Safety Commissioner has been formed, has their presence seen a sea change in how the tech giants deal with that complaints process?  Mr. Dagg has pointed out that the complainants have to go to the tech giant before going to the commissioners.  However, has there been a sea change?  What pressure does Mr. Dagg put on the tech giants?</p> <p>  My follow-up question is to the commissioner, although these can be answered together.  She spoke about the new online safety Act which was passed in Australia in 2021.  How specifically has that been tweaked?  In what spheres was it tweaked?  What deficiencies did she see that needed to be addressed?  If she has had a chance to look at the Irish Bill, does she see any deficiencies in this piece of legislation?  Many people who have come to the committee have said that they want to see the Bill amended in different spheres.  I have one last question for the commissioner.  I have found through this pre-legislative process is the huge breadth of work emcompassed in this Bill.  It is overwhelming to hear the witness testimony, especially from the young girl who was just in the meeting, or the special rapporteur on child protection rights.  They talk about the abuse to these people.  I ask the commissioner, because she ended her statement by talking about putting citizens first, has she found that emotionally stressful in her job?  She is dealing with the attacks on citizens' rights as well.  </p></speech>

It is fair to say that our experience with the efficacy of the reporting processes that are provided by the services and platforms has been mixed.  We have had some very direct engagement with some of the major platforms in respect of deficiencies that we have identified in recording, for example, an account carrying child sexual abuse material.  We provide in that way clear illustrations as a consequences of our investigations.  In some cases, that has yielded some positive results, which we have been pleased to see, and some marked improvements in the context of removing any ambiguity regarding aspects of the complaints process.  However, there remain some deficiencies and we have been pointing to those on a fairly consistent basis.  Our experience has been that some of the glaring holes are slow to be remedied and repaired.  Why that might be the case is a matter for speculation.  There is definitely work that continues to have to be done.</p> <p>  Senator Cassells referred specifically to Instagram.  We are pleased to see that Instagram has improved the protective tool set made available to its users, particularly in dealing with unwanted messages and detection of abuse in some of the content that passes over Instagram.  That is very welcome, but there is a lot more to do.</p> <p>  Our real concern is with those platforms, services and sites that serve a very specific interest, namely, the malicious distribution of harmful content serving a particular audience who really do not care all that much about the impact on victims, and, in fact, take some pleasure from it.  They currently have very poor reporting mechanisms.  It is difficult to identify who is responsible for the services.  What the legislation that the Commissioner referred to seeks to do is provide multiple entry ways into a regulatory action.  If we cannot get any response from the content service or the operator of a website, we can identify the hosting service and push at that door.  If that fails or if removal notices are ignored, we can go to additional mechanisms such as seeking to have the material delisted from search engines, for example, through a power that the Commissioner wields.  What we found effective and what will be apparent in the new legislation is that it is good to have fallback points so that you can increase your regulatory spread and exercise ever more serious measures in order to achieve a form of compliance and remedy the particular ill which is causing harm to a complainant.</p></speech>

We are often surfacing things that are missed but there is no question that having a big stick we can wield means that they are more compliant and willing to work with us.  That has changed with the spectre of having new powers.  We have seen some of the platforms do less in the context of goodwill.  When this legislation was conceived in 2015, social media was primarily the challenge but we know online harm happens on dating sites and online gaming platforms.  There is a really broad ecosystem.  The search engines have a role to play and we will have a function around linked deletion notices.  The app stores have a role to play, particularly if they are hosting rogue apps that are harming citizens that are in violation of their terms of service.<br/><br/>We now will have the power to remove content more rapidly.  The quicker we take down content, the more distress is relieved from the person.  It was initially 48 hours, and is now down to 24.  We have seen some cases where a major platform will take down content within 12 minutes.  We had a lot of baulking on the part of the platforms but even since that time around the sudden content moderation that is happening, they are increasingly using artificial intelligence, AI, and other tools to surface and help with their moderation efforts.  Therefore, that is possible.<br/><br/>We have a new set, of, I guess, a duty of care, called the basic online safety expectations that will be laid down through ministerial instrument and will be able to compel transparency reports.  We can do periodic reports or ones around specific issues.  For instance, if there is a big pile-on, a brigade or a volumetric attack, we can write to a platform and ask what signals was it seeing, how did it respond, and is it consistently and fairly enforcing its terms of service, and if it does not comply there are penalties.<br/><br/>I guess the big <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>is the adult cyber abuse scheme.  Within three months of expanding our remit from Children's eSafety Commissioner to eSafety Commissioner adult cyber abuse reports started exceeding youth-based cyberbullying.  Of course, if you are indigenous, an Torres Strait Islander, you have different ethnicity, sexuality or gender, you are three times more likely to be targeted than a white male.</p></speech>

In some of the kickback that we have been getting from some stakeholders regarding the individual complaints mechanism, their argument is that it would be instantly bogged down with complaints and reports and that would render it useless.  Were there similar concerns in Australia initially and how did it play out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.561" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julie Inman Grant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021072100002#F00500"><p>We had the same fear-mongering and there were times when we were concerned as well.  Because we were a new entity, particularly for youth-based cyberbullying, we had more of a trickling effect at the beginning than we were hoping for.  As we raised awareness about our services, that started to gather pace.  We have not had an advertising or marketing budget and we have had to use a lot of our own media to get word out that we are a new agency and that we are here to help people.  We also find over time that we need to do more to encourage young people to engage in help-seeking.  Only 50% of young people will speak to trusted adult, such as a teacher or a parent, when things go wrong online.  Even fewer will report to a social media site, let alone a Government entity, because they do not think anything will happen.  That will all take time to build.</p> <p>  As we went into the pandemic, as I mentioned, we saw a surge of reports.  At one point, in April 2020, around the Easter long weekend, we had a 600% increase in image-based abuse reports.  There are a couple of reasons for that.  Of course, more people were turning to digital intimacy tools when they were separated from their loved ones and things went wrong, but there were also four different variants of sexual extortion scams that were going around.  These scams involved people stating that they had hacked into a person's hard drive and they had seen his or her intimate images and that the person must send them money, or a range of imposter accounts seeking to meet people, asking for a sexy Skype and using that as a form of sexual extortion for either more explicit images and videos or for money.</p> <p>  We had some surge funding given to us by the Government over the pandemic period in 2020 to accommodate the increase in reports.  The way that Mr. Dagg has set up investigations is that we have multiple teams that all work together.  We are prepared for surge support.  If there is a surge in youth-based cyberbullying reports, the image-based abuse team can step in and help.  We have never been overwhelmed.  We have 26 million people.  Ireland, I believe, has 5 million.  It would not be intractable.</p></speech>

We are taking account of the different stakeholders' opinions and that.  If we do not have an individual complaints mechanism, the Bill will not be worth the paper it is written on.  Certainly, it will not be as effective as we want it to be.  Is it Ms Inman Grant's opinion that there is no reason an individual complaints mechanism will not work once it has sufficient funding and resources behind it?</p><p>There is no reason that would not work if it had sufficient funding and resources behind it.</p></speech>

We are mitigating individual harms and helping citizens to remediate them.  That cannot really happen on a process and system level.  There are benefits to that approach as well.  Both really need to work together.  The other value of engaging with citizens on a daily basis is that we see terrible things every day, which energises us and reminds us why we are doing what we do.  We are helping individual citizens.  It also gives us a really good indication of what is going wrong on these platforms, what is being missed and what are the trends and the social engineering scams.  Without that, it would be harder for us to ascertain or pinpoint what is going wrong on those platforms or where their processes and technologies are deficient.  Does Mr. Dagg agree?</p></speech>

To the commissioner's remarks on this particular question, I will add that what has helped us to limit the volume we might otherwise need to deal with it are the legislative brakes on the volumes.  These include the requirement for complainants to have first made a complaint to the social media platform before coming to us.  The provisions create sufficiently high thresholds so that we can concentrate our regulatory endeavours and energy on those harms that are manifesting in a way that leave their mark more so than the normal hurly-burly of social media interaction.  I will give a snapshot from the cyberbullying scheme.  In the first full year of operation, the 2015-16 financial year, we received 186 complaints about child cyberbullying.  In the last fully financial year, 2020-21, we received 934.  There has been a year-on-year increase of 30% to 35%.  Because we have made our processes more efficient and our procedures more responsive, we have been able to absorb this increase with some headroom left for those times when we receive a surge of the sort the commissioner talked about.</p></speech>

I know their schedules are busy so I thank them very much.  I will take the opportunity to ask three quick questions.  Some questions have already been asked so I will try to ask different ones.  During our discussions, some stakeholders have made strong suggestions regarding a self-regulation model for Internet safety.  The general consensus was that self-governance is very weak.  What are the dangers and potential pitfalls associated with self-regulation?  In Australia, the take-down time has been reduced from 48 hours to 24 hours.  Do the witnesses think that should be included in our Bill?  Will they tell us about their social media tier system and how it works?  What incentives are there for companies to sign up?  What happens to companies that do not participate or that simply refuse to participate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.567" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julie Inman Grant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021072100002#G00500"><p>As someone who worked in the technology industry for more than 22 years, my view on self-regulation is that it does not work.  One of the things we are trying to achieve through safety by design is to encourage a change away from the cultural ethos of moving fast and breaking things towards mindfully building or updating online services while understanding and mitigating risks, engineering out misuse and building in safety protections at the front end.  The best analogy is that, more than 50 years ago, the car manufacturers really pushed back when regulators forced them to embed seatbelts but we know take it for granted that seat belts are embedded, that airbags will deploy and that brakes will work.  These things are guided by international standards.  If you build the digital roadways, you should be erecting the guard rails.  Right now, the technology companies do not have any of these requirements and we believe they should.  We should continue to push them to do better.  We can do that through safety by design and by surfacing up best practice because there are good innovations happening.  This is the type of change we want to see go viral.  We are never going to regulate or arrest our way out of online abuse.  We are talking about human malfeasance and behaviour playing out on an online platform.  A combination of both is needed.  A pragmatic approach should be taken to regulation, which I believe Ireland is seeking to do.  I believe we have struck a useful balance.  We are not trying to undermine innovation or curtail freedom of speech.  In fact, the burden is on us, particularly in respect of the adult cyberabuse scheme, not only to prove that the target is suffering serious harm or distress, but also that the perpetrator intended to cause serious harm, which is a high threshold to reach.  I will ask Mr. Dagg to give his input with regard to the tier system.  The Deputy asked a third question but I am blanking on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.568" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Toby Dagg" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021072100002#G00600"><p>I will take a look at the tier question for the Deputy.  I believe the three questions were on self-governance, whether a 24-hour or 48-hour threshold should be included in the Bill and the tier system.  The tier scheme is actually being repealed in the Act which is to commence at the beginning of next year.  I can certainly talk about how it has operated and how it is designed.  I may then talk briefly about some of the reasons why we have moved to a non-tiered approach to the regulatory schemes in the new Act.</p> <p>  Under the current arrangements, there is a two-tier scheme for serious cyberbullying matters.  A social media service can be declared a tier 1 service on application to the commissioner.  If the basic online safety requirements are met, requirements which include nominating a contact person, having policies in place which prohibit the use of the service for cyberbullying and adopting those sorts of principles, the commissioner can declare the social media service a tier 1 service.  With regard to the benefits of being a tier 1 social media service, the tier scheme operates like a regulatory scheme.  Tier 1 members can elect to have what is called the special rule imposed.  This allows for any decisions made as to whether material amounts to cyberbullying material to be made by us with reference to the terms of service in operation on the relevant platform.  Under this scheme, we serve the provider with a request for removal rather than a compulsory notice.  </p> <p>  That is also available under the tier 2 scheme.  On the advice of the commissioner, the Minister can declare a large social media to be a tier 2 service.  There are various elements the commissioner needs to take into consideration before making that advice available to the Minister.  If a service is declared to be a tier 2 social media service, the nature of the regulatory options become somewhat more interventionist and attract civil penalties.</p></speech>

In the course of business, they have been collaborative and co-operative when we have requested removal.  I believe they did not sign up to become tier 1 services because doing so involved a coregulatory model and they did not want to set a precedent showing a tolerance for compliance with a regulatory scheme, which might start a domino effect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.570" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Toby Dagg" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021072100002#G00800"><p>I will transition to discussing the arrangements under the new Act.</p><p>We have found over the life of the cyberbullying scheme that harm is happening on social media, on relevant electronic services like instant messaging and gaming services and on websites.  The legislation as it is written now under the Enhancing Online Safety Act does not cater for websites within the cyberbullying scheme.  They need to be social media or relevant electronic services.  The online safety Act creates a degree of uniformity across all our regulatory schemes, so they focus on the harms that occur across platforms.  What will be brought into scope through the reforms are websites, other designated Internet services and anything that can be reached by an Internet connection.  That is where some of the more serious, cross-platform cyberbullying is happening.  As a result, the social media-focused tiered scheme will be abolished in favour of that broader approach.</p></speech>

The commissioner is right that in Ireland we hope to take the pragmatic approach that Australia has taken without compromising freedom of speech.  Will Ms Grant talk about what it has taken to resource her commission in terms of manpower?  That will help us to formulate that.  In terms of ensuring we do the right thing and get it right from the start, will she give us three points of advice in the wrap-up?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julie Inman Grant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021072100002#H00300"><p>In the four and a half years I have been in this role, we have quintupled in size.  When I came in, there were 35 people in the office.  We have grown with schemes and functions and will be at almost 200 by the end of the year.  We are in the middle of a major hiring boom now to accommodate the new functions which will take significant man and woman power.  We are about 70% women at the eSafety Commissioner and 30% men.  I think sometimes Mr. Dagg feels outnumbered.  I used to say when I was in tech, where the proportion of men to women was the opposite, that the odds were good but the goods were odd.  That was an inside tech joke.  I will not do any more joking.</p> <p>  We started with a Australian $10 million budget.  This year we are at Australian $55 million.  It feels like a luxury but we will use every penny to put towards fulfilling our mission of keeping all Australians safer and having more positive experiences online.  We are comparatively small compared with our brethren in national security or the law enforcement community, equivalent to An Garda.</p> <p>  What I would say, first, is "due diligence".  You have obviously been thinking about this for a long time.  We have engaged with various sectors of the Irish Government for at least two years.  You are getting that right and trying to make sure you get the policy settings right.  Our bias is that having a citizen-facing service is very valuable to citizens and the individuals impacted harmfully and as a way to surface up what is happening in the online environment and assess those trends.  </p> <p>  It is important to make sure to choose someone for commissioner who has an understanding of how the technology industry works.  What has helped me in this role is knowing what points they will come in and talk about.  I know what their limitations are so I can be reasonable but I also know when they can do better.  It is about having that understanding of trust and safety, how harms manifest, how online platforms can be weaponised, how to engage constructively with the industry to the extent one can and when to wield the stick.  Those are all important considerations when choosing the person to lead these teams.</p> <p>  I have a philosophy of hiring smart, nice people who have a passion for making a change and a difference.  We see the most horrible aspects of humanity every day, particularly the pro-terrorist content and child sexual abuse material our investigators look at.  We have extensive wellness programmes in place and we try to make the culture positive so we walk in every day with a spring in our step waiting to help more people.</p></speech>

The commissioner looked at data around online harm that is happening.  An issue we will look to address related to media literacy is fake news, particularly with regard to Covid.  I wonder how the commissioner responded to that.  I am thinking about stories, which the commissioner may or may not wish to comment on, of vaccine hesitancy in Australia and whether that has been a contributory factor.  I ask about the extent to which the commissioner's office engages in tackling problems around fake news, particularly during the pandemic.</p></speech>

We sit in the Australian Communications and Media Authority.  That is the traditional media and communications regulator.  It has taken on the role around misinformation and, to a degree, disinformation, as has, when it comes to disinformation by state actors, our home affairs division.  The authority has developed a code of practice with the high technology industry about misinformation and disinformation.  That is of concern.</p> <p>  We have a stronger prevention of media literacy programme.  Part of what we do is teach through parents or educators what we call the 4Rs for the digital age: respect, responsibility, building digital resilience and critical reasoning skills.  Critical reasoning skills are important in helping young people and adults discern fact from fiction, whether or not an impostor account is attacking them or whether they are being socially engineered for a scam.  Teaching these skills at home to start with so people question everything and in schools is critical.  It is a skill set we all need to address.  We have not specifically addressed vaccine hesitancy in this context.</p></speech>

I got delayed.  I will not ask specific questions.  They may have been asked earlier.  We will have a media commissioner and the Australian model is seen as best practice, which is why we are chatting today.  The position of media commissioner will be extremely important.  The Chair asked about best advice from the Australian experience that we should learn from.  With regard to the position of media commissioner, are there specific terms of reference for who that person may be that we should highlight and prioritise before the position is put in place?  It is important we have a strong leader in that role to drive this forward when we bring in the regulations.</p></speech>

Depending on how complex the codes of practice are, Ireland might decide to choose somebody with a much deeper skill set when it comes to bureaucracy, codes enforcement and development or investigation.  An all-rounder may be needed.</p><p> As the online safety regulatory network grows globally, we must engage internationally with counterparts.  We must engage with non-governmental organisations.  We are managing many competing interests and dealing with citizens in great distress.  Sometimes we cannot help people.  A person is required who is a good communicator with a good team around him or her.  A person also needs much resilience because the pace of technology will always outstrip policy.  We are moving very quickly and we must be deft and stay a step ahead.  We are dealing with some hard issues and we must steel our resolve.  This person must also be able to lead a team and ensure they are focused on the task and also healthy when it comes to their well-being.

The commissioner has spoken about finding someone who understands the industry components and can inquire as to the significance of statements by industry, pre-empting and anticipating some of the strategies and tactics that might be employed by industry to push against regulatory reform.  That is absolutely essential.  Beyond that, it should be somebody capable of adapting to change and forecasting some of the essential strategic changes within the country's landscape that are likely to affect planning and execution on the objectives as set out in the legislation.  That is key as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-21a.581" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Toby Dagg" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021072100002#J00400"><p>Absolutely.  All our complaint processes function in reasonably similar ways in terms of throughput.  A person visits the safety commissioner website and we have a reporting page.  Every page on the website allows a person to navigate to the report page via a prominent report abuse button in the right-hand corner.  The person can then complete a complaint form specific to a complaint type.  We are conscious of the need to ensure citizens are not put in a position of having to choose which door to go through.  There are some similarities between schemes and we do not want people trying to diagnose their own form of online harm through a regulatory lens.  We have separate forms set up for each of our complaint areas.</p> <p>  A person will tell us what is happening, such as the location of material, and if it is image-based it may be a URL on an adult or rogue site.  They person will also include demographic information so we can prioritise and we prioritise complaints from young people, for example.  Approximately 25% to 30% of image-based abuse complaints are made by young people.  We collect as much evidence as we can up front and the report will generate an entry in our complaints management system.  An investigator will pick that up and start to perform triage by reviewing the complaint and assigning priority.  Any significant issues, sensitivities or risks will be raised with a manager and we will discuss some of the responses that should follow.  In talking about human-centred harms, involving image-based abuse, cyberbullying and cyber abuse, there is invariably a phone call with a complainant in order to talk through additional details, gather additional evidence and starting to plan a response.</p> <p>  Once that response has been settled, we may have recourse to several regulatory options and these are anything from informal warnings to a perpetrator on a particular matter to options involving applying to the federal court for injunctions.  These are not options we have had recourse to because as others have mentioned, much of our work is done very successfully at the informal end of the regulatory spectrum.  There is a range of interventions that we can have regard to, depending on the severity of the matter presenting.</p></speech>

I thank the Commissioner and Mr. Dagg for joining us.  Much of what they have shared with us today could certainly be applied to our work in Ireland.  Of course, the three "P"s of prevention, protection and proactive change provide some really good highlights for us to use.  I hope we can protect our citizens as Australia has done so well.  We have just 5 million people compared with Australia's 26 million, but we have work to do in order to protect them.  We certainly intend to deliver on that.  I thank the witnesses for joining us from the other side of the world today.  I thank colleagues for their participation in the meeting.  I say "sl&aacute;n" to gach duine.</p></speech>
