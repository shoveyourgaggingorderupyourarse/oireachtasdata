I welcome all of our witnesses.</p> <p>  The matters for examination today are from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the accounts of the public services 2019; chapter 11 - measuring performances for Exchequer spend on social housing;chapter 12 - progress under the land aggregation scheme; and chapter 13 - the pyrite remediation scheme.  To assist us in our examination of these matters, and with regard to public health guidelines, we are joined in person by Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General of the Department, Mr. John O'Connor, chief executive of the Housing Agency and Ms Marguerite Ryan, finance officer.  We are also joined remotely by the following officials from the housing delivery division: Mr. Barry Quinlan, assistant secretary; Ms Sarah Neary, principal adviser; Mr. David Kelly, principal officer; and by Ms Clare Costello from the housing Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I welcome all of our witnesses and I thank staff in the Department for the briefing material they prepared for the committee. </p> <p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations that they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation for anything that they say at the meeting.  Witnesses are expected, however, not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  If statements by witnesses are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks, and it is imperative that witnesses comply with such directions.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly, frankly and concisely, because we are under time constraint in terms of health regulations, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policy.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to him or her identifiable.  I ask that members and witnesses remove their masks when speaking to ensure that they can be heard and that when members are leaving and taking their seats they sanitise their area.  </p> <p>  I now invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamas McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-26a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020112600002#A01100"><p>I resume my opening statement at chapter 11.  Departments are obliged to demonstrate that they have used funding provided by or under the authority of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the purposes intended and to good effect.  This requires them to have relevant and reliable measures of their performance that are linked to identified lines of funding.  The annual appropriation accounts present details of the amounts made available by the D&aacute;il in the Estimates for each programme and how much was spent.  Information about what has been achieved with that spending is more difficult to find and to understand.  For this report, I wanted to look at the &euro;2.4 billion housing programme, to assess the kind of performance information that is available in social housing delivery.  The main objective of the assessment was to establish if the performance measures used and published by the Department provide a complete and accurate account of what is being  achieved by the spending in a timely way.</p> <p>  At the outset, I want to acknowledge that monitoring and reporting on the performance of the various public bodies involved in social housing support is a complex process. Authorities in many jurisdictions are working to improve their own performance measurement systems in this area and those systems evolve over time.  As part of the annual Estimates process, the Department reports on a range of key housing-related output and activity measures.  The data presented indicate that the Department has achieved or substantially achieved most of the performance targets it has set.  These are predominantly output targets that measure aspects of the programme-funded activity.  However, we found that the measures used are not well aligned with the nature of the activity that is funded.  Some substantial funding lines in the Vote have no output or activity measures associated with them.  Some measures appear to relate to a number of funding lines, so it is difficult to see what contribution each spending channel is making.  A number of the measures and targets relate to incremental values rather than to the full scale of support provided through the funding stream.  For example, one measure relates to the number of new housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies put in place in the year.  A better measure relating to the annual spend on HAP would be the average weekly number of HAP tenancies supported in the year.  We found that none of the measures focus on economy or efficiency aspects of performance.  There was more focus on target outputs than on planned outcomes for households in need of support. </p> <p>  The report makes a number of recommendations for improvement in the Department&rsquo;s performance reporting.  For example, we propose that they could develop new outcome and effectiveness metrics; they could express targets in percentage terms to facilitate benchmarking; and they could examine the potential to introduce qualitative indicators.  The report also highlights some performance measurement issues, with implications across all votes. </p> <p>  Turning to chapter 12, progress under the land aggregation scheme, LAGS, the scheme was established in 2010 to provide assistance to local authorities with land purchase loans that were maturing.  The local authorities had bought the land for social and affordable housing purposes but were not in a position to go ahead with housing development.  In return for LAGS funding paid from the Vote, local authorities were required to transfer the related land to a special purpose body called Housing and Sustainable Communities Ltd., known as the Housing Agency.  No new applications for site transfers under the scheme were accepted after December 2013. </p> <p>  The position at September 2020 was that 68 of the 73 sites approved under the LAGS had been fully transferred by local authorities and registered in the ownership of the Housing Agency.  For the remaining five sites, beneficial ownership had transferred to the agency but title registration had not yet been completed.  In a 2018 strategic development plan, the Housing Agency categorised 36 of the LAGS sites as ready for immediate development.  Those sites were assessed as having the potential to accommodate 3,370 housing units.  At the time the report was signed off, 98 social housing units had been completed on the sites and a further 792 units were at various stages of development.</p><p>The 2018 development plan stated that the remaining 37 sites were not suitable for immediate development for housing.</p><p> Chapter 13 deals with the pyrite remediation scheme.  As members may know, pyrite is a common mineral found in certain types of rock that can swell and lead to structural problems in buildings.  Towards the end of the development boom over a decade ago, pyrite-related damage emerged as a problem for homeowners.  The majority of the identified cases were located in two local authority areas: Fingal and Meath.  In 2013, the Pyrite Resolution Board was established to direct and oversee the implementation of a pyrite remediation scheme. The Housing Agency is responsible for the administration of the scheme, on behalf of the board.</p><p> Initial estimates were that over 10,000 homes might be in need of expensive repairs.  The outturn has been significantly less.  Up to the end of 2019, 2,110 applications had been approved for inclusion in the scheme and a further 301 were at the application or assessment stage.  By the end of 2019, remediation works were completed on 1,890 properties and the scheme had cost the Exchequer nearly &euro;126 million.  Costs per home remediated have averaged around &euro;65,000.  Future projections up to 2023 indicate the scheme will cost approximately &euro;210 million and will remediate approximately 3,140 dwellings.</p><p> Under the Act, the board may recover from any party with a liability, and the capacity to pay, all or part of the costs of remediating damaged dwellings.  Costs of the scheme recouped from third parties to the end of 2019 amounted to just under &euro;1.8 million, representing 1.4% of total costs.</p><p> Support to the value of a further &euro;1.8 million had been received from HomeBond, which had provided structural defect guarantees or warranties for an estimated 74% of the eligible scheme applications.  This support was in the form of technical and project management services.</p><p> The board estimated that by the end of 2019, it had spent just over &euro;887,000 on remediating non-pyrite related defects that it could potentially claim from HomeBond.  Just 6% of that amount had been recovered from the company.  The report recommended that the board and the Housing Agency put in place a more robust process to quantify and recover the cost of remediating such non-pyrite related defects.</p></speech>

We will come back on any items that were identified during the course of that engagement.</p> <p>  I am pleased to be here as Accounting Officer to assist the committee in its examination of the three areas covered in chapters 11 to 13, inclusive, of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, that is: performance measurement for Exchequer funding on social housing; progress under the land aggregation scheme; and the pyrite remediation scheme.  We have Mr. John O&rsquo;Connor, chief executive of the Housing Agency, with us.  Given the role the agency plays in the implementation of both the land aggregation scheme and the pyrite remediation scheme we thought it would be very useful to have Mr. O'Connor give a presentation to the committee.  I am joined by a number of experts to assist with that on these three particular areas.  The Chairman has already introduced them so it might be useful if Mr. O'Connor took us through his presentation now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-26a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Connor" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020112600002#B00700"><p>I thank the Chairman.  In the four minutes I will give an overview of the pyrite remediation scheme and the land aggregation scheme.</p> <p>  I will first give a quick overview of the pyrite remediation scheme.  Pyrite is a mineral that is found in rock and it affects the hard core.  If we take the floor of this committee room, it would be the stone underneath the floor.  It expands and starts pushing up the floor, which causes damage to the floor and begins to cause cracks in the walls.  The damage can be very significant.  It causes many cracks in the walls of houses of a structural nature and the floors start to be pushed up, which is very distressing for homeowners.</p> <p>  The pyrite remediation scheme applies to certain parts where pyritic heave is being caused.  The majority of cases where we have remediated houses have been in Fingal County Council and Meath.  They account for 90% of all the houses remediated.</p> <p>  To be eligible for one's house to be remediated, it has to be damaged to a certain level.  It is called a damage condition rating of 2 and it has to be as a result of pyritic heave.  The work we have to carry out in a house is very intrusive.  On the screen are some pictures of that.  We have to dig out the entire ground floor slab, take out all the stone underneath the ground floor slab, put the stone back in and the floor back down.  We then finish the house in that we put back the floor finishes and paint the walls so the ground floor of the house is handed back to homeowners in show house condition.  To date, we have remediated 2,029 homes and handed them back to homeowners.  That is an overview of the pyrite remediation scheme.</p> <p>  I will give a quick overview of the land aggregation scheme.  Arrangements were put in place to clear the loans for 73 sites and they have been transferred to the Housing Agency.  There are 247 ha in total.  That is 600 acres around the country.  The diagram shows where the sites are located across the country.  As I said, 73 sites in all were transferred and every number of years we do a strategic plan in respect of those sites, in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in terms of plans to develop those sites.</p> <p>  I will give the members some examples of what has been done with the sites.  The first one is in Portlaoise town.  It is a development of 33 houses provided for social housing by Laois County Council.  On the slide is another example of a social housing development.  It is the largest social housing development in Galway city, on the Ballymoneen Road, which is being done.  Phase 1 is complete and phase 2 is under construction.  Another example is in Craddockstown, Naas, which is part of a wider bundle under a public private partnership, PPP, project undertaken by the National Development Finance Agency, in conjunction with local authorities.  All of those are for social housing.  Other parts of that site we will use for other purposes.  The slide shows another one in Stepaside, Dublin.  It is a development of 155 homes done in conjunction with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Respond and two housing associations.  There will be 105 for social housing and 50 for cost rental.  That development will be completed next year.</p> <p>  Some sites are more appropriate for mixed use.  The site on the screen is in Fermoy where a school has been constructed on half of the site.  We have transferred that to the Department of Education.  On the other part of the site housing has been completed by the Respond housing association, again for social housing.</p> <p>  The last example is the Devoy lands in Naas, which are beside the Kildare County Council offices.  Part of that land is being used for an enterprise building for start-up businesses.</p><p>This is for start-up businesses being built by Kildare County Council.  Part of the site will be used for housing development.  The Housing Agency is working with the Land Development Agency to develop that for over 200 houses and apartments.  They will all be either for social or affordable housing.</p><p> At a very high level, in terms of any lands under the land aggregation scheme to date the plans are to use it for public purposes for social housing, affordable housing and other public purposes.  In terms of the remit, everything has to be sanctioned by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The focus has been on using it for social housing, affordable housing and for all our public uses.  That is a very quick overview. </p></speech>

Pyrite was a major issue during the 31st D&aacute;il and many of us were scratching our heads over how it might be resolved.  It is good to see that level of progress on it for the people caught up in that unfortunate situation.</p> <p>  The lead speaker is Deputy McAuliffe, who will have 15 minutes, followed by Deputy Colm Burke with ten minutes and five minutes for everyone else.  Due to the time restrictions, I will be keeping people to the time allowed and will allow people in for a second round if we move fairly efficiently through the meeting.  To give the committee the best chance to deal with the issues in hand, I ask the witnesses to keep their answers concise because we have a two-hour limit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-26a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020112600002#C00300"><p>I welcome our guests, Mr. Doyle, Mr. O'Connor and Ms Ryan in the room, and all those who are joining us via Teams.  I hope to keep my questions short and hope the witnesses can keep their responses short so that we can cover as much territory as possible.  I hope to cover Chapters 11, measuring performance for Exchequer spending on social housing; Chapter 12, progress under the land aggregation scheme; and Chapter 13, the pyrite remediation scheme, which both witnesses covered in their opening remarks.</p> <p>  I start with measuring performance.  The Comptroller and Auditor General made a very clear assessment in believing that the measurements were not well aligned with the nature and activity of the funding that was being spent.  A different way of saying that is that the targets might have been too easily achieved.  The value for money and the overall impact of the spending was not taken into account.  How has the Department responded to that?  What relevant targets does it intend to include in future accounts?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-26a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Doyle" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020112600002#C00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for that.  I am not quite sure that is what the Comptroller and Auditor General said in terms of the targets being easy to achieve.  I know I am new to the Department, but I know a huge amount of effort has gone into achieving targets and, obviously, more has to be done given the nature of the situation around housing - certainly the issue on aligning the targets that are published with the actual spend categories, as the Deputy says.</p> <p>  I know people say this, but the chapter is genuinely useful to us.  I am a chartered accountant by profession.  I came into the Civil Service a number of years ago into another Department.  I am very focused on the need for good performance indicators and that what gets done gets measured, and the importance of numbers as we look at what is now a really considerable spend.  The Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out in his report that on social housing from, I think 2016 to 2019, the spend is about two and a half times greater.  It is very important that we measure appropriately.</p> <p>  The chapter is largely focused on the REV, which is published each year.  We have gone from about nine performance indicators in 2016 to 19 now.  We are now reviewing what is there and how we can add to it.  It is coming quite quickly, but in the REV that is coming out shortly we will probably have a couple of additional indicators in taking account of the report.  Over the course of this year, we will look at that in greater detail with a view to the next REV having a more comprehensive set.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-26a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020112600002#C00500"><p>While the indicators measure the output, in some cases there was a failure to understand the economic element and the value-for-money element.  Let me take two examples.  A housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancy has an indicator.  Many of us in the room would have dealt with a family who might have become homeless, availed of emergency accommodation, exited emergency accommodation, taken up a HAP tenancy and after 12 months or another period found themselves back in emergency accommodation and back in a second HAP tenancy.  That is very clearly bad value for money, albeit market driven.  Many of us would like to see greater focus on value for money and less on counting what is effectively two exits from homelessness.</p></speech>

When we talk about the number of additional tenancies that would be supported in a particular year when the budget comes around or whatever, we lose sight of the fact, and do not necessarily automatically point out, that this chunk of money is actually covering this number of tenancies.  That is a very valid point.</p> <p>  In his initial intervention, the Deputy talked about the variety of schemes.  In coming to the Department, I have tried to get my head around all the different ways a house can be delivered and all the different funding mechanisms.  It is quite a challenge.  They are all tools in the box, as we talked about yesterday.  There are multiple funding streams and we have to report on the funding streams, but tying that to the outputs is a challenge and is a diifficult process.  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General certainly accepted the complexity of it.  We have to try to crack that and align those things better.  Given my own background, it is particularly important that we do that given the amount by which we have ramped up spending.</p></speech>

In highlighting those issues, we are highlighting that the policies were revenue intensive and, in many ways, they were short-term because of the immediate shortage.  Their value for money and efficiency, and the more holistic aspect in terms of being more than just a home were not considered by the policy.  The accounting is really just a reflection of what was actually happening in the policy.</p></speech>

We did a little bit of talking yesterday evening on that in terms of what was available to the State, what kind of armoury was available to the State as the housing problem emerged and the speed of it.  Certainly, the answer has to be much more build and direct delivery.  We need to be showing the balance.  We talked yesterday about needing to reduce the HAP numbers over time as delivery improves.  Delivery has significantly improved over the last number of years.  It still has a long way to go and we have to focus on that so the measures we use and the way we report it has to acknowledge that, exactly as the Deputy says.</p></speech>

Our failure to wean ourselves off HAP over the past ten or more years has been a failure of policy.</p> <p>  Mr. Doyle spoke about the supply of housing.  I ask about the land aggregation and Mr. O'Connor might like to answer some of these questions.  Let us cast our minds back to the financial crisis because that was the context of it.  Somebody described this scheme to me as NAMA for local authorities.  One would imagine some drop in value as a result of that context.  A total of 73 sites were identified, with 72 of them purchased for a total of &euro;125 million.  In 2018 they were valued at &euro;55 million which represents a halving of value.  There are bigger questions on land values and so on at the time.</p> <p>  The bigger issue for me is that it was a scheme that was intended to deliver just under 3,500 units and we have only delivered 98.</p><p>That is a major issue.  It appears that more than half the sites transferred from local authorities to the land aggregation scheme were not suitable for housing.  One would have to ask why they were purchased in the first place if they are not suitable.</p></speech>

The value has gone down.  That would be the same for nearly all lands bought during that period.  On using the lands, it takes time to come up with plans, to develop them.  Our first focus was on getting the sites, having them transferred and putting plans in place to develop them.  The smaller sites have been used first.  At the end of 2019, there were approximately 100.  That has increased to well over 200.  Very quickly next year up to 900 will be delivered, so delivery in respect of those sites is accelerating.</p></speech>

We need to get them properly planned to get a proper mix of housing and the right types of housing.  It is not just about the mix, but also about having one-, two- or three-bedroom homes, and we need to make sure they are developed properly.  The larger sites in particular take a good number of years to be taken through.  The one thing we do not want to do is underutilise sites that we paid a lot of money for.  They are coming through and the Deputy will see a very rapid acceleration in the coming years.</p></speech>

As a former local authority member, I have some experience of how it can be really difficult delivering a mix on big sites.  Can Mr. O'Connor answer the criticism of why it has not proved possible to deliver on so many of the sites transferred to the Housing Agency?  I think 37 were categorised as unlikely to be suitable for near-term development.  I realise I am asking Mr. O'Connor to second-guess the local authorities' decision but why were the latter purchasing lands that had huge debts attaching to them, which the State was then forced to take over under the land aggregation scheme, and that are not deemed suitable?  Will we see some of those lands handed back the lands to local authorities for parks or other purposes?</p></speech>

There are plans in respect of 32 of those, which have either been built on or with which we are progressing.  Another group of sites from those secondary sites is being developed.  We went out to the local authorities and to approved housing bodies, in terms of the suitability of developing those sites.  Ultimately, a small number may not be suitable for housing and other community uses may be more suitable.</p></speech>

The 36 sites were identified for immediate development.  What we did with the other sites was that we went to the local authorities and approved housing bodies and asked if any of the sites were suitable for the delivery of social or affordable housing?  Both approved housing bodies and local authorities have identified several sites as being suitable.  There are other sites that will take longer.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the Housing Agency is dealing with issues decided outside its remit.  Is it the case that there were sites bought by a local authority, because it wished to develop them, which had the potential to deliver 50% of the total estimate, that the Housing Agency asked was it interested and the local authorities said there was no demand?  There is a massive issue where sites were purchased for housing, we are asking if local authorities wish to develop them and they are saying "No".</p></speech>

In County Cork, there is a small piece of land in a village called Meelin where Cork County Council thought it had a need for a certain amount of social housing and purchased the site.  Having assessed it some years later, it found that it did not have the need and the site has been sold and transferred for community use.</p></speech>

It is a completely valid and understandable question but I do not think it is necessarily as stark that these sites will not be developed on.  They will be developed over time through a mix of the various delivery mechanisms whether approved housing bodies or local authorities.</p></speech>

If it is not possible to do it in this decade when numbers were so difficult and if it was not possible to do it in the in the past decade for the same reason, I cannot imagine a time when they would be ambitious.  I accept that the authority is effectively dealing with the outcomes of those decisions.  I thank the witnesses for their time with us today.</p></speech>

In Goleen in west Cork, a lovely part of the country, &euro;393,000 was paid for 0.82 ha.  That is phenomenal money for west Cork.  The second is Dripsey, where I come from myself, where over &euro;500,000 was paid for 1.5 acres, which now has a value of &euro;47,500.  The third that really sticks out in my mind is the one for Sligo where &euro;11 million was paid for 13 acres of land, the value of which is now estimated at &euro;420,000.  It sounds phenomenal that that kind of money was paid out without a clear plan for a reasonable period.  This was before 2008, so more than 12 years have passed and none of that land has been used.  How do we make local authorities accountable in that situation?</p></speech>

It is very hard to rationalise them today when one looks at the types of numbers quoted by the Deputy.  This particular scheme was to partially deal with the indebtedness in which some local authorities found themselves, to enable them to get on with their other important work.  A range of controls is now in place to ensure that we do not do that again, such as controls on local authority borrowing, how sanction is delivered, and particularly around the strategic planning and area development plans within local authorities, in terms of where there will be housing and so on.</p></speech>

There are two parts in terms of the lands.  There is Ballinode and Lisnalurg.  There were significant plans for large developments on the Ballinode lands, where the larger amount was paid.  There was considered to be a big demand at the time the land was purchased by Sligo County Council.</p></speech>

In particular over the past four years major efforts have been made to build more local authority houses.  The timeframe from when the local authority decides to build to getting the building completed is running now at nearly four years.  Can we do something to try to change the process within the local authority?  I refer to the time required from design, getting the project out to tender, getting the tenders in for the building and getting it completed.  Surely the Department must have looked at a better way of delivering in a faster turnaround time.  All of this land is pre-2008, yet in real terms a very small proportion of it has been built on.</p></speech>

There is the scheme itself and there is probably a slightly broader question.  My colleague, Ms Sarah Neary, who is in the other room, has done a huge amount of work on the delivery process, so I might just ask her to come in if she can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-26a.56" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarah Neary" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020112600002#E00700"><p>Over the past four years we have done a huge amount in order to streamline the approval process for local authorities bringing forward building projects.  We have worked on a 59-week target programme from conception to starting on site.  That is a little over a year from concept to signing contracts and getting on site.  That compares very favourably with the private sector.  A report done by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, in 2017 shows that, on average, a housing project would take up to three years from start to completion.  Since we worked with local authorities on that at the back end of 2017 and implemented it in 2018 we have seen good results in terms of meeting the 59-week programme and in many cases beating it.</p> <p>  One of the very successful ways of beating it has been to use design and build contracts.  We have supported local authorities in developing frameworks for that, which reduce the procurement period for the contract.  Design and build also shifts the detailed design, post-planning, onto the contractor rather than the local authority.  We have seen the four Dublin local authorities using it, and a number of other local authorities including Wicklow and Cork are in the process of adopting it now.  The pre-construction programme is reduced.  In one case we have seen a project go from conception to starting on site in 43 weeks and we have seen very good results in terms of construction on site with 30-unit and 40-unit projects being delivered within about a year.  That is as good as any private sector delivery, and it beats it in many cases.</p></speech>

When the tenders come in there is quite a big variation.  There is a reluctance by the Department to respond in a timely manner.  I have come across that on a number of occasions where there is an estimate of what the cost will be and then when the tender comes in it is way above the estimated cost.  It appears that there is quite a delay in the process then to try and make a decision on it.</p></speech>

The whole concept is to have the designs to a point where one can do an accurate estimate before tendering and then if something is way off, following the tendering process, it is worth looking to see where those problems are.  I would say that is more the exception rather than the rule.  If there are specific projects the Deputy wants to share with us, we can talk to him about them.</p></speech>

I wish to go back to the sites which have now gone down in value.  One of the sites in my area, in Dripsey, which is 1.5 acres, is now valued at &euro;47,500.  I know the area and I think that is an under-valuation.  What has been done with local authorities to try to get these sites moving again?</p></speech>

In 2019, more than &euro;800 million was spent on building activity.  As we intensify the output of units that balance will continue to shift.

The responsibility to continue housing support for that tenant therefore rests with the local authority.  The local authorities will put plans in place to accommodate those tenants.  We do not know what the objective of the owners of the property will be at the end of the lease.  They may seek to sell the properties.  There may be opportunities for the local authorities to buy them in that case.</p></speech>

They have no guaranteed place to go.  I could cite numerous incidents proving this.  They are certainly not housed.  The State has paid the lease for 25 years and has nothing to show for it.  The family that was in the property has nothing to show for it.  The cycle continues.  This is a waste of public money.  Can Ms Ryan find out the figure for lease-to-lease arrangements?</p> <p>  This is astounding.  If the money given to private landlords and developers in the last decade was spent elsewhere we could have had the capacity to build tens of thousands of permanent public homes.  The State would have housing stock to show for that.  Despite this the policy continues.  Looking at the figures for next year, it seems it will continue indefinitely.  Given the amount of money that has been spent and what we could have had, unless one has rocks in one's head the only conclusion one can come to is that Rebuilding Ireland has failed, particularly where value for money is concerned.</p></speech>

To my mind, over the past decade there has been a real and noticeable relaxation of building regulations.  I have particular concerns, as Mr. O'Connor well knows, about the recent decisions on fire prevention in build-to-rent schemes, for example.</p> <p>  We take a risk-based approach to certification in the construction industry, which is valid in its own right, I suppose.  It is, however, a model of certification which is based on the UK system, SIBC certification and all those kinds of things.  It relies a lot on information from private providers.  I assume the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has been following the Grenfell reports and that a manufacturer there has actively misled a building control body.  I am not suggesting that is what happened with pyrite, but will Mr O'Connor outline the recourse of the Department in those situations?</p></speech>

It is a dreadful situation for people to find themselves in having bought, at that time, very expensive houses only to find there was a defect with them.  In response to that, a group was set up early in the following decade to identify what the problems were with the system, and-----</p></speech>

I will focus initially on the performance-related piece of work by the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of delivering target setting.  We all took the view that there should be strong transparency on which local authorities are performing well, and that they should be recognised for performing well.  Equally, it is not clear to me exactly how that is measured and assessed or what constitutes performing well in terms of build and what does not.  Will the witnesses talk me through how the Department assesses that?  How does the Department deal with local authorities that are perceived not to be performing well on their build target?</p></speech>

There are a number of layers of assessment around the various programmes, for example, the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit, the work of other groupings and the targets we put out.  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General's report focused very much on what goes into the Revised Estimates Volume each year.  There are a wide range of statistics and pieces of information, and I have folders full of them here, on the various elements of delivery among various programmes that are in place.</p> <p>  I said earlier that my background is as a chartered accountant, so I am keen that we have strong performance indicators which allow us to measure.  Some of the points in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report are well made.  We have significantly increased the number of indicators in the Revised Estimates Volume itself.  We have gone from approximately nine indicators to 19 over recent years.  We will add some more, a small number, because the timeframe is tight for the upcoming Revised Estimates Volume.  Over the course of this year, we will work on improving the measures and linking them, most importantly to the spend, although as the Comptroller and Auditor General has acknowledged, that is complex.</p></speech>

Mr. Doyle has come into the Department, however, as a new Secretary General and has seen the work that has been done and the efforts to re-equip local authorities to build, in addition to the partnership arrangements they have for building.  We have reams of briefing materials, which is helpful to a point, but if there is too much, it is almost unhelpful.  Therefore, let us talk straight, as it were.  What proportion of local authorities does Mr. Doyle think are delivering, or delivered as expected, in 2019 and might be expected, notwithstanding the difficulties of Covid-19, to deliver in 2020?</p></speech>

Undoubtedly, some local authorities have delivered more and some have delivered less.</p></speech>

There are some that we need to work with more closely.</p></speech>

He is well placed, therefore, and as he said, he is well placed as a chartered accountant to perform that sort of analytical task.  Is it his view that the same local authorities are performing well and the same ones are not, or does he see it as a variable thing in his analysis to date?</p></speech>

When a scheme is being launched on a particular day and somebody is cutting a ribbon on it, it is a moment where suddenly the local authority delivering that has done tremendously well.  With any of these projects, we are talking about the delivery of infrastructure.  I come from the transport side.  The delivery of infrastructure does not happen overnight; it happens over a period.  It is largely the same in housing.</p></speech>

I appreciate what Mr. Doyle has said.  There are, therefore, different targets the Department sets along the different elements of it.  It is capable of being assessed, not just when a ribbon is being cut but at various stages along the path.  How does the Department deal with local authorities that are not performing well enough?</p></speech>

That is already making a difference from what I have seen so far, and I believe it will make a greater difference over time.</p></speech>

If it is looking for funding or sanction to borrow, it must come to the Department for pre-approval of that borrowing.

I will return to an issue my colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, raised.  I refer to HAP and homeless HAP in particular.  Some applicants who have been approved for HAP have had their payment reduced if they accepted a property with a particular approved housing body, AHB.  In a recent incident, a single individual had been approved for the full amount and just by virtue of the AHB they were approved to be housed with, their payment was to be reduced.  I do not know how that would happen.  I do not expect the witnesses to know the intricacies of these issues, but is there a policy or a mechanism within the Department whereby one gets a reduced homeless HAP for certain AHBs?  I would have thought it was standard right across the board.</p></speech>

There can be some unusual situations with moving from the capital assistance scheme, CAS, to HAP and top-ups with the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, to CAS and different arrangements where people accessing long-term rent supplements are transferring across to HAP.  It is more to do with the differential in rent.  We can look into any specific cases but there are no different treatments of tenants because they are homeless.  If anything, there are additional supports available to them.</p></speech>

I am flushing that out because the Comptroller and Auditor General's report delves deeply into HAP expenditure.  I would like to ensure there is no differential, particularly for people who are homeless.  The assistance of the State must be there to ensure they have a roof over their heads.  It took quite a bit of effort to get to the bottom of this case and the anxiety caused to the individual concerned is unacceptable.  I might submit further correspondence to the Department to try to deal with that issue.</p> <p>  Deputy Verona Murphy alluded to the pyrite remediation scheme.  I ask the witnesses to advise the committee on the progress made between the Housing Agency and HomeBond.  I heard what the Chairman said about the previous Committee of Public Accounts and the Oireachtas committee on housing dealing with this issue.  I ask the witnesses to update the committee on that work.  The report makes note of the non-pyrite related damage.  I am not referring to the damage identified when dealing with the pyrite issue, but properties constructed in the last decade or two, or even three, where there are general defects.</p><p>What remediation policies or procedures are there for the Department to deal with those individuals?</p></speech>

In some cases, insurance is in place and that covers a certain amount of defects.  The situation is fundamentally different when we go from pre-2014 to post-2014.  I will address the pre-2014 situation first.  A significant problem arose in Donegal and Mayo in respect of defective concrete block work.  A report on that was done in 2016.  Following that, the Government made a decision to create a grant scheme for both local authorities to administer for private housing affected by defective concrete blocks.  Deputy Hourigan mentioned the Safe as Houses? report from 2017, which outlines an approach to general defects as well, in addition to the two about which we have spoken.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to examine defective housing in a broader sense.  Work on that has progressed.  We are working on terms of reference and establishing a working group to examine that.</p></speech>

I know the supports that are in place under improvements, refurbishment of private wells, etc., but it is critical that we start identifying the group water schemes that need to be connected to the public water supplies.  There was a major issue regarding connection in Murrisk outside Westport.  I would like some feedback on where this is in terms of funding and where works can commence.  A number of communities in north Mayo - Carrowteigue, Sraith an tSeagail, Portacloy, Porturlin, Keenagh and Letterbrick - are all crying out for funding.  The biggest challenge they face is that when they submit their application for funding to the local authorities, the cost of domestic connection per household is too high.  We need to remove the roadblocks here.</p> <p>  I know a working group was established in 2018 around the multiannual rural water programme and there were a number of recommendations that built into the 2019-21 programme but where do we move in 2021 and the next three-year cycle?  People on the ground are receiving letters from the local authorities.  One stated that the 2019-21 multiannual rural water programme allocation from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage had been received in October 2019 but the proposed community water connection did not receive any funding allocation and that the expert panel that assessed all of the multiannual rural water programme submissions considered that the unit cost was too expensive.  These people are dealing with condemned water that they cannot drink.  Their heating system cannot reach the required temperature.  It is clogged with bog.

Regarding the overall number about which the Deputy asked, I think the allocation was &euro;47 million under the rural water programme last year.  It was an underspend on the capital side and an overspend on the current side due to the projects out there.  There is &euro;49 million in on the 2020 number.  We will give the Deputy those numbers but more specifically, we will come back to him because I know how important the work around these schemes is to rural communities.  As I said, our water expert was here with us yesterday when we were dealing with the wider Vote but we will come back to the Deputy on each of those questions.</p></speech>

Local authorities do a tremendous job trying to get as many projects as possible across the line.  People see TV ads where people are looking to donate &euro;2 per week to supply a family with fresh water abroad but we have that challenge in Ireland.  These people do not have domestic water that is fit for use, which is a crying shame.  We are seen as a progressive country but many communities have been left behind in this regard and an action plan to address this as swiftly as possible needs to be put together by the Department.</p></speech>

Ms Ryan has clarified that &euro;631 million covers just under 1,000 homes.</p> <p>  In terms of today's business, the pyrite remediation scheme on Old Knockmay Road was very good but painfully slow.  The Part VIII process has received a lot of criticism but I know that, in general, a Part VIII can be dealt with in a matter of weeks, in other words, the planning permission was passed by councillors.  However, there was a lot of toing and froing with the Department on minute details.  The Department needs to give local authorities a bit of elbow room, particularly the good ones.  Laois County Council has an ambitious housing programme and local authorities need to give a bit of space.  I know that the Department must have oversight as a huge tranche of public money is being spent.  This excellent scheme is a great example of one that came from the land aggregation scheme as it is built on that land.  There is a lot of bureaucracy with the four stage process because a number of hurdles must be crossed at each stage.  The scheme must be simplified down to two stages.</p> <p>  I wish to raise the issue of architect costs.  We start with a blank canvas on each site but while we do not want Soviet-type blocks where everything looks exactly the same, surely we could have a more generic design model for a one, two and three-bed unit for a terraced or semi-detached house, or a stand-alone rural cottage, and for apartments?  In 2003, the current system was brought in.  Why start with a blank canvas each time?  The only change is to the ground underneath.  We need to reduce costs and bureaucracy because there is a huge amount of toing and froing between the design team and the local authority, between the local authority and the technical people in the Department and back again.  Can we simplify the cost and timeline?  Can we use a blueprint as a design for similar sized homes?  There is a blueprint for most of what is designed.  I am sure whoever designs the blueprint will be happy enough to get a royalty for each use.  Can we do that? </p></speech>

Ms Neary and her team do quite a bit of on that.  I know that Mr. O'Connor and his organisation get involved in advising local authorities around this.  Ms Neary might talk for a moment about standardisation.</p></speech>

In 2019 we published the employers' requirements document.  That, for all intents and purposes, is like a standard specification for the quality of finishings on local authority housing.  It gives a very clear understanding, for both the local authorities and us, of what is covered by the funding.  It informs the design and gives a framework around the cost perspective in terms of briefing architects who are designing the scheme.  That has created effective standardisation and consistency across the country in terms of social housing.  It also provides guidance on costs.</p></speech>

Why not use the same design on each site?  There are different types of housing such as terraced, semi-detached and stand-alone rural cottages.  Surely we could have a standardised design for the different types and sizes of homes.</p></speech>

We discuss this a lot.  The actual look and feel of an estate does need to fit within the context of the environment and community that it sits in.  That is where the architects are very important in terms of appropriate designs.  We have done a lot of work on the internal layouts.  We are just about to share that with local authorities, in terms of a consultation period at the end of this year, so that there would be standard, economical layouts for one, two, three and four-bedroom houses and apartments.  That is in motion.</p></speech>

I could name a few sites but I will not waste the time of the committee.  Borris-in-Ossory is one example where the situation has changed in the oast four or five years.  It changed from high demand to no demand and now there is demand again, which is being met by the county council.  Some of the sites are zoned for the cost-rental model.  Yesterday, at our meeting I cited some examples of people in the midland counties.  If a family of four has an income of over &euro;430 they cannot get on a waiting list for local authority housing.  They need an income of between &euro;900 or &euro;1,000 net to get any kind of a loan, including the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  These people and their children are trapped for eternity in private rented accommodation without rent control and security of tenure.  A labourer with a county council cannot get on the local authority housing waiting list, which is ridiculous.  One of the effects is that there are whole estates with nobody or very few people working.  Even some people on social welfare cannot get a local authority house.  I have encountered a situation where two people on disability benefit could not get a local authority house.  There is a huge number of families with one or two people working earning relatively low wages so they cannot get on the local authority housing waiting list, cannot get the Rebuilding Ireland home loan and are trapped in the middle.  I have raised this issue with the former Minister, Deputy Murphy.  I am overwhelmed with the number of people who have contacted me about this matter and I have no answer for them.  The witnesses, as officials in the Department, and we, as politicians, must re-engineer the system to assist people.  While a lot of them would like to be able to buy an affordable home, which would be great - and we need to get that scheme back up and running - the cost-rental model would give them security of tenure and a fair rent.  Can this be pushed on some of these land aggregation scheme locations in terms of some of the vacant sites?</p></speech>

Now with the reintroduction of affordable purchase housing and cost rental housing, we have those options on the site and we are pushing them.  One example I showed there was in Stepaside and there are 50 cost rental units there.  On the Devoy Barracks site in Naas, the requirements the Housing Agency, in conjunction with the Department, has set for that land is for a significant amount of cost rental and we are talking with-----</p></speech>

The real problem arising in more rural counties, such as counties Laois or Offaly, is that the threshold for social housing is very low.  It starts at &euro;480.  It is &euro;506 for a couple.  Once a person's income is more than &euro;506 he or she cannot get on a local authority housing waiting list and we do not have answers for such people.  They are trapped for years.  There are lands available.  There are seven land aggregation scheme sites in County Laois, where they are transferred over into the NAMA for local authorities.  They are there.  Some of those sites are suitable.  I also bring Mr. O'Connor's attention to a site being purchased by the local authority in Portlaoise, a substantial site on the Stradbally Road.  There is potential there.  I have raised it with the management of the council and am using the opportunity today to raise it with the various officials.  We need cost rental on that.  I spoke to the director of services and the county manager about this recently.  Maybe Mr. Doyle and the Department can look at it.  Here is an opportunity to do this model in a more rural county.  It is a good site and a great chance to do it.  Might he take that up?</p></speech>

There is a wider context as well to that question.  I know the Chairman is posing it in terms of LAGs and how we progress our affordability and cost rental schemes over the coming months.  My colleague, Mr. Barry Quinlan, is leading our work on the affordability and cost rental piece, working on legislation and on the schemes, but there is a wider context to the Chairman's question and we are very cognisant of that.</p></speech>

In the first instance it is a matter for the Pyrite Resolution Board under section 13 to make proposals to the Minister either to amend, revoke or replace any part of the scheme.  With Limerick, what would have happened was it took several years to establish the extent and severity of the damage to the dwellings and to confirm that the damage was actually attributable to pyritic heave in the hardcore.  All sorts of investigations into the background and any other means of resourcing the remediation had to be exhausted before a proposal was made to the Minister.  In the Deputy's example, that sort of a process would have to be followed in order for the board to be satisfied and then to make a submission to the Minister.</p></speech>

We do not leave a problem behind us but the scheme is limited to the pyrite remediation works.  We have no remit to remediate any other issues.

General defects that are not the result of the pyrite in the hardcore are not covered by the scheme.  There is no provision in the Act for that.</p></speech>

Further on, the report states that 36 sites have gone to approval stage, that these sites comprise 159 ha, and that approximately 3,370 homes are earmarked for those sites.  It also states that there are 37 sites, comprising 89 ha, that are not suitable for development.  How many sites have come under that scheme, how many of them are in Dublin, and how many of them have plans approved under, say, Part 8?

From the local authority's perspective, the repayment of that loan is being funded from central government funds.  On the 36 sites, in terms of immediate development, 32 of them have been built out or there are plans in progress for them.  On the remainder of the sites, for a number of them there are feasibility or other plans in place to develop them.  The others are more long-term in terms of appropriate use of them.</p></speech>

It has already received &euro;52,000, which is only 6% of what is outstanding.  What is the end game in recouping public money?</p></speech>

Public sector benchmarking is relevant.  I understand the Department is not at liberty to make this available publicly.  Will the Department look at providing the detail to the Committee of Public Accounts at a private meeting?  We have to try to judge whether value for money is being secured.  I am unsure whether the Comptroller and Auditor General has sight of this.  If we are delivering houses through PPP schemes, the Committee of Public Accounts has to make a decision on whether there is value for money in terms of oversight and monitoring.  We cannot do that if we do not have the figure for how the schemes are benchmarked with the public sector.

I welcome the Minister for Defence and his officials.  I call him to make a brief opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-26a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2020112600002#A00300"><p>I know there are only two amendments for us to consider but I will say a few things before we formally move through Committee Stage.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to make a brief statement.</p> <p>  Although this is a relatively short Bill, it addresses some important matters.  The principal issues dealt with by this legislation relate to overseas operations as well as the provisions in the Defence Act for the enlistment of minors.  In addition, the opportunity has been taken to make a number of other minor amendments to the Defence Act.</p> <p>  As the committee is aware, I will be moving an amendment to delete section 4 of the Bill as this particular amendment to the Defence Act was accelerated and enacted pursuant to the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  I also take the opportunity to advise the committee that I propose to bring forward a series of amendments at Report Stage to allow for a member of the Reserve Defence Force, on a voluntary basis, to provide additional support to the Permanent Defence Forces at home and overseas.</p> <p>  The programme for Government, within the framework of the proposed commission on the Defence Forces, includes a commitment to carry out a review of the role of the Reserve Defence Force, including the question of deploying members of the Reserve Defence Force with specialist skills on overseas missions.  Having considered the matter, I recently obtained approval from Government to bring forward amendments to the Defence Acts to provide the legislative basis, by way of enabling provisions, to allow members of the Reserve Defence Force to serve in support of the Permanent Defence Forces at home and overseas, on a voluntary basis.   These amendments do not, in any way, preclude the commission from examining comprehensively the roles of the Reserve Defence Force nor do they prejudge any possible recommendations from the commission.  I am simply taking the opportunity, through the current legislation, to facilitate any such recommendations by the commission, on a wider role for the Reserve Defence Force, which I believe to be necessary, by removing the current legislative restrictions.</p> <p>  The proposed amendments will focus on the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960 and the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006, removing prohibitions, contained within those Acts,  on members of the Reserve Defence Force serving overseas.  There is also an amendment to facilitate a broader degree of support, which the Reserve Defence Force can offer to the Permanent Defence Forces at home.  There will be some consequential, technical amendments required to the Defence Act 1954.</p> <p>  It should be noted that any deployment of a member of the Reserve Defence Force, on foot of these amendments, will be on an entirely voluntary basis.  Also, I cannot accept Deputy Berry's amendment but we will more than compensate for that by bringing forward a series of other amendments at Report State that are consequential on each other.</p></speech>

I will allow brief comments before going on to the Bill although, perhaps, it might be preferable to deal with the Bill section by section.  I acknowledge the fact that the Minister has made an opening statement so any members can make a brief statement now.  I believe that the best order would be to go straight to the Bill.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

It was part of the recruitment and retention issues, basically, and it still is.  We are re-enlisting people now.  We have not achieved the numbers we would like but there is a steady stream of people seeking to come back into the Defence Forces, for various reasons.  Some of the reasons are linked to job opportunities that no longer exist due to Covid and others because we have a very active recruitment campaign under way.  It is one of many strategies to deal with the fact that we are 1,000 people below where we should be in terms of the number in our Defence Forces.  One of the ways to address the issue, and arguably it is the most efficient way, is to bring people back in who have left but have the skillset and training so can slot back into the Defence Forces quickly.  That has been a very successful scheme within the Air Corps, particularly in terms of getting pilots back.  We are trying to ensure that for the Army and Naval Service.  There has been legislation done for it so we do not have to do it again.</p></speech>

What the Minister said is a very encouraging development.  I propose a small change which would allow a member of the Reserve Defence Force to travel abroad in an official capacity.  That would allow for the same privilege as is extended to members of the Permanent Defence Force.  What the Minister said is far more comprehensive and ambitious.  He said he will introduce a series of amendments on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The proposal the Minister made today will have a transformative effect on the Reserve Defence Force.  The ability to deploy Reserve personnel at home and overseas from an operational perspective to augment the permanent Defence Forces would breathe new life into the Reserve Defence Force.</p></speech>

The opportunity for those with the skill set and training of the required standard to serve abroad is something that has been sought for many years.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this, but one issue that might arise is the necessity for people who are employed at home to give it up for a certain period of time Reserve Defence Force to serve abroad.  That employment should be preserved for them.  Will that issue be addressed?  We await the Minister's amendments and proposals.</p></speech>

We had quite a good debate on this on Second Stage.  The Bill is quite technical.  It does not change fundamental policy on defence, but I was anxious to use this opportunity to put in place legislation as a foundation, from a legal perspective, to allow the commission to make recommendations to the Government on the future of the Reserve in terms of its function.</p> <p>  Nobody is questioning the existence of the Reserve, but it is currently way under strength.  Many people have said to me that if the Reserve had an increased role, they would consider joining more seriously.  I hear the kind of accusations of training for training's sake, as opposed to training for the purpose of being deployed with and complementing the Permanent Defence Force at home and abroad.  The decision to join or stay in the Reserve should be informed by a more ambitious approach to its role.  Of course we need to manage that in a responsible way. </p> <p>  Many in the Permanent Defence Force will need reassurance that this is not in some way limiting their place on the career ladder or opportunity to serve overseas; quite the opposite.  We have limitations on what we can do overseas because we have shortages of certain specialties.  Ships are not going to sea because of the limitations enforced on us due to the fact we are missing a chef, medic, specialised engineer or whatever.  There is an opportunity for specialist skill sets, in particular, in the Reserve to be able to complement and work with the Permanent Defence Force at home and abroad.</p> <p>  When the commission has been established I will ask it to examine this more seriously in terms of international best practice and make some recommendations to me.  I have encouraged it to be ambitious and, if necessary, quite radical to reflect the future security and defence challenges we face.  One of the specific terms of reference will be the Reserve Defence Force.  I do not want the commission to make recommendations and for us then to have to start the legislative process all over again.  It could take six or eight months to facilitate those recommendations.</p> <p>  I appreciate what Deputy Berry is willing to do.  If he withdraws his amendment, he can resubmit it on Report Stage and see what I come up with.  He could then push or drop it if the amendments I bring forward go as far as he suggested.  As he said, they will probably go well beyond what his amendment proposed.  We are in a good space.  I will share the amendments as soon as they are ready for Report Stage.</p></speech>

The contributions of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  A number of MPs are participating remotely on a regular basis from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  MPs participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State have been advised that they should always be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to their participation in proceedings.</p> <p>  There is, of course, no change in regard to the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or persons outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

That, for me, was one of the most significant points within our 31-year campaign.</p> <p>  If I can go back to February 1989, as a family, we sat, like many other families, enjoying our Sunday dinner around the kitchen table.  I, my brother, my sister, my mother and my father were there when two gunmen burst in and shot my father 14 times and shot my mother once in front of us all.  While I have spoken before about that incident and, in fact, losing a parent in any circumstances is life changing and traumatic, no matter what the circumstances, from the outset, as a family, we had questions to ask.</p> <p>  My father was a human rights lawyer.  In the lead-up to his death, he had been threatened numerous times and this was relayed to him via his clients, who were held in infamous holding centres such as Castlereagh.  While he maybe dismissed that as an interrogation technique designed to unnerve the client, things very much changed a matter of weeks before, when a British Government Minister, Douglas Hogg, made a statement in the House of Commons, having been briefed by senior members of the RUC, that there were a number of solicitors who were unduly sympathetic to the IRA.</p><p>My mother and father did not have any time to react to that statement.  The significance of it hit home to them straight away but, within a matter of weeks, he was dead.  He had been killed in front of us all.  The context of the time meant that as a family we had questions.  That is all we started off doing; we asked questions.  Over time, more and more evidence arose, through the work of investigative journalists, our legal team and those who supported us from an early stage.</p><p> The term "collusion" evolved naturally from that campaign.  "Collusion" is a neutral word, at times, to describe the activity we saw in front our eyes.  My experience growing up in the 1990s in Belfast was that even to utter the word "collusion", you were viewed in a certain way.  You were viewed as a republican propagandist.  There was no such thing as collusion.  It did not happen.  That evolved into the idea that there were one or two bad apples in an otherwise healthy barrel.</p><p> To sit in front of the British Prime Minister in 2011 and have the collusion accepted at the highest levels of the British State was of a significance that can never be overstated.  We no longer talk about allegations or suspicions of collusion; we talk about a practice that has been accepted at the very highest level.  The support we have received throughout our 31-year campaign has been extraordinary.</p><p> I wish to use my platform today to thank everybody who has and continues to support us.  I will not give an exhaustive list but any non-governmental organisation that has concerned itself with human rights on this island has backed our calls for an inquiry.  Legal and human rights groups around the world have backed our calls for an inquiry.  Political parties have backed our calls for an inquiry, as have political institutions.  We have had judicial victories.  Significantly, there has also been governmental support.  I particularly point out and thank the Irish Government and successive Irish governments for their support.</p><p> That support led us on a journey that has had numerous investigations and I deliberately use the word "investigations", not "inquiries".  We have had investigations under the authority of the UK's then most senior police officer, John Stevens, now Lord Stevens, who carried out three investigations examining security force collusion with loyalist killers.  His third and final investigation led to the production of more than 1 million documents, yet the majority of that remains in secret.  However, his conclusions were significant - that there was collusion and that agents were involved in crimes up to and including murder.  Significantly, at the time he reported, he said with confidence that he had seen everything, that he had had access to all of the secret documents and that his report was the authoritative version of what happened to Pat Finucane.</p><p> Our journey then brought us much further on and became part of the Weston Park peace talks between the political parties on this island and also the British and Irish Governments.  These governments, with no input from us, picked six cases to be examined by an international judicial figure.  If that figure recommended an inquiry, then the relevant jurisdiction would have an inquiry.  Of those six, five inquiries were recommended; of those five, one related to this State and four to the British state.</p><p> At a time this country was bordering on bankruptcy and had zero money, the Irish Government understood its duties.  It understood the significance and importance of peace and reconciliation and that it needed to fulfil the promise it had signed up to.  That led to the Smithwick tribunal.  Of the four that were recommended to the British state, we have already had inquiries into the killings of Billy Wright, Rosemary Nelson, another human rights lawyer who was killed, and Robert Hamill.  The fourth case, which remains outstanding, is the case of my father.  It is the case that has met with the most resistance from the British state. </p><p> We then embarked again on a campaigning journey to force the British Government into doing something and finally grasping the very difficult issue that it faces in the murder of my father.  That led us to where I started my comments today, which is October 2011, when the then British Prime Minister apologised for collusion.  He explained to us that he was a young man in 1989, that he did not have any particular bias as to how he would approach this issue and that is why he felt the best way to look at this would be a review of the papers by a barrister.  It is fair say that the meeting went sour at that point.  We felt that while de Silva ended up being a very significant document, the methodology was flawed from the outset.  Sir Desmond de Silva, no matter what his credentials were, did not have the power to force anybody to attend in front of him or to force anybody to provide documents.  He relied solely on the goodwill and honesty of the very services and agencies we were accusing of murder, which, by that stage, had accepted that they were culpable in the murder of my father.  The de Silva report, nonetheless, is a significant documentary.  I urge members of this committee, if they have not already, to run their eye over that document.  He had access to primary source material from the intelligence agencies.  He came up with some shocking conclusions, including that more than 85% of all loyalist intelligence was security force documents.  He confirmed what we already knew: the person who came into our house that evening was an agent of the state; the person who supplied the weapon was an agent of the state; and, in fact, the person who supplied the intelligence, not just for the murder of my father, but for the murder of many others was not just an agent of the state but had been recruited from Germany to go back specifically to carry out that role within the loyalist paramilitaries.  That was a man called Brian Nelson, since deceased.</p><p> The conclusions of de Silva were shocking but where we differed from the British Government is that it felt there was very much a full stop after the name Pat Finucane as a result of de Silva report.  We accepted that report was significant but it begs more questions and it answers.  Our analysis, which was shared by our supporters, was that it was a significant stepping stone to what should be a full inquiry but the British Government was not for moving on this.  They made it very clear that they would not re-examine the case of my father and, as such, we were left with no other option but to initiate legal proceedings.  We judicially reviewed the Government's position in presenting us with de Silva instead of a full inquiry.</p><p> I do not need to take this committee through the entire history of those legal proceedings.  We worked our way from the high court in Belfast to the court of appeal and, ultimately, the supreme court, which gave its judgment in February 2019.  I imagine that most members of this committee will be aware, certainly with the news this week, that our supreme court judgment in 2019 was significant and it was a victory.  The importance of that judgment is that the supreme court was completely unambiguous in saying that every single previous investigation that had taken place up to that point was not compliant with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It did not meet the international legal and human rights obligations the British Government is bound by.  It was significant because we say there is only one option left for the British Government, namely, to have the inquiry they promised to my family and to the Irish Government, the inquiry they have put all their time, efforts and considerable resources into resisting for 30 years.</p><p> The judgment issued in February 2019 to the British Government.  It was a complicated judgment and we accept that but, as a family and with our lawyer, we were able to get our heads around it fairly quickly.  The British Government said they needed time to consider and digest it.  We allowed them some time and, in July last year, we were again forced - I think, quite cruelly - to go back to court to force the government to respond to a judgment of the highest court within their own jurisdiction.  That led to commentary from the high court in Belfast at the beginning of this month.  The judge, Mr. Justice Gerry McAlinden, was absolutely scathing of the British Government response.  He described it as adding insult to injury: the injury being the very deliberate targeting and taking of my father's life and the insult being that we are forced to go to court to force the British Government to respond to the supreme court judgment.</p><p> It reminded me that when Judge Peter Cory presented his recommendations to the British and Irish Governments, the British Government refused to tell us even what his recommendation was.  In an act that sums up that man and also shows his great sense of humanity, Judge Cory found that cruel and intolerable and he phoned our family to say that, while he could not discuss the contents of the report, he found it incredibly cruel that we had to go to court to find out what his recommendation was.  He told us that he was firmly recommending an inquiry.  However, 20 to 25 years later, we found ourselves in court again, forcing the British Government to do the most basic of things, namely, to respond to a judicial judgment from their own courts.  At the beginning of this month, they accepted that they had delayed, they apologised for that delay and they committed to responding to the supreme court by 30 November.</p><p>That is a matter of days away and within that very short window, we have been trying to revisit our supporters who have been so firm and loyal in their support over the past 31 years.  I want to take this opportunity to thank everybody.  Dr. Farry from the Alliance Party is here.  He signed the motion letter last weekend on behalf of his party.  I also want to thank the Green Party, the SDLP, Sinn F&eacute;in, the British Labour Party and the Irish Government.  Last night we saw yet another example of the Irish Government's firm support.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, was in the Seanad to debate a motion tabled by my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, which received unanimous support in the House.  I am grateful to those who signed that motion and to all who spoke in support of it.  </p><p> On Monday of this week, we met Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin for the first time in his role as Taoiseach and, again, he was unequivocal and unambiguous in confirming his personal support.  He had dealt with this matter when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs previously.  Now, in his role as Taoiseach, he again confirmed his firm commitment to my family on this issue.  He did not need us to explain to him the significance and importance of, and the need for, an inquiry into the murder of my father.  He committed to engaging with the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on the issue and I understand has already done so.  </p><p> We are now days away from the British Government announcing its response to the Supreme Court judgment.  I have outlined today, all week and all month that our position remains the same.  We want a fully independent, public judicial inquiry as a mechanism of last resort.  It is the only mechanism in this case that can fully grasp all of the issues that led to the murder of my father.  It would be remiss of me to focus my comments today solely on my father.  If this system was put in place to kill one person, we would not be here 31 years later; this matter would have been dealt with a long time ago.  Some people have suggested that the system was broken but I disagree.  I think the system worked perfectly because the system was designed to do just what it did in our house on 12 February and in so many other houses.  Make no mistake about it; collusion was not something that affected one side of the community and not the other.  Collusion visited all sides of the community and, in fact, visited all parts of this island.  This State has suffered from the effects of collusion, whether that is the Dublin-Monaghan bombings or the murder of my colleague in Donegal.  Whenever the state's own actions are being questioned, it is incumbent upon that state, if it is serious about truth and reconciliation, democracy and moving a society out of conflict, to grasp that issue, no matter how difficult.  </p><p> Legacy as a whole is a mess at the minute because we have a previous political agreement the British Government has reneged on.  It is exceptionally cruel.  No matter where in the world a family is from or who in the world their loved one was, if they mourn and demand answers for the circumstances surrounding the killing of a loved one, they deserve that.  They deserve it, no matter who they are and no matter what the circumstances are.  The sooner we deal with legacy in our society, the better.  My mother has described it previously as a very deep wound and that is apt.  Legacy remains a very deep wound in our society.  One does not treat a deep wound by putting a sticking plaster over it.  If one does that, the wound festers, gets infected, gets poisonous, bursts and seeps out.  The way to heal a deep wound, no matter how painful, is to go to the root of the wound and treat it.  Legacy will be the same.  It will be difficult.  Nobody underestimates how difficult it will be but believe me, my family is ready to deal with it.  The other families that I speak to, who have suffered loss, are also ready to deal with it.  </p><p> At this time it is incumbent on the British Government to heed the words of my family but if it continues to ignore my family, then it needs to listen to those around the world who continue to support us.  Just this morning, a US congressional letter with 24 signatures was sent to the British Prime Minister.  We are, again, very grateful for that support, which was forthcoming within a very short space of time.  We have a president-elect who was previously the chairman of the US foreign relations committee when a motion that began its political life in this House worked its way across the Atlantic and received bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress, including from the then Senator, Joe Biden.  The British Government needs to heed and read the room in terms of where this issue is going.  It is not going away.  As my mother said and as Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile very eloquently put it in the Seanad last night, we are no longer interested in who pulled the trigger; we want to know who pulled the strings.  It is now time for the British Government to live up to the promises it made previously.</p></speech>

As he rightly said, successive Irish Governments have fully supported the call for an independent inquiry, particularly in view of the commitment given at Weston Park in 2001.  It is absolutely imperative that this committee now discusses the motion.</p></speech>

I am sure that it was a lonely road to travel.  I have memories of John's dad as a young lad growing up in north Donegal.  I remember the stature of the man.  Every time I saw him on the television, I could see he was a man with great presence.  He was also, obviously, a champion of human and civil rights.  Though it was never his intention, he obviously instilled fear and things happened as a result.</p> <p>  This is a very important week for the Finucane family and I am delighted that they have received such widespread support.  I must commend other parties in the House and the Government on collectively getting behind this motion, as they should.  I am delighted that the Taoiseach met John and his mum on Monday and gave them his full support.  I believe he is working diligently behind the scenes with the British Government and I hope these efforts are fruitful.  The way the family was treated by David Cameron demonstrated his weakness as a leader.  It was awful leadership to meet the family and apologise but not set up an inquiry.  I hope that all of the work and effort that has been put in over 31 years is fruitful in the coming days.  Mr. Finucane's delivery in Dublin and his timing is perfect.  I must also give credence to Mr. Colum Eastwood.  What he did at Westminster in the past week was a very important move.  This collective political approach is very welcome and I hope and pray that it brings results.  It is important for us as a nation and for the Finucanes as a family, particularly given what John's dad was - a champion of civil rights.</p></speech>

Nobody can talk about this issue in the way that he can.  What the Finucane family has had to go through, not just on that terrible night in 1989, but over the past 30-odd years and the way they have been treated by the British Government and by elements of the media, has been nothing short of despicable and disgraceful.</p><p>The bottom line in this whole issue, in the short period of time I have, is that the British Government killed Pat Finucane and they killed many other people.  They organised his murder because they saw him as a threat.  Any state that does that and then continues to cover up that very fact needs to be held to account.  There is widespread support across our island and in Westminster, and right around the world, for a full public judicial inquiry.  Nothing else will do and nothing else will be acceptable.  As John has said, it is not because the Finucanes feel that they are any more important or that their grief is any more important than anybody else's.  They feel the exact opposite.  It is because this particular murder gets to the very core of the British Government's activities in Ireland.  I believe that it is possible, with a full public judicial inquiry, to prove that the British Government, as has already been accepted by David Cameron and many others, was very much involved in the murder of its own citizens in Ireland.  This is an indictment upon that Government that needs to be rectified.</p><p> Looking back at the Weston Park talks, as John has noted the other inquiries that were granted have taken place and have reported.  The only one that has not is the one that gets right to the heart of the British Government's involvement in the North of Ireland.  That is very deliberate and is a shocking approach for any government to take.  It has made a promise to this family.  It has made a promise to the people who want to see an inquiry.  They have totally and utterly reneged on that, as John has already observed.  I will not say more than has John, except to state there is a number of days left for this British Government to do this.  It has not done it for decades.  It has not lived up to the responsibilities it signed up to at Weston Park.  It has an opportunity now, in the dying days of this month, to finally and once and for all do what it has to do, which is to announce a full public judicial inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  Nothing less will be enough.</p><p> As John has said, this is not going away.  Those of us who support this campaign will not stop campaigning for it and will not stop supporting Pat Finucane's family.  It is all set within the context of the British Government reneging on another promise, which was the agreement it made with the Irish Government and the parties in the North at Stormont House.  It has very deliberately avoided having any level of accountability put onto its own actions, as carried out during the conflict in Northern Ireland.  That cannot be allowed to stand.  Our society cannot take it.  We cannot leave the victims outside the room anymore.  I do not believe we can fully or properly move on in a spirit of partnership and reconciliation unless we embrace the truth of what actually happened during those terrible years.  That requires those people who know the most to come forward with that truth.  Nothing else will do.  We cannot leave the victims who suffered the most in all of this out in the cold and sacrificed at the altar of political expediency because of the Tory backbenchers or because of secrets that people do not want to come out.  I do not believe we can properly move forward unless we do.  The British Government has an opportunity in the dying days of this month to do the right thing for once and for all, and it should do it.</p></speech>

John also heard me speak last night.  I very much support the motion from last night and the motion today.  He will see from everyone that it is very heartfelt.  It is absolutely the time for the UK Government to do the right thing.  It has been far too long.  It has taken more than 20 years to do so.  It needs to deliver on a commitment it made at Weston Park.  The delay is unjustifiable.  The shocking levels of State collusion have been established. This is really significant and not just for the Finucane family.  It is also, as Mr. Finucane has said himself in a very generous way, much bigger than that.  When the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, spoke on the Seanad motion last night, he said this is such a significant decision it will "be a powerful demonstration of the commitment of the UK Government to truth, recovery and the rule of law, even in the most difficult of cases."  That is what we need across the board.</p> <p>  I talked about the importance of the Stormont House Agreement in last night's debate and about the principles that underline the Stormont House Agreement.  I feel that reconciliation and legacy is the most important thing that we as a committee and we as a people need to speak up to and take on.  We have to try to heal the past, as the pain is too evident in the present.  Mr. Finucane has been a voice for that today.  It is a reminder to all of us of the really important work we do in this committee.  I reiterate what a significant week this is.  I truly hope that the UK Government will do the right thing with regard to the Stormont House Agreement and that instead of what we saw in March, which was not about putting victims first or about putting reconciliation first, this will be an opportunity to put those things first. </p></speech>

This is an issue that affects everybody across these islands.  It is an issue pertaining to the rule of law, human rights and due process.  It is important they are understood as being building blocks of all societies and that they are particularly relevant to how we can move forward collectively, as a set of islands, over the coming years.</p> <p>  On the Supreme Court ruling in February 2019, while it was not prescriptive around a public inquiry, it is our belief that it is the only logical conclusion one can derive from what was said.  We believe that the UK Government has an obligation to follow through in that regard, and we want to see the Secretaries of State making this clear between now and the deadline of Monday next week.</p> <p>  Some people have made comments as to why there would be a public inquiry in this case and not other cases.  I am very conscious of the number of victims in the violence we have seen over the past decades.  It is worth stressing again that it is the nature of the issues at stake, and the context of this killing, that make it so pertinent that the issues are fully tested in a public inquiry, that the murder of Pat Finucane is properly acknowledged, and that the underlying context behind it is fully exposed.  This is fundamental to ensuring that we have a just and reconciled society going forward.  As with other speakers, I must stress the importance of the Stormont House Agreement being implemented and the concern we share around the default we have seen from the UK Government in that regard over the past months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-26a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2020112600002#D00700"><p>I have very little to say on this other than to express my deep regret at the loss of Mr. Finucane's father, a man who was doing his best for the society he worked in.  It is simply not good enough that it has dragged on all of these years.  I know that colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in have always felt that there should be a truth commission to go back over some of the things that happened during the troubled years.</p><p>This was particularly a heinous crime insofar as the man who was targeted and taken out was doing nothing other than the job he was being paid to do.  It must have been absolutely horrendous for John Finucane and his family to grow up knowing that their father was, for the want of a better description, taken out because he was a pain to society.</p><p> Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the Seanad debate last night.  I join colleagues here, however, to demand that the British Government steps up to the plate and faces what has to be faced.  The truth is there.  It is time the British Government came out and had a judicial inquiry.  We need to get it out in the open once and for all.  Some terrible things were done by official forces, the people who should have been protecting both sides of the community.  Official forces sided, as it suited them, with different sides, especially when it came to the murder of Pat Finucane.  It was a heinous thing to do.  All I can do is express my deepest sympathy to John Finucane and his family.  I assure him that what little influence I have I will use in any way I can to push for a full inquiry.</p></speech>

Others have added their own important points.  I suggest that we as a committee, on the back of this today, write to the Secretary of State, Brandon Lewis, outlining our position unanimously as a committee that a fully independent judicial public inquiry needs to take place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-26a.394" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1556" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2020112600002#E00300"><p>I compliment John Finucane on presenting the case with such clarity and great composure.  It cannot be easy to recount the events around the murder of one's father at the dinner table in one's own home, an event also witnessed by his mother and siblings.  It goes without saying the pain and the appalling circumstances that his family were thrown into due to that awful murder and the collusion that brought it about.</p> <p>  As my colleague, Senator Blaney said, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party believes there has to be a full public inquiry.  I heartily endorse Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's motion.  As has been said by colleagues, this is an important week as the Secretary of State indicated he would make a decision on this matter before the end of the month.  I agree the deliberations and the outcome of this meeting should be conveyed to the Office of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and that the Seanad and an Oireachtas committee are calling for a full public inquiry.</p> <p>  Successive Governments have reaffirmed this position since the agreement was made in Weston Park in 2001.  When two sovereign Governments make an agreement, it is expected that it will be honoured.  The Irish Government has honoured its part of the agreement.  It is way beyond time that the British Government honoured the commitment it made.</p> <p>  John Finucane, along with this mother and other family members, have campaigned with great dignity and courage over the years.  It cannot be easy always to maintain such dignity and composure.  He exemplified that so well here this morning with his powerful presentation.</p> <p>  I listened to the Taoiseach on Leaders' Questions on Tuesday when he said he met John Finucane and his mother on Monday.  The Taoiseach said the full weight of his office would be behind the Finucane family in its quest and campaigning efforts to get a full public inquiry.  There has been international interest and support for John Finucane's efforts.  The intervention of the committee of ministers at the Council of Europe in September was an important one.</p> <p>  It is sad we have to be discussing such an issue 31 years after the murder of John Finucane's father and so many years after an agreement made between two sovereign governments that has not been honoured.  As Senator Craughwell said, there were other horrendous deeds, loss of life and injury inflicted on so many people due to collusion, along with atrocities perpetrated and supported by state forces.  The committee has often discussed the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  The Oireachtas has on several occasions unanimously appealed to the British Government to give an independent legal person access to the papers surrounding the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the atrocities and activities of the Glenanne gang, as well as other atrocities which took place in my constituency in Cavan-Monaghan and throughout Northern Ireland.  These are all legacy issues that need to be addressed, no matter how painful it is for whoever or for whatever state organisation.  The truth has to be uppermost in everybody's efforts.</p> <p>  Today we are concentrating on this motion.  Again, I compliment John Finucane and his family on the great dignity with which they have carried out their campaign.  We sincerely hope that the campaign for a full public inquiry will be reached within days.  I thank him again for this presentation.</p></speech>

I must hold my hands up and say that my lack of knowledge of what happened to his family and father was slim to none compared with what I have learned this week.  There is no point in me trying to say otherwise.  I was not even born when John Finucane's father was so cruelly taken away from him.</p> <p>  I was hanging on every word of John Finucane earlier.  What really struck me was trying to imagine the horror visited upon his home that Sunday afternoon when his family was sitting down to dinner.  When we talk about collusion and recognising the other families affected, it reminded me of my own part of the world where Seamus Ludlow was murdered in 1976 through collusion.</p> <p>  It is galling in the extreme when one thinks of the lengths the Finucane family has had to go to, speaking to legislators across the world, whether in the US Congress or the Oireachtas, trying to bring a Government, which made a clear-cut commitment to the family, to deliver on what was promised so long ago.  Personally, I hope John Finucane gets the answer he deserves before 30 November.</p> <p>  Moving forward, there are more people with more experience on Northern Ireland than I have, but the only way to bring real reconciliation to Northern Ireland is when the clear facts of what happened right across all communities are put on the table, are acknowledged and not hidden or forgotten or, what the British Government is doing, pushed to one side.</p> <p>  I am annoyed I did not contribute to last night's Seanad debate.  I was watching it on the TV in my office because I felt it was more appropriate for colleagues like Senator Currie and others within my party with a more in-depth knowledge of it to contribute.  It was wonderful to meet John Finucane last week and I look forward to working with him on this committee into the future.  I hope from the bottom of my heart that he gets the answers he deserves before 30 November.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-26a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1463" speakername="P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2020112600002#E00500"><p>I thank John Finucane for his presentation today.  This committee deals with the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement after the culmination of decades of terrible conflict in the North of our island which seeped into the rest of this island and into Britain.</p><p>All of us acknowledge the immense hurt and pain.  I speak as the son of a man who was in prison for nine years as an IRA prisoner.  As an Irish republican, I am aware of the immense hurt and pain the IRA caused to many families across the North of Ireland.  The reason for the particular emphasis on the case of Pat Finucane is that the missing piece in the jigsaw is the profound role of the British Government and the British state in our conflict.  Thanks to the diligence and determination of families like the Finucanes and others over many decades, it is now incontrovertible that the British state and its intelligence agencies, or security agencies as it presented them, were controlling, arming, financing and directing unionist and loyalist paramilitaries to kill across the North of Ireland.  The Finucane case is the most obvious one of them all because of the multiplicity of agencies involved in co-ordinating that political assassination and murder.</p><p> The final piece of the jigsaw in dealing with the conflict and the legacy of that conflict, the immense hurt and pain inflicted on so many people by all sides, is the British Government and the apparatus of the British state putting up their hands and admitting that they were a central component of that conflict, and apologising for that.  It was not a few rotten apples or a few loose cannons here or there.  They were a central controlling component.</p><p> When this case reaches its conclusion, as it surely will, the full truth will be known, and justice will be done for all the people of these islands so that we can heal and build a better country.  I heartily commend the Finucane family on the service they are doing for all our people.  Dr. Farry is absolutely right that this is not just a nationalist issue.  This is an issue of healing for all of us looking for the full truth to come out.  I thank Mr. Finucane.</p></speech>

No matter how often one hears the story of his mother and the rest of the family, it still sounds as horrific as ever.  What he said about the system working perfectly stood out for me.  It certainly worked perfectly.  It is a system that is allowing the British Government to stop the truth from being revealed.  The consequences of this stretch far across the island.  This is probably one of the only legacy issues on which there is a unified approach across the island.  Of course, it is not just across the island.  It is also for the Irish in Britain and many of the British in Britain as well.  I know we only have hours left.  In summing up, Mr. Finucane might outline what our diaspora can do, particularly the Irish in Britain, in these hours to put pressure on the British Government to do the right thing.  It is never too late to do the right thing.  I thank the Chairman for facilitating this morning's meeting and I thank everybody who took part.</p></speech>

As a child, I remember the murder of his father.  It penetrated my consciousness even as a child because it was so horrific.  I am so sorry for Mr. Finucane and his family.  As a member of this committee entirely committed to the rule of law, I recognise this is the right thing.  It has to happen.  It has always been the right thing.  I very much hope for Mr. Finucane and his family that this happens now in the last few days before the deadline.</p></speech>

Our job is to have oversight of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  We can make suggestions and proposals, and adopt motions such as today's motion.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has unanimous support on the motion.  As Deputy Brendan Smith said, it must be very traumatic for all Mr. Finucane's family, particularly his mother, for this not to be addressed appropriately by organs of the state which had all the so-called legitimacy of the state behind its actions.</p> <p>  While this committee has representatives from different parties, we all agree that truth and justice are an essential part of the healing of our island.  As Mr. Finucane said, that truth and justice form part of finding a permanent solution to the problems.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn rightly referred to atrocities on all sides.  All murders were absolutely wrong.  Violence on this island perpetrated by anybody is wrong.  Particularly in this case, which is the subject of today's debate, it is absolutely unacceptable.</p> <p>  I also live in a Border constituency.  As a young person, I remember the hooded bodies on the Border.  I think of people like Jean McConville, who lay in an unmarked grave for over 30 years.  Along with Mr. Finucane, the families of all those people who died as a result of the appalling tragedies that were visited upon them are entitled to their truth and justice.  I wholeheartedly support the motion which is entirely appropriate, and we are unanimous on that.  The committee should strive to have justice and truth for the Finucane family and for all the other families to give them closure.  That is essential so that our island can move forward together.  At Weston Park, the British and Irish Governments gave an absolute commitment that a public inquiry would take place, but it has not.  Until it does, there cannot be justice.  No exception can be made to an agreement that is written and that is committed to.  Mr. Finucane has our absolute support in all that.  </p></speech>

I thank colleagues from across the groups for their unanimous support for the motion.  The same sentiment was reflected in the Seanad last night.  It has been the position of these Houses and successive Irish governments for many decades.  I know that support means a great deal to the Finucane family.</p> <p>  Members are right to reflect on the broader issue of legacy, truth recovery and justice.  This committee has previously looked at the issue of legacy.  We all need to redouble our efforts to ensure that the mechanisms agreed at Stormont House are implemented fully because that is what we all agreed or at least thought we had all agreed.  Unfortunately, the only signatories to that agreement who are reneging on the agreement are the same people who are reneging on what they agreed at Weston Park.  We need to be unified.  We are at our best when we speak with one voice to ensure that pressure is brought to bear on behalf of the Finucane family and so many other families like them across the island and beyond.</p> <p>  The great strength of this committee is that Mr. Finucane is not here as a witness, but as a member and is speaking to this motion as a member.  We are enriched as a committee and as an institution for having him do that.  I am sure his mother and family are very proud of him coming here to do this today.  Equally, his father would have been very proud of all his achievements in politics, law and life.</p> <p>  I am thankful to members for their support.  When the motion is agreed, it is important that the secretariat issue a press release on it.</p><p>At the heart of this is a family and their request for justice for Pat.  In the remaining days, before 30 November, there has been an important series of steps.  It is testament to the tenacity and determination of the Finucane family that within a short period of days, one could have the four parties in the North write to the British Secretary of State, the Taoiseach meet with the family and come out publicly, the issue raised at Leaders' Questions, a motion agreed in the Seanad and this motion agreed this evening.</p><p> As I said last night, it is incumbent upon us to support this motion and this campaign, not just as elected representatives and parliamentarians, but as citizens and people who believe in and want to affirm and achieve full truth and justice.  I am, therefore, grateful to colleagues.  I will defer now to John.</p></speech>

I thank everybody who spoke for their support.  As a family, we are not na&iuml;ve as to what we are up against, but I believe this very vocal support is important.  It is as important here as it is in America and when it comes together, it builds a significant momentum.  As I said, however, we are not na&iuml;ve.</p> <p>  As part of the judicial review, which worked its way towards the Supreme Court, we were able to get disclosure of really interesting commentary and analysis from within the British Cabinet as to how it was going to deal with our case.  This was not back in 1989 but at the time of Mr. David Cameron's decision.  In its analysis, it described this as one of the darkest periods in its military history, worse than anything that has come out of Iraq and Afghanistan.  While I do not think they are but if members are unclear at all or in any doubt as to the severity in which the British state analysed this case, then I believe that commentary goes some way to making it very clear.</p> <p>  I wish to finish by paying tribute to my mother.  As somebody who is a parent himself, I can only imagine what it was like to raise three children in the context in which she had to, like so many other people in our society.  To do that while trying to fight for justice for my father shows the measure of the woman I am very proud to call my mother.  I was only able to say this with a degree of bravery by socially distancing from her on Monday when we met the Taoiseach, but she is not getting any younger and I had to be socially distanced from her when saying that.  She was 39 when my father was killed and I was eight.  They had the best years of their lives ahead of them.  My eldest child is 18 and getting ready to go to university.  He watched the debate last night in the Seanad.  He should not have to do that.  I wish he was not in the position where he was watching that debate last night and where he is probably going to listen to this debate later today.</p> <p>  One thing I would put into the heads of members is the generational impact of the failure to deal with legacy.  Some families deal with it better than others, but no family should have to deal with it.  It should not have to pass down from generation to generation.  That applies to my family as much as it applies to every single family who has had the conflict visit them over the past 40 years.  It is incumbent on the British Government to recognise that when it approaches how it will respond to my family.  It is incumbent upon the British Government to recognise that, as it is on all political parties, when they approach legacy.  We heard from my colleague that there is only one obstacle to the implementation of Stormont House which will, hopefully, provide closure for families right across the board, no matter where they come from.</p> <p>  No matter what we are presented with on Monday, when we meet the Secretary of State, the support we have received today and over the past number of weeks strengthens my family, whether we are engaging in the process of an inquiry or continuing our campaign.  Make no mistake about it, we are not going anywhere, just as legacy is not going anywhere.  I thank everybody for their comments today.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p> <p>  Given that all committee business is in the context of a report to each House, I propose the committee report to each House recommending it to take note of the motion agreed by this committee and, in view of the debate in the Seanad yesterday on this same motion, I propose the report recognises that debate and the decision of the Seanad accordingly.  The report will still be laid before both Houses and a motion included on the Order Paper of the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  If it is agreed, we will go into private session.</p></speech>
