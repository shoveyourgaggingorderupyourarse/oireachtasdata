I have received apologies from the Chairman, Deputy Stanley, and from Deputies Verona Murphy and Colm Burke.  I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Today is the second day of a two-day engagement with officials from the Department of Justice.  Officials from the Irish Prison Service are also in attendance today to assist us in examining the following: from the Comptroller and Auditor General's appropriation account for 2019, Vote 21 &ndash; Prisons, and from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the accounts of the public service 2019, Chapter 7 &ndash; catering and ancillary services in prisons.</p> <p>  With regard to public health guidelines, we are joined in person by Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Accounting Officer for Vote 21 - Prisons, Ms Caron McCaffrey, director general of the Irish Prison Service - it is all very female today - and Mr. Fergal Black, director of care and rehabilitation in the Irish Prison Service.</p> <p>  We are also joined remotely by Mr. Don Culliton, director of human resources in the Irish Prison Service; Mr. Derek Caldbeck, director of finance and estates in the Irish Prison Service; Mr. Doncha O&rsquo;Sullivan, assistant secretary at the Department of Justice; and Mr. Liam Gleeson, from the justice Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  I welcome all the witnesses to the meeting and I thank them and the staff in the Department of Justice for the briefing material they have prepared for the committee.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Witnesses, however, are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Vice Chairman to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory with regard to any identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and frankly, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I ask that members and witnesses remove their masks when speaking to ensure they can be heard, and that when members are leaving and are taking their seats that they sanitise their area.  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-10a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020121000002#A00600"><p>The Irish Prison Service is formally part of the Department of Justice but is funded and accounted for separately through Vote 21.  While the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for Vote 21, the Prison Service is headed operationally by its director general.</p> <p>  The 2019 appropriation account for Vote 21 - Prisons records gross expenditure of &euro;358 million.  More than two thirds of the expenditure, totalling &euro;255 million, relates to pay.  The remainder is spread across a range of areas, including maintenance and improvements to the prison estate, equipment purchase, education and services for prisoners and other operating costs.</p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the account.  However, I drew attention in my report on the audit to material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts operating in 2019.</p> <p>  I will turn now to the report on catering and ancillary services in prisons.  Catering in prisons is a significant operation involving the preparation and provision of meals every day to an average of nearly 4,000 prisoners at 12 locations across the State.  A number of related services also operating within prisons are not funded by the Irish Prison Service.  These include mess committees operating staff catering services and prison shops whose profits are transferred to a separate fund for the benefit of prisoners.  The report examined the controls over all of those services.</p> <p>  With regard to catering, our focus was on controls over food purchases and food stocks.  The Irish Prison Service has devised a 28-day menu plan which is used in all prisons.  In 2019, the Irish Prison Service incurred expenditure of &euro;8.2 million on catering purchases.  We found that the cost of providing prisoner meals ranged from a low of &euro;4.54 per prisoner per day in Wheatfield Prison to a high of &euro;7.27 in Portlaoise Prison, a variance of 60%.</p> <p>  A review of items charged to prisoner education and training budgets noted some non-standard high value food items repeatedly purchased in one prison.  These items were not called for in the standard prisons menu plan.  I understand the governor of the prison in question has been investigating the circumstances surrounding that expenditure.</p> <p>  The scope of the examination also included a review of the operation of voluntary mess committees in most prisons, which co-ordinate the running of canteen facilities for prison staff.  The committees use kitchen facilities provided in prison premises free of charge.  The food is prepared under a training regime for prisoners.  The committees can purchase food from approved suppliers at prices agreed under Irish Prison Service contracts.  The prices charged for staff meals are set by the committees with the aim of recouping the costs of the inputs.</p> <p>  The relationship between the Prison Service and the mess committees is not covered by a written agreement.  While the Irish Prison Service has issued some governance guidance to the committees, it did not seek formal assurances that the guidance was being followed.  Overall, we found that the Irish Prison Service did not have adequate processes in place to ensure there is no unintended subsidisation of food costs for the staff committees.</p> <p>  Each prison operates a shop facilitating the purchase by prisoners of a range of items, including confectionary, cigarettes, soft drinks and toiletries.</p><p>With a small number of exceptions, stock items are procured from an approved central supplier at wholesale prices.  Payment for shop sales is deducted electronically from funds held in the respective prisoners' personal money accounts, which are managed by the Prison Service.  Until April 2019, staff were also allowed to make cash purchases from the shops, which resulted in cash handling and additional control needs.  In 2019, gross profits of just over &euro;1 million were generated from sales of nearly &euro;7 million in the shops across all prisons.  Gross profit margins ranged from 8% in the Midlands Prison to 21% in Castlerea Prison.</p><p> The examination raised a number of issues in respect of the operation of the prison shops, including weaknesses in controls over stock and cash purchases and delays in the submission of accounts and bank reconciliations.  Profits from shop sales in each prison are transferred to dedicated funds, known as prisoner assist programme funds.  These are intended to be used only for the benefit of prisoners.  Our examination found some examples where expenditure from the funds was not in accordance with procedures set out by the Prison Service.  This included a number of payments for the benefit of staff and some payments related to the operation of the prison that should instead have been charged to the Vote.</p><p> I made a number of recommendations for improvements in controls, all of which have been accepted by the Prison Service.</p></speech>

I am down as the first member to speak but I will drop to the end, as is the tradition for the Chair.  I propose that Deputies Munster and MacSharry move up to first and second places, respectively.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I invite Ms McPhillips and Ms McCaffrey to make their opening statements.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-10a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh McPhillips" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020121000002#B00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to meet the committee on the 2019 appropriation account for the Prisons Vote and chapter 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s 2019 report, which deals with catering and ancillary services in prisons.  I propose to keep my opening remarks brief and then hand over to the director general of the Prison Service, Ms McCaffrey.</p> <p>  The Prison Service is a key component of the criminal justice system and its voted expenditure is directed towards one strategic programme: provision of safe, secure, humane and rehabilitative custody for people sent to prison.  The gross expenditure under the Vote in 2019 was &euro;357.9 million, of which 71% related to payroll costs, 22% related to non-pay current expenditure and 7%, or &euro;26.6 million, was capital related.  The Prison Service operates 12 prisons.  There were 8,939 committals to prisons, with a daily average of 3,971 prisoners in custody, during 2019.  In total, there were 3,405 full-time equivalent staff in the Irish Prison Service, IPS, at the end of 2019.</p> <p>  The IPS is an executive office of the Department of Justice and operates within policy parameters established by the Minister as well as within statute, such as the prison rules.  The Secretary General of the day is the Accounting Officer for the Vote and the director general and her team, including prison governors, manage the day-to-day operation of the 12 prisons around the country and the IPS's headquarters in Longford.  The governance relationship between the Department and the IPS is underpinned by an oversight agreement between us in line with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The current agreement runs from 2020 to 2022, with provision for review and amendment annually as required.  It sets out the respective roles and responsibilities of both parties, along with the key corporate governance compliance and reporting obligations of the IPS.  It also provides for a minimum of four formal governance meetings per year, which are chaired by the assistant secretary with responsibility for governance of criminal justice bodies.</p> <p>  The difficulties of managing Covid-19 in institutional settings throughout the country have been particularly challenging.  This has been accentuated in the high-risk, closed environment of our prisons.  A significant amount of work has been carried out by the IPS to address this challenge.  The measures taken have been informed and guided by the advice provided by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and consistent with the prison-specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the WHO in March and the human rights guidance issued by the Council of Europe.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that, similar to other areas of Irish society, this has been a difficult and worrying time for prison staff, offenders and their families.  Great efforts have been made to limit and curtail the spread of the virus in the prisons, including close co-operation with our health service colleagues on outbreak control and the establishment of a robust contact tracing model, which has been acknowledged by the WHO as best practice for prisons worldwide.  I am proud of the work the IPS team has done and it and the prisoners themselves are to be commended on the manner in which the challenge of Covid-19 has been managed to date.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Ms McCaffrey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-10a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caron McCaffrey" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020121000002#B00400"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to meet it today.  As Ms McPhillips stated, 2020 has been a challenging year for our service, but I am proud to say that it is a challenge that has been embraced by our staff and those in our care.  We have worked together to chart our way through this pandemic successfully.  Critical to our success has been our experience in dealing with previous outbreaks of infectious diseases in prisons, including tuberculosis.  We have used those lessons to build robust infection control structures at national and local levels.  This work forms a small part of a broader agenda of enhanced risk management within our service.</p> <p>  Deputies will be aware of the recent report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, following its visit to Ireland in 2019.  I welcome the CPT's acknowledgement of the ongoing positive steps that were taken by our service since its 2014 visit.  The IPS has been on a journey of transformation, and this transformational journey touches all facets of our organisation, including security, prison regimes, governance, risk management and financial control.</p> <p>  In September, the Comptroller and Auditor General published the report on the accounts of the public service, which included a chapter on catering and ancillary services in our prisons.  I thank him for this important and valuable piece of work.  The report made a number of recommendations, and I wish to mention some of the actions we are taking in that regard.</p> <p>  The provision of high-quality, nutritious food for prisoners is an essential operation within our prisons on a daily basis.  The total annual catering cost for prisoners in 2019 was &euro;8.5 million.  The average daily cost of food per prisoner has changed little in recent years from &euro;5.41 in 2016 to &euro;5.66 in 2019.  This differs little from costs incurred ten years earlier in 2009 when the average cost for per prisoner per day was &euro;5.67.  Prison demographics, such as age, addiction levels, fitness, poverty and homelessness, can influence quantities consumed by people in custody.</p> <p>  The IPS has introduced a range of measures to strengthen and enhance the oversight of food procurement and supply.  In 2019, in order to strengthen controls, I reintroduced a catering supervisory grade with direct responsibility for food ordering, stock control, compliance and prisoner training in all closed prisons.  The service is also developing a new procurement requisitioning system, which will go live in early 2021 and will deliver a better segregation of duties in ordering, delivery and payment.  Further enhancements, including the introduction of food usage reports and more detailed expenditure reports, have also been introduced on a monthly basis and are being monitored by our headquarters.  These actions will greatly enhance the oversight and monitoring of catering and food usage in each location.</p> <p>  Regarding voluntary mess committees, we have recently completed a governance review of their operation and are implementing stronger governance arrangements, which includes the signing of an annual service agreement.  This agreement sets out clear arrangements, including the provision of an annual statement of compliance and the preparation and submission of annual audited accounts.</p> <p>  The report has made a number of recommendations on the operation of prison tuck shops, including the updating of shop accounting systems, and work is ongoing in this regard.  A tender for a new inventory management system, which will integrate with our financial and reporting systems, will be published before the end of this year.  The new system will automate stock management processes, thereby delivering better stock controls and providing management information to allow for better analysis of stock purchases.</p> <p>  The report made recommendations about the operation of the prisoner assist programme funds.  I wish to advise the committee that, earlier this year, I decided to eliminate this programme and replace it with a centrally managed Vote-funded programme for prisoner initiatives.  This will eliminate the need to run prison shops on a profit-making basis and allow the introduction of a new pricing system, which will see all non-tobacco products sold at almost-cost price.  This will benefit prisoners and their families greatly and eliminate the need to increase the prisoner gratuity payment, which has not been increased for a significant time.  Separately, profits from the sale of tobacco-related products will continue to provide funding for a new prisoner hardship fund, which will be managed by governors and administered through the prisoner account management system.</p> <p>  The Secretary General and I will be happy to take whatever questions committee members may have on the 2019 appropriation accounts and the chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p></speech>

We introduced a protected disclosure policy in 2015 and an amended policy in July 2018.  There are significant differences between the original and the new policy.  The new policy aims to ensure that staff have confidence and feel comfortable to make a disclosure and it provides for a full, independent investigation at every stage of the process.  Where a person makes a disclosure, the assessment of that disclosure is made independently, outside the organisation.  Where that is determined to require investigation, the investigation is also done outside the organisation.  Where a person is dissatisfied with the outcome of that investigation, the 2018 policy provides for a review, which is conducted external to the organisation.  If a person makes a claim of penalisation in respect of having made a protected disclosure, the policy provides for an investigation outside of the organisation.</p></speech>

Investigations undertaken by the Inspector of Prisons in relation to deaths in custody may also have been impacted.  There was no cessation of protected disclosure investigations.

The Committee of Public Accounts made a recommendation at the beginning of 2019 on this but again it appears from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that the Government's advice to the mess committees does not constitute a formal agreement.  It does not, for example, set out that the Prison Service can get assurance that none of the food used in the provision of staff meals is a charge on the prisons Vote, that good accounting records are maintained or that prices are set at a level to recover costs.  That recommendation was made by this committee almost two years ago.  We are talking here about a mess committee.</p><p>We are in here year on year having to spend considerable time discussing these matters.  I do not know whether the witnesses feel it is not an important issue, that it will go away or that we will not keep coming back to it.  However, it is important in the sense that there are so many questions and so many irregularities are arising.  The substantive issues the Committee of Public Accounts has raised concerns about have not been dealt with.  Why is that?</p></speech>

One issue raised by the Committee of Public Accounts at our last hearing concerned whether or not those activities were subject to VAT.  We had extensive engagement with the Revenue Commissioners on that.  It was, unfortunately, a protracted engagement.  The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed to us that they are not VAT-related activities.  In addition, we have undertaken our own governance review on the operation of the mess committees.  That review has made a number of recommendations, on foot of which we have taken action.</p></speech>

We have annual service agreements that will be in place for our mess committees for 2021, which clearly set out the arrangements that pertain to their operation.  We are also putting in place annual statements of compliance with our mess committees.  They will be required to provide audited accounts with information on food purchases and analysis of meals.  They will also be required to provide a statement of assurance that no food item for prisoner use and paid for by the prison service has been used in a mess committee.</p> <p>  On the delivery of supplies, deliveries for mess committees are or should be made to a different area of the prison, with the exception of one prison, namely, the maximum security prison.</p></speech>

I suggested that he make contact with whatever agencies the Irish Prison Service had used in recent years and asked if there were instances of sexual harassment, to which I had previously referred.  I said I was sure he would like to see that dealt with, if it occurred.  He responded that he would.  I asked that he do that, he said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;great&rdquo;.

We engaged with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  We asked staff to come forward and talk confidentially to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre to share their experiences so that as an organisation we could learn and put better supports in place.  That culminated in a training package for all senior managers.  Subsequently, that training package has been rolled out to staff support officers, to chief officers within our prisons and to our HR and governance so that we are in a position whereby if a person is subject to a sexual assault in the workplace, the impact of that is understood, on a man or a woman, and that the person is given the appropriate supports.  I am very committed to that.</p></speech>

It is not exclusive to the Department of Justice or to the Irish Prison Service.  There appears to be a general pattern right across the process whereby people find engaging with protected disclosures can be very unsatisfactory with regard to career progression and the feeling that people cannot go back to work without there being a consequence.  We definitely all wish to see an overall review in that regard because whistleblowers play a very important part and should be encouraged and not penalised.  We all have significant frustrations about the process.  The problem is that very often those frustrations come about by people identifying themselves and their dissatisfaction with the process.  Sometimes that is the only sight we have of it.  The learnings are the important thing and most important is that people do not feel it is to their disadvantage that they come forward.  We all feel this acutely.  We will come back to that.</p></speech>

We have a full-time protected disclosures manager.  This is the person who engages individually.</p><p>The name of the discloser is not disclosed outside of the process.  I do not see protected disclosures when they come in.  The only sight I have is of the high level summary where an investigation has been completed.  Where recommendations are made, those recommendations are brought to my attention to ensure they are fully implemented.  There is full confidentiality within those processes.  We take it very seriously.  It does mean we are not in a position to discuss individual cases because we have an obligation under our own policy and under the Act to protect the identity of the discloser and to ensure we do not provide information of a disclosure that could lead to a person being identified and I take that obligation very seriously.</p></speech>

We have seen the coverage of this story in the press in recent weeks.  It is a huge amount of money to have so little information about in terms of receipts.  I see the Prison Service brought back the supervisory grade and that is to be commended but we are lagging in terms of change.</p> <p>  The knee-jerk reaction to these issues in the media will be for people to see things such as prisoners ordering steak and prosciutto and for it to be quite divisive.  I will not do that.  One of the points I want to make before going to the questions is that training people in catering is useful and has been a success in the Prison Service.  Particularly in the workforce in Ireland, we need catering staff and it is a constant lack in our workforce.  Therefore, I commend the Prison Service for focusing on it.  I do not think anybody wants to see money being spent on items such as steak and prosciutto but within reason it should be supported.  One of the points I want to make is that I hope these processes and a new focus on procurement do not begin a race to the bottom and cost-cutting in areas that would affect the training because it is very important that it is supported.</p> <p>  One of my questions is on the new procurement and requisitioning system.  Where is the progress on this?  We have been given a number of details on how it would look.  One of the issues in dealing with the level of supplies the Prison Service will be looking at is local purchasing processes and issues such as community wealth building.  Within these new procurement measures, has the Prison Service considered issues such as community wealth building and local buying?  There is a large prison in my constituency of Dublin Central and it is embedded in the community.  It does have a huge impact on the local community.  Has this been considered?</p></speech>

Some purchasing does take place locally for approximately 5% of all of the items bought for the tuck shop, such as newspapers, fresh fruit, birthday cards and such items.  We are bound by procurement rules and we do go to tender on those contracts and draw from an approved supplier list.  With regard to the new purchase requisitioning system, effectively what happens at present is that food is ordered locally.  The new system will mean the order is generated locally but it will be approved centrally before that order is placed.  The order will also be from an approved catalogue.  The Deputy pointed to issues in the D&oacute;chas Centre, which constitutes one 20th of our overall catering budget so we need to keep it in context.  There will be much tighter arrangements on buying from approved product lists and people will not have the ability to buy off-contract items without approval from headquarters.</p></speech>

Within the Prison Service, approximately 300 prisoners a day are engaged in catering and culinary skills courses and training.  The reintroduction of the supervisory grade will improve the number of people who are trained.  In Loughan House in County Cavan, we have our own barista coffee shop which the prisoners operate.  Members of the public come in, buy their coffee, have their scones and get the car washed.  It is an enterprise.  We have engaged with the Probation Service in a social enterprise and have secured funding from the dormant account funds to ensure we can provide prisoners with employment after release.  The transition from custody to community is extremely difficult.  We have made significant progress in the areas of getting them an income, a medical card and accommodation but employment-----</p></speech>

We regard people in custody as members of society so the fewer than 4,000 people in custody should be treated in an identical fashion to persons outside.  People over the age of 65 in prison should receive the vaccination at the same time as those outside..  We have measures in place to provide the vaccination.  To go back to the first point, we recently completed a competition to recruit prison doctors and we are very hopeful, as we have a panel formed, that we will see a transformative effect in leadership in primary care at prison level from next year.</p></speech>

We undertook a root and branch review.  We got an international expert, Dr. Frank Porporino, from Canada to look at our psychology service in 2015.  Our agenda going forward from that was to grow the psychology service and look at more specialist activities.  Obviously psychologists now are more embedded within our organisation.  They fundamentally deal with risk information and offending behaviour but they also deal with mental health.  They are the two streams that they work in but within that we now have specialist services for lifers, violent prisoners serving over two years and sex offenders.  We have moved to specialise our interventions and moved away from just one to one or very extensive group work to ensure that we provide a much broader service to prisoners.</p></speech>

In the past we might have had a situation where individual offenders could have 50 sessions with a psychologist and other groups have no sessions.  We have looked at ensuring that we have a breadth of interventions that we engage with offenders.  Obviously we are engaged with the parole board and with probation.</p> <p>  Psychology is a very important service in terms of addressing the risk factors associated with offending.  For instance, I managed the national violence reduction unit and within that we have a governor and a senior psychologist managing people who are the most challenging, violently disruptive offenders.  It is a psychologically informed approach to address the risk factors associated with those offenders.   </p></speech>

We are on a growth path to ensure that we develop the psychology service and our goal is to have one psychologist for every 150 offenders.  Currently, we are at one per 190 offenders so, by my reckoning, we need another five psychologists to meet our objective.</p></speech>

I mean in terms of the rapport and experience that psychologists will have developed when dealing with individual prisoners in terms of post-release programmes for prisoners.  I presume that there is sometimes a psychology aspect to the work done by the parole and rehabilitation services.  Is there co-ordination between the two units?</p></speech>

It would be fair to say that we do not provide post-release work, as a general rule, of psychologists with offenders.  However, we work very closely with our colleagues in probation.  That kind of co-ordinated approach ensures that for the programmes that are run in the community, say for sex offenders, there is linkage between the individuals, who have engaged in psychology work and probation work in prison, so that continues while they are released.  For the transition from custody to community, we are very anxious to ensure that we link people in.  Whether it is psychology, mental health or addiction, we have a very clear objective in that regard.</p></speech>

I have worked on prison and penal reform for a very long time.  I am really interested in the topic, particularly in the community release projects and the work done to help train and develop people thus giving them real rehabilitation opportunities.</p> <p>  I wish to check the following with the witnesses as my information might be slightly out of date.  How is the community release programme going?  How many people participate in the programme?  The last I heard about the programme was that it was 90% successful, which is fantastic.  What is its current success rate?</p></speech>

The levels of engagement and adherence to the terms continue to be very high so we still see a 90% success rate in completion.  Where somebody does not complete the programme he or she can be recalled to custody.</p> <p>  We did make one change.  We found that in 2018 and 2019 our prisoner numbers were growing.  The way the scheme works at the moment is that if one is serving between one and eight years one becomes eligible at half of the full sentence.  We changed that for prisoners serving between one and three years so that they can become eligible at half of their remitted sentence thus potentially avail of an earlier release and engage at community level because we know where people go out, particularly under probation supervision and where they have support, they are less likely to reoffend and we are less likely to see them return to custody. </p></speech>

It does require a changed regime within the prison, and a higher emphasis on family support and education but it is something that we are committed to.  I am sure that the Secretary General will say that it is a particular objective that is currently being rolled out by the Department.</p></speech>

It is the case that some prisoners in custody can have Xboxes.  We do not buy the versions currently on the market.  We buy second-hand versions and ensure that any ability to operate Wi-Fi or engage online is decommissioned.  I can come back to the Deputy about where purchases have been made from.  There are security reasons as to why we buy the older versions.  Work is then done internally to ensure that they meet our security parameters and cannot be used to communicate with people on the outside.  I do not have that specific piece of information that the Deputy has asked for, but we will commit to coming back to him on that.</p></speech>

Prisoners receive gratuities while they are in custody.  They are also supported by their families and, on average, prisoners receive between &euro;20 and &euro;30 a week into their personal accounts from family members.  Prisoners would have to save to purchase an Xbox.  They would purchase it through the tuck shop and it would be their property.  When prisoners leave custody, they take their property with them unless they decide to give items of property to other people who are remaining in custody.

I was at the convention centre earlier because the Minister for Justice was before the D&aacute;il.  I am sorry for not being here for our guests' presentation.</p> <p>  I wish to quickly raise three issues.  The old prison in Cork has been closed and a brand new one built.  It was a very good project and well delivered.  What is the plan for the old prison?  Are plans already in place there?</p> <p>  I also raise the matter of healthcare costs in prisons.  I understand that quite a number of people in prison have hepatitis C.  I understand that there is a healthcare programme over 12 weeks that can leave prisoners completely clear of hepatitis C if they stick to it.  I understand the programme has now been introduced in Cork.  The product involved is also manufactured in Cork.  Are we doing enough for the healthcare of prisoners?  Some people are in prison for six months, 12 months or three years.  A 12-week programme of constant treatment can resolve an issue for them forever.</p> <p>  I will also touch on a matter relating to compensation and legal costs for claims.  The figures for 2018 and 2019 are set out in the report.  There were 94 claims by prison staff.  I am not sure when those claims were made.  Were they actually made in 2019 or were they finalised in that year?  There were 26 claims for criminal injuries compensation, and 175 claims arising out of injuries and other actions involving prisoners.  There were 40 claims from members of the public.  We are only given the number of claims per year in this report because it deals with the financial aspect.  Will our guests give us an idea of what numbers, on average, we are having in claims per annum from prison officers, prisoners and members of the public?  Over the next few years, are we going to have an increase in the level of compensation in this area?  Our guests might give us some details on that.</p></speech>

As the Deputy has pointed out, there are different types of legal cases that can give rise to compensation within the Prison Service.  Those figures relate to claims that were settled in the particular year, so the 2019 figures relate to claims that were settled in that year.  I do not have figures for the claims that have been made, but we will certainly send them to the committee before the end of the day.</p> <p>  I should say that we have quite a good engagement with the State Claims Agency, which is responsible for managing slips, trips and falls in personal injury claims.  It is also responsible for managing claims relating to slopping out.  We are doing extensive work with the agency to identify the reasons behind those claims and understand why issues are arising, and then to take the appropriate action to ensure they do not occur again.  I mentioned in my opening statement that we have had some historical claims relating to tuberculosis.  There were 99 claims relating to an outbreak in Cloverhill and 44 relating to an outbreak in Shelton Abbey.  As a result of that, we have done extensive work on infection control so that we are now in a position to keep our prisons effectively free of Covid-19.  We learn from claims and analyse their causes.  We have a dedicated health and safety team at a headquarters level and are always seeking to understand the reason a claim occurred and trying to ensure that we can drive down the level of claims that are made.</p></speech>

We have decommissioned the old prison, although it remains our property.  At this stage, we have no particular plan for its future use.  It remains part of our portfolio, and consideration could obviously be given in time, subject to the availability of capital resources, for potential development on that site.

Chapter 7.11 relates to catering, indicating &euro;5.66 as the average cost of a meal in 2009.  Depending on age and gender, I presume, there are considerations of the volume of food needed.

As a new member of the committee I look forward to working with the witnesses over the course of the D&aacute;il term and being fair and frank when both characteristics are required.</p> <p>  A number of matters are in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The history of the Thornton Hall site is well understood and my question at this point is what happens next.  Today we will see passage of legislation relating to the Central Mental Hospital and the possible provision of 1,500 homes on State land while embedding affordability into the city.  Is that an option for the Thornton Hall site?  Has the Department and the Prison Service decided that building a prison on the site is no longer an option?</p></speech>

It is a strategic asset for the State and we have made it known to the Land Development Agency that there is a portion of it in which we would not have a strategic interest.  In the medium to long term, our preference is to retain a portion as an option in case we need it.  Our development potential around other prisons is very limited, as the Deputy knows, and he is familiar with some of those in the city centre, for example.  It is not possible to develop around them.</p></speech>

We have engaged with the Office of Public Works and the Land Development Agency on the potential for the site.  I am very concerned about retaining a portion of the site.  It is over 40 acres and needs to be retained for future prison buildings.  I mentioned earlier that prison numbers have been increasing and in 2019 we saw a 10% increase in the numbers of people in custody.</p> <p>  Before the pandemic our prisons were full, I regret to say, and unfortunately we were accommodating prisoners on mattresses on a floor.  Much work has been done in the Department in examining alternatives to custody, particularly with people serving short-term sentences.  Over 70% of people coming to custody in 2019 came for less than 12 months.  I know Deputies have mentioned Cloverhill Prison and depending on our capital budget in future, I would not rule out the potential of either a closed prison or a different type of accommodation model.</p></speech>

It would also would have a significant impact on the surrounding areas.  We saw many disputes in respect of the original idea, and I imagine it is something that would have to be handled sensitively.  Given the issues around affordability, however, there is huge potential for the Land Development Agency, LDA to develop that portion of the site.</p></speech>

It is on its radar and I will not put it any further than that.</p></speech>

Last year, with Bohemian Foundation I had the great pleasure of visiting Mountjoy Prison, to talk about some of the educational opportunities that people are taking up.  Will the witnesses outline what has been spent on education to support prisoners who perhaps are there for long-term stays?</p></speech>

On participation rates, over 40% of the prison population engage in education, and this is delivered in a variety of ways.  Looking at our prison population today, the average age a person left school is 13.9 years, so education has a huge role to play.  The Department of Education provides us with 220 whole-time equivalent teachers, and that is a huge investment on its part in our prisons.  We support education with a budget in excess of &euro;1 million.  This is used to buy supplies and whatever might be required to ensure that we have appropriate supplies in place.  I have visited every education centre in all of our prisons and they are hugely vibrant learning areas.  Our teachers are very committed and they are part of the fabric of our prisons, and the men and women in prison are benefiting significantly from the investment in education in our prisons.</p></speech>

While spending is always an important issue, I urge the witnesses to do everything they can and to continue to do everything they are doing to ensure the safety and security of those people, who are often very vulnerable in their own communities.  Prison officers are doing a huge job of work and they deserve a lot of credit for this.</p></speech>

On the issue of Thornton Hall, &euro;30 million was spent on the site itself and an additional &euro;20 million was spent on services such as roads, water etc., so it may well be a strategic asset but it is a pretty expensive one.  Could the witnesses show us a map as I think that format might be helpful in seeing exactly what might be available and what uses there might be for the site?  There might be discussion around that, so perhaps the witnesses could provide us with that.</p><p>Yesterday we talked about an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>on the detention of an individual who was refused the right to enter the country.  The witness did say that it was an unfortunate case.  Since then, I have discovered that, in 2019, somewhere in the region of 500 people found themselves in such a position where they were refused the right to enter the country and were detained as a consequence.  Given that we have a prison population of 4,000, 500 is a significant number, even considering the fact that most of them are not detained for a protracted period of time.  Can we get some detail on that?</p></speech>

Governance guidelines were provided to those committees, but as identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General, there were no written agreements.  We have now moved to put in place two things, one of which is an annual service agreement that sets out the rules and responsibilities of each party, the activities to be undertaken, the financial arrangements which must be in place, including establishing or maintaining a secure financial accountable system with accounts for all receipts and records of all moneys expended, and reporting arrangements, including an annual statement of compliance.  In respect of the annual statement of compliance, part of that is a requirement to provide audited accounts with information categorised, including an analysis of the number of meals, the average cost, and other performance data.  The statement of compliance also requires the mess committee to provide assurance that no item for prisoner use and paid for by the Prison Service is used for mess committees for meals provided, including condiments and disposals.  There are also other confirmations that are required related to supplier credit.  Those arrangements have been put in place.</p></speech>

As I clarified earlier, there are separate contracts in place that the mess committees buy from.  They are separately paid for and separately delivered to that area of the mess committees, with the exception of our high-security prison.  We recently completed an audit on catering activities in three prisons, and we identified one issue in respect of a mess committee, which concerned milk being provided from the prison stores to the mess committee and not being appropriately paid for.  That matter has been rectified, and in addition to it being paid for going forward, we have been very clear with the governor and the mess committee that any milk provided and not paid for will be back paid by the mess committee.</p></speech>

That arrangement ceased a number of years ago, so while there is no disciplinary issue arising necessarily, there is clearly a concern from our perspective in respect of assurance and compliance.  Over the past 12 months, on at least three occasions, I have written to governors to remind them of their responsibilities to ensure that any food purchased for prisons does not find its way to the mess committee, and ultimately that responsibility lies with the governor of each institution.</p></speech>

Through audit we feed it into their recommendations across a whole range of issues, so if anything is raised, even if the disclosure itself is not upheld, they can still extract the learnings.  Obviously, they safeguard the confidentiality of the process, but they apply it through their audit recommendations and then we take it on board and make sure we have a process to implement the auditor conditions.</p></speech>

It is always going to be difficult for somebody to go back to work if he or she has disclosed something.  What systems are put in place to protect the person?  Is there a system that involves some degree of mediation?  As I said, this is not exclusive to the Prison Service or the Department of Justice but it certainly impacts people who feel they are disadvantaged.  They are perhaps given particular shifts or they are transferred, and there is no explanation for such things happening other than that the person was a whistleblower.</p></speech>

I agreed with the Vice Chairman's point earlier that once one gets into the process it is difficult to get a good outcome for the discloser at the end of it because, between audit and then quite a legalistic process around investigation and so forth, it can become almost adversarial for the person, and that is not what it is supposed to be.  I have some reservations about the path we have gone down in terms of independent investigation because I think there is a risk.  While it gives us the arm's length and the independence and confidence to which the director general referred, we have to make sure, as the Vice Chairman said, that that kind of mediation approach is our principle concern.  How do we safeguard the individual and his or her future within the organisation?  So many people are totally committed to both the organisation and their work within it and making the organisation better.  How do we uphold and safeguard that?  The mediation approach is something HR will look at, as is my suggestion as to how the Department should process disclosures in the near future.</p></speech>

I want to come back to the suggestion I made earlier to the committee.  I am not confident that the Prison Service has addressed the issues raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in a timely manner.  There are the issues surrounding the staff mess.  There does not seem to be adequate record keeping.  There is the issue of the funds that should be solely for the benefit of prisoners being used for other purposes.  These situations are not ordinary in any organisation, let alone when they carry on for years through subsequent reviews.  I therefore suggest that the committee recommend that the Minister for Justice request that the Inspector of Prisons carry out an investigation of these irregularities.  Perhaps this time around a final, single report from that office will achieve what the Department of Justice and the Irish Prison Service cannot.  As I said, this has been going on for years.  We are back here each year raising the same issues.  Successive Comptrollers and Auditors General have flagged up the same irregularities.  Therefore, for once and for all I would like the committee to support the recommendation that we write to the Minister requesting-----</p></speech>

Even in doing the report we could already see some improvements between 2018 and 2019.  A number of changes occurred there, including in the prison tuck shops and in the ceasing of sales to staff members in 2019.  One can even see the impact on the profits in the year.  Certainly, I would welcome the changes that have been outlined by the director general.  I think they would represent significant improvement and will make improvements as they are implemented.  Finally, we will come back and look at this again in subsequent audits and I expect I will report to the committee again in future on how these recommendations have been implemented.  That should give more roundedness and an assurance to the committee that recommendations have been acted on.</p></speech>

I think it would also send out a message that where there are these irregularities going on for quite some time, and despite the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, through the Committee of Public Accounts, has raised them, it has taken this length of time for some to be acted on.  There are others that have yet to be acted on.  In the interest of transparency, I think it would be wise of the committee to recommend that the Minister ask the Inspector of Prisons to carry out an investigation of these irregularities.

The milk issue bears out the point I have raised.  I was accused by the previous Secretary General of not having tested things in advance.  We only raise issues if people raise them with us.  The milk issue proves that it could happen, and indeed did happen in at least one instance.  Some years ago, I raised multiple instances of cross-subsidisation between prison stores and mess stores.  We have new controls now, but we have no accounts.  After our meeting in 2019, we got a list of balances of accounts and nothing more.</p><p> The memorandum issued by the Irish Prison Officers Association, IPOA, seeking approval for the establishment of messes states that 40% of staff spend &euro;10.61 per day.  I will quote the IPOA's figures.  The State provides &euro;1.4 million of subsidies for staff, equipment, heat, light, etc., and the system works very well.  If &euro;10.61 was spent per day by 470 staff members, a substantial amount of money would be raised every day throughout the eight prisons.  If we multiply that by 365 and then by seven we arrive at a figure of several millions.  I note that these were all cash transactions.  I join Deputy Munster in suggesting that we get an external investigator to look through those seven years' figures to ensure the milk issue was a once-off.  I hope that would be supported by the Irish Prison Service.  In case the IPOA is watching, I want to make it absolutely clear that I am totally in favour of the appropriate supports for hard-working prison officers.  Their job is a very difficult one.  There is probably an argument for them to be fed and watered free of charge given the dangers of their job.  It is not about those facilities.  It is about the appropriate oversight of many millions of euro of subsidy during that seven-year period, for which there are effectively no records. </p><p> Yesterday, I raised the issue of protected disclosures and the terms of reference of external investigations.  Ms McPhillips noted that the terms of reference are prescribed under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and are not in her Department's remit.  The witnesses were to check this.  What is the situation?</p></speech>

One of my colleagues referred to the generic terms of reference which are made available.  Those generic terms are issued by the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, when contracting for the investigation.  That body issues a standard set of terms of reference.  In each case the independent investigator looks at the generic terms and comes up with a specific set of terms of reference for each individual.</p></speech>

I appreciate that there has been a change of personnel, but this is our first and only opportunity to ask this question.  The letter from the then Secretary General said that one private company was paid &euro;9,586.59 in 2011 and &euro;8,641.68 in 2012.  A second company was paid &euro;10,774.12 in 2011.  Ms McPhillips's predecessor stated that it was not possible from the information available to determine if these payments related to the surveillance of prison staff.  If Ms McPhillips does not have the information today, I ask her to come back to us a specific answer.</p></speech>
