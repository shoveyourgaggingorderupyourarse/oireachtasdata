From the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we are joined by Mr. Bill Callanan, Ms Deirdre Fay, Mr. Fergus Moore and Mr. Dale Crammond.  From the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, we are joined by: Mr. Paul Lemass, assistant secretary; Mr. Sean Armstrong, principal officer; and Mr. Michael MacDonagh and Ms Suzanne Nally from the heritage division.  From the Department of Transport, we are joined by: Mr. Caoimhin O'Ciaruain, principal officer; Dr. Aoife O'Grady, principal officer; and Ms Andrea Lennon, principal officer.  From the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, we are joined by: Mr. Paddy Mahon, chief executive of Longford County Council and chair of the City and County Management Association, CCMA, climate action, transport and networks committee of the LGMA; and Mr. David Mellett, co-ordinator of the Atlantic Seaboard North climate action regional office, CARO, of the LGMA.</p><p> I welcome the witnesses.  The purpose of this series of meetings is to consider the carbon budgets.  This is the final meeting in this series.  We had three meetings last week.  Following this meeting, the committee will report back to the D&aacute;il in writing with recommendations by 7 February 2022.</p><p> I remind those present of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity outside the Houses by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, he or she will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks and it is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction.  There are limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  I ask that prior to making their contribution, members confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p> I invite witnesses to make their opening statements.  I request that they adhere to the five-minute timeline due to the number of them attending this morning.  I will indicate when they each have one minute left.  I invite Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor &Oacute; Raghallaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022011800002#B00200"><p>In September, I was appointed as head of the climate action unit at the Department of the Taoiseach.  Immediately prior to that, I had been serving as deputy Secretary General to President Higgins.  In my previous career, I had some relevant experience relating to my current job.  I spent six years as a director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service dealing with biodiversity protection and the implementation of relevant EU law in Ireland.  I was also directly involved with climate policy for a number of years in the Department of the Environment representing Ireland at EU meetings and also representing the EU in negotiations at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p> <p>  The climate action unit at the Department of the Taoiseach was established in 2019 in recognition of the need to ensure a whole-of-government response to the climate crisis and specifically to strengthen governance and oversight of the implementation of climate policy.  The unit concerns itself with the broad scope of issues relevant to the climate challenge as well as with wider environmental issues, including biodiversity, water and air quality.</p><p>Our purpose is to support the Taoiseach and the Government in their leadership of Ireland's transition to a climate-resilient, biodiversity-rich, environmentally-sustainable and climate-neutral economy, as mandated in the passing of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act last summer.  The legislation is just one part of the Government's comprehensive approach to climate action.  A wide range of practical commitments are included in the programme for Government and now also contained in the Climate Action Plan 2021.  Following publication of the climate action plan in December, the Government published an annexe of actions to the climate action plan that contains details of more than 1,000 individual measures that have been agreed to complete the actions committed to in the plan.</p><p> The climate action unit plays a role in co-ordinating climate action across the Government, which is essential in such a complex policy space, and also in making sure that each Department and sector can play its full part in moving us quickly and coherently towards the changes that are required.  The work of the unit is, as members would expect, cross-cutting, supporting climate action through the provision of systemic supports and seeking to identify and remove barriers to our transition to the climate-neutral future envisaged by the Government.  Our principal purpose is to support the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change in its work as well as that of the associated senior officials group.</p><p> The unit also supports the work of the climate action delivery board, which has been tasked with holding each Department and public body accountable for the delivery of actions set out in the climate action plan.  The delivery board is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government and the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p><p> A key aspect of monitoring the implementation by Departments of agreed climate action measures, which are set out in the climate action plan and its annexe, is the preparation of quarterly progress reports.  This work is also undertaken by the climate action unit that I lead.  Under the climate action plan, and its annexe, Departments have been assigned lead responsibility in respect of each measure and a timeline for completion is provided.  Departments that have responsibility for actions report progress to our Department in each quarter.</p></speech>

This process is essential to maintain accountability in the system.  These reports are brought to the Government for its information and are published on the Department's website.  To date, we have had nine progress reports, the most recent covering quarter 3 of 2021.</p> <p>  From Roinn an Taoisigh's perspective, we now have to increase our focus on implementation and delivery of climate action.  A number of actions have been committed to in the climate action plan for this year to better identify and address barriers to timely implementation within Departments and across the public sector and also to ensure that necessary systemic supports are in place for Departments to fulfil the climate leadership role that is expected of them.  I thank the committee for inviting me to attend.  I am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

I had to speed him up and he did not get to read one paragraph of his submission into the record.  I want to come back to that later.  I invite Mr. Callanan from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bill Callanan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022011800002#C00500"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it to inform its considerations of the carbon budgets.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Deirdre Fay and Dale Crammond from the climate change division, and by Mr. Fergus Moore, who is head of forest sector development.</p> <p>  The 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis is an extremely ambitious but also challenging target for all sectors, including both agriculture and the land use, land-use change and forestry, LULUCF, sectors.  The agriculture sector, due to its biological nature, coupled with the high level of methane in the emissions profile results in unique challenges in particular when compared to other EU member states.  In the absence of new technological innovations and as long as the sector produces food, feed or fibre there will always be residual emissions.</p> <p>  The recently published Climate Action Plan 2021 sets out what is needed from each sector with the plan committing the agriculture sector to reducing its emissions by between 22% and 30% to bring the emissions for agriculture into the range of 16-18 Mt and for LULUCF, a contribution of 2 Mt from land use and land use change and forestry.</p><p>We are not starting from a point of inaction and the commitments in the Climate Action Plan 2021 build on progress to date.  Food Vision 2030, the stakeholder-led strategy for the development of the sector, sets an ambitious agenda, addressing sustainability in all its dimensions and identifying that Ireland will aim to become a world leader in sustainable food systems.  Food Vision 2030 is about targeting increases in value growth rather than volume growth and evolving and adjusting to a more sustainable way of farming that uses fewer inputs and relies instead on new technologies and new practices.  The publication of the Climate Action Plan 2021 goes hand in hand with Food Vision, thereby ensuring Ireland can continue to produce high quality food in a manner that protects the environment and mitigates climate change.  It is important that we drive this momentum forward.</p><p> Driving environmental ambition and change at farm level will require a combination of policy instruments, such as financial incentives, for example through the Common Agricultural Policy strategic plan, through market-driven support for farmers by food processors and food companies or regulation with an initial focus on reducing nitrogen use, or through the roll-out of new emerging technological solutions and innovations.  Early action and high levels of take-up will be required across our 135,000 farms to drive momentum towards achieving the required ambition in the context of managing emissions from our dairy herd and transforming our model of beef production.</p><p> As noted earlier, food production is a biological system and the climate Act makes it clear that the social and economic role that Irish agriculture plays in society must be considered at all stages of the carbon budgetary process.  To ensure early action in the first five-year carbon budget, there will be a significant focus on reducing nitrous oxide emissions in agriculture, mainly associated with the use of chemical nitrogen fertiliser.  A national fertiliser register of compliance will be developed and reductions in chemical nitrogen allowances will help to achieve our objectives, as will supports such as training and advisory services to underpin this transition.</p><p> Reductions in methane are more challenging as the technological advances are not available in the marketplace.  Progress on methane is expected to accelerate in the second five-year carbon budget as methane-reducing feed additives become commercially available.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine continues to significantly fund and participate in international research to address the methane challenge from pasture-based livestock production systems.  The importance of cutting methane to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goals is widely recognised but it must be acknowledged that in the short term the global focus is on cutting fossil methane, something for which the EU Commission will legislate in 2022.  The challenge to reduce methane levels in Ireland is very clear, as 95% of total methane emissions arise in the agriculture sector where abatement potential is limited.</p><p> New technologies, such as the development of feed additives, will be needed to complement existing technologies to bring the sector into the climate action plan target range of a reduction of 22% to 30% for agriculture.  Long lead-in times will be essential to allow for the scale-up and deployment of commercial technologies.  Importantly, given the international research focus and findings to date, the commercialisation potential of this technological advancement and innovation is extremely promising.  Through the national soil carbon observatory we support increasing afforestation rates, a focus on reducing emissions associated with the management of peat-based soils in agricultural use and the development of our knowledge about carbon flows in our soils.  This will be critical also in respect of land-based emissions and opportunities for removals.</p><p> Agriculture globally impacts on our climate but it is also very much impacted by climate change.  As set out in Food Vision 2030, there is a critical need to consider the three pillars of social, economic and environmental sustainability as we move forward.  The targets as set out in the 2021 plan are ambitious but challenging for the sector as part of the economy-wide target of 51% reduction in emissions.  In particular, there are significant challenges around the reduction of methane in our pasture-based livestock production system.  We welcome the fact that the second five-year carbon budget is aligned with the current technology constraints in this regard.  I and my colleagues are happy to answer any questions committee members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022011800002#D00200"><p>I now invite Mr. Carroll from the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022011800002#D00300"><p>I will use my opening remarks to address the three issues the committee has indicated that it would like to discuss.  The first relates to how Departments intend to deliver the carbon budgets.  The Climate Action Plan 2021 builds on the Climate Action Plan 2019, recognising that a larger range of measures are now required to achieve the significant increase in ambition set out in the 2020 programme for Government.</p><p>The focus of the 2021 plan is on delivering a 51% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 and a pathway consistent with climate neutrality by no later than 2050.</p><p> To support these two objectives, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 provides for the adoption of a programme of three sequential, five-year, economy-wide carbon budgets, namely, 2021 to 2025; 2026 to 2030; and 2031 to 2035, the latter being provisional.  It is these budgets the committee is currently considering with a view to providing a report to the Oireachtas.  Once the carbon budgets are adopted, Government must then approve sectoral emissions ceilings within the limits of the respective economy-wide carbon budgets.  The 2021 climate Act also provides that Government approve an annual update to the climate action plan that is consistent with the carbon budget programme.  Once the carbon budget programme and associated sectoral emissions ceilings have been adopted, the Climate Action Plan 2022 will update the 2021 plan to ensure such consistency.</p><p> While I have set out key elements of the legal and policy framework to support Departments delivering the carbon budgets, this is not to say it will be easy.  The challenge of doing so is very significant and will require transformational change across all sectors of society and the economy.  The current climate action plan sets out ambitious targets, measures and actions for all sectors while also recognising we cannot yet identify all the emerging science, technologies or policies to meet our full ambition, but it points to further measures that could close the gap.  A programme of work will be undertaken to refine the potential of these measures and to set relevant targets and pathways.  These will be reflected in future climate action plans.</p><p> The second issue signalled by the committee is whether the carbon budgets meet the requirements under the 2021 climate Act.  While the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications is currently considering the carbon budgets in accordance with the provisions of the legislation, including consulting with the committee, other Ministers and the public, the carbon budget technical report of the Climate Change Advisory Council clearly sets out that the proposed budgets have been calculated to allow compliance with 51% emissions reduction by 2030 and to set Ireland on a pathway to achieving climate neutrality by 2050.</p><p> The proposed carbon budgets have been calculated in line with SI 531 of 2021, Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 (Greenhouse Gas Emissions) Regulations 2021.  They use the most recent Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, inventories and projections, they are built on the latest science, and they are consistent with international best practice on reporting.</p><p> With regard to the need to maximise employment and ensure a just transition in Ireland, appropriately designed climate policies, measures and actions have significant potential to open up new employment and enterprise opportunities, including targeted supports to help particularly impacted groups, regions and communities adapt to the new economy, as committed to in the Climate Action Plan 2021.  In terms of consistency with Article 2 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, and having regard to international climate justice, Ireland is required to make an appropriate contribution via the European Union's nationally determined contribution to the Paris Agreement.  The proposed carbon budgets will enable this.</p><p> The third and final issue the committee highlighted for discussion is how the carbon budgets intersect with the climate action plan.  I have already outlined this in my statement.  It is clear that a relentless focus on delivery and intense policy evaluation over future iterations of the climate action plan will be essential to achieve the greenhouse gas emissions reductions necessary for compliance with the carbon budget programme to be adopted by Government this spring.</p><p> I thank the committee for inviting me and my colleagues.  I am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Lemass" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022011800002#E00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the joint committee on this topic of carbon budgets.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Se&aacute;n Armstrong, Ms Alma Walsh, Mr. Michael MacDonagh and Ms Suzanne Nally.</p> <p>  Housing for All sets a target of an average of 33,000 dwellings per annum.  The State plans to invest &euro;20 billion in the next five years, which is the largest investment in housing in the history of the State.  Over its lifetime, Housing for All seeks to eradicate homelessness and promote social inclusion.  It takes account of our climate action targets though the following policies.</p><p>One is the implementation of nearly zero energy buildings through the building regulations, which will ensure that while we achieve more energy-efficient buildings we also build healthy, sustainable and durable buildings suitable for the Irish climate both today and in the future.  In addition, the Department's retrofitting programme for local authority housing is an essential measure to target climate justice.  The Department plans to retrofit approximately 40% of local authority dwellings not currently performing to a building energy rating, BER, of B2 up to B2 or cost optimal equivalent by 2030.  There is also the national planning framework objective to promote compact urban growth and town centres first.</p><p> As set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, published proposed carbon budgets in October 2021.  These proposed budgets are planned to be presented to the Oireachtas and approved by the Government in the coming months.  The Government will then set sectoral emissions ceilings determining how each sector of the economy will contribute to the achievement of the budgets.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is implementing a range of ambitious decarbonisation actions for housing, planning, marine and natural heritage protection and analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s climate.  In 2021, we worked with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and a range of other Departments and agencies to publish the Climate Action Plan 2021.</p><p> I will give the committee an overview of the many areas this Department is working on to achieve our shared goals of achieving net zero emissions no later than 2050 and a 51% reduction in emissions by the end of this decade.  The statutory national marine planning framework, established in 2021, sets out objectives and policies, including in respect of climate change adaptation and mitigation, which must be considered with regard to all programmes, plans or policies and consenting, approvals or regulations in Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area.  Management of Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area is being reformed through the Maritime Area Planning Act, which was signed by President Higgins on 23 December last.  The emerging plan-led system will provide a foundation for climate measures, such as meeting renewable energy targets through offshore renewable energy installations, and identify ways that all activities in the maritime area can contribute to carbon reduction and adaptation measures.</p><p> I am pleased to advise that the Climate Action Plan 2021 aligns closely with the Housing for All strategy in areas such as compact growth, nearly zero energy buildings and retrofit of social housing.  While the retrofitting of the existing buildings is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, this Department is showing public sector leadership in our ambitious programme of retrofitting social housing.  The Department has made a submission to the national development plan that 36,500 local authority-owned houses will be retrofitted to a BER of B2 by 2030, at an estimated cost of &euro;1.2 billion.  In 2022, the energy efficiency retrofitting programme will see a significant increase in funding support to local authorities to &euro;85 million, allowing 2,400 homes nationally to be upgraded to a B2 or equivalent standard.</p><p> The national planning framework, NPF, puts climate action and the national objective to transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient society by 2050 as a central outcome.  In addition, it promotes compact growth.  The overall NPF strategy is for a better balance of development between the regions and a greater focus on Ireland&rsquo;s cities, where 50% of development overall is targeted, with 50% of that growth to be supported to take place in the four cities other than Dublin.  The introduction of nearly zero energy buildings, NZEB, and major renovations performance requirements in building regulations by my Department in 2019 is already making a significant contribution to these targets.  Central Statistics Office analysis shows that 97% of new dwellings have an A rated building energy rating and the BER database shows that 80% of new dwellings built to these 2019 regulations have installed heat pumps.</p><p> Measures to protect biodiversity are also a welcome inclusion in the plan, as are measures to restore and rehabilitate Ireland&rsquo;s peatlands.  The restoration and protection of raised bogs is an action for this Department in Ireland's climate action plan.  Returning peatlands to more natural conditions will deliver a range of climate benefits through reduced carbon emissions, long-term carbon storage, increased carbon sequestration and enhanced resilience to the locked-in impacts of climate change.  The Department has accelerated significantly its programme of restoration for raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas in recent years with assistance from the carbon tax fund and Exchequer funding for the Department.  The programme has allowed the creation and sustainment of a number of jobs in the midlands region in particular.  The Department is currently drafting the fourth national biodiversity action plan, with a review of the third plan also planned.</p><p> As the Department with responsibility for water quality, including good agricultural practices for the protection of water regulations, the inclusion of measures in the climate action plan to address inputs from agriculture, such as reducing the usage of chemical fertiliser, will bring benefits to the quality of our rivers and lakes and for climate change.  A key commitment in the programme for Government is to publish a strengthened river basin management plan in 2022 to advance Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a robust and effective policy for water services and water quality through the implementation of the EU water framework directive.  In developing the final plan and its programme of measures, the Department will seek to identify those measures that will deliver multiple benefits for water, biodiversity and climate change.</p><p>Met &Eacute;ireann has also provided significant actions which will deliver climate services as enablers of climate action in areas such as water, transport, energy and biodiversity. </p><p> In addition to these major actions, which will make significant impacts on carbon emissions, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has a number of supporting actions, which are critical to the reductions.  These include wind energy guidelines, measures to support the reduction of embodied carbon in construction materials and implementation of requirements for electric vehicle recharging infrastructure.  The sectoral contributions of these actions will be captured in other sectors.  Specific actions under all these policy areas are outlined in the climate action plan, which the Department is working to implement. </p><p> We have ambitious targets in terms of the quantity, type and location of homes to be delivered and we are also ambitious for climate action, including energy efficient housing.  Through our building regulations we are ensuring the quality of the homes we are building for future generations continues to achieve the high standards we are setting for decarbonisation of our built environment.  We are happy to address any questions the members of the committee may have. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Caoimh&iacute;n &Oacute; Ciaru&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022011800002#G00300"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and committee members for this opportunity.  The &Oacute; Ciaru&aacute;in following Caoimh&iacute;n always trips people up.  As of today, I head up the climate action division in the Department.  I am joined today by Dr. Aoife O'Grady, who heads up the climate delivery division, which looks after electrical and demand management policies, and by Ms Andrea Lennon, who heads up our energy, air and adaptation division, which includes policies relating to renewables and biofuels for transport.</p> <p>  As members will know, the transport sector, at the last count, accounts for approximately 18% of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions.  Covid-19 had a temporary suppressing effect on emissions from transport but that does not lessen the need for fundamental changes to the transport system.  Transport behaviour is deeply embedded in how and where we work and live.  This makes the challenge in delivering the required reduction in transport a systemic and challenging one.  However, the prize is worth it.  There are many significant co-benefits for all of us from more sustainable travel in terms of quality of life and health benefits.  It will result in quieter streets and neighbourhoods, free from noisy traffic and fumes, and more livable towns and cities with better air quality and less urban congestion. </p> <p>  In transport, the Climate Action Plan 2021, CAP21, sets out a roadmap to deliver a range of between 42% and 50% in carbon reduction by 2030.  The pathway for decarbonizing transport is multilayered, combining significant behavioural change and technology adoption.  It is premised on the avoid-shift-improve approach to achieve the level of transformation required over the longer term.  It still requires individual choices and action on a daily basis and no less than a significant mindset shift in terms of how we travel.  The pathway for the next decade focuses on the following measures: first, a significant modal shift to sustainable transport modes, away from fossil-fuelled cars to public transport and active travel modes; second, accelerating the electrification of road transport, particularly the private car but also public transport; and, third, increased use of biofuels within existing technologies. </p> <p>  Modal shift to sustainable mobility will be achieved through a significant increase in public transport and active travel infrastructure and services, allied with the introduction of measures to disincentivise the use of the traditional fossil-fuelled vehicle, so-called demand management measures.  This category of sustainable mobility and demand management measures will deliver the greatest impact over the longer term.  These measures will require significant buy-in across the system, working closely with stakeholders, including other Departments, local authorities, the enterprise sector, the political system and, particularly, and most of all, the citizen. </p> <p>  The electrification of the passenger car fleet is ambitious and necessary.  The climate action plan envisages a future where Ireland&rsquo;s roads are ultimately free from fossil fuel cars.  In this regard, we are leading the way with public sector fleets and providing supports for private car users to make that switch.  There are acknowledged challenges on this journey but the destination is clear. </p> <p>  Increased use of biofuels in existing technologies will continue to make a significant contribution to decarbonising transport in the medium term while we transition to lower and zero-emission transport modes. </p> <p>  There are more than 70 actions set out in the transport chapter of CAP21, many of which fall within the policy remit of the Department of Transport and its agencies.  There are also actions across CAP21 that will support and facilitate the decarbonization of transport, particularly in terms of planning, energy, enterprise and taxation.</p><p>The national development plan ring-fences a significant level of Exchequer investment for transport, focusing in particular on public transport, active travel and electric vehicle, EV, infrastructure, that will be mobilised to support our carbon reductions targets.  The pathway here will be very challenging for the sector.  The Department will ensure that delivery is accelerated where possible in order to maximise the overall carbon reduction impacts in a manner that is timely, fair and equitable.</p><p> The climate action plan identifies a gap to target of 0.9 Mt CO2 eq in respect of anticipated growth in travel demand during the intervening period.  We are engaging in a review to refine measures to see what can be done to make up that gap in a fair and equitable manner over the course of the coming months.  This recognises that the decarbonisation of transport will impact in different ways on different cohorts of the population and sectors of the economy.  Optimising the wider economic and societal benefits as we move forward is critical.</p><p> The Department will continue to focus resources on cross-Government and cross-sectoral collaboration in modelling and research.  It is clear that the assumptions we make now on the pathways to the decarbonisation of transport may not hold and will need to evolve as technology and behaviours change over time.</p><p> As I said, my colleagues and I are more than happy to take any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paddy Mahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022011800002#H00200"><p>On behalf of the CCMA, I welcome the opportunity to appear before the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action and help inform its consideration of the carbon budgets.  I am joined by David Mellett from the, Atlantic Seaboard North CARO.</p> <p>  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act frames Ireland's legally binding climate ambition in delivering a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 51% by 2030.  More recently, the climate action plan has set specific objectives for the public sector, which includes local government, regarding energy efficiencies and emission reduction, that include: improving the energy efficiency from the 33% target in 2020 to 50% by 2030; delivering a 51% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 from local government operations; upgrading local authority housing stock to B2 or better; retrofitting national public lighting stock; reducing emissions from the local authority fleet and taking a leadership role in low-emission transport options; delivering a decarbonisation zone within its administrative area that will become the focus for a range of climate mitigation, adaptation and biodiversity measures; and preparing a local authority climate action plan at least once every five years, containing both mitigation and adaptation measures.</p> <p>  Under the system of carbon budgeting established by the Act, the Climate Change Advisory Council has proposed three five-year economy-wide carbon budgets, covering the periods 2021 to 2025, 2026 to 2030 and 2031 to 2035, to assist the State in achieving its national climate objectives and greenhouse gas emissions targets agreed by the European Union.  The CCMA recognises and agrees with the approach to: &ldquo;balance the urgency for era-defining change and practical feasibility while also providing a 51% reduction in the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions from 2018 by 2030.&rdquo;  These carbon budget proposals look to align with the specific objectives and targets set out for the local government sector in the climate action plan 2021.</p> <p>  We are not starting from a standing start.  By 2019, local authorities had saved 28% over the 2009 baseline, which is equivalent to 123,000 tonnes of avoided CO2 emissions.  Local authorities are building on these successes and working towards the new national 50% energy efficiency and 51% emission reduction targets for the sector.</p> <p>  We are committed to adhering to our carbon budgets through improvement works to our public lighting, offices, housing stock, leisure centres, infrastructure and transport fleet, and by prioritising green procurement, the circular economy and investing in decarbonisation projects.  We are also committed to providing appropriate climate action training, with the support of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to all our 29,000 employees and our 942 elected members.</p> <p>  Operationally, it is important to note that while local authorities are generally responsible for less than 5% of our administrative areas' emissions, we are well positioned in our communities with already established engagement in climate action to also take on a broader role of influencing and facilitating others to meet their targets.</p> <p>  Local authorities are committed to engage with and empower local communities and enterprises to embrace climate action by using existing and enhanced local authority structures, operations and networks.</p><p>The local authority climate action charter, which was signed by every one of the 31 local authorities in October 2019, confirms the sector's commitment to scale up efforts and to play a key leadership role locally and nationally in delivering effective climate action.  It is increasingly clear that responsibility for climate action extends across several Departments and organisations.  As a sector, however, local government can act as a conduit to lead a just transition locally in order to ensure a co-ordinated local response to climate change, bringing our communities, businesses and staff along with us.</p><p> Set against the backdrop of an evolving and increasing ambition of national climate policy in recent years, the local authority sector has developed Delivering Effective Climate Action 2030, a strategy for the sector to deliver on the commitments of the climate action charter and to maximise the 31 local authorities' collective impact on Ireland's national climate action targets.  In Delivering Effective Climate Action 2030, an overarching commitment on leadership is highlighted to ensure a coherent approach to climate action across the administrative and political structures of all 31 local authorities.  The sectoral vision identified in this strategy is to leverage the capability, reach and resources of local authorities to effectively lead and co-ordinate climate action across Ireland.  Our mission is to deliver transformative change and measurable climate action across our cities and counties and within our organisations through leadership, example and mobilising action at local level.</p><p> We have identified six key goals: to foster governance, leadership and partnerships for climate action; to achieve our carbon emissions and energy efficiency targets for 2030 and 2050; to deliver on climate adaptation and climate resilience; to mobilise climate action in local communities; to mobilise climate action in enterprise and to support the transition to a net-zero and circular economy; and to achieve a just transition.  Delivering Effective Climate Action 2030 has identified a number of additional resources required within the sector to deliver on our climate action ambitions and to work with our stakeholders to ensure that actions for emissions reductions, building climate resilience and behavioural change are designed to be inclusive and to make this a transition for all.</p><p> I thank the committee.  I am happy, along with my colleague, Mr. Mellett, to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>

That is all the opening statements, so I invite members to raise their hands to ask questions. I ask for agreement from members that we stick to the two-minute rule in asking questions because we have limited time, as members will know, just three hours, in the committee room.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

In many cases they will have to lean heavily against established practices.  They are taking on a really important national endeavour, and I wish them well.</p> <p>  My questions are directed to the two framework Departments, namely, the Departments of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Taoiseach.  First, has the fact that we now have legally binding targets changed the nature of the Departments' approach, which up to now has been best endeavour, and many would say poor endeavour?  Will there be sanctions, trade-offs, rations and big bets driven from the central Departments?</p> <p>  My second question is whether the Departments plan to have a central think tank to develop policy tools.  From where I am sitting, there do not seem to be proper policy tools for forestry, rewetting, methane management, SUV reduction or the retrofitting wave.  I could probably go on.  We do not even have education Departments investing to match housing developments in a timely manner.  Is there an approach beyond co-ordination and sitting at senior officials' group meetings to have a central brain that will drive the new policy tools?</p> <p>  Third, what are the criteria for weighing the essential trade-offs between the sectors?  We have seen in the past things like marginal abatement costs but, clearly, those leave out the social disruption that policies could carry.  How will that be done?  Is it a matter of horse-trading between the central Departments and the line Departments or is a metric being applied?</p> <p>  Finally, the issue of social consensus came up.  How do the Departments intend getting community buy-in and social consensus on both the change and the policy tools?  We already see a lot of resistance to policy tools such as carbon pricing, road pricing, planning acceleration, etc.</p></speech>

Those are questions for the Department of the Taoiseach and for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh may go first on behalf of the Department of the Taoiseach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor &Oacute; Raghallaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022011800002#K00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  We are building on a lot of the foundations he put in place during his time as Minister.  I have only been in this sphere for a few months but, having come back to it after having worked in climate policy a decade earlier, my own view is that there has been significant change with regard to the framework in which we are now operating.  The legislative scheme that has been put in place brings a degree of concrete reality to the situation.  There are now very concrete ceilings under the carbon budget process.  Sectoral emissions ceilings will follow.  For policymakers, Ministers and civil servants, this provides a definite set of parameters in which we and the sectors we are responsible for regulating will have to operate.  The thinking has changed.  We have to move from the "best endeavours" approach the Deputy mentioned to an approach based on set tonnes of emissions and sequestrations.  It is largely a zero-sum game in that we have to come in within the legally mandated budgetary ceilings.  That will involve many trade-offs.  We will have to decide where those trade-offs will take place and in what sectors is it most cost-efficient and socially acceptable to make these cuts in emissions.</p> <p>  I will pass over to Mr. Carroll to add to my response to the Deputy's other question as he may be over the detail a bit more than I am.  We have the benefit of being able to work with a number of models that try to plot the various scenarios with regards to emissions, but also abatements. There are marginal abatement cost curves such as the Deputy mentioned.  One was undertaken for the 2019 climate action plan.  It formed the backbone of that plan.  McKinsey did some work that fed into the updated plan in 2021.  There are also other models throughout the system which look at issues in respect of energy and agriculture.  They do not completely talk to one another, that is, they are not completely comparable.  As part of my remit, I chair a research and modelling group.  We are currently looking at all of those models and at the other layer of analysis that may need to be undertaken to join them up and layer them over one another in order to consider issues regarding the macroeconomic implications of the plan and the distributional effects the Deputy spoke about in respect of what the implications will be throughout-----</p></speech>

I will call on Mr. Carroll to answer those questions.  I ask witnesses to be as brief as possible in their answers because, although members are restricted to two minutes, they can still get quite a few questions in and those questions may be directed to quite a few witnesses.  We do not have a great amount of time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022011800002#K00400"><p>I will be brief.  Deputy Bruton's first question was on whether we have changed our approach now that we have legally binding targets.  While we now have legally binding targets for 2030 and 2050, by the time the spring comes these will have been refined further to provide legally binding economy-wide carbon budgets, which will be followed by sectoral emissions ceilings.  That implicitly changes the approach because, for the first time, it will place legal obligations on the Ministers responsible for specific sectors.</p><p>That leads on to the second question about whether we have a central think tank.  I will not repeat what Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh said about the modelling capacities and so on that we have in place but, given those new legal accountabilities, there will an onus on each of the line Departments to start bringing forward policies to ensure they remain within their sectoral ceilings.  There will be accountability to the committee and the Oireachtas in respect of that achievement.  There is then a role for the climate Minister under the legislation, who will have to build his or her capacity to comment on policy efforts, with the support of the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, Taoiseach and Finance, and other Departments, because there is now a legal requirement on the Minister to make recommendations, potentially, to other Ministers, if they are off course.</p><p> The first thing to be said about the criteria for waiting is that the 2019 plan, as we know, was based on a marginal abatement cost curve.  That was fully incorporated into the 2021 plan, but the step up in ambition was such that all the known and settled technologies we could identify, and the pace at which we could ramp them up, did not even get us the full way to the ambition.  We have had to identify further areas that will need to be explored very intensively over the coming years to ensure we realise the full ambition over the decade.  When we get the least-cost options and so on, other criteria will have to be brought to bear regarding social acceptability, fairness and practical issues around how quickly we can ramp up supply chains and get infrastructure delivered on the ground.</p><p> The final issue Deputy Bruton raised was on social consensus.  That will be very challenging.  The recent work by the EPA on measuring sentiment towards climate action indicated people believe climate change is taking place and want something to be done, but that is not actually translating into the actions or decisions that need to be taken necessarily being taken.  There is a challenge for policy design and for engaging and communicating with people.  Enduring structures for a national dialogue have been set out in the climate action plan 2021 with three elements - one is around local engagement and activation, where the local authorities will be very important, the second is a national convening a number of times a year, where key stakeholders feed in to policymaking and the third is around strategic communications, which will be led by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions.  The officials from the Department of Transport mentioned research in the context of the focus on achievability of targets.  As part of that research, are they looking at why, when cost is not a barrier to access to electric vehicles, EVs, there is not a greater uptake?  I noted the figures from last year.  Many people are still opting for SUVs, in particular, and other vehicles, when EVs would be an option.</p> <p>  We have heard significant criticism of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in recent days regarding the level of preparedness and the alternatives being provided for farming communities and farmers in respect of alternative, sustainable models.  Do the officials believe that criticism is fair?  Much of it is levelled at their Department.  What measures will they take to address that, if they do?  I noticed many caveats in their contribution.  What emissions reductions do they envisage for the agricultural sector in the term of the first carbon budget?</p><p>The CCAC was critical of what it saw as a lack of an overarching, whole-of-government approach to climate action.  How does the Department of the Taoiseach intend to address that and the significant implementation deficit?</p><p> Do the Departments of the Taoiseach and the Environment, Climate and Communications see an opportunity, in terms of increased participation, for the sustainable energy communities to have an improved and enhanced role and, as we heard from previous contributors, for the public participation networks to increase community-led climate action and bring about a understanding of and connection with these issues?  How do they intend to co-ordinate and deliver that, if they believe such an opportunity exists?</p></speech>

The cost of that switch remains a barrier, certainly in the consumer perception.  The big challenge here is to get beyond that in terms of the total cost of ownership piece.  In the next couple of months, we will look to establish the office of low-emitting vehicles which will address much of the consumer challenge with regard to that switch.  I will pass over to Dr. O'Grady, who will give a bit more detail on that.</p></speech>

I interpret the Deputy's question as being about research we might be conducting or work we are doing into the non-financial barriers to EV uptake.  As Mr &Oacute; Ciaru&aacute;in has said, there is still a cost differential.  I think the Deputy suggested in his comment that people are still buying very expensive vehicles, when clearly they could afford to purchase an EV if they chose to do so.  We are doing some research at the moment, which will inform our infrastructure strategy, on the perceptions of barriers to uptake for people who may be thinking about purchasing an EV.  That research will report shortly.  Our anticipation is that the perception of the need to charge and the reliability of EVs in terms of recharging distance might be an issue.</p> <p>  In the past six months since I took up my role in July 2021, the number of new vehicles that have come on the market has been astonishing.  All of them will do 400 km to 500 km on a single charge and in some cases they will do up to 500 km or 600 km.  What is happening now within the EV market is that many of those potentially higher-cost vehicles are becoming available as high-range EVs.  I anticipate that over the coming years we will see a further shift within the market when many of the more expensive internal combustion engine vehicles will come on to the market as EV options and people will start to purchase them.</p> <p>  What is also happening this year in terms of consumer engagement and advice, as Mr. &Oacute; Ciaru&aacute;in mentioned, is that we will establish the office for low-emitting vehicles.  Part of its function will be to provide a price comparison and an objective one-stop shop of information for people who are interested in purchasing a new car.  The provision of information on the differential between EV and non-EV, what one can get from an EV, the range one will be able to get and further information about the charging network we will deliver should tip that further in order that we see an increased EV uptake again.</p></speech>

What I am trying to articulate in the conversations is that this is around the whole issue of diversification.  If one looks at diversification, one will see that there are two different issues.  One is diversification of income and the other is diversification of land use.  From an income point of view, clearly Teagasc is mandated in terms of having an options programme, at which it is actively looking to see where the opportunity for added value is.  Focusing on that is a critical component of Food Vision 2030.  That is improving the return in terms of products we produce.</p> <p>  In terms of diversification committed in the climate action plan, similarly, a substantial increase is identified for organic farming within the plan, going from 2% to 7.5%.</p><p>There is a clear ambition articulated by the farming sector, as well as contributing to the energy sector.  That is clearly understood internally and it is sought by both industry and agriculture.  Agriculture is seeking opportunities to contribute under that.<br/><br/>On land use, there are areas such as afforestation.  Colleagues can comment on that but the opportunities for forestry use or land, including for anaerobic digestion, will all have to get focus as we progress through the decade.<br/><br/>On splitting, I do not have absolute figures on the split between the first and second.  What we highlighted in the opening statement is that when one looks at methane as a clear element of the package of agricultural emissions, it is a fairly challenging one in that we will be looking new technology and the improvement of reading.  The EU methane strategy identifies three pillar areas around feeding, breeding and anaerobic digestion.  We are developing and investigating all of those.  There is a challenge in getting those translated right through into inventory in the early part.  However, we are focusing strongly on nitrous oxide, which will be in the early budgetary period, as something that can be changed.  This will be done by reducing fertiliser usage, changing fertiliser type etc.  Those will all contribute to that.  If we were to take a <i>pro rata</i>expectation, in terms of delivery on what is the proposed CCAC budget, we would have to be delivering something close to 2 megatonnes - something in that sort of range - in the first budgetary period to contribute to the overall economy-wide commitment of 51%.</p></speech>

On foot of the 2019 plan, we engaged immediately with the sectors on what were the actions we needed to take to try to build the momentum.  In agriculture, because we deal with 135,000 farmers, clearly we have to move early with respect to implementation because there is always going to be early adoption by some and slower adoption by others.  When we are dealing with a broad population like that we need to ensure everybody comes along with us but it will be at different levels and speeds.</p></speech>

We have a very active Cabinet subcommittee on the climate that met, I think, eight times in 2021 and a senior officials group meeting under that.  That is all trying to give such a coherent overarching approach to climate action.  The extent of the challenge has been brought together in the climate action plans that are going to be further developed over this year and will need to reflect the sectoral emissions ceilings and the overall economy-wide carbon budget that is put in place.  Deputy Bruton alluded to it but this is a huge challenge for the system and for Departments and the public sector generally, as well as broader society.  There are going to be issues and there are going to be things we need to explore further.  In the climate action plan for this year, we have a number of actions trying to look at impediments to delivery around the system and looking at capacity constraints in various Departments and the broader public sector.  All that work will feed into a closer a co-ordination of effort by Government but the structures are in place to provide that.</p></speech>

There is a centralised need to co-ordinate that communications and engagement piece.  Most of the work on this has been done elsewhere in the system.  Mr. Carroll might be better placed to reflect on that.</p></speech>

There is a very important role for them to play in terms of that engagement and activation at local level.  As I mentioned earlier, we have three pillars to the approach.  The local one, PPNs working through the local authorities and harnessing those existing structures like sustainable communities, will be central to that.  The focus there is not just about engaging people and talking about climate, which is obviously very important to do, but that it quickly leads to action at local level and the types of changes that need to happen very quickly starting to happen.  Yes, we see a role for PPNs and sustainable communities.</p></speech>

In addition, we would like to draw attention to the peatlands community engagement scheme, which is supported by the Department, and the Community Foundation for Ireland, which funds biodiversity links between ecologists and local communities.</p> <p>  If the chief executive of Longford County Council, Mr. Mahon, was available to come in, maybe he could speak about the county development plan review process and the inputs from PPNs and others on that.  I will also call on my colleague, Ms Nally, to speak a bit more about the community engagement scheme for peatlands, which is in place.</p></speech>

The PPNs are very important.  They reach into all the communities across the country through the local authority networks, and it has proved to the Department to be very beneficial in terms of the conversation leading into the climate action Bill and the climate action plan and the Act.</p> <p>  In the area of the reviewing of county development plans, we are all at various stages in the review and updating of our county development plans.  Climate action very much governs the determination of the new county and city development plans that are either in place or being put in place by us in Longford and our colleagues throughout the country.  Climate action is becoming an overarching element of how we plan for our future.  Where I am, in the midlands, the impact of climate action on the closure of the power stations in Longford and Offaly has a fundamental impact right now on how we plan for our future.  As I mentioned earlier, one of our key objectives as a sector is the area of just transition.  We are experiencing the full impact of what is a just transition and the territorial plan that is being consulted on at present in the midlands as we speak.</p></speech>

The National Parks and Wildlife Service strongly encourages locally led and community-led conservation efforts.</p><p>It has done so through the variety of projects and schemes it operates.  The peatlands community engagement scheme, one such scheme, was launched recently by the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  It intends to encourage local communities to restore, revitalise, conserve or put in place local amenities or undertake feasibility studies, a range of ecological reviews or any projects that would contribute to positive action for peatlands, as such.  That is in addition to other programmes the National Parks and Wildlife Service supports, such as the Community Foundation for Ireland, to which Mr. Lemass referred.  We also provide funding for a network officer for the all-island climate and biodiversity research network.  We also provide funding directly to local authorities for biodiversity action.  There are a range of supports and initiatives already in place to support community-led conservation and actions that contribute to national conservation plans and the national climate action plan.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh and it relates to the annual review of the climate action committee.  That review mentions that the national climate action delivery board, the role of which is to hold Departments and public bodies accountable for the delivery of their actions, did not meet at all in 2020, despite a commitment to meet quarterly.  Is that board still in existence?  Did it meet in 2021?  Is it the intention that the board will continue to meet to hold entities to account for the climate action commitments made under the 2021 plan?</p> <p>  I will address my next question, which is about local government, to Mr. Dunne.  I was a councillor in Wicklow County Council for a number of years.  One of the issues councils encounter is a lack of funding when it comes to meeting the national commitments that have been set for them.  That is the case, for example, for electric vehicle, EV, infrastructure.  Councils only receive 75% of the funding necessary to install EV charging points.  The implementation and delivery of those by local government has been very poor in recent years.  Funding could have played a part in that.  Are local authorities receiving sufficient funding to enable them to meet their many commitments, including new commitments that are being set down for them under the current plans?</p> <p>  My final set of questions, which relate to housing, is for Mr. Lemass.  Today's residential building report specified that more than 90,000 houses are vacant at the moment.  It is clear the most sustainable building is an existing building.  Refurbishment involves the equivalent of 15 tonnes of carbon compared with 50 tonnes of carbon for a new building.  Does the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage have a target number of vacant premises it would like to see refurbished?  What are the mechanisms to do that?</p> <p>  There was a target to retrofit 2,400 social homes that were due for upgrade in 2021.  When I asked the question in November, only 199 properties had been retrofitted.  Does the Department have an update on that figure for 2021?  What were the barriers to getting those properties retrofitted and how will they be resolved, going forward?</p></speech>

The climate action delivery board has met on four occasions altogether.  Three of those meetings occurred in 2019.  It was due to meet again in March 2020 when Covid-19 struck.  My understanding is the Covid situation prevented the board from meeting for some time.  It did meet again towards the end of 2021 on the back of the updated climate action plan for 2021.  The board is likely to meet in the coming weeks and it is envisaged it will meet quarterly, as per the commitment in the climate action plan.</p></speech>

I think it was about 77%.  This means actions that were delivered in the intended timeframe.   It does not mean the actions were not undertaken.  They could have been brought forward to the next period.  Our reporting structures allow for that.  If a target is missed, it moves into the following quarter.  There have been difficulties and the delivery rates have been sporadic in terms of the results.  They dropped a little bit throughout 2021.  There are a few reasons for that.  Part of the issue has been that the officials involved in climate action policy around the system were quite engaged on the Bill which came through in the first half of 2021, and then on the review of the climate action plan.  There were interim climate actions in place for 2021.  I think there has been a bandwidth issue in terms of the same officials being responsible for planning as well as implementation.  That is one of the capacity issues we are going to have to face on this.</p></speech>

In the roll-out of electric vehicle charging points, there is definitely a gap between the grants that are currently available and the cost of putting in chargers.  Most city and county councils will have put in chargers in their towns and public areas but there is a significant gap.  The grant available is up to &euro;5,000.  Our costs, just based on a survey we did as a sector last year, are anything up to &euro;15,000 or &euro;16,000 for the low-range charging points.  There is a challenge there, no doubt.  However, as local authorities we are committed to showing the way and putting in chargers where feasible and where we can afford it.  There is a significant role for the energy companies and others in this space to meet the expected demand.</p> <p>  The sector has embarked on a major public lighting retrofit across the whole country.  That is fundamentally funded by the sector with support from Europe under the ELENA funding stream.  It is a significant challenge for the sector but we have embarked on that process and the first contracts were signed just before Christmas for the southern region.  Retrofitting of our housing stock is funded from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Local authorities are beginning to upgrade and decarbonise our fleet.  That is generally funded by ourselves.  We need our fleet to do what we do.  We need to fund it appropriately.  There is no doubt that there are and will be significant challenges as we invest in decarbonisation projects in the future.  It is not a one-size-fits-all process.  Definitely in the area of electric vehicle charging there is a challenge at present.</p></speech>

We have undertaken to review that scheme in consultation with local authorities this year.  When we launch the infrastructure strategy later in this quarter, the plan is that it would be very shortly followed by a couple of funding streams to help with delivery of the strategy, one of which would be a revised public points scheme.  We are aware that the cost of the works connected with putting in the chargers and the capital works connected to that can go well above the cost of installing and running a charger.</p><p>Finding funds to cover that is where, we understand, the local authorities have had difficulty.</p></speech>

Among them, we will launch this year a Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund to support individuals who want to refurbish vacant properties in towns.  That will be complemented by better homes energy grants from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  There is also a statement in Housing for All that we will buy, through compulsorily purchase orders, CPOs, via local authorities, 2,500 vacant properties.</p> <p>  In addition, we will launch the town centre first policy shortly.  It will complement the vacancy in this area.  It will also pick up on urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, and rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, moneys where we will be drawing up specific criteria to address vacancy as part of future funding proposals under both of those funds.</p> <p>  On the actual number of retrofits, the target was 2,400 in 2021.  We achieved 1,730 at the end of the year.  Frankly, the biggest barrier was Covid, which restricted our ability to go into people's houses.  Mr. Mahon might want to contribute on the reaction on the ground when retrofitting has been done in the midlands.  The midlands has not hit the numbers it would have hoped to for those practical reasons, but I understand that the response has been extremely positive.</p> <p>  I will refer to a few other points.  We are in the process of reforming the fair deal scheme, which means that a person will be able to sell a property which might currently be lying vacant without any additional penalty.  There are proposals from the Department of Health to reform it further in order that a property can be made available for rental while the applicant is in a fair deal nursing home.  We are supporting vacant homes officers in local authorities with a fund of &euro;50,000 per authority.  We have also called out the need for a Government portfolio of properties to be examined in order that any vacant properties in a town can be made available and put on the market.  Those are the measures we are taking.</p></speech>

What we found from the CSO analysis of vacancy that was taken at a particular point was that when local authorities followed through and examined individual streets where vacancy was alleged to have been an issue, the actual levels of vacancy were not as high as were signalled in the CSO report.  We are trying to build a bottom-up approach to this.  We do not have a target for the 90,000 homes.</p></speech>

I am not sure if these are included in Mr. Lemass' numbers, but there are approximately 750 houses in the pilot programme in this regard.  A number of those are complete, a significant number are on site and approximately 300 are at tender stage.</p> <p>  The feedback we are getting from residents in the houses that are complete has been generally very positive.  The shift from traditional fuels to the retrofit-type energy solutions to our social housing stock anecdotally has been surprisingly positive.  We anticipated, particularly in my county of Longford, a degree of reluctance or, indeed, opposition to the changeover.  Thankfully, the response has been generally positive thus far.</p></speech>

I want to ask a number of questions, first of all, of the Department of Transport.  Would the officials agree that the public service obligation, PSO, levy in this country compares poorly to those in other European states?</p><p>It is a key mechanism for reducing fares and moving towards more frequent and cheaper public transport, which would attract people away from private cars.  However, the only concrete figure in the climate action plan seems to be of a further 1,500 low-emission buses as against 1 million EVs.  This does not inspire confidence in the ability to increase our public transport journeys.  The estimate is quite low, that is, a 2.9% increase in public transport journeys by 2042.  I would have viewed this as very unambitious for one of the key sectors that must see a reduction in emissions.  In terms of the amount of money being ploughed into State subsidies for EVs versus subsidies for public transport, we would be far better off investing more in public transport, which is more sustainable than the purchasing of EVs, the production of which can be bad for the environment.</p><p> I wish to ask a question of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  There is a target to upgrade 36,500 local authority houses, with 2,400 to be done this year.  A spokesperson has said that the greatest barrier to doing the work to date has been Covid.  If we come out of Covid, do the officials believe that we will reach the target?  Given that the average cost per house is between &euro;56,000 and &euro;75,000 and that a small number of workers are available, is it achievable?  The State's commitment is very small.</p><p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's submission is littered with the word "sustainability", yet it clearly says that the Department refuses to even countenance cutting the national herd or dealing with the question of the growth in the number of animals.  Instead, the Department says that the growth will continue and it will rely on future as-yet-unproven technologies to deal with agricultural emissions.  The officials will see from the ongoing concerns of and protests by ordinary farmers that those farmers feel they are being put upon and have to pick up the tab for the big agricultural production companies.  Will the officials comment on this point, please?</p></speech>

The Deputy's specific question related to the PSO levy.  It is under review constantly.  One of the key issues there has to do with some of the proposals in the climate action plan, which will be supplemented through the sustainable mobility policy that will be forthcoming in the next couple of months.  The policy will set out the framework for delivering much greater investment, including infrastructural investment across public transport and active travel.  It involves more than just the conversion of the fleet to low-emission vehicles.  There is a much wider strategy around the big projects, for example, BusConnects, and delivering a more reliable and attractive service from within the PSO provision.  The latter will require investment on the service side.  As such, both capital and current expenditure will make those projects deliver the level of modal shift that we are seeking.</p> <p>  The Deputy referenced a figure of 2.9% in respect of 2042.  That is probably the greater Dublin area, GDA, strategy.  The climate action plan sets out a significant modal shift through BusConnects and a number of other projects of 500,000 daily public transport and active travel journeys by 2030.  This represents a 12% move away from fossil fuel cars to public transport journeys and active travel.</p></speech>

In terms of delivering the level of modal shift we are requiring here, we will be looking at both the capital investment side and the PSO subvention.  It has to be made attractive in terms of the fares etc.  That all has to be looked at in the coming years.  That is on the table or will be a consideration in respect of all of this.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to the 2,400 units.  That was actually the target for 2021 but it was impacted by Covid.  We ended up doing 1,730 but I am confident we would have done the 2,400, were it not for the Covid restrictions.  That backlog will be made up in 2022.  I know from local authorities that although works were not always progressing as we would have liked, background work such as putting tenders in place has advanced quite a lot.  Many tenders are in place to enable work to now commence.  The Deputy referenced a cost of between &euro;65,000 and &euro;70,000 per house.  Our evidence suggests the range is approximately &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 per house and the funding is provided at a level of &euro;33,000 per house.  The cost varies from one house to another.  That is the nature of retrofit.</p></speech>

On the issue of sustainability and our submission being littered with that word, it is very much at the centre of the agriculture sector going forward.  That is recognised in the Food Vision 2030 report.  However, it is sustainability in its three manifest elements, that is, environmental, economic and socially sustainable production models, that is very much clearly at the centre.</p> <p>  As regards an increase in the national herd, that has not been policy for several yeas in the context of potential for growth.  Indeed, action 2 on page 57 of the Food Vision 2030 report requires us to produce detailed plans by quarter 2 of 2022 to manage the sustainable environmental footprint of the dairy and beef sectors.  That includes reducing total methane, nitrous oxide and ammonia emissions.  It is not policy in the context of growth and has not been for several years.  The focus in Food Vision 2030 is on value over growth in numbers.  Even in the context of the 2019 action plan, we were the first sector to come out with a roadmap of actions for farmers to do because it is very important that people understand how we implement the ambition.  At that time, we identified that methane levels could not grow if we were to achieve the overall commitments made under the 2019 plan.</p></speech>

As the national herd increased in the five years from 2015 to 2020 by something like 20%, when did it become policy not to encourage growth of the national herd, or even to curtail or stop such growth?  When did that happen?  Where was that in the strategy?</p></speech>

There was a situation post the removal of dairy quotas in 2014 whereby there was an increase, given that the sector had been constrained for approximately 30 years.  I do not have exact figures but it was in approximately 2017 or 2018 that the herd number stabilised in terms of the total number of animals in the country in the past couple of years.  Food Vision 2030 is the current strategy.  We update every five years.  Food Vision 2030 in particular identified at that time that the issue was around the development of value added.  It was in 2017 or 2018 that the total number of livestock in the country stabilised.  There undeniably been continued growth in dairying but there has been reduction in other areas of the livestock sector.</p></speech>

Could the officials comment on the concerns that the budgets, as proposed, do not seem to align with the 7% per annum commitment to the programme of Government?  We have been told that it would be a budget of 468 Mt for 7% per annum, whereas the proposed budgets are at 495 Mt, so an additional 27 Mt might be required.</p> <p>  I will put those questions to the Department of the Taoiseach, and of course the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications can answer this as well.  I welcome the identification that this is ultimately about tonnes.  It is a very hard and real measure.  The witness mentioned risk analysis.  Something we heard a lot about was the precautionary principle.  What risk analysis has been done on the dangers of backloading, in terms of both variables?  Scientifically, we know that there are risks, but, if targets are not met early, there are financial risks as well.  We have access to finance now.  Within the Department of the Taoiseach, is there the understanding that we have more flexibility in terms of access to finance at the moment than compared to the carbon budgets?  Again, the risk context, what emergency measures are being considered in terms of the next 18 months to three years, if it looks like we are not on track?  It is clear there is no scope for going any lower than the top of the sectoral targets.  In fact, it seems that it would be prudent to have "reach targets" in each sector.  Could Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh comment on that?   We almost have to aim higher so we do not fall lower.  </p> <p>  I have a question for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on emergency measures.  Forestry will only come in after 2030.  Could Mr. Callanan comment on measures such as limiting artificial insemination in the short term?  We know that the scientific measures are unproven and will only conflict.  </p> <p>  Similarly, on housing, why are we looking at only retrofitting 40% by 2030 and not 80%?  I know it cannot happen immediately, but certainly it would seem that by 2025 we should have that capacity.  Lastly, on demolition, reference was made to putting embodied energy into new building.  Would we look to a temporary stay or a higher bar for demolition, given that it also front-loads emissions in the period where we are most vulnerable, which is the next five years?</p></speech>

The Minister is awaiting input from the committee once its deliberations are complete and is also consulting with other Ministers and the public.  We will be in a better position to comment on numbers once that analysis is complete and we have received all of the input.  All I can say is the overarching objective as set out in the legislation is 51% by 2030 and an average of 7% per annum over the decade, which is based on all emissions - land and non-land - from 2018.  I am very happy to revert to the Senator with a written note, if helpful, and to receive any calculations the Senator might have as input into that analysis.</p></speech>

The financial analysis underpinning all these things was, to some extent, undertaken in the modelling and research that was done to feed into the 2021 climate action plan.  We are now looking at the increased ambition that has been put in place through the Act and there is a requirement on the system now to look much more closely at the financial and economic implications of all this.  Risk analysis is something at which we are looking quite closely at the moment.  When looking at the climate action plan, we need to look at whether the measures that are set out in the plan are achieving what they said they would.  The Senator alluded to the risk analysis of back-loading issues.  In a way, we will be waiting to see what the Oireachtas recommends in that regard and what the ultimate budgets will be.  There will be an annual economy-wide reduction requirement.  The scheme envisaged allows for flexibility for overshoots and undershoots, and savings between budget periods, so that is a possibility.  It is work that we need to do more of and it is something we will take forward through the research and modelling group.  It is something in which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Department of Finance are particularly interested.  It is an ongoing piece of work that we will be undertaking in the coming year in advance of the 2022 climate action plan.</p></speech>

We are charged with monitoring its implementation and this committee will also have a role in that if it looks like the measures set down in the various climate action plans, as well as sectoral measures, are failing to deliver the types of emissions reductions that are required.  That is within the scheme that the Oireachtas has agreed.  Within the various Departments and sectors we will try to pre-empt any of that and start work on it but at the moment we are not planning for emergency measures or the action plans not to be delivered.  That is our position at the moment.</p></speech>

Methane is clearly one of the big issues for agriculture and is a big proportion of our overall profile.  The EU methane strategy for agriculture identifies three opportunities: feeding, including feed additives; breeding strategies; and anaerobic digestion.  Within breeding, what are we trying to do is, basically, breed an animal that has greater longevity and better delivery of economic traits such as milk production, milk solids, etc.  The evidence is irrefutable that there is quite a substantial difference between animals of superior breeding versus those of lower breeding when it comes to environmental efficiency.  To put some numbers on that, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation has the largest data processor in Ireland and brings together all the data points relating to animals' performance and translates that into an economic breeding index that is understandable for farmers.  That is on the dairy side and on the beef side with the use of stars.  How does one make that simple?</p><p>There is a &euro;50 identified difference between high and low breeding values, which translates into approximately &euro;100 of economic benefit.  In simple terms, a better bred animal is generally a smaller cow.  It has greater longevity, which is about living longer with very good production profile.  AI is the greatest opportunity for success in this area.</p></speech>

So many of the plans in agriculture deliver longer-term results, but for the next five years, what measures will be important?  We might need to stop doing certain things.

The big focus, particularly in the early stages, is around nitrous oxide in terms of reducing the dependence on nitrogen in the system artificially and also reducing crude protein in the animal feed diet, which is another source of nitrogen.  We have set out objectives in terms of reducing nitrogen usage overall by 20%.  It may have to be reduced further.  It is important we do not replace nitrogen with feed imported from abroad.  That is critical.  It is about working with farmers in terms of education and about the technologies being rolled out.  By way of example, clover, multi-species swards, are less dependent on artificial nitrogen than on prairie and rye grass.  We have seen a significant growth in terms of the opportunity and the development of those technologies.  Simply put, the Minister announced a scheme in the budget under which support will be provided for the introduction of multi-species grassland, which we will be rolling out this year.  </p> <p>  The big focus, in particular in the early stage, has to be around reducing nitrous oxide associated with fertiliser, but doing so in a way that does not really result in unintended consequences.  Internationally, particularly within the EU, a huge amount of dairy and beef is now indoors.  It is not a system we want to see in Ireland.  A pastoral-based, rain-fed, grass-based diet is environmentally much more acceptable.</p></speech>

We have the economy-wide budgets.  They will flow through the Oireachtas and through Government in terms of developing into sectoral targets.  There is a requirement for an annual revision in terms of the climate action plan.  That will, by necessity, require us to continually review and assess our overall performance.  Similarly, the food vision structure, which is the strategy drawn up by stakeholders under the chairmanship of Tom Arnold, flows back to a high level implementation committee, which is chaired by the Minister and will meet six times per annum.  In terms of openness and transparency, we have set up an environmental sustainability committee to report on our overall performance and on whether we are on track in terms of the objectives set out in regard to climate, biodiversity and water.  We are very much committed to reporting regularly in terms of our overall performance in the agriculture sector and, by necessity, that will lead to a continuous review of achievement of the commitments.  </p> <p>  As I said, on foot of the 2019 plan, the sector was very much to the fore in terms of developing a roadmap.  It was one of the first sectors to do so.  We have had significant engagement within industry in terms of these objectives.  Sustainability was mentioned.  It is driven not just be regulatory compliance, but also by market demand.  The market is expecting that we can back up our ambitions environmentally with clear, undeniable evidence that we are on that trajectory.</p></speech>

I ask the witness from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to respond to the remaining two questions.  The first question was around the retrofitting target being set at 42% and not 80%.  The second was in regard to regulations around demolition and embodied energy.</p></speech>

As that proportion has been front-loaded, the overall proportion of retrofitting is greater in social housing than in the broader housing stable in the early years.  We are something of a pathfinder and a capacity development enabler by virtue of taking on a greater proportion in the early years.  Between 2013 and now there have been 73,000 shallow retrofits completed at a cost of &euro;161 million.  It is not that the remainder of the stock has been untouched.  There is the potential to do further work post 2030, but the target to 2030 is 36,500.  Incidentally, that is based on 100% Exchequer funding. <br/><br/>On the question of a temporary stay on demolition, we are looking through the national planning framework and in Housing for All to achieve compact urban growth.  That requires us to work with brownfield and infill sites and that, in turn, requires demolition from time to time.  In Housing for All, housing policy objective 23, namely, &quot;Drive economic sustainability and reduce Construction Costs&quot;, relates specifically to construction and demolition waste reduction and the change in the designation for end of waste, which speaks to the circular economy and the reuse and segregation of demolition waste so it is no longer waste for landfill but is reused as part of the construction process.  That is the direction of travel we are working in.  </p></speech>

It is fair to say the 255 pages of the annex of actions will define whether we and the Government are successful or not.  Those actions come down to the witnesses and their Departments.  No pressure but we are relying on them to get it right.</p> <p>  I have a couple of specifics for two of the Departments.  The first is in relation to Mr. Callanan's Department.  How many farms fall under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP?  Is it fair to say some of the higher income and more intensive farming may not be involved in CAP?  We are reliant on CAP to be greener and fairer next time around and this could drive some of the change but how does the Department aim to drive change in other farms?  It is quite a specific number there.  Also, how many of the farms use nitrogen fertiliser at present?</p> <p>  Second, for Mr. Lemass's Department, there are independent bodies that define many of the actions around the country.  I am thinking in particular of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Mr. Lemass's Department appoints the board but the body is independent.  Is the board looking at the 51% currently and applying that in its decisions?  </p> <p>  County and city development plans cover every inch of this country and what happens in those plans will decide what kind of planning occurs, where our roads and cycle lanes are and how much parking goes into our cities.  Those decisions all fall under those development plans.  They are being looked at, proposed by executives like Mr. Mahon and specific elements are being voted on by councillors.  I think of a case in Galway where all councillors bar one voted against moving the setback distance at a council area in Galway further from the sea.  That is not mitigation but it still applies when we think of all the actions now being made and decided.</p></speech>

This may allude, in particular, to whether certain regulations apply to a farmer who is not applying under the Common Agricultural Policy.  That would be something like the nitrates regulation, for example.  I want to be clear with everybody.</p><p> A measure like the nitrates regulations is national legislation.  It is policed generally through compliance with the Common Agricultural Policy and local authority inspections.  All farmers, however, are subject to it irrespective of whether they apply under the Common Agricultural Policy.  The nitrates action programme is the principle control mechanism for the use of nitrogens etc. and sets limits, storage requirements and the stock carrying capacity on land.</p><p> I do not have a figure for how many farmers work outside the Common Agricultural Policy but I would suggest that it is quite small.  In terms of the suggestion that there are large farmers who have deliberately avoided the requirements of the Common Agricultural Policy and the additional conditionality that accompanies, I think that there is a handful at most.  I have heard of one case but I want to make clear that they are still subject to the rules and regulations of the nitrates action programme.</p></speech>

It is about all of the measures that may now be set down in the Common Agricultural Policy that may help to move farmers to a different type of farming, other than regulating them.  That is the challenge the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will face.</p></speech>

A certain number of farmers are very small.  I think there is only a handful of very large farmers who may be avoiding a situation of applying for the Common Agricultural Policy.  In general, the vast majority of all farmers are applicants under the Common Agricultural Policy.</p> <p>  As for how many farmers use nitrogen, there is quite a different spread across the farming population of those using it.  Approximately half of the fertilisers used in the country are used by dairy farmers.  Tillage farmers also use it.  The spread then across beef is quite varied in terms of their dependence on nitrogen fertilisers.  Under the organic requirements, just around 2% of the land area is organic so they are certified as not using it.  We also have significant areas of what is called high nature value, HNV, land, which is identified as approximately 1 million ha and that includes the likes of a lot of commonage, Natura land, etc.  That would receive either no or very little fertiliser in the main in terms of overall usage.  I do not have absolute figures.</p> <p>  The way that we track overall operations at farm level is through the national farm survey, which is operated and implemented by Teagasc.  We report the metrics associated with that survey to the European Farm Accountancy Data Network, FADN, which gives an oversight on the available storage on farms and income from different farm types.  As it is structured to cover quite a wide variety, we can get the results for the Senator.  The initiative has been expanded to look at issues, including biodiversity, or it is expanding in that way to get metrics on biodiversity at individual farm level as well, and how we can report and improve on that. </p></speech>

I will bring in colleagues from the planning side in a moment but first I will signal that the main instrument we use to regulate emissions from buildings is the energy performance of buildings directive.  The directive has been transposed into Irish law and it is a feature of building standards in Ireland.  As the enforcement authority for buildings standards is a local authority, each local authority is responsible for buildings standards in its area.</p></speech>

I am talking about roads, cycle lanes and where we build houses.  One example is whether we have town centres first or one-off housing.</p><p>What obligation is there on An Bord Plean&aacute;la and indeed on local authorities to ensure that county development plans and decisions are hitting that 51%?  That seems to me a determining factor as to whether or not we hit our targets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.133" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alma Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022011800002#Z00200"><p>I might deal with the policy in regard to the local authorities in the first instance.  Statutory land use plans prepared by a local authority are not prepared in a vacuum.  There is a hierarchy of policy from the national planning frameworks through to the regional spatial and economic strategies that inform each of our county and city development plans.  Then there is a wider policy influence and consistency that is sought through the legislation.  In other words, policies included within development plans and local area plans are required to be consistent with national policy and objectives, so there is already a decided or a settled policy piece at a national and regional level ahead of a development plan review being undertaken.  Separate to that, as part of the process there is an opportunity for Departments and other agencies to engage with a plan-making review process.  Many of our Departments are designated as prescribed bodies as part of that and would therefore be notified at pre-draft, draft and material amendment stage of any plan process.  The opportunity is there to input and provide observations and submissions on policies as they are developed by the local authority.  There is a good level of engagement and an established process where these issues do not necessarily always come to the end of the process on adoption of the plan.</p> <p>  The second point is that on completion of a plan review, the Office of the Planning Regulator has the role of evaluating and assessing that particular development plan and has the duty and the power to make a recommendation to the Minister to issue a section 31 direction.  There are structures in place that track and follow policies and objectives included in development plans to ensure that they are consistent.  That is well established, but ultimately it is the elected Members who make the decision in a council chamber in regard to the plan, as they are entitled to do and for which the legislation allows.  Where the process kicks in after that is the role of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  </p> <p>  In regard to the question on An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the appeals board in the planning system, it is obliged to have regard to the policies, guidelines and objectives set out at a national and regional level, and also the development plan that is in force.  Its point of reference in examining any planning appeal that comes before it will be the established and agreed policy that is already in force, and to track that and ensure it is implemented at development application stage.</p></speech>

Can I query it further?  Under the Act, State bodies have to act in a way consistent with the 51% objective.  I wonder how that is cross checked.  As Senator O'Reilly pointed out, with the development plans and other strategy and statutory documents that local authorities and other State agencies would adopt, what is the checking mechanism to ensure they are aligned with the 51% as per their legal obligation?  Is it the OPR in the case of the development plans?</p></speech>

The 51% is an important consideration at pre-draft, draft and material amendment stage in a plan and one imagines would be picked up on and accounted for.  What we see, as many of the development plans are being reviewed throughout the country, is the reliance on data and the importance of the evidence base to support any of the policies that are included in the plan-making system.  We are seeing a new wave of development plans that are climate conscious, and climate proofing on that front.</p><p>I cannot speak to the other non-statutory pieces that sit outside of the planning process but there is a very strong, established way.  I believe the climate action plan and the legislative frameworks that are in place will give rise to, if we like, a new wave of stronger, more robust and climate-proofed development plans.  The system is in transition at the moment, and it is important to say that.  We are four years post the publication of the national planning framework.  In moving towards a more compact growth approach, particularly in our towns and villages, some of which are derelict and require levels of regeneration, we are on a pathway to bring a transition piece on that front, and climate is very important in that regard.</p><p> I hope I have answered the question.  If there is anything supplementary I can add, I will do that.</p></speech>

I am not saying it is Ms Walsh's fault but I would urge a review of the development plans that are under way at the moment because they last for five years, as she knows, and I know there are holes in those.  I have concerns and I hope the Department will take them on board.  I look forward to any of the responses that I did not get coming through.  While I do not mean to be abrupt, time is limited.

It is probably opportune to advise that the section 28 development plan guidelines which are due to be published shortly provide guidance to all of our 31 local authorities in regard to preparing their own development plans.  They are currently being finalised with a view to publication so there is certainly an opportunity there to build in or strengthen, where we need to, on this particular front.  While they have been drafted with regard to the climate agenda in order to increase that and to bring that to bear on development plan policy, there certainly is an opportunity on foot of CAP being published to further bring that to the fore.  We will certainly take that on board and build that into the finalised set of guidelines.</p></speech>

I might put the same question to the Department of Transport.  I was reading the draft greater Dublin area, GDA, strategy last week and I put in a submission before the consultation closed last Monday.  In that, it is said that emissions in the GDA under the draft strategy would reduce by 37% by 2042.  The GDA is responsible for about one quarter of all of our transport emissions so if we are only aiming for 37% in a period that is twice as long as the timeframe that the first two carbon budgets take us to, are we missing a trick?  Are these documents at all aligned with the 51% objective?</p></speech>

As the NTA strategy is drafted, it states that full implementation of all the measures would be delivered by 2042 with a 69% reduction in emissions.  They set that out quite clearly in the draft strategy.  Obviously, it is still a consultation piece and they will be reviewing any considerations that have come in as part of that.  In terms of delivery to 2030, they have acknowledged there is a gap of 0.4 megatonnes to deliver the full 51% by 2030.  That is down to issues in regard to demand management and how a demand management scheme that they propose to put in place over the next year to 18 months would deliver that gap to target up to 2030 in terms of the 51%.</p></speech>

We made that point clear, and the NTA is working towards it.  It was clear from the outset that the ambition in this regard was to deliver 51% by 2030, but the NTA has acknowledged there are issues with the delivery of the last 0.4 Mt CO2 eq in the context of demand management measures that must be elaborated, socialised and mapped out clearly.  Therefore, the material comes to the Minister, there is internal checking and then it is opened for wider submissions and public consultation.  That is the checking mechanism.</p></speech>

I call Senator Boylan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022011800002#BB00600"><p>I thank our guests.  Going straight to my questions, and starting with the witnesses from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the annual transition statement is 13 months overdue.  Is there any indication of when we are going to see it?  In addition, section 17 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 refers to "relevant bodies" and how they "perform ... [their] functions in a manner consistent with" the climate action plan and the long-term strategy.  Does the Department have a definitive list of the relevant bodies?  Commercial semi-State bodies, such as Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte, will play a significant role in enabling us to achieve our climate targets.  Those organisations, however, are not covered under the definition of "relevant body" in the context of the Freedom of Information Act 2014.  In that regard, then, does the Department have a list of relevant bodies?  If it does, will it share the list with the committee?  In addition, when will the provisions of section 17 commence and how does the Department anticipate that the relevant bodies will implement those provisions?</p> <p>  My next question is for the witnesses from the Department of Transport.  We have heard several times at this committee that, even with the incentives that exist to encourage the purchasing of electric vehicles, there is still a preference among people who have the money to buy SUVs.  In France, a tax has now been implemented regarding the weight of a car.  Once it exceeds 1,800 kg, a &euro;10 levy is applied on each additional kg.  Is that something the Department would consider in the context of disincentivising the purchase of SUVs and steering people towards buying electric vehicles instead?</p> <p>  My final question is posed to the witnesses from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  The opening statement referred to exploring the potential to reduce methane emissions using feed additives in pasture-based livestock farming.  Does the requisite technology exist?  I ask because my understanding is that providing feed means moving away from pasture-based livestock and towards feedlot-type farming.  One risk in that context from an agricultural perspective in Ireland, therefore, concerns whether the required technology exists in this regard.  If it does, how far are we away from it being applied?  Is there a real risk we will move to feedlot-type farming to make use of feed additives?</p></speech>

It is the final statement due under the 2015 Act.  It will not be a requirement in future under the new legislation, because new accountability requirements are set out.</p> <p>  On the question of relevant bodies, we can supply the Senator with a list of them.  I think her key concern, however, is that some of the commercial semi-State organisations may not fall within the ambit of that term.  The chapter in the climate action plan referring to the public sector leading by example sets out a climate mandate for the public sector.</p><p>We are also bringing forward a mandate which we have worked on with NewERA and input from other Departments for the commercial semi-States.  In effect, there will be a mandate for both commercial and non-commercial and Departments.  </p><p> The Act has commenced.  It was commenced last September.  These mandates are for Departments to start implementing and moving forward.  The one for the commercial semi-States has still to be approved by the Government but it will happen by the end of March.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.153" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aoife O'Grady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022011800002#CC00400"><p>An incremental approach has been taken in budget 2022.  For example, one change that was introduced is that the VRT rate for zero-emitting vehicles did not increase but an incremental increase was brought up based on vehicle weight.  The 20-band table was introduced last year, going from the lowest to highest emitting.  From this year there is a 1% increase in VRT for vehicles in bands 9 to 12, a 2% increase for vehicles in bands 13 to 15 and a 4% increase in bands 16 to 20.  That is not specifically targeted at SUVs as a vehicle in terms of weight but it does introduce an increased rate of taxation being paid on the more heavily emitting vehicles in the fleet.</p> <p>  The electric vehicle policy pathway report was published in September last year.  That was produced by a working group across Departments.  One of its key recommendations is that the Government continues to assess the taxation and regulations that might be introduced to incentivise electric vehicles across the fleet.  That group will reconvene this month.  One of its key actions will be to consider what further taxation or regulations might be introduced in future budgets over the rest of the decade.  </p> <p>  As I said earlier, the range of EVs coming on the market is quite significant now.  The larger range vehicles of 500 km to 600 km will attract over a lot of people who might have been interested in purchasing the larger, heavier SUVs.  I would point out that our EV sales are where we need them to be now.  We did very well in 2021.  Although the pathway to 1 million electric vehicles is significant and highly ambitious, we are not expecting to do a straight line trajectory from where we are now at a low base of about 43,000 vehicles up to 1 million.  We expect a slower start to increase in the next few years and that by the end of the decade we will reach a point where we expect 100% of the vehicles in the fleet will be electric.  The Department is comfortable that the sales of EVs are where they need to be.  We were very happy with the uptick in sales last year.  There was a very significant increase, 127%, in grant applications to the SEAI on the previous year.  While we understand that there may be a slight slow down in all vehicle sales next year because of global supply chain issues we envisage that the increased sales of EVs will continue year-on-year up to the end of the decade.  </p></speech>

There is a problem even within the electric vehicle sector where some of the cars are so heavy that they are doing away with the benefits of electric vehicles because the car is so heavy and takes so much power to charge.</p></speech>

Vehicles are not coded by weight in the national vehicle and driver file.  We know whether a vehicle is battery operated or plug-in hybrid.  Within the traditional internal combustion engine, ICE, vehicles there is a breakdown of vehicle types but in electric it just comes to us defined as battery or plug-in hybrid.</p><p>I understand the points about vehicle weight and size but a large EV is still far more climate effective, even if powering off a traditional energy supply, than the equivalent large size vehicle would be in an ICE.</p></speech>

While a large EV might be more climate friendly than a fossil fuel car, a lighter and smaller EV is even more climate friendly again and it seems there is a gap in how the vehicles are classified in the tax code.</p></speech>

On Government supports, I should point out that in the past year we have kept the maximum EV grant at &euro;5,000 for vehicles that cost up to &euro;60,000 but we have taken it away from the higher value EVs.  If one looks at the large range of EVs on the market, those higher priced large EVs that are coming in above &euro;60,000 are not supported by Government anymore.  On the VRT rate, one gets a maximum relief of up to &euro;40,000 on a battery electric vehicle, BEV.  We are not incentivising the large and expensive EVs but we are fully incentivising EVs that cost up to &euro;40,000 on VRT and grant relief.  We are still offering the grant relief and some VRT relief for vehicles of up to &euro;60,000 but the Government supports are specifically targeted at those smaller EVs.</p></speech>

In recent months we have seen a high proportion of BEVs to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, PHEVs being sold.  We also removed the PHEV grant from last July and those tend to be the larger vehicles.  We announced this ahead of time to give the market and the public time to react but that led to an imbalance in sales for last year.  The announcement of that led to a rush on PHEVs being purchased prior to the end of June and we will see a more stable profile throughout this year.  Last year we saw that from July to the end of the year there was a shift across to BEVs rather than PHEVs with a breakdown of 60% BEVs to 40% PHEVs, which is where we need to be.</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague, Mr. Crammond, to go into more detail on that.  Looking at the overall picture, the unique selling point of Irish agriculture is that it is a grass-fed and rain-based system and we always have to be careful that we do not suggest any move away from that.  A lot of international systems are based around animals being permanently housed and that is not a model that we would support or envisage for here.</p> <p>  There are technical issues around the use of methane reduction feed additives.  I have responsibility for research so I would draw attention to two projects that are ongoing for some time, including the GreenBreed project.  We are seeing that there is quite a difference between individual animals in the amount of methane they produce due simply to their basic characteristics.  As a scientist, when one sees that variability then it is possible to breed for that trait and good work is ongoing in that section.  Second, there is Meth-Abate, the project being run by Teagasc, which is looking at multiple different varieties of feed additives, including olives, oils, seaweed and commercial products.  In the long term there will be lots of claims about this and we need to make sure they are valid and authenticated.  The research in Meth-Abate is looking at a number of different products but there are specific challenges around the use of a feed additive.  I might ask Mr. Crammond to explain the additional information that is required about the effectiveness of feed additives in a pasture system.</p></speech>

As Mr. Callanan has outlined, the area of methane reducing feed additives is incredibly important for the sector in the achievement of its targets.</p><p>Given what we are seeing at the moment, with the first feed additive, which contains the 3-NOP chemical, 3-nitrooxypropanoal, having gone through the European Food Safety Authority, we expect this feed additive to be commercially available in Ireland later this year.  This will be targeted over the winter housing period initially.  When the animals are indoors we would be able to feed that continually to our animals.  The challenge then is to take that 3-NOP product and develop a slow-release bolus for it that we can deliver to animals when they are put out to pasture over the grazing period throughout the year.  One of the ways we can target this is when the animals come in for milking in the morning.  We would be able to feed this to the animal through a slow-release bolus, and then continually do that over the grazing period.  The expectation is that this product is still a couple of years away from market.  We probably do not envisage this before 2024 or 2025.  It is coming, but in the short term the focus will be on the housed animals over the winter.  It was identified in the climate action plan that this would be expected to make a contribution.</p></speech>

Exactly what volume of seaweed would be required?  I am aware that people involved in the seaweed sector would say that it is just not practical to be talking about harvesting seaweed to feed livestock.</p></speech>

It is something we must watch very carefully.  With regard to seaweed, the results that are coming through globally for the reductions in methane are very high, but it must be balanced against that issue, as the Senator has rightly raised, around the ability to produce large quantities of seaweed along our coastline to feed to our animals that would make a material difference.  That work will need to be done.  We are very conscious about that, and from our point of view it is certainly the case that 3-NOP will be the feed additive that comes to the marketplace in the first instance.</p></speech>

My questions would come under some main headings relating to the witnesses' contributions, namely: Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh's consideration of the resources to deliver, which I will touch upon shortly; Mr. Mahon's contribution on the local authority's role in all of that; and Mr. Carroll's points about retrofitting.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh.  On the overall targets that need to be achieved across Departments, what kinds of physical and human resources would be required?  What changes are being made currently across Departments to ensure that those are targets are met?</p> <p>  In the context of the 31 local authorities, Mr. Mahon spoke of fostering and achieving those targets and engaging with various stakeholders.  Colleagues on the committee have mentioned the public participation networks and other local organisations with which to engage.  I did not hear much about youth in this context.  Young people have really driven this agenda.  One of the reasons we are all talking about climate targets in different sectors is, arguably, because young people have for many years been ahead of the curve on this and have demanded change.  This is commendable, but the local authorities are at the coalface of responding to this challenge and I am not hearing a lot about that engagement.  Yes, there are those plans that must be reviewed every five years, but I wonder how the local authorities will engage with young people and those organisations such as Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, and others we have spoken about before.</p> <p>  From what I heard, there has been very little reference to the engagement with, and the onus on, the regional authorities.  There are some challenges, which we have spoken about before, such as car sharing, bike sharing, scooter schemes and other types of schemes where local authorities will need to act together.  The regional authorities play a pivotal role in that regard.  Perhaps Mr. Mahon will comment on this matter.</p><p> On retrofitting, Mr. Carroll mentioned a target of 36,000 by 2030.  With regard to his plans for local authority housing, he mentioned a 40% target in connection with local authority dwellings not performing to the level required for a B2 rating.  Has the review started?  How advanced is it in determining how many dwellings do not hit the target or will require retrofitting?  If it has not started, when will it be completed?</p><p> Mr. Mahon mentioned in his opening statement the retrofitting of the national public lighting stock and the local authority fleet.  What are the percentages for each?  What is the percentage for the success regarding national public lighting?  How many vehicles do the local authorities have that are of renewable stock?</p></speech>

It is not lost on any of us that the deployment of resources to achieve what needs to be to achieved will be significant.  I am referring not only to financial resources but also to human resources, within Departments and the bodies under the aegis of each Department.</p> <p>  To date, several initiatives have been taken.  Climate action units have been set up in almost all Departments.  They will add capacity to them to focus in on the most immediate demands that the climate action plan places on them.  Broader than that, there is a recognised need for the system to reorient itself towards climate action.  This will have implications for all Departments and sectors, and nearly all civil and public servants, in one way or another.  We need to factor the climate challenge into operations and policy actions.  One way of doing so is to increase capacity and climate literacy throughout the system.  We have measures in the climate action plan to that end.</p> <p>  I Roinn an Taoisigh, we have been considering how climate considerations are hardwired into policy formulation.  In the first instance, we will be demanding to know the climate implications of Government memorandums as they are submitted.  That is a good way of ensuring they will have been considered.  In the longer term, however, we have to get much farther back in the chain of policy formulation and ensure climate considerations are hardwired at the very start.</p></speech>

Each Department's requirements will be different.  Sometimes it will be about redeployment, possibly, and sometimes it will be about the retraining of staff to ensure they can focus on the climate implications of the work they are already doing.  In other cases, however, specific skills needed to meet the climate challenge but that are not currently in the Departments or bodies may have to be identified.  All those things will have to be done.  There is a series of measures in the climate action plan to address this.</p></speech>

I will not get into great detail now because of time but we envisage additional resources will be required to deliver on our ambition.</p><p> On the area of the role of youth, I will ask Mr. Mellett to speak to that because the climate action regional offices have had engagement on this and we have worked with Comhairle na n&Oacute;g in partnership with the Department in having a conversation on climate earlier in 2021.</p><p> On public lighting, I am kind of afraid to mention a figure but every public light in the country will be retrofitted if it has not been already as part of a major programme by local authorities to reintroduce energy-efficient bulbs to the core public lighting stock.  It is a significant number and the process is regional.  The southern region signed the contract just before Christmas to replace the public lights in the south of the country.  We divided the country into three regions for the purpose, and of the others, the midlands and east will I hope go to contract in the first half of this year.  The other region, comprising the west and north west, will do that we hope later in the year.  A number of local authorities are not participating in this but delivering their own public lighting programme individually.</p><p> Our committee has commissioned a working group to work with representatives from our sector, the SEAI and the Department of Transport to look at reimagining our fleet.  A major survey is under way to identify the number of vehicles that each city and county council has and the number that are electric.  A significant number are not but we are trying to get an understanding of what we have and the challenges we will have in "reimagining" our fleet to reduce our emissions of carbon from fuel as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Perhaps he will send us a note on the public lighting.  It would be nice for the committee to have a baseline of how many lights are converted and how many are to be.</p></speech>

As has been outlined, we are looking at improving efficiencies by more than 50% on the public lighting, which is supported through the climate action fund.  As Mr. Mahon mentioned, we have a working group with various stakeholders looking at how we can improve the fleet.  The results of that survey will be forthcoming in the next few months.  The objectives there will be very much along the line of what the Department of Transport strategy is around avoiding, shifting and improving.  We will look at how we do things to see if we can change those operations and avoid having to use transport.  On the shifting to EVs, a number of local authorities are leading on this and we hope to learn from that through the working group.  There is also the matter of improving the fuel we are using and our driver behaviour to try to reduce emissions in that way.</p> <p>  On engagement with youth, each local authority works with Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and there are various initiatives across the 31 local authorities specifically on the matter of climate action.  Much of that discussion is coming back to the strategic policy committees and feeding into local authority strategies.  There are also strong relationships across local authorities with green schools and they are partnering with them on various initiatives to both create awareness around climate action and develop appropriate actions that can be delivered at that local level.</p></speech>

The questions were following up some of the comments from my colleague, Mr. Paul Lemass, so I will let him take those.</p></speech>

Anything built since 2011 will be an A3 standard and from 2019 the standard is A2.  Effectively, we can take those out of the equation because they are already at that level.</p><p>It is 40% of the remainder, which is around 36,000 units, that will be focused on for the retrofit.  That is how those numbers were arrived at.  There is not a review as such.  It is simply that we have the data to know which ones have already hit the B2.</p></speech>

If I can, Chair, very briefly address a point to Mr. Carroll about the private stock, there is a huge demand for that, particularly under the better energy warmer homes scheme.  We all need to do our best to achieve the target.  There is a willingness from the public.  We just need to ensure the resources are in place.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for the interesting discussion.  My camera has been off for most of the time, but I have been here listening to them all.  On the point Deputy Devlin raised on retrofit, the advancement of the proposed one-stop shop for information for people right across the board, whether it is on EVs or retrofitting schemes, is something on which we need to put significant focus in the coming months.  We need to see this operational in 2022 to try to assist us all in getting to where we need to be.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding everything that has been discussed, I want to focus on public lighting for a moment.  Mr. Mahon talked about the energy efficiency improvements that are being done.  One aspect to an area of personal interest, which is electric vehicles, alternatives to cars such as electric scooters, and the infrastructure associated with cycling routes throughout the country, is one of things they are doing in Fingal at the moment and which is operating quite effectively, which is a trial use of lamp standards for charging EVs.  This is in partnership, I think, with a private firm.  It seems to be operating quite well.  With this energy efficiency upgrade of our lighting equipment throughout the country, there are great opportunities to broaden the delivery of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  Coupled with that is the fact it would dramatically reduce the costs.  I believe one of our witnesses estimated them at somewhere between &euro;10,000 and &euro;15,000, with the costs being per hour and with funding being provided to local authorities at around, I think, &euro;5,000 per unit.  Clearly, if the infrastructure is there and it can be adapted, as it has been in Fingal, then it occurs to me there are opportunities to reduce the overall costs.</p> <p>  The point I wanted to raise is that it is quite alarming to find at this stage in our discussions on climate action and reducing our carbon emissions as a country that we did not or do not have a national strategy for EV infrastructure.  If I am not mistaken, I think it was mentioned that we do not have one and it is about to be published.  The only question I would ask is why the delay.  The climate action plan was published in 2019.  It has been dramatically improved, in both its reach and its targets, by both the Government and this committee in the significant work we put into the process.  Therefore, to hear that the national strategy for EVs has not even been published is a bit alarming.  When will it come about?  Will there be an opportunity for this committee, or indeed the transport committee or housing committee, to review it before it is published?  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p> <p>  My final question relates to local government.  It is very important our local government bodies throughout the country lead on climate change in local communities.  They have the networks.  They have the outreach on the ground in education and in improvements within each and every local authority in the country.  My only question to the LGMA representatives is whether we have sufficient budgets and expertise within the local authorities to deliver upon what has been set in front of them, especially in staffing.  Are there any barriers to their body in attempting to reach those targets at a local authority level?</p></speech>

As a sector, we have developed our own guidance for local authorities on the whole area of electric vehicle charging points.  We have identified through our committee the best possible guidance that we can give to colleagues around the country because there is a need for electric vehicle charging.  I am aware that the Dublin local authorities and in particular Fingal are probably more advanced in this space.  The concept of getting access to a charging point via public charging ports is definitely one that is being pursued in Fingal and is being considered in other places.  I note that Dr. Aoife O'Grady has her hand up and that the Department of Transport is in the process of preparing an overall strategy for this, which will be welcome when it is in place.  We have issued guidance to our own colleagues with support from many agencies, including the Department of Transport, for the roll-out of charging points as best placed to provide some degree of local charging points at this time.</p> <p>  I can move on to on the last question and the significant role for local government to provide leadership and, indeed, be the conduit from a national level to local communities and local enterprises.  That is stated in our strategy, which I mentioned earlier.  We see that as a pivotal role for ourselves in this space.  We have received significant resources in some of these places already.  For instance, in the area of active travel, in partnership with the Department of Transport and the NTA, every local authority has been given approval to approve additional people to make sure the modal shift is put in place and that the active travel programme for each county council is delivered upon.  Those resources are, therefore, either in place or being put in place at the moment.  It was agreed to just over a year ago and there are significant developments there.</p> <p>  Indeed, through the retrofitting programme, there is scope for local authorities to put resources in place at a local level to provide them with technical support for the roll-out of the social housing programme.  They are very welcome.  In our strategy, we have identified other resources that we believe are needed in the area of co-ordination, such as the role of a climate action officer.  Some local authorities have them in place in the areas of energy co-ordination, delivering on our energy and emissions targets, green solutions and climate community officers but many do not.  There are opportunities there for additional resources to be identified and put in place to co-ordinate the full and effective role of local authorities in dealing with climate action.</p> <p>  We have good engagement, in particular with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, in identifying how those resources can be put in place and we are moving forward as quickly as we can to identify the appropriate funding in order that those resources can be put in place for all the city and county councils across the country.</p></speech>

I will mention a couple of things on that.  We are very interested in what is happening in Fingal.  We have been funding the public points scheme in local authorities over the year; we would like to see a pilot for lamp posts funded through that this year.  It is something we are hoping to encourage.  There are a couple of challenges with it, however.  I always feel the job of the public servant in these situations is to say that it is a bit more complicated but it is a bit more complicated.  This is just to flag these issues.</p> <p>  At the moment, my understanding is that the energy to lamp posts across local authorities across Ireland is unmetered.  The Fingal pilot and a similar one in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown are being run from a couple of lamp posts and the local authority is absorbing the cost of the energy that is being provided to EVs.  Installing meters on a lamp post is obviously a bigger infrastructural challenge than just being able to install a charger so there is that challenge.</p> <p>  One of the things we are looking at is trying to see if a solution is possible for this.  In Germany and in the UK, a person can purchase a certified self-charging cable for his or her vehicle that actually runs a meter on the cable itself.  A person can plug it in and that is then metered.</p><p>We are trying to see if we can get a certification of that.  That also involves interaction with the energy companies in provision and supply of that.  The last thing on that is with the upgrade of street lighting across the country, it does become a possibility.  However, in many of the older lampposts, the wiring would be insufficient to support an EV, multiple EVs on the street, as well as providing the lamppost charging.  However, I would hope that there would be - horrible word - "synergy" across these issues.  At the same time as doing a lighting upgrade, we could look at using the same facility for EV charging.

I have raised it because I feel that while there are complications with the provision of charging at lampposts, which will not work everywhere, if we press ahead with the upgrade and with the energy efficiency upgrades of all of these lampposts across the country over the coming decade, we will miss an opportunity.  I would hate to see that opportunity pass.  However, they are all over it, so I will not-----</p></speech>

This is one of my hopeful, easier solutions to EV infrastructure challenges.  I hope that it will work out.  We are engaging heavily with local authorities.  We are eager to see a pilot up and running to understand how this might work across, maybe, one town, one village, or one urban or suburban area.  We would like to see how it works in practice.</p></speech>

The first objective in avoid-shift-improve is to reduce the need for driving.  That is to enhance the capacity of the population to walk as much as possible and to cycle.  Where there is currently on-street parking, which is pretty much where the public lighting is, we will have to make our footpaths much wider.  We will have to take over public space for cycle lanes and cycle networks.  That will complicate the idea of using the lamp standards, or probably most of the lamp standards, for EV charging.</p></speech>

However, one of the things we are doing is research.</p> <p>  I will come back on the EV infrastructure strategy.  I would just say there is not a delay on that.  It was a programme for Government commitment in the establishment of this Government.  It is being prepared at the moment.  We would expect to publish it in the next few months.  Deputy Alan Farrell asked about engagement on it.  We would publish it for consultation.  The purpose of the publication would be to engage with stakeholder groups, including this committee, to get feedback to refine and improve upon it.  Part of the work we have been doing on that is to look at what other cities across Europe are doing.  We are keen about this.  Part of the climate action plan is to massively increase the proportion of sustainable transport trips in our towns and cities across Ireland.  Looking at cities like Amsterdam, where they have been able to put in on-street EV charging, they have walking and cycling modal shares that we would grab with both hands if we could.  They are able to deliver that alongside street, curb-side and EV charging in Amsterdam suburbs.  There will be many streets where this is not suitable, where we are looking to install segregated cycle paths and wider footpaths, as the Chair mentioned.  However, in some of the quieter suburban streets, where there is not the availability of front gardens for people who want to purchase an EV and charge it, this would be a nice solution for those areas.</p></speech>

Mr. Mellett mentioned that the &ldquo;shift&rdquo; referred to shift to EVs.  It absolutely does not.  The electric vehicles fall under &ldquo;improve&rdquo;.  As well as this, avoid-shift-improve are in order of priority.  &ldquo;Avoid&rdquo; is the first priority, &ldquo;shift&rdquo; refers to shift to active travel modes and sustainable transport, then &ldquo;improve&rdquo; is to improve efficiency.  That is where EVs come in.  Would Dr. O&rsquo;Grady agree with that?</p></speech>

It is to reduce the need for travel, to shift to public transport and then improve the technology if all else fails.</p></speech>

The &ldquo;avoid&rdquo; and the &ldquo;shift&rdquo; are a higher priority than the &ldquo;improve&rdquo;, which is where the EVs are.</p><p>I interjected a few times during the questioning by other members, but I still have my own to ask.  Starting with the witnesses from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I notice that the number of farms, or perhaps the portion of land, for organic farming is to increase from 2% to 7.5%.  Is that the plan?  I refer to an increase to 350,000 ha.  It has also been stated, however, that the herd numbers can remain stable.  If there is a large increase in organic farming does that not imply a much lower stocking rate and, ultimately, a lower herd number?  It might not be the policy to reduce herd numbers, but will that be the effective outcome of increasing the share of organic farming?  Can we go further in that regard?  What are the obstacles to going beyond the target of 7.5%?  I think that is the current EU target, but we are trying to catch up and go further in this context.  Why, therefore, can we not go beyond 7.5%?  Other European countries are way beyond it.  I would have thought that we could follow and catch up in that regard.   </p><p> In addition, does the Department have a diversification strategy?  The vast majority of emissions are coming from the dairy herd and, as I understand it, the beef herd to a lesser extent.  We want to make farming a viable choice for people and to sustain jobs in rural Ireland.  Unless there is a diversification strategy, however, and perhaps there is one and I have just not seen it, I do not think we are going to reduce emissions as much as we need to.  </p><p> Moving to transport, we could achieve our targets regarding private electric vehicle penetration increasing to approximately 850,000 vehicles by 2030.  Unless we are displacing fossil fuel cars, however, it would still be possible for us to face an emissions' challenge in the transport sector.  It was pointed out that we are more or less on target with the sales of electric vehicle and a pathway document is being followed in this regard.  Are we seeing an equal reduction in the sales of fossil fuel vehicles?  If we are not, then we are going down the path of having more vehicles on the roads.  We might end up having 1 million electric vehicles, but we could also have 2 million vehicles using fossil fuels.  If we were to have so many vehicles on our roads in 2030, then that is going to militate against our efforts to make it attractive to live in our villages, towns and cities.  There is simply not enough road capacity in urban settlements to accommodate so many vehicles.  Therefore, is there a target to reduce the overall number of vehicles and the number of fossil fuel vehicles?  I direct my questions first to the witnesses from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

That will account for a contribution of 0.3 Mt CO2 eq.  To explain why the change to an increased level of organic farming is not as big a factor as perhaps it might be thought, it involves the removal of fertiliser.  Every reduction of 10,000 tonnes of fertiliser used decreases the climate impact by 0.07 Mt CO2 eq, which is a relatively modest amount.  Our overall footprint in this context is approximately 85% driven by emissions from livestock.  The rest comes from fertiliser use.  Some fertiliser emissions will be removed because of the increase in organic farming, but the major element of emissions comes from animals.</p> <p>  The Chair is correct concerning our best estimate of the impact.  The stocking rate is generally lower.  Given, however, that many of the farms likely to embrace an increase in the percentage of land devoted to organic farming are also more likely to be operating extensively in this area already, our estimates suggest a reduction of about 10% in the stocking rates on those farms.  It does not, therefore, translate into as big an impact as might be thought.  Organic farming will see the development of organic horticulture.</p><p>Equally, in terms of area, organic livestock production is a core activity.  The increase in area is like any change.  It is significant at farm level.  We have to work with people on developing their expertise in the area and developing their openness and willingness to move towards organics.  We also have to work on the market development and make sure there is a market out there that is willing to support the addition of organic production.  That all needs to be developed in tandem.   Naturally, that influences what your ambition is.  Organic demand is growing but it is coming from a relatively modest base and we just need to reflect on that. </p><p> In terms of diversification, there is a commitment between the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and of Environment, Climate and Communications to work on a land use strategy.  As part of that process, and consequent to that, is looking at diversification opportunities as well.  As I mentioned, there is the Teagasc options programme, which looks at the overall capacity for diversification.  There is alternative land usage, but, equally, much income diversification is around adding value.  Again, it is the same as organics when the basic livestock units are there.  For example, when somebody is moving to cheese production or direct sales to consumers as diversification, the emissions associated with the animals that were at the core of that farming enterprise still have to be counted.</p></speech>

To support the Chair's earlier point, all of what we are about in the transport area is that avoid-shift- improve piece.  It is about the avoiding and reduction of demand insofar as we can.  The avoid piece happens around planning and at the town and city level, and the engagement that we are having with local authorities, other levels and the planning department around compact growth.  The improve element is around biofuels and electrification of the car fleet.  The electrification piece gets many of the headlines and much attention, but it is not where we are focusing for the longer term.  Clearly, demand management and reduction in kilometres of fossil fuel cars is where the first order of action needs to happen.  I will hand over to Dr. O'Grady because there is a bit of research being done around this and she can add to this.</p></speech>

At the moment, approximately 12% of new registrations on the road this year are EVs.  The modelling we have done is not based on a target of cars in the fleet; the modelling is based on what we think is reasonable in terms of projecting future demand for car purchase and then how many of those will convert to an EV rather than an ICE vehicle.  When the modellers did that analysis, they projected an increase in the car fleet over the next decade.  They project that increase is likely to be smaller than the increase in the car fleet over the previous decade of 2011- 2020, but there will be an increase of approximately 1% year-on-year out to 2030.  That is based on both demographic and economic growth, which are trajectories set out by the CSO.</p> <p>  In terms of EVs displacing ICEs, we expect that by 2028 or 2029 almost 100% of car sales to be EV.  At that stage, we do not see any ICE passenger car sales.  There may still be some vans and heavy goods vehicles, but we would expect the passenger car fleet to be 100% new EVs at that point.  The market will completely switch.</p></speech>

The group found that a general scrappage scheme was not necessarily recommended at that point, but we have introduced a scrappage scheme for targeted groups.  The scheme we are running at present is for electric taxis.  There is an incentive, in the form of a capital grant, for electric taxis and a scrappage scheme to further incentivise the owners of older taxis with internal combustion engines.  The finding of the group, however, was that a general scrappage scheme across the car fleet would incur significant financial costs and was not necessary at this time.  Depending on how our EV projections go, it could be something we come back to and consider later in the decade but, certainly at present, with the growth in the EV fleet being around where we want it to be, if not slightly ahead, maybe it is just a little early to jump on that at present.</p></speech>

If we change the policy environment, and change incentives and disincentives further, that is likely to shift, but the modelling was done on a neutral policy basis, taking the policies we have now and looking at what EV uptake would be envisaged out to 2030.</p></speech>

One of my staff reminded me that the SEAI told us at an information session in late 2018 or probably 2019, she was not sure of the date, but the date she was sure of was that by July 2019, there would be no stipulation on the one home, one visit for retrofitting.  In other words, if your attic was insulated 15 or 20 years previously, one would be entitled to apply for it again and that derogation was being lifted.  That does not seem to be happening and certainly does not comply with what the council is telling us, which is that if you already had any retrofitting done and were considered to be at an appropriate BER rating, you could not have that revisited.</p> <p>  It is important to clarify where we are at.  Has the SEAI gone back on its word that it would lift that one visit, one home obstacle?  Is the council applying that when the SEAI is not?  We have, and I cannot overstate this, so many elderly, sick people who are living in cold housing and looking for a bit more retrofitting and being rejected repeatedly by the council and the SEAI for any help.  It just seems totally inappropriate.</p> <p>  My second question-----</p></speech>

One point is that I do not believe the preparation of those will help us achieve the 51% and I ask that the Department review all of them and see what actions can be taken to address that.  The second point is that if we have councillors who are continuously voting against climate measures, both in mitigation and adaption, is there an emergency plan by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage?  There is a real risk at the moment.  I have already seen councillors voting against these measures.  Measures have been taken around housing.

The timelines for completing work on the fossil fuels subsidies are as agreed in the climate action plan.  Any decision to accelerate those would have to be looked at and agreed, but I hear the Senator's suggestion and her point.  On the sectoral targets, to be clear, it is not that they will not be available until quarter 4.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 has a statutory timeline for the economy-wide carbon budgets, which is four months from the date of publication of the proposal by the CCAC.  That takes us to 24 February.</p> <p>  I have not got the words but the Act more or less says, as soon as practicable after that, the Government needs to adopt sectoral ceilings.  The intention is to do so as quickly as possible.  We are saying that once that is done, the update of the climate action plan will need to be made consistent with those ceilings.  It is not that the ceilings will not be available very early; it is making the climate action plan consistent with them.</p> <p>  I am sorry, with the comings and goings, I did not hear Senator Higgins question on climate justice.</p></speech>

I personally believe we need to be fighting for the second budget to be aligned with fair share at a minimum.

We contribute to that via the European Union's nationally determined contribution.  That is how Ireland's contribution to the global effort in terms of the Paris Agreement feeds through.  On some of the wider issues, I can supply a note to the Senator.

I will not be able to speak to the SEAI point, but I will be able to speak to the social housing side of it.  On the social housing side, there is not a one person, one visit arrangement.  If a house is below the B2 energy rating, it will be considered for an upgrade and retrofit.  We are aiming for 40% of those houses to be done by 2030.  There is no exclusion based on the SEAI.  The SEAI might be a separate cohort of houses.</p> <p>  On Senator Pauline O'Reilly's question, on the county development plans Ms Walsh outlined the intention to ensure that the development plan guidelines have regard to climate action.  She also talked about the question of an Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, review.  The Senator is concerned about councillors voting against measures, but any plan will have to be reviewed by the Office of the Planning Regulator and it must be consistent with national policies.  There is a safety net there.</p></speech>

It is actually a reserve function and I appreciate the issue being raised.  We are aware in the Department of where decisions are made on resolutions to not agree on certain proposals and developments.  How that is responded to is something we can consider but it sits outside of the planning process.</p><p>It sounds like something that could be looked at legislatively.  We will take that on board and bring it back to colleagues across some of our other units to perhaps scope out where there is merit in looking at that.</p></speech>

Today is the second in a series of meetings the committee has been holding to look at urban regeneration and how to bring some life, vitality and living back into our urban towns and villages across the country.  In the first meeting, we looked at dereliction, decay and vacancy.  We also looked a little bit at compulsory purchase.  It is important to note that, even if you address dereliction and vacancy and have a town that is full to capacity, that town may still not be a very nice place to live.  There are other aspects that contribute to nice liveable towns, villages and cities.  In this second meeting, we will look at some other aspects in respect of transport, active transport and the public realm, which is really important.  I refer to the nice places people have in towns, how to get around, through or to the town and how to get from town and town.  We will look at many of the transport aspects of this question.  We will also look at the Town Centres First policy and active transport.</p><p>I am delighted we are joined today by the Heritage Council.  I welcome back Ms Virginia Teehan, chief executive officer who is joined by Ms Alison Harvey from the collaborative town centre health check, CTCHC, programme.  Some tremendous work has been done up and down the country on that programme.  It is vitally important research where they look at the baseline and economic aspects of towns and their spatial dimensions, transport, culture of the community and commercial and residential aspects.  A baseline is created as a plan to implement actions to put life back into towns.  Both Ms Teehan and Ms Harvey are very welcome.</p><p> We are joined by Mr. David O'Connor, assistant head of school, spatial planning and transport; Dr. Sarah Rock, lecturer spatial planning and transport; and Dr. Lorraine D&rsquo;Arcy, senior lecturer, spatial planning and transport, Technological University Dublin, TU Dublin.  They are very welcome.  I thank them for supplying an opening statement.  I am very interested in hearing their experience of active travel and all the accompanying aspects such as the reallocation of road space, pedestrian permeability and nice linkage through places.  I am interested in hearing how we can get around towns to places of work, recreation, school, employment and all of the accompanying aspects so I look forward to their contributions on that.</p><p> We are joined by Mr. Conn Donovan who is the chairperson of the Cork Cycling Campaign.  I have no doubt that a lot of what he will advocate for we will hear from TU Dublin as well because they probably have aligned desires in cycling.  He is very welcome.</p><p> Finally, we are joined by Dr. Cathal FitzGerald, senior analyst, and Mr. Noel Cahill, economist, National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  In particular, I look forward to discussing the transport orientated development paper that NESC produced about two years ago, which very much feeds into our work as a committee on housing, local government, planning and heritage.  Therefore, this committee is about how we travel, build houses and create communities around the really good transport hubs that exist, and the high-frequency, comfortable, reliable and affordable public transport links, and how we can bring all of those aspects together.  All the witnesses are very welcome.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  Members attending remotely from within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meeting.  This means that they will have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.</p><p> For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present within the Leinster House complex.  Members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy, and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> The opening statements that were submitted to the committee by our witnesses today will be published on the committee website following this meeting.  I ask witnesses to make brief opening statements as we have a lot of witnesses and questions to get through.  The opening statements submitted are comprehensive and we would appreciate being briefed.  I invite Ms Teehan to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am CEO of the council.  As members may recall, Dr. Martina Moloney, chairperson of the Heritage Council and I met the committee two months ago in late November.  Today, I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Alison Harvey, planning officer and project manager for the CTCHC programme.</p><p>As outlined at the November meeting, the remit of the Heritage Council is very broad.  The topic of today's meeting is of particular interest to us as we have, through many years, demonstrated an authentic commitment to addressing the many issues that impact towns and villages.  We welcome the fact the committee shares our concerns in respect of an evident pattern of deterioration of the heritage, historic fabric and economic health of towns and villages.<br/><br/>The Heritage Council, which was established in 1995, is a prescribed body for the purposes of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2021.  The council has specific responsibilities under section 6 of the Heritage Act, which states:</p><blockquote>	The functions of the Council shall be to propose policies and priorities for the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of the national heritage, including monuments, archaeological objects, heritage objects, architectural heritage, flora, fauna, wildlife habitats, landscapes, seascapes, wrecks, geology, heritage gardens and parks and inland waterways. </blockquote><p>Since its foundation in 1995, the Heritage Council has undertaken extensive research, policy development and delivery to support the planning and management of Ireland&rsquo;s unique national heritage.  Our commitment to supporting historic town centres is evident from our initiation and management of the following key strategic programmes.  The Irish walled towns network, IWTN, was formed by the Heritage Council in 2005 to unite and co-ordinate the strategic efforts of local authorities and other stakeholders involved in the management, conservation and enhancement of historic walled towns in Ireland, both North and South.  The Heritage Council offers annual grants to the towns that participate in the IWTN.<br/><br/>The historic towns initiative programme was established in 2017.  This capital grant scheme for heritage-led regeneration is managed in collaboration with the heritage unit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  In 2021, ten towns benefited from grants from the project.  The average value of each grant was &euro;150,000.  This year, the budget for the initiative was increased to &euro;2 million and it is currently open for applications.<br/><br/>The collaborative town centre health check, CTCHC, programme was set up in 2016 as a pilot programme in response to the overwhelming level of demand, initially from the private sector, to support the regeneration of historic town centres.  We are here today to talk about the CTCHC.  It sets out to collect data on economic, social and cultural activities in each individual town.  It is a health check for the town.  The programme is based on a collaborative approach that includes local and national stakeholders.  This collaborative approach guides the design, delivery, and evaluation of economic development, regeneration, and investment programmes in each town.  The programme strongly supports the implementation of national polices, including the national planning framework, Project Ireland 2040, Housing for All, Our Rural Future and the Climate Action Plan 2021.<br/><br/>Surveying, data collection and data verification to create digital mapping are at the heart of the programme.  A 15-step assessment process is conducted at the outset.  Multiple surveys are undertaken in town centres on land use, footfall, business sector confidence, consumer behaviour and patterns, land and building ownership, air and noise quality, etc.  Once these location-based data baselines are in place, the overall intelligence gathered enables business and civic leaders to create a roadmap for regeneration and targeted investment.  This serves to bring about the renewal of their shared historic environment.<br/><br/>The participatory approach of the programme enables a comparative analysis of the results from towns within the programme.  The same types of data collected and assessed are used for all towns.  The collective nature of the programme and the uniform nature of the data add to its value.  Operating collectively within a combined programme with multiple participants strengthens its impact nationally.</p><p>This unique value generation, including the creation of social capital, is recognised by international partners.  The programme has recently been selected as one of five best practice case studies by the EU-funded ESPON Heriwell programme, which promotes cultural heritage and heritage-led regeneration as a source of societal well-being.  The value of this programme is summarised as follows: it is data driven and evidence based and creates scientific baseline data sets capturing economic, spatial, commercial, social and cultural activities; the process creates spatial data, a geohive, which in turn supports the implementation of UN sustainable development goals; it supports the creation of data for EU funding streams for regeneration of town centres; it creates social capital and public value, and facilitates social cost-benefit analyses; it results in the creation of local regeneration engines; the enhanced collaborative process facilitates increased participatory democracy; the regeneration of historic town centres creates a focus for local communities; and the process results in an enhanced pride, a sense of place and a sense of citizen belonging.  <br/><br/>The CTCHC programme is extremely successful.  It has grown exponentially since its inception in 2016 and was included in the programme for Government published in June 2020.  The commitment in the programme for Government was expressed as follows:</p><blockquote>	We will... Prioritise a Town Centres First collaborative and strategic approach to the regeneration of our villages and towns, using the Collaborative Town Centre Health Check (CTCHC) framework to gather data and lead actions. </blockquote><p>Our work demonstrates that there is a clear need and demand to operate the CTCHC programme nationally.  Currently there are 15 towns participating in what, it must be remembered, is a pilot programme.  There are 45 towns on a waiting list. <br/><br/>At the Heritage Council we incubate ideas and provide advice and solutions to the key issues which impact heritage and its protection.  That is our key function as stated in our founding legislation, the Heritage Act.  It is not the role of the Heritage Council to operate programmes such as the CTCHC programme on a national level.  As I have stated, the evidence emerging from our work demonstrates a clear need to adopt a national and collaborative approach to seek to resolve the issues facing Irish towns.  We very much welcome the work of the Towns Centre First committee under the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  It is our hope that the pending Towns Centre First policy will adopt the valuable learnings from the CTCHC programme and recommend that a unit is established at Government level, within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which will be responsible for the roll-out of the CTCHC programme nationally throughout Ireland. <br/><br/>I thank the Cathaoirleach and committee members for their attention.  The delivery of the CTCHC programme is detailed and complex.  I have done my best in the time allocated today to summarise the key points, outline the programme&rsquo;s value and impact and convey our recommendation that it is rolled out nationally.  We have submitted to the clerk of the committee a detailed document outlining the operation of the programme to accompany our attendance today.  Ms Harvey and I are happy to answer queries and provide further information as required.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh go l&eacute;ir.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues: Mr. Dave O&rsquo;Connor, head of environment and planning at our school; and Dr. Lorraine D&rsquo;Arcy, senior lecturer.</p> <p>  There are many facets to urban regeneration, some of which were discussed at the first session of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage on vacancy and dereliction.  Today, we would like to discuss the importance of good urban design and transport and mobility to regenerating our villages, towns and cities.  Last year Technological University Dublin undertook a pilot evaluative research project in conjunction with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on its Covid mobility and public realm works, focusing on Blackrock village.</p><p>A copy of our phase 1 interim findings has been included in our submission.  Today, we want to outline briefly some of our key learnings from that study. </p><p> Blackrock village was like many towns and villages around the country.  It had a once-lively main street that fell into decline.  Street space was largely given over to cars, a dual carriageway separated the community from the village and a new indoor shopping mall turned its back on the main street.  Like so many places, it had assets and potential but these became diminished.</p><p> With Covid, the local business and community network worked with the council to reimagine Blackrock main street and provide for social distancing.  Footpaths were expanded, a lane of traffic was removed, some cycling facilities were provided and thoughtful planting and seating were provided as well.  The result was more people, fewer cars and a clear endorsement from business and the community.  This balance between movement and place is rare within an Irish context.  We believe a mix of new and existing elements combined to make this project succeed.  These included existing Government policy and legislation that supported the redesign and facilitated quick delivery; a vision within the council from which the Covid response could be rapidly built upon; and an active and fairly cohesive business representative body that wanted change.</p><p> However, what was quite new was accessible and speedy Government funding in the form of National Transport Authority-administered active travel funds and a recognition that speed was of the essence.  There was leadership and action by the local authority, coupled with a culture of innovation and interdisciplinarity, such as engineers, architects and others, working together in the design and implementation approach.  There was an open and collaborative approach to stakeholder engagement and a willingness to listen and adapt the design, without losing the overall project objectives.  In addition, there was a recognition of the importance of research and evaluation.  Due to of the foresight of the local authority, we now have an Irish evidence base from which to learn and build upon. </p><p> If we were to add what additional ingredients -----</p></speech>

Can she continue from "additional ingredients"?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.260" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sarah Rock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#E00300"><p>Yes, perfect.  It froze at just the right moment.  If we were to add what additional ingredients could help other agencies successfully replicate this elsewhere in the future, it would be the following.  First, we would add integrated funding.  Funding streams can be quite narrow in their focus, whereas good urban regeneration is always multifaceted.  One way to do this might be to allow a percentage of spend on a project to be non-traditional and more flexible.  For example, we could allow for street trees, seating and small play areas as part of an active travel fund, thus encouraging both place and movement functions to be addressed.  Another example would be to ensure research and evaluation is an integral component of significant schemes so we can always learn from them.</p> <p>  Recruitment is also important.  This would mean a public appointments process that recognises the value of interdisciplinarity.  Those who are recruited into the public sector to work on projects that impact on the vitality of our towns, villages and cities must come from a range of skill sets and backgrounds.  More flexibility is needed in recruitment, at both a local and national level, to attract specialist, diverse and interdisciplinary appointments, including urban designers and public engagement, health and community specialists.</p> <p>  On transport demand management, the recently published Five Cities Demand Management research report recommended a broad and integrated range of traffic demand management measures which, if implemented, can greatly enhance the mobility and liveability of our urban centres.  These include, for example, 15-minute neighbourhoods, parking and traffic management and low emission zones.  Experience elsewhere shows us that this can enhance local economies while creating people-friendly places and increasing health and accessibility.  </p> <p>  Walking, for example, is one of our most neglected, yet highly effective, forms of transport.  In September 2022, Technological University, TU, Dublin, together with Rialtas na h&Eacute;ireann and the Walk21 Foundation, will host the 22nd International Walk21 Conference on Walking and Liveable Communities.  This conference will bring together a global community of academics and practitioners to explore how supporting and encouraging walking and walkable communities can help deliver sustainable development goal commitments by 2030.  We are grateful for support, in the spirit of multidisciplinarity, from several Government Departments for this.  </p> <p>  The current system, whether it is funding, recruitment, design or implementation, is generally not set up to react quickly enough to deal with the large scale and transformative changes that are required over the next five years and beyond.  However, we learned over the past two years that when it is needed, we can do things differently and change is certainly possible.</p></speech>

If a drug was developed that lowered the risk of developing heart disease and cancer by 40%, governments across the world would rush to ensure their citizens had access to it.  This drug already exists, albeit not in pharmaceutical form.  It is called cycling to work.  Equally, if a technology was developed that lowered the average person&rsquo;s transport carbon footprint by 67%, it would be seen as a game-changer.  This technology already exists.  When people choose a bike instead of a car, even one day a week, they can achieve a significant reduction in their carbon footprint.  Improved public health and lower transport carbon emissions are just two compelling reasons it makes sense for central and local government to promote cycling as a form of everyday transport.</p> <p>  Several pervasive narratives in Ireland suggest that cycling is not a realistic transport option for people.  We often hear that our climate is too wet, that our cities sprawl too far or that cycling is just not part of our culture.  The reality is that Dublin has comparable weather to Copenhagen, two out of three primary school children live within 2 km of their school and 84% of residents in Dublin support building more physically-separated, on-road cycle tracks.  There are two main reasons more people tend not to cycle in Ireland.  They do not think cycling is safe and driving is often very convenient.  Government can address these issues using carrots and sticks.  The carrots include the provision of safe cycling routes, high-quality bike parking and compact neighbourhoods, while the sticks include transport plans that limit unfettered vehicular access in urban areas, increase parking charges and reallocate road space.</p> <p>  Transport-oriented development, TOD, helps to create vibrant, liveable and sustainable communities.  Government should prioritise TOD ahead of low-density greenfield development insofar as possible in the coming years.  We must, however, appreciate what TOD would mean for cycling in Ireland.  It would lead to the development of small urban areas where it may be safer and more attractive to cycle.  These would be in or near larger urban areas where it is often not safe to cycle and more attractive to drive, and therefore the adoption of TOD development must not be seen as a silver bullet for the promotion of active travel, but rather one piece of the puzzle in helping to achieve modal shifts.</p> <p>  The Merwede district in the city of Utrecht in the Netherlands offers a good example of what TOD can look like.  This new neighbourhood will eventually be home to 20,000 people, but the entire new road network for this development will consist of just 60 m of roads, or four short dead ends.  Parking will be limited to one car for every three households.  Small electric vehicles will carry out waste management and deliveries, and urban spaces and the public realm will be quiet and car-free, with an emphasis on biodiversity and place-making.  Perhaps Merwede's greatest asset is that it will be in the city of Utrecht, where cycling policies and investment over several decades have made the bicycle a popular transport option.  The Merwede piece of the puzzle therefore fits in nicely with the existing picture in that city.</p> <p>  In Ireland, we must be careful to ensure that TOD is not used as a Trojan horse to justify building more roads and thus locking Irish society further into car dependency.  The docklands development in Cork city will eventually be home to 25,000 people and there is a target that 70% to 80% of local trips will be taken on foot, by bike, or by public transport.  Last year, Cork City Council approved plans to build a new dual carriageway in the docklands.  In its submission to the public consultation regarding this proposed dual-carriageway, Cork Chamber of Commerce noted that "a new high-capacity multi-lane provision for cars is not in keeping with the national and regional commitment to high density, low car and compact growth".</p> <p>  Last month, funding was provided to 26 towns to deliver town centre first plans.  In 12 of these 26 towns, not one girl aged between 13 and 18 cycled to school, according to data from the Central Statistics Office.  These towns are not outliers.  In 2016, no teenage girls cycled to school in more than 120 towns with populations greater than 1,500 people.  In 1986, more than 19,000 girls cycled to secondary school, but by 2016 this number had fallen to 700.  Teenage girls cycling to school face challenges above and beyond poor infrastructure, but they are a well-researched group and may be considered an indicator species for how inviting it is to cycle in a town.  Town centre first plans and policy ought to be compared and contrasted in the coming months with the healthy streets approach of Transport for London, TfL.  The healthy streets for London policy seeks to make that city's communities greener, healthier and more attractive.  Economic analysis collated by TfL has demonstrated that high streets in which it has been made safer to walk and cycle are also more economically viable and vibrant.  Specifically, these streets enjoy higher retail spends, lower retail vacancy, and increases in people stopping, sitting or socialising.</p><p>Specifically, these towns enjoy higher retail spends, lower retail vacancy and an increase in the number of people sitting, stopping and socialising.  It is imperative that Town Centre First plans in Ireland seek to make walking and cycling a more attractive option for people living locally.</p><p> Last December, the committee had an extensive discussion on the ways to incentivise urban living and bring derelict properties back to life.  The town centres living initiatives synthesis report noted that the public realm in Ireland is dominated by cars and there is a perception that streets are not safe for children.  When we are designing the master plan for a large brownfield site or adopting policies to bring existing buildings back into use, we must consider whether it will be a healthy place to live.</p><p> We know that when urban areas are dominated by cars, communities suffer.  Less social interaction, increased risk of death and disease, sleep disturbance and developmental delays in children have all been associated with living near busy roads.  Urban areas in Ireland need to be healthy and attractive places to live.  To ensure this, significant modal shifts away from private cars and in favour of walking, cycling, light mobility and public transport must be realised.  I thank the Chair.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Noel Cahill.  Members should please note that we are members of the NESC secretariat rather than members of the council and we are speaking to the committee in that capacity, in the interests of time and taking as read the role and membership of NESC.<br/><br/>Our research on TOD was published on our website, but I will summarise some of the key points briefly for the committee.  In 2019, we assessed the opportunity to apply TOD in Ireland.  TOD is a specific type of urban development.  It is not about making development happen, which is a separate issue that the council has examined.  Rather, it is about the nature of the urban development that does happen.  It addresses problems of sprawl, long commutes, harmful emissions, pollution and poorer quality of life.  It does this by maximising the provision of housing, employment, public services and open leisure spaces within close proximity to frequent high-quality transport services.<br/><br/>TOD means locating higher density housing, typically in excess of 50 dwellings per hectare, within a radius of 400 m to 800 m of a transport stop.  Typically, that transport stop is a light rail<b></b>or dedicated rapid bus transport corridor.  More homes are within walking or cycling distance of public transport.That transport must be high-quality and high-frequency, and must be integrated into a network.<br/><br/>The emphasis on active and public transport is important.  TOD also means the active discouragement of car usage and ownership by reducing parking availability and situating parking away from homes at garages on the outskirts of a development.  Our research is based on case studies and revealed four key elements which are necessary to deliver successful TOD development.  <br/><br/>First, there is a need to articulate a vision.  TOD begins when policymakers clearly articulate what it is their actions are intended to achieve, whether this is compact urbanisation, as was the case in the Netherlands or, as we see in Freiburg in Germany, a city of short distances.  The high-level vision spurs the second important factor, that is, the decision.  State level or local authorities take a formal decision to deliver a TOD at an identified suitable location.  Without this, business-as-usual car-orientated design and development scenarios can be expected.  The third important element is the tailored institutional set-up.  TOD is aided by a publicly led body or team at the helm, one which does the land use and transport planning for the site and then prepares the site for development in accordance with the master plan.  Fourth, the TOD model requires an appropriate funding system.  TOD means making significant investment in large transport and other infrastructure ahead of demand.  Our research shows the importance of capturing the value of State investment and the uplift in the price of property in the area around the investment.  Policymakers must actively install a funding model appropriate for TOD, one which applies value capture to deliver homes and facilities ahead of population increases.</p><p>It is notable that there is no successful modern example of transport oriented development in Ireland.  The NESC's 2019 assessment of the policy context found that while one of the four required elements was in place, that being the national planning framework&rsquo;s vision for compact growth and sustainable mobility, this did not appear to be the case at that time for the other three elements we considered important, that is a decision, the publicly led institution, and the appropriate funding model.  It is important to say that since then, there have been some promising moves in relation to Dublin, Galway and Limerick, with plans for Heuston, Shankill, Terryland and Colbert Square.  An ambitious vision has been set out for the redevelopment of the Naas Road-Ballymount-Park West area, the City Edge project, and Cherrywood has some positive features.  The planned investment in commuter rail in Cork also provides an opportunity for TOD.  I understand a Bill to progress land value sharing has also been published.  The extent to which these plans result in new transport oriented development in Ireland remains to be seen.  Mr. Cahill and I are happy to answer any questions on that topic that members may have.</p></speech>

If members keep each slot to seven minutes, we will be able to bring everybody in and we may have time for a second round.  To be clear, the seven minutes includes the time to ask and answer the questions.  If we could be straight to the point with our questions, it would give more time for witnesses to answer.  That would be helpful.  If members indicate who they wish to answer a question rather than putting it out to the entire room, that might help the process as well.  I will first go to the Fianna F&aacute;il slot and call Deputy McAuliffe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.268" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#H00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for being here.  Many of the topics they have discussed are the backbone of the conversations that many Tidy Towns groups have when they are out and about each week carrying out their work.  I will be going to my local Tidy Towns group in Santry this evening.  These conversations happen right across my constituency in Finglas, Ballymun and Santry.</p> <p>  I was interested to hear Dr. Rock talk about what I would call an urban town or an urban village.  My constituency is in the difficult position of not being the priority of a local authority, in that it is not the city centre, and equally it does not have the local democracy that the outer towns in the county have.  It is sandwiched between local authorities in Fingal, such as Blanchardstown and Swords that are rapidly developing, and the city centre, where we are trying to concentrate footfall.  In places like Ballymun, Finglas and Santry, there are often two options: either continued dereliction because of a lack of investment by both public and private operators, or the only opportunity of development being that which comes with significant intensification and when that is developer led, it does not deliver for the community.  Intensification is appropriate but it is right to say that communities have fears around that because often they are the places where housing has been put before facilities in the past.</p> <p>  I have two areas of questions.  One is around the question of how we drive development that is not necessarily solely around the delivery of housing.  I am not saying that we should not have it for the delivery of housing, but how do we develop it?  From what I can see, Dublin City Council or local authorities do not seem to have the remit to develop in the way they should or in the way local authorities in other countries have done.  If any witness, other than Dr. Rock, has looked at Housing for All particularly around the issues of Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns and cities, and when compared with the funding allocated to many rural towns to tackle dereliction, funding which is not available to Dublin urban villages, I would be interested in having a conversation on that.</p> <p>  My second question is for Mr. Donovan.  In Dublin North-West, we are unlucky in our history in this area but lucky that we have significant transport projects coming down the line.  In the west we have a new Luas line proposed and a new metro line through Ballymun.</p><p>In the east we have a new BusConnects route through Santry, Finglas and Ballymun and we have two great orbital routes across the constituency, with one along Collins Avenue linking Clontarf to Glasnevin, while above that there is a route from Finglas to Kilbarrack that goes along Glasnevin Avenue and so on.</p><p> We are retrofitting a very old area with very good and active public transport models but that creates much conversation and controversy.  Motorists have not had to share the road for the best part of 100 years and at that time they shared it with horses.  Many people take for granted that everyone supports this.  I have dealt with the great Dublin Cycling Campaign organisation, for example, but I ask Mr. Donovan in particular how we can bridge the gap in what is sometimes a very toxic conversation between people who share the roads.  It can sometimes be bus users versus car users.  How can we try to make people realise these cyclists are not some sort of alien Lycra-clad beings but they are actually our work colleagues and children?  How would we promote that?</p><p> These are two very broad areas but, to be fair, the topic for overall discussion is also very broad.  I am happy to hear the views of Dr. Rock, Mr. Donovan and anybody else who wishes to contribute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sarah Rock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#J00200"><p>My colleagues may also wish to contribute on this.  I am having Internet access issues today so I missed a bit of the Deputy's contribution.  I can certainly respond to what I did hear.</p> <p>  On the question of housing and mixed-used development, there are a number of considerations.  When one is near a well-located area, such as a crossroads or an urban centre, it is really critical to have mixed use.  The ground floor use should bring a sort of vitality to an area.  One cannot have empty ground floor units everywhere and they can only work in the right locations.  What is also critical for that is maximising accessibility to those areas via walking.  That local accessibility via walking is absolutely critical in ensuring that sort of life and vitality exists in an area that can make that sort of mixed use more viable.</p> <p>  On the retrofitting of older and more established areas, the walking element is again relevant.  Our rush tends to be towards other modes of transport but the most important intervention we can have in existing areas is making the streets more comfortable and safer for those travelling on foot.  Once we get that right, we can start to work on the other forms of transport.  That is the critical element that is the essence of contributing to a healthy, active and livable neighbourhood.</p> <p>  Some of my colleagues may have additional points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.271" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#J00300"><p>I will be brief.  We have highlighted Blackrock because we have an evidence base there but really the measures emphasised by my colleague, Dr. Rock, could apply to many places such as in the Deputy's constituency.  We have done much civic engagement around there.  A mixture of public and private investment and measures within Housing for All such as land value sharing and urban development zones cannot be overstated in their importance, especially in urban areas where, unfortunately, there has been a tradition of speculation and land values being pushed upwards.  That level of public investment is absolutely vital in creating the type of mixed neighbourhoods and quality of community facilities.</p> <p>  In many cases the type of densification or density can be overstated.  Freiburg has been alluded to in Dr. FitzGerald's NESC report and in such places the densities are not that much higher than what we have been able to achieve in Dublin and other Irish cities.  It is about the quality of the neighbourhood and the design of those places.</p></speech>

However, the conflict between road users with limited space in our towns is an important question.  The next slot is for Sinn F&eacute;in.  I call Deputy &Oacute; Broin, who has seven minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#K00200"><p>I confirm that I am in Leinster House.  I thank the witnesses for the presentations.  I am a strong advocate of both compact growth and transport oriented development so I endorse a large portion of what has been said.  The real challenge, and Deputy McAuliffe's questions alluded to this, is the implementation.  My questions are directed to Dr. Rock and her team in the first instance, but other witnesses should feel free to speak if there is time to do so.  What are the best ways to achieve the outcomes we have discussed here?  That is our core problem.  For me, there appear to be three problems.  The first is policy-making.  Infrastructure investment and delivery are very fragmented, with two Departments and multiple agencies in transport and housing.  That is before one gets into the mix of public and private.  Are there models of best practice from other jurisdictions that find a better way of overcoming that fragmentation so that at both the policy-making and funding levels there is greater co-ordination and consistency?</p> <p>  Second, we have a major problem with transport infrastructure lag.  The final iteration of BusConnects is very positive, but it is still delayed over three years rather than the original first year.  Again, are there models from other jurisdictions of best practice where they are able to have both the residential development and the transport infrastructure, whether it is new developments or retrofitting existing developments, with greater density housing and more active transport infrastructure?</p> <p>  Third, I refer back to the issue of public support.  I get very concerned when I see the way some of this debate goes.  My view is that people are entitled to an opinion, even if I do not agree with it.  Rather than us ending up having an argument in which people are shouting at each other, we have to find a better way of participating earlier in the process to get the best possible outcomes.  Blackrock is interesting because there is probably a longer list of the unsuccessful projects for some of that street furniture infrastructure for active mobility transport.  We could also talk about Sandymount or Woodford Hill in Clondalkin, or Lucan's current transport plans.  From the work Dr. Rock has done, are there principles of participative planning that are not necessarily in the mainstream of our planning process which we might want to incorporate to ensure not only that we get a less conflictive process but a better outcome at the end?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.275" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lorraine D'Arcy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#K00400"><p>Yes, but I will step in, if that is okay.  I will take Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question and expand on it a little.  There are other models outside of the planning realm that we should consider, these being community development and sport, health and well-being, and some of the initiatives community groups have at local level.  We could look at how we can replicate the types of frameworks and structures they have through their network of local sports partnerships and so forth and use that for a bottom-up, community upwards approach.  We know that when it comes to individuals' behaviour they are mainly influenced from the top-down plus bottom-up.  Top-down policy is how we design our infrastructure and our bottom-up is individuals, families and decision-makers, and they are influenced by many things.  If we want to influence change, we must understand that.</p> <p>  Taking a step back from the reliance on our narratives regarding BusConnects and public transport infrastructure, which are vital and important parts of the jigsaw and transportation development is a part of that, we need to think about our all-day travel and needs. Most of our public transport infrastructure is fundamentally based on the commute because that is the data we have.  Traditionally, we have collected data on the commute and we have a bias towards that.  We have to think about how we get everywhere during the day and integrate those trips.  By learning more about local needs, what people want and how they spend their days, we can start from that point.</p> <p>  Our colleague, Mr. O'Connor, will come in here on policy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.276" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#K00500"><p>To follow up on that briefly, I emphasise not just policy but also something Dr. Rock emphasised in our paper which is the concept of multidisciplinarity.  All the evidence from successful traffic management schemes shows that one of the key ingredients is very good communication.  That is not something that is the forte of transport planners, planners and engineers, although it is something we certainly would deliver and teach in our programmes.  However, traditionally it is hard to build those types of teams within local authorities.</p><p>Here in Ireland, in places such as Westport, Waterford and Clonakilty, the really successful schemes were where teams worked together.  Indeed, we saw it in Blackrock, where the architecture, parks and engineering divisions worked very closely and had a plan in that regard.  Facilitating local authorities to work together in collaborative teams is key.</p></speech>

The approach to stakeholder engagement, although not perfect and generally taken in a highly restrictive time, was really open.  Those concerned learned as they went along.  Key was the ability to meet people on the ground face to face insofar as it could be done to hear about their needs and issues and adapt on the ground while going along.  That was unique.  There is a lot to be learned from that process.</p></speech>

My colleague Ms Harvey may be able to add more on this.  The approach we have taken is very much on a town-by-town basis, but it is a broad-brush collaboration, including the business stakeholders and town citizens.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about examples internationally.  Ms Harvey has very good examples that relate to Scotland and its holistic approach.  "Holistic" is a phrase that is really important.</p> <p>  The recent allocation of funding to towns by a variety of Departments is really valuable, but it does create a sense of dismemberment in that the sense of collaboration and strategic investment are sometimes lost in the more piecemeal approach.  My colleagues may wish to add to those comments.</p></speech>

For a successful mixed-use development to deliver on all the requirements, it involves leadership and the involvement of the public, private and non-profit sectors.  The second of the four key ingredients that we identified was an institutional element.  An example we found really interesting was from Nantes in France, where in 1979 a new public private partnership was put together involving the local authority, a transport company, chambers of commerce, banks and the NGO sector.  All have shares in the company.  It is majority-owned by the municipality.  It has responsibility for transport planning, land use and investment over the long run.  The collaboration for specific sites is institutionalised, and it has been successful.  It involves a seven-year timeframe.</p> <p>  The second lesson from France relates to the corridor contract idea.  When a new significant transport corridor, such as a tramway or quality bus corridor, is being planned, the institution that has been established enters contracts with landowners adjacent to the proposed route.  It involves a co-operative agreement whereby the public company commits to building, extending or renovating the transport line while, in reciprocation, the local landowners agree to densities, use, planning restrictions and objectives.  This ends speculation along the transport route.  It also allows the zoning and the uplift that comes from that to be managed to the mutual benefit of the transport company, residents and local landowners adjacent to the route.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we are out of time in this slot.  We will return to the point on collaboration because it is extremely important.  I will invite Ms Harvey to comment when we do so.  Since no one is indicating they wish to contribute in the Fine Gael slot, we will proceed to the Independent slot.  </p></speech>

I apologise; I am hopping between this meeting and a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine this afternoon.  That is how busy we are.  I have read all of the submissions.  It is a really exciting issue.  Before I ask anyone any questions, I would like to draw particular attention to a document commissioned by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  It is called Travelling in a Woman&rsquo;s Shoes and was delivered by the consultancy Arup.  In a week when we have seen so much about vulnerability and women and transport, it is a must read.  It is a very important document full of policy recommendations.  It focuses on women and safety, and talks about why they feel they cannot travel within their towns and communities, particularly when coming home from the cities they work in.  It also refers to issues around vulnerability.  It makes for awkward reading but is a real wake-up call with regard to planning.</p> <p>  When we talk about transport planning, we need to look at this issue and ask ourselves why this report has been sitting on desks since July 2020.  Again, it is called Travelling in a Woman&rsquo;s Shoes.  It is a call to action and I will circulate it in the next five or ten minutes.  It is something all of us should be mindful of when considering transport policy and why people do not opt to walk or cycle.  The report includes some very stark figures and qualitative research showing the reason that women in particular are using private cars to travel short distances, which is that it allows them to feel safe.  It is a real wake-up call for every one of us.</p> <p>  I will not deal with all of the submissions.  They were very comprehensive.  We had an opportunity to read them.  I will focus on just two.  I have a few questions for the Heritage Council and a few for Technological University Dublin.  I thank Ms Teehan from the Heritage Council for the comprehensive submission she made today and for the appendices that accompany it.  Within that submission, she talks about the establishment of a unit within Government to deliver the collaborative town centre health check programme nationally as part of the town centres first policy.  Will she touch on that?  I will put three or four questions to her before asking her to answer.</p> <p>  Ms Teehan is suggesting or recommending a national view.  She also mentions issues in respect of compulsory purchase orders and compulsory sale orders similar to those used in Denmark and Scotland.  Will she briefly tease out what differences there are between what is going on here and what is going on in Denmark and Scotland?  What have we not talked about or included in our policy plans in Ireland?</p> <p>  Ms Teehan also talked about the establishment of community development trusts and town and city development trusts.  It must be remembered that we have city and county plans and that the courts have found that these represent a contract with the people.  Citizens can have a legitimate expectation with regard to how we plan our cities under city and county development plans.  I am interested in hearing about Ms Teehan's own experiences and those of the Heritage Council with regard to town and city development trusts.</p> <p>  I will move on to my final questions to the Heritage Council.  I am quite excited by what I read about this Irish towns diaspora network.  There are real opportunities there.  It is something I have never really heard about before.  It is about how we can tap into the diaspora.  I know of a particular project in Kilcullen, County Kildare.  Someone who had gone away to the United States and been very successful decided to financially support two or three restoration projects because of their link, connection and family.  The person still has not come back to Ireland and does not intend to but was drawn back to a town they had lived in and felt they were in a privileged position to do something.  I like this idea but I do not know enough about it.</p> <p>  I will touch on TU Dublin.  I live out in Blackrock so I am particularly interested in its interpretation of the success of the works in Blackrock because it is a view I do not share.</p><p>They talk about change and bringing people with them.  I picked up from the TUD presentation issues around the executive and decision-making, but we must have democratic accountability and oversight of projects.  Citizens own their towns, villages and cities and want to be involved.  I am a former county councillor for Blackrock, without getting too parochial about this, and I did not feel included.  I shop there, walk there and go to the library there and I felt partially excluded.  I say that despite many of the councillors being my colleagues.  It depends who we are talking about.  While businesses might say one thing, residents might say a different thing, so it is always a matter of hearing the different perspectives and views.</p><p> We talk about transport governance.  Mention was made of an article in which it was said transport projects are ultimately political and require accountability and oversight.  I agree with that.  That is a very important part of our debate and our argument.  How will we bring in people?  Projects such as BusConnects have been referred to.  We do not need a history lesson in BusConnects to know that people felt left out-----</p></speech>

I am sure we will get time to broach those subjects, Senator Boyhan.  They are important.  I am just tied by time.  I ask Ms Teehan to address just the question about the Government's national unit dealing with collaborative town centre health checks.  We can come back to the other issues.  Is that okay, Senator Boyhan?</p></speech>

I will be brief because I realise Senator Boyhan is out of time.  We very much support the Heritage Council and the work that has been done on this pilot programme.  It is hugely important to the development of towns which are hollowed out right across the country, in both urban and rural areas.  The Heritage Council quite simply does not have the resources to roll this out nationally.  It makes sense that it is properly resourced but in the way in which it has been developed by the Heritage Council, which is holistic and collaborative and has the support of the business community, the citizens and the civic leaders in towns.  That is vital.  Ms Harvey will be happy to answer the Senator's other more detailed questions either in writing or, if there is time in the meeting, verbally.</p></speech>

There will be time at the end of the meeting.  We will get into a second round and we can come back to all those questions.  If every member turns up, I need to stick to seven-minute slots; if not everybody turns up, we can have longer.</p> <p>  I will take the fourth slot, which is a Green Party slot.  I will set a timer for myself to be fair.  I have a question for the NESC.  Is there enough integration and collaboration between the Departments with responsibility for transport and housing?  There is a budget of &euro;4 billion per annum for development of housing.  Do we see commensurate investment in public transport?  Is there enough collaboration between those two Departments to give leadership?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cathal FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#N00900"><p>When we did the analysis in 2019 we looked at the extent to which the policy set-up in Ireland was conducive to delivering transport-oriented development.  The elements we looked for, unsurprisingly, were the four we saw as being critical: the vision, the decision, the institution and the funding.  At that time, we reviewed the national planning framework, the national development plan and the regional spatial and economic strategies, which were in draft form at the time.  While we found that in the first instance the vision was present in that the national planning framework does set out an adequate vision for compact growth, sustainable mobility and having 40% of new homes within existing developments, there is an institutional issue.  We find that responsibility for transport planning, transport investment and housing development are separate.  They are complex areas and there are good reasons specialties are required across Departments.</p><p>Where TOD is undertaken, as opposed to everyday development throughout the country, more intense collaboration is required.  We find that having separate entities for investing in transport planning and housing is sub-optimal.  This is why we think that once a decision is taken to deliver transport-oriented development at a suitable location the institutions that support it are required very quickly afterwards.</p><p> This brings us to the next point on funding.  The typical funding models for Exchequer Vote and capital expenditure, noting that of the &euro;130 billion in the national development plan &euro;3 billion will be spent on transport this year, do not capture the uplift to allow building the infrastructure, services and green spaces that make these areas attractive in advance.  If we look at what we are planning now with the metro and quality bus corridors, do we have mechanisms in place in advance?  We put a thought experiment in our analysis.  If at each of the 16 stations along the metro route 1,000 homes got a typical uplift of &euro;114,000 from being proximate to the nodes the State is providing it would mean in excess of &euro;1.5 billion that could go to capital and operational expenditure, as happens with Transport for London.  It starts by having the vision in place, which we do, and quickly afterwards making a decision on the site having formal institutional co-ordination and, flowing from this, the ability to capture the uplift.  I would say that in 2019 we felt there was no institution to prevent a siloed approach.</p></speech>

Is there enough emphasis in local level planning to indicate clearly where the active travel routes should be?  There should be a clear indication as to where the active travel route should be and the desired location, wherever it might be.  Does this happen enough at local level?  We end up in conflict situations when we try to retrofit these active travel links through housing estates.  Perhaps Mr. O'Connor will answer this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.295" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#O00300"><p>I will begin.  Certainly it is taken account of but being in the local plan or the development plan does not mean it will be activated.  It is about placing emphasis on activating it and making it happen.  We certainly welcome the delivery of the active travel teams.  We go back to our point about public appointments and being able to bring in the right type of people, including community people and communications people to realise these things and make them happen.</p> <p>  I echo the points made by Dr. FitzGerald on the institutional framework and arrangement.  Where this has successfully happened has been in an agency-based approach.  Abbotstown was happening very well and there was very innovative design on walkability and permeability until, unfortunately, the economic collapse.  The Grangegorman agency will do similar work on permeability.  Dublin City Council has come in with filtered permeability mechanisms.  The points on multidisciplinary teams and flexible public appointments are key.  My colleague, Dr. Rock, will also comment on this.</p></speech>

They are real opportunities to engage the public on establishing a vision for an area.  This vision can include many things, one of which may be active travel.  There is a much greater opportunity to work very collaboratively with the public quite early and establish a much greater long-term vision for the area.  Collaborative planning is a very resource intensive task but is absolutely essential and critical to the success of schemes and projects.  It is very important to emphasise resources for it so that when it comes to delivering projects such as active travel they meet less resistance than they otherwise might.</p><p>There is an understanding that this is a vision that the local community has bought into as part of an holistic package.  It is not just about active travel; it is about understanding the many benefits and multifaceted elements of urban regeneration.  There are many facets to it and active travel is one but it is very important to the overall vision.</p></speech>

I will just make a comment before I move on.  A lot of what we are talking about here is actually climate action as well, insofar as it involves reducing emissions from transport and having the town close to work, close to recreation and close to schools.  Active travel, which Mr. Donovan mentioned, also brings about emissions reduction.</p> <p>  I will move on to the Social Democrats slot and call Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.</p></speech>

We have seen a lot of damage done in the past by really poor speculative rezonings outside of towns and urban centres.  I am thinking of leapfrog zonings with whole housing developments being built where there is no public transport infrastructure and where it is not feasible to provide such infrastructure for one particular development in a random field that should not have been zoned at that time anyway.  With the changes that have happened around planning in recent years, do the TU Dublin witnesses feel there are sufficient controls to ensure this is no longer a problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.300" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#P00400"><p>I may be able to take this question.  We refer to the five cities report which is obviously focused on the cities.  It points to what it calls Tier 1 strategic pillars, the first of which is the 15-minute city.  We could talk at length about that.  It is essentially about walkability and creating walkable neighbourhoods.  It also refers to delivering the national planning framework, NPF, which is enormously important.  There have been developments but for a period planning was very loose in this country and there were very limited controls on location assessment.  There is an enormous population that is very disconnected.  The NPF has made certain moves to address that and to stop it but counteracting it is going to take a long time.  There are significant vacuum effects of development.  It is going to be very difficult.  The Connecting Ireland strategy is going to be very important.  Increased investment in local links and in that strategy is crucial.  The importance of encouraging compact development in our villages, town and cities cannot be overstated.  That will not happen by way of the private market alone.  The private market has to be regulated.  There has to be public investment and schemes like Tosaigh and Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe will certainly be important in that regard.</p></speech>

Has it or anyone else analysed transport infrastructure funding and investment to see how well or otherwise it aligns with housing demand and projected population growth?  Sometimes it does not align.  It is spread geographically or politically around the country instead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.302" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cathal FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#P00600"><p>Section 2.5 of the report we published examines the funding mechanisms in place in 2019.  I will mention some developments since then.  The best thing we could say is that funding was not a barrier to TOD but in a way it is a bit like general funding for housing and other infrastructure.  The State must be active and take decisions, have specific priorities and follow them, sometimes ahead of population demand.   We looked at the national development plan, NDP, and the extent to which there were citable amounts of money in support of each of the national strategic objectives.  The NDP states that a mechanism will be put in place to allow the uplift in the investment to be used to fund some of the other ancillary services that are needed.  Land value sharing is now an option but I do not know if that is exactly the same as land value capture.  It may be more to do with rezoning as opposed to the actual investment and uplift we get from that.</p> <p>  One of the things we mentioned was that transport infrastructure funding, such as under the urban regeneration fund, should be separated out from having to compete against other worthy demands for funding, such as improving the public realm projects and so on.</p><p>They should have their own separate basket in seeking that funding for urban regeneration, which I know is important to the committee.  We made some suggestions on how existing funding could be targeted to support transport and compact growth but that there was also probably a need for more sophisticated mechanisms.  We listed 14 potentially new mechanisms that are used internationally in Japan, Germany and London, which we think could be progressed by the State in collaboration with private sector providers, those who provide patient capital etc.  These are listed in our report.  There is something there but  probably more needs to be done.</p></speech>

In his submission and opening statement he stated that we have to be careful that transport-oriented development does not become a Trojan horse to justify more roads.  Can he expand on that point please?</p></speech>

It is important, if we are developing new communities that we do not use these as a pretext to deliver more road infrastructure and that we think about what sort of communities those houses are going to be based around.  If we are building a community where we have aspirations that 70% to 80% of the trips will not be taken by car, why are we then providing road infrastructure to justify or pass through that development?  Part of the problem is that investment is realised when infrastructure is coming along, where it may be seen as an opportunity to fix some issues around a city but it is very important that we look at what is best practice in other countries.  If we are asking people not to live with a car or have a car-lite experience, that we do not then subject them to a high car environment.</p></speech>

Does the NESC wish to come back in on that question on transport-oriented and the development of roads?  This is more about public transport links than road links, which would be my understanding.</p></speech>

The example to be looked at in Freiburg was that before the first home was occupied in that development, the tramline was already in place in Rieselfeld.  In the overall development, within a couple of years of it having been opened, the bus had been replaced by a tram.  The central point is that the central axis of both of these transport-oriented developments is a tram route.  It is only then that one can start to look at dealing with cars, sprawl, parking and other issues that go alongside transport-oriented development.</p></speech>

I thank everyone for coming today and for speaking to us.  I have a couple of questions.  As was just outlined, we conducted a survey on sustainable transport in my constituency of Cork North-Central.  The survey found that 74% of people felt that it was not safe to cycle in our constituency.  It also found that 64% of people noticed that the cycle lanes ended abruptly and suddenly.</p> <p>  Two key issues arose from this and perhaps Mr. Donovan from the Cork Cycling Campaign might like to comment.  I first thank him and his associates for supporting the survey but I would like to ask him about the issue where Cork is divided.  There is a great difference between the northside and the southside in the number of cycle lanes, and there is a great discrepancy.  For anyone who wishes to cycle on the northside, where I am from, it feels that there is underinvestment and not enough funding being put in.  </p> <p>  The other important issue is on cycle lanes and routes.</p><p>What people are telling me is that they want to see specific cycle routes so that they can travel to work, school and college.  Mr. Donovan spoke earlier about fewer and fewer people using cycle lanes, especially young women and girls going to school, college or wherever.  What are he key factors in fixing these issues?  I will come back in if I have more time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.314" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conn Donovan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#R00200"><p>With regard to cycle lanes ending abruptly, part of the problem is that investment is handed out in a piecemeal fashion, so local authorities use that investment to deliver a small section.  There is probably an underappreciation of the fact that delivering a small cycle route is like sprinkling small flakes over a city.  It is not really going to give people an option to cycle across a city or from one trip destination to another.  We really need to move to a place to where we are thinking about routes, as the Deputy stated.  We need to have two trip destinations that people can travel between.  We must offer people a safe and quality service between those routes.  If there is a gap in that route, people are perhaps being exposed to a risk they may not be willing to take.  As Senator Boyhan noted, according to the TII Travelling in a Woman's Shoes report, cycling is the most deemed to be the most dangerous form of transport for women in Ireland.  We must, therefore, make routes high quality and inviting.  As we are spending a lot of public money on cycle and walking routes in the next few years, we really need to appreciate that we are spending that money for people who are in cars now.  We are not spending it for people who are cyclists or who like cycling; we are spending it to get people essentially out of cars and into cycle lanes, onto footpaths or into public transport with regard to BusConnects.  There needs to be an emphasis on quality and routes as opposed to lanes.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's second question, there has been massive underinvestment in the area north of Cork city.  It has happened for many reasons.  There were a lot of quick wins on the southside in terms of old tracks and rail routes that could be converted to greenways.  That is not the reason that it has continued to be so bad in recent years.  Looking at areas such as Blackpool, 2 km from the city centre, there is no safe cycle route even though a national road and two urban streets are running parallel.  It hits on the key point that we must ensure that cycling does not become a privilege of certain people, classes or genders in cities.  It should be for everyone.  Whether a person is aged eight or 80, he or she should have the option of moving round the city by bike.</p></speech>

It is such a well-connected and permeable part of the city.  I understand that there may be some reluctance to cycle because of the topography and the fact that there are some very steep places, but San Francisco has managed to run a very successful cycling programme where it has highlighted places for people to cycle, including relatively flat routes.  It is about looking at what is there and how it can be best optimised.  It is most important to link in with the traditional communities that are in the area.  A great study was done by UCC a number of years ago, which looked at fear of violent crime.  We focused on some of those north Cork city communities.  Coming back to some of our gender work, there was a history of association with violent crime that had happened previously.  The area had completely changed but people associated places with an event that happened because of the tradition of storytelling.  It happens all over the country.  This is where we need to engage with communities and find out where they feel safe, what they would like, what they can change and what can be done.  There is a lot of potential in that area and in urban communities generally.  Where the roads do not seem wide enough to put in a cycle lane or widened footpaths, it is where we should consider the filtered permeability and urban greenways.</p></speech>

As someone who lives in and represents the area, everything they said makes complete sense.  I have another question for the representatives of the TU Dublin.  The research they carried out in Blackrock sounds very interesting.  I know that we have very similar initiatives in Cork with on-street dining, pedestrianisation and improved public spaces.  Cork City Council has done a lot of work over the past two years during Covid.</p><p>The key issues that arose time and again were the accessibility to these spaces and areas by people who have limited mobility or disabilities, and the removal of disabled parking spaces because of these pedestrianised and on-street dining areas.  When the witnesses did their research, did they look at the consequences of the changes that were made in Blackrock and what effects they might have on people who are disabled and the accessibility for people in the Blackrock area?</p></speech>

Blackrock was quite limited in that regard, in that there were no changes to the amount of disabled parking spots that were there originally.  We were really only able to look at the things that changed rather than do an assessment of what was there before and if that was good enough.  We were looking more at the impact of change.  It certainly arose as a very important issue.  We noted what the council endeavoured to do, which was through our interviews.  We interviewed a number of different people including members of the public participation network and the disability consultation group.  Although things were not perfect, we found that there was an appreciation of the openness of the local authority to engage with them on those issues.  I am aware that there was some trial and error around the location of the disabled parking spots.  This is the absolute critical thing when we are looking at road space reallocation.  If we are looking at pedestrianised areas or shared street spaces we must prioritise, where possible, the disabled access parking spaces.  In addition, we looked at other aspects such as access to chemists and pharmacies where traditionally there would not have been a disabled access parking spot outside of those areas.  We noted that by moving some general parking spots it could reduce the accessibility to those types of users and people who would depend on them.  One of the solutions was the use of a set-down or a loading space that would allow people to access those spaces.  That was a very important part of it.  It is certainly something that we fed into the research and into the recommendations for that also.</p></speech>

I am aware that it is an important aspect.  At the very start of Covid mobility, there was a focus on making sure accessibility was maintained where we were losing it with tables and chairs.  We had to make sure we had footpath space left for people who needed that accessibility.</p></speech>

It has been hugely informative.  I will probably come at it from a slightly different angle.  I am looking at the issues in the context of a very rural and provincial town with a population of 10,000 to 14,000 people.  The great thing about those towns is that we have plenty of space in the towns.  Many of these towns, historically, have very large and wide streets.  We probably have a public that is averse to abandoning their cars and going into town centres.  I have two very specific questions, mainly for the witnesses from TU Dublin.  Perhaps they could deal with them for me.  One question relates to an aspect that we discussed at our last engagement.  I am still struggling to get a clear answer or a clear recommendation from the experts on which way we should be going.  It concerns provincial towns where retail is obviously in demise and there is a compelling argument that we should get people to move into these houses that were former shop units.  Yet, in all the time I have people coming into me looking for housing, I cannot get young couples and young families to put their hand up and say they want to live in a town centre, especially in rural Ireland.  They still want that garden and they want that house with the green area.  Can the witnesses point me to any place where we have looked at an alternative for those shop units?  I am referring in particular to continental Europe.  Is there some way to energise the units, be it through artists and artisans?</p><p>Have we looked at incentives and - dare I mention it? - tax schemes to cultivate that new alternative fledgling retail within those units?  That is one aspect.  The second one follows on from it.  Where we do active transport in these towns, we do it very well, but then it becomes almost like a sore.  It looks really good but it does not link in with anything else in the rest of the town.  Could the witnesses point me to some town with a population of between 10,000 and 14,000 where there is a really good workable example?  We have invested large sums in our greenways and all of that, which is laudable, but I do not think that gets to the kernel of getting people out and cycling.  I come from Longford and there are hundreds of people out cycling on the greenway every Saturday or Sunday but when I am running in the morning, I will see at most three or four people cycling to work.  We are not making that transition despite the massive investment in the greenways.  Perhaps the Cork Cycling Campaign may wish to come in on that point.  How can we cultivate that culture of getting people cycling in these provincial towns?</p></speech>

It was one of the first towns in Ireland to have a pedestrianised main street.  I am thankful that this is still doing well and that it has been treated very well by the local authority.  It is well pedestrianised.  When I grew up, it was a very walkable town.  Unfortunately, our towns have expanded.  People have moved further and further away, so this has become a very difficult challenge.  There is evidence from UK research suggesting that where main streets are regenerated and pedestrianised, retail sales can increase by up to 30% and that retail vacancy rates can decrease.  The Scotland's Towns Partnership evidence that the Heritage Council mentioned certainly fully supports the idea that, when done well, this can be good for business in the town centre.  Public realm improvements can lead to adjacent units doing well and can bring people back into the towns.</p> <p>  The two successes I will point to are ones I have mentioned.  The first is that of Clonakilty.  The Cork county architect, Ms Giulia Vallone, has been instrumental in bringing together a team and working with the planners, engineers and town executive team to regenerate those public spaces and beautiful squares there.  There was an awful lot of work to bring the community back in and to activate those spaces.  This included car-free days, street parties and the like.  Similarly, a very integrated approach was taken in Westport, County Mayo.  There was a plan and the architect, Mr. Simon Wall, worked together with a team of people who moved around the town bit by bit and bucked the trend.  </p> <p>  It is a cause for hope that, due to Covid, houses are being sold in many of these towns.  The real estate markets are doing very well and that is very encouraging to see.  It is one of the few good things to come out of Covid.</p></speech>

The Dutch are talking about consolidating their town centres, that is, making them strong and shrinking the amount of zoning on the edge to push activity back into the town centres.  At that stage, we were talking about small town vacancy rates of 24% for ground floor retail while the Dutch were at 6.8%.  We were listening very intently to what they were telling us about what they are doing.  The Netherlands is very strong on what to do with small town centres.</p> <p>  We have published research on meanwhile use.  This aims to show the steps that can be used to get out of dereliction and vacancy.  You really want to establish your baselines at the very start.  That is very important for public spend as it allows you to show the impact and the outcomes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.327" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lorraine D'Arcy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#U00100"><p>A point was made about getting younger people to live in town centres.  Mr. Chris Leinberger in New York conducted research on where people wanted to live.  He found there was an association between television programmes and where people wanted to live.  For example, in the 1960s and 1970s people watched &ldquo;I Love Lucy" and they wanted to live in the suburbs.  In the 1990s, people watched &ldquo;Seinfeld" and "Friends" and they wanted to live in urban areas.  In Ireland, the soaps tell us that if we live in an urban area, it is full of crime and you will get murdered, and the association is made that it is a lovely thing to live in the countryside.  There are cultural aspects to whether people want to live in certain places.  We must highlight to people that the cost of living is lower if they live in these areas because they will have reduced their transport costs.  Sometimes that fact does not communicate well when people are getting a free site from a parent, building in the community and can have a big house in the long term.  There is a narrative there needs to be considered.  As I said earlier, we have a top-down policy, but we the bottom-up that we need to understand.</p> <p>  A request was made for an example of where a greenway is linked to urban areas and I think west Limerick is doing that really well at the moment.  A recreational greenway has existed for many years, but following investment, awareness of the greenway has been heightened among communities.  In particular, in Newcastle West, where there has been some public realm works done over recent years, there is now a great linkage that brings the greenway to the town and an increasing number of children now cycle the greenway every day to get to school etc.  This is what is really important.  I understand that greenways came about because the investment was justified by tourism data because that was the only sector that had data at the time.  We now need to see the transportation value and we need more research in that area to capture that data, as Ms Harvey has mentioned.</p></speech>

I tried to balance two meetings but did so very badly so missed all of the first hour.  I apologise to the witnesses, therefore, if what I ask them has been covered already.</p> <p>  As the focus of this session is urban regeneration and I have a particular interest in transport, I would like to hear from the witnesses whether they agree - if they disagree with me, that is fair enough - that transport policies and choices are inextricably linked to urban regeneration or, indeed, the failure of urban regeneration.  I hope they will agree with me but I want what I have asked about to come out of this session.</p> <p>  We had a very interesting session of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action in which we had participation by officials from the Departments of Transport and other Departments.  The witnesses present will probably be disappointed to hear that those officials expect an increase in the number of cars on our roads and streets by 2030.  Notwithstanding the expected shift to public transport and active travel, according to the Department officials we are still going to have more vehicles in 2030.  I believe that that view should challenge all of us.  If we are trying to create liveable villages, towns and cities and breathe life into rural Ireland by making villages and towns viable, we are not going to succeed if these places are clogged with cars.  Therefore, a discussion on how to use public space is critical and we need to make a lot of noise about how problematic the growth in the number of vehicles would be.</p> <p>  Recently, I was overseas in Rome and saw that quite a lot of the vehicles there are, by necessity, very small and light.  You do not see that in other cities.  We see a trend of increasing size and weight of vehicles.  If we must have cars in urban areas, then insofar as possible they should be as small and as light as possible so that we can make the best use of urban spaces.  I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on that and I ask them to shed some light on the practice across the world in the area of light vehicle policy.</p><p>I would say that Mr. Donovan will agree with me that the best light vehicle is a bike.  I think that we need to do a hell of a lot more to make cycling attractive, viable and safe for everybody.</p><p> The witnesses have addressed the issue of road space reallocation, which is critical.  One of the criticisms of the BusConnects programme is that it does not talk about the reallocation of road space rather then the finding of new space for buses.  I think we must move away from that policy.  We need to recognise that the car is the lowest in the hierarchy of road users, and rightly so.  The car is very energy-inefficient and it is a space-inefficient mode of transport.  Every decision we take at a policy level needs to recognise that.</p><p> Is the national planning framework fit for purpose?  The framework allows for 50% of all new developments to be located outside of urban areas and I think that undermines towns and villages.  While I acknowledge that the percentage is a step in the right direction, the framework is up for review in 2024 and it needs to be seriously reviewed if it is to take us to where we need to get.</p></speech>

The big decisions on cities, towns, villages and across Ireland generally are made at the executive level of local authorities but I think there is a dearth of transport planning expertise and knowledge, and there is a dearth of expertise in urban design.  In Limerick, we have made some very good strides recently and brought in some very good people, which I think will change things but Limerick is probably the exception.  Have we enough expertise at a senior level?  It is important that we have such understanding at director level.  Have we got that knowledge across all of society?  It is not just in local authorities that that is important.  We need that understanding across the Civil Service and across society in general.  There probably is not enough time for the witnesses to answer my questions but I ask them to do their best and all of them can respond.</p></speech>

Dr. FitzGerald raised his hand to notify us that he wants to respond to the question on transport policy and choices.  I will allow him to reply and we might be able to return to the other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.334" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cathal FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#V00500"><p>I will first respond to the point made about regeneration and then the point about expertise.  With transport-orientated development, there is a tendency to see all of these locations as being large-scale or massive sites like former military air sites, etc.  They have regeneration at their core and they have done since the concept was developed in the 1900s with the idea of garden cities.  Montpellier provides us with a good example of regeneration that was planned in terms of layout, routes, safety and lighting.  These things have recently become most important.  The amenities are built to serve the community.  This is a mixed use brownfield site that includes colleges and industrial sites.  By having the vision, decision and a dedicated institution they were able to take a 36 ha site that was run down with factories and turn it into mixed living, offices, regional government headquarters and create a swimming pool, etc.  There are 50% private market homes and 50% social and affordable homes.  There is a tendency to think of these large-scale sites as being a blank canvas and a greenfield site somewhere on the outskirts of a town but we should not look beyond the regeneration capacity of transport-orientated development.  We should not lose sight of the fact that the Land Development Agency, LDA, was established as a regeneration agency as well as a development agency.</p> <p>  In our NESC report of November 2020 on housing actions, we spoke about expertise within local authorities and the need for specialist teams, possibly within the LDA, to support local authorities that must engage on an irregular basis on massive planning or compulsory purchase order, CPO, which means that the expertise at senior levels is not there.  So why do we not have teams that can master plan a  CPO, who are specialists in it and are available to local authorities to undertake that work?</p></speech>

The first town we completed the baseline for was Tralee.  The rate for that town was 24%.  I am referring to ground-floor retail.  The target in Europe is 5%, and the proper range from 5% to 11%.  I started a programme with no funding in the first year, basically because people kept coming to the Heritage Council to ask me for help.</p> <p>  On land use and transportation strategies, it is so important we look at what we have already and how land is being utilised or wasted.  On the vacancy rate, one town with a massive road going through its centre had a ground-floor vacancy rate of 31%, which is unheard of.  We really need to use the data wisely and target the vacancy rates we need to have.  We should not be above 11%.  Our rate is quite embarrassing at meetings with people from the Netherlands, Scotland and elsewhere.  There is land already available.  It is a matter of how we use the existing stock.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.336" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sarah Rock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#W00400"><p>I reiterate our point.  Urban regeneration is multifaceted but transport plays a very important role in it.  We absolutely share that view.  If we approach it in the wrong way, we essentially kill a town.  If we approach it correctly and make it about people, we can bring life to a town.  Part of the reason for the death of many towns in recent decades is that we focused on road-based transport.  We might have ploughed a national road through the heart of a town.  The approach taken is intrinsically linked to the vitality of a town.</p> <p>  On large vehicles and the trend towards having them, we share the view that large vehicles are completely unsuited to urban locations.  They are very dangerous.  Children cannot be seen around them.  They are unfit for open roads.  We absolutely support a move away from large vehicles and SUVs in general, which result in so many other problems.</p> <p>  Regarding the multidisciplinarity of senior level decision-making, it is essential there be more diversity and knowledge in higher level decision-making in local authorities with a view to understanding and valuing the importance of urban design and transport and all the other elements that come together to shape and inform urban regeneration.</p></speech>

I will be much more strategic with my seven minutes.  I will focus on TU Dublin.  It was said that transport projects are ultimately political and require accountability and oversight.  I agree with that.  BusConnects and such projects, rational as we may believe them to be, need to be both challenging and championed politically.  Those are two profound statements.  I want the delegates to comment on them.  Before they do so, I will make two other points.</p> <p>  The delegates referred in their submissions to a Dublin transport advisory council and giving it limited executive powers.  I am interested in reserve functions and the importance of our city and county councillors, who are democratically elected.  I like to see equal weighting.  Deputy Leddin talked about councils being led by the executive, but we have elected city and county councillors.  They have a really important role, have their finger on the pulse and are very close to the citizen.  That is one of the great things about local government in Ireland.  That is an important point.  The delegates might refer to the Dublin Transport Authority Advisory council.  They talked about the legislation being in place and would like to see it rolled out.</p> <p>  The TU Dublin delegates talked about regulations concerning messaging and imagery in the car advertising sector.  They made a comparison with the advertising standards for alcohol and gambling in Ireland.  That is interesting.</p><p>Those are three questions I would like the witnesses to tease out with me in some detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.339" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#X00200"><p>I will start addressing the questions raised by the Senator.  I thank him for raising them and reading our report in detail.  The matters raised were in our additional material.</p> <p>  On BusConnects, we believe it is not only rational but also essential to have interconnectivity.  It is about making the entire city more accessible to everyone.  It is about a network that is always available and accessible to everyone.  Building it up will take time but it is important.  It has been very controversial, however.  There were 70,000 submissions, which is phenomenal.  This is unprecedented in planning.  These are matters we watch and get involved in.  Perhaps the number of submissions is a barometer of how important the matter is and how people want to engage with their own neighbourhoods and city.  The proposal is really to address the issue of accountability.  That is not to say anything about the NTA and the project itself, which we believe are good; it is a matter of proceeding with projects of the kind in question and giving people a say.</p> <p>  We have mentioned the Dublin Transport Authority Advisory Council.  It actually exists in legislation but it is a very diverse body.  It includes representatives from businesses, communities, the Garda, disability groups, elected representatives and executive services.  It is wide in scope.  It is typical of many metropolitan transport authorities in America and Transport for London.  The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 states it should, and can, be established, but it does not vest any powers in it.  It could be given a nominal power to vote on the transport strategy.  At least it would be a forum for this type of debate, but involving councillors, communities and businesses.  If the debate takes place upfront, projects might become a bit more acceptable.  That is why it is worth proposing.</p> <p>  On advertising, we are aware that the French have introduced legislation to do exactly what has been alluded to, just because the imagery is so incredibly powerful and disconnected.  The biggest spend by most of us will be on a car.  We are aware that 80% of all trips made by Irish people when they step outside their doors are by car.  There is a huge level of car dependency.  Most people, when asked, say they would prefer something different, such as a walk in the neighbourhood or cleaner air, but the messaging is very powerful.  Perhaps it can be done in a different way.</p></speech>

One of them was on imagery.</p></speech>

Car advertisements on our television screens show large cars moving freely through an environment with no traffic or congestion, and no other road users.  It is about getting there faster.  It is all very sexy.  A lifestyle is being sold but it does not reflect the reality.</p> <p>  We have had a huge increase in the number of SUVs and larger vehicles recently.  If we are to be climate conscious and conscious about the amount of energy powering cars, be it electric or based on fossil fuels, why do we need two tonnes of vehicle to be moved to buy a pint of milk?  Is that energy efficient?</p> <p>  We must also consider sedentary behaviour and the influence it is having on our physical activity levels as a nation.  A total of 11% of all premature mortality in Ireland is caused by physical inactivity.  We have a sedentary population and an obesity problem.  It is not just about our body mass but also about our concentration, cognitive ability, physical and mental health, and community health.  It is particularly the case with community health.  A lack of social cohesion and loneliness are estimated to comprise an even bigger killer than smoking.  When we leave our houses and get into our cars, we do not meet anybody else.  We get out of the car at the opposite end of our journey.  However, if we walk, cycle or take public transport, we meet our neighbours and are more connected to our community, and therefore we have greater health and wellness.</p><p>This is backed up both in Ireland and internationally by our statistics.  In regard to big vehicles, high fronted vehicles are far more dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.  If people are hit by an older, lower fronted car, their legs are hit and they are tipped onto the bonnet.  Their core body did not take the impact.  However, if hit by an SUV, a jeep or any larger car, the entire body takes the impact and they are much more likely to die even if hit at a lower speed.  These are things we must consider.  Mindful guidelines must be given around advertising in the same way as was done with other public health issues.</p></speech>

Often, how the marketers wish the car to be seen when advertising it is not the way many of us vulnerable road users view those vehicles as they come behind or beside us.  Ask a seven-year-old child walking along the street how he or she views a large SUV on the road.  I want to bring this back because what we are looking at is developing how to bring living and light back into the towns.  It is not just about transport.  If someone does not feel safe on a street, or if a street is not a nice place to step out to from your residence, it is not going to be somewhere you will want to live.  It will be hard to sell the idea that streets have to be safe and inviting.  That includes the public realm, walkability and safe walking routes.</p></speech>

The discussion is genuinely very interesting.  I have two quick comments to contribute to the discussion and then a round-the-houses question for each of the contributors.  While not discounting the importance of advertising, particularly in respect of people's lifestyles, when it comes to people's decisions about where they live, price, size and comfort are absolutely key.  One of the biggest difficulties with suburban sprawl or one-off rural houses is that it is often far cheaper to get a much larger quality home.  Dr. D'Arcy is absolutely right that people do not necessarily think about other costs at the point of purchase, such as transport.  This relates not just to Dublin and Cork cities.  I talk to many people in mid-sized regional towns where the cost of purchasing a second-hand or new house in the urban core is now very expensive.  There is a real challenge in that if we want to incentivise compact growth, we have to make it affordable for people.  There were some interesting figures recently which show, notwithstanding the national planning framework, the vast majority of new homes that have been built are still being built on the wrong side of the M50 in the commuter belt and not in the inner core of Dublin.  Affordability is, therefore, absolutely key.</p> <p>  In regard to Bus Connects, Mr. O'Connor highlighted a good point in that 70,000 submissions is a sign of success.  What is most important about that consultation is that the NTA changed the nature of the consultation in response to the public engagement.  It was meant to be single round, but it became two.  There was meant to be one version; there were three.  The NTA is in fact still engaging with people.  It had a meeting recently with interested parties in Lucan to look at the initial reaction to the first phase of the C-spine and potential gaps.  That is an example of where there is top-down infrastructural development of significant change there is real merit in that process.</p><p>That can be combined with what Dr. D'Arcy and Dr. Rock spoke of earlier, which is getting out early and adopting a grassroots, bottom-up approach to get some valuable things.  We need to talk in more detail about how we improve that public participation and consultation, because there are far more examples of how this stuff does not work well, than does.  I ask contributors, not only in response to my question but generally, to share with us the experience they have, because that would be useful.  I was quite taken by Dr. FitzGerald's comments around the institutionalising of the participation.  Again I go back to the fact that there are two Departments, 31 local authorities, and a range of other development models.  Let us keep in mind we are producing a report, hopefully, with some recommendations to Government.  If there were one or two priority changes that they would like to see at central or local government level that our contributors think should be considered in our report on foot of these three hearings, what would they like us to recommend?  They are probably getting the sense that most of us sitting throughout the entire meeting are in a similar space to all of them.  What are the key recommended changes they would like to see beyond their submissions?</p></speech>

That was going to be my wrap-up question for all the witnesses but we will deal with it now, although they have to spend less than two minutes on answering that question when the temptation is to spend much longer on that.  I will start with the Heritage Council and the same order as we invited opening submissions.</p></speech>

That is why we are taking the time to work with these people and set up the projects.  That is probably why we have such a long waiting list of more than 45 towns.  To move that forward, in the 2019 Town Centre First policy we recommended that we need to scale up that CTCHC programme so that everybody can work together in collaboration and get the stuff done that needs to be done.  As I said earlier, the vacancy rates at the moment are really high.</p> <p>  The second thing is to look at Scotland's Towns Partnership to see whether a model like that would be useful in Ireland.  Certainly they have been very good in supporting what we are trying to do with the CTCHC programme.  The programme that we run was set up at the start because the private sector came to us and asked would we help.  In my professional opinion regeneration cannot be done alone by the public authorities.  It has to have the private sector.  We have to bring them in.  We need to look at ways to do that efficiently and effectively.</p></speech>

These are important questions.  I will give this slot a bit longer so if everybody can answer the question in around two minutes each, that would be helpful.  I now call TU Dublin for its two major recommendations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lorraine D'Arcy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#Z00500"><p>I will cover the first recommendation and Mr. O'Connor will take the second.  On the first one, we need to have a real conversation about the lifelong costs of where we live and the influences on those decisions.  Frequently our first home, and this is compounded by the grants that are given for first-time buyers, is a suburban home.  It ticks the boxes, we think we want the three-bedroom semi-detached but we do not talk about how we will end up sitting in the car all weekend dropping children to sports clubs because where we bought that house is on the periphery of the city or out in the countryside and we are not close to amenities.  We think of the immediate bricks and mortar, and not about how that serves us in the long term.  If we found ourselves with a physical impairment and inability to drive we would be isolated in that place.  Studies I did ten years ago found that people who lived in the newer suburbs spent significantly more on transportation costs, spent less time at home, and had higher education levels and higher salary costs, moreso than everybody else.  People who lived in deprived neighbourhoods in the suburbs were spending more than &euro;10 per week more on transport fuel than their counterparts in the urban deprived areas in the more traditional sense.</p><p>They were also earning nearly more than &euro;16,000 per annum than them in the first place.  We need to have a real conversation about the lifetime costs.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connor may have additional information to add.  The most critical point we would raise from our statement that would support a really open or different culture of collaboration, particularly at the local authority level, which is the coalface of where these sorts of changes happen, would be that flexible public recruitment process that would value interdisciplinarity.  In a practical example, at the moment, if one is working on a significant project, one can advertise for an engineer, a planner or an architect, but yet these people may not necessarily have the skills in public engagement.  It is a very particular skill set we currently try to address in some level in our programmes in TU Dublin, although traditionally it is not part of their education.  We need to bring in specialists, people who understand how to engage with stakeholders, to get the absolute best out of them.  That would probably be the key recommendation I would take from that.</p> <p>  Does Mr. O'Connor wish to add anything to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.355" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#AA00400"><p>I will add a third point based on the discussion we just had, and that is simply to refer to the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland and ask it to review advertising for private motor vehicles in the context of the Government declaration of a climate emergency and public health - simply that.  On the points Dr. Rock made, we have seen examples of public appointments for active travel teams, which have to be multidisciplinary, that have all come from a single discipline.  It does not matter what the discipline is; they have to be diverse teams and have to take account of less traditional, maybe degree, qualification and experiential backgrounds to build successful teams.  It is not just I but everybody here who has pointed out that success nearly always come from that type of integration and multidisciplinary working.</p></speech>

There is a massive need in Ireland to market these campaigns and to sell them to people and change the narrative.  We are spending almost &euro;1 million a day on these projects, but I often do not see money that actually sells the message of why we need them.  Compared with the UK, Manchester and London both have cycling commissioners, and they are people who have great skill sets and are very senior, perhaps almost to the level of a Deputy, who can go on the media, visit communities and market those campaigns.  Perhaps one of the reasons we have stronger and stronger bike advocacy groups around the country is that there is probably a lack of leadership, and those groups are forming and going into an empty vacuum to promote projects.</p> <p>  It is a huge honour for me to be here today, but I am primary school teacher.  I go back to senior infants tomorrow.  There should be someone on the radio tomorrow in Cork selling the message of why we need active travel, why we need to take road space away and the challenges we are facing regarding public health and climate action.  Cycling commissioners for each of our regional cities who can sell the message the schemes would be very important.</p></speech>

All of the case studies we looked at without exception had social and affordable housing at their core.  That said, with housing development and supply, in particular, affordability has to be engineered in.</p> <p>  That brings me to the two recommendations from the council.  The first one would be a cost rental scheme at scale - a national scheme beyond pilots - with modest supply-side subsidies in terms of the land or through finance.  It would be a useful existing mechanism at scale.</p> <p>  The second recommendation would be policy innovation around new off-balance sheet financial instruments.</p><p>Patient capital and finance could come in in advance of development and we could use our ingenuity and innovation to work within balance sheet and fiscal rules.  </p><p> One recommendation uses the mechanisms we already have in cost rental and the other is some policy innovation around patient finance off-balance sheet.  They would be the two I would go for, otherwise there is no guarantee that the supply would be transport orientated or affordable.</p></speech>

Those themes would encompass much of what has just been recommended.</p> <p>  It is my slot for questions now.  Mr. Donovan gave the example of the Merwede district in Utrecht and said they planned that cycling infrastructure with several decades of investment.  Ireland, on the other hand, spent several decades planning for cars.  That is why we have such a car culture and urban sprawl.  It was planned and that was the way it was naturally going to follow.  How do we, with urgency, bring about behavioural change and the change the climate requires?   How are we going to develop sustainably as well?  How do we bring that in quickly?  We do not have decades, like the Utrecht model, to reverse this.  How do we do it quickly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.361" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conn Donovan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#BB00300"><p>There may be a misconception in Ireland that people in the Netherlands cycle because it is flat or the weather is conducive to cycling.  The reality is that much money and much time was spent promoting cycling and active travel.  Meanwhile, perhaps the opposite happened in Ireland.  For every car that was on the road in Ireland in 1990, there are now three.  Nobody asked us about that.  There was not any policy position taken, but that has happened.  We need to play catch-up very quickly.  In our cities and in some of our towns, we need to get the modal share targets that our European colleagues have now in about eight to ten years if we are going to hit any of our climate change targets.  Big projects are slow and take a lot of time.  They can get stuck in planning and there can be planning paralysis.  We need to look at many pieces of the puzzle and see what places we can slot in more quickly.  </p> <p>  Dr. D'Arcy mentioned things such as permeable streets and filtered permeability.  Things like that can be done very quickly.  We saw for Covid how quickly things can be deployed.  Low-hanging fruit such as 30 km/h zones are very quick interventions that do not take much time or millions of euros of investment or long planning yet can produce results.  </p> <p>  We need to look at perhaps 15 solutions and categories in terms of how long they will take, and do the quickest ones today.  There is no reason there is not a 30 km/h zone in the vast majority of Irish urban areas.  The way we are doing it at the moment seems to be street by street.  If we continue that way, it will take decades.  The vast majority of people in Europe who live in towns and cities live in 30 km/h zones.  It is frightening to cycle on a road where there is no cycle provision when a car passes you doing double or sometimes even triple your speed.  </p> <p>  There are many solutions.  We need to look at the ones that will bring results quickly, but we also need to look at ones that will take longer.</p></speech>

We spoke to people about what would help them to make those changes.  There are great Bike Life studies being done at the moment.  We worked on a European project called DIAMOND where one of our topics was around surveys on gender and bicycle sharing.  One of our key findings was that women of low or no income said bicycle sharing gave them one of the greatest opportunities, because for &euro;20 per year they had access to the equivalent of a Dublinbikes or city bikes.  They asked for more child seats or cargo bike options.  They said they could not afford to buy a car or bicycle.</p> <p>  The bike to work scheme is great but it is incentivised in a way that the more someone earns, the better the discount they get.  We are not reaching everyone in society and we do not reach our students.  We have to look at people's life change stages and talk to them about how we can get them on bikes.  We need to make it safer for people who are reluctant to cycle because they have a child.  How can we get someone who moves to a new city on a bike?   We have to think about those behavioural issues and individual concerns as well as the infrastructure.  As I said, urban greenways and filter permeability are some of the quickest, easiest and cheapest things we can do.</p></speech>

It is always contentious when this is discussed at council level.  Local businesses always say they will lose business because people cannot park outside the business they want to go to.  I know TU Dublin has done a study on Blackrock and from what I have read, it indicates an increase in footfall and probably an increase in economic activity where a change is made.  This was again distorted by Covid-19.  Do we have any really good research from before Covid-19 that takes in where we have given over that road space allocation and prioritised pedestrianisation and where local businesses have benefited rather than lost out from the loss of car parking spaces?</p> <p>  It is an argument we see time and again at council level and councillors often give in to that lobbying, not taking the difficult decision that would probably after six months of a trial show as beneficial.  Where have we really good examples of this in Ireland or Europe?  I would prefer an Irish example.</p></speech>

That started with the collaborative town centre health check, CTCHC, programme we did a few years ago and those relationships continued.  During Covid-19, the engineers met the people from the chamber on a regular basis to ensure they were happy in terms of space and widening of pavements etc.  Tralee has really jumped in with help from Kerry County Council and the chamber.  It is definitely worth a look.  The vacancy rate we discovered when we did the baseline was 24%, which was very high, so those networks that were created are really important.  This goes back to what we said about participation and a collaborative approach.</p></speech>

It involved Oliver Plunkett St. in Cork.  We worked on surveys in the area and spoke to many shopkeepers who shared those concerns.  They were really worried about that.  We did much engagement and when pedestrianisation was introduced, there was an initial drop in footfall but four years later, it won European street of the year.  There is a phase in behaviour change; generally there is an initial drop-off and then we find there is an increase in time when people become more familiar with the change and the street becomes a destination to be enjoyed.</p> <p>  We have not traditionally done evaluations in Ireland.  We have anecdotally great examples, including Tralee and other places all around the country where we can find people speaking locally about them.  We have not been formally evaluating them and this is a real strength of the project in Blackrock, where we have done such an evaluation.</p> <p>  In the Cork project and numerous places, I have noticed shopkeeper concerns about parking spaces outside their shops but we have found, more often than not, the shopkeepers themselves are parking in those spaces.  We must be aware of that.  Thinking about people's behaviour we must also understand that people fear change.  We must understand their concerns.  They might not want to say they have nowhere to park their cars so we must work with them and allow them to outline their concerns.</p></speech>

I was sort of trying to highlight the CTCHC project we did in 2017.  A few months later, Tralee won an award as the most enterprising town in Ireland as well.  As I said at the start, we are trying to create social capital and empower people, ensuring they can hear each other and start to listen.  Tralee is definitely a good example.</p></speech>

In adding to Dr. D'Arcy's point, we hope that in the miscellaneous provisions legislation we will soon introduce the experimental traffic orders regulation, which will be critical in enabling local authorities to do those trials without fear of ending up in the High Court.  That will be really important.</p> <p>  On the same point, I have spoken with a senior planner in Utrecht in the Netherlands.  He said that even in the Netherlands they always had difficulty persuading businesses to change a street, remove parking, introduce cycle lanes, widen footpaths or whatever it might be.  In that country they have a compensation package and if the business can demonstrate that it has been affected by the change to the public realm, it can be compensated.  The evidence is they never have to pay out because 98% of the time the businesses do better when the work is done.</p> <p>  I go back to a question I asked previously but I did not leave the witnesses with enough time to answer.  That question relates to the national planning framework and I direct it to the witnesses from NESC and TU Dublin.  Will they comment on the national planning framework and whether it is fit for purpose?  Would they like to see a substantial review of it in 2024?  As I said earlier, my concern is that it allows for much development outside our urban settlements, thus diminishing the potential of our towns and villages.</p></speech>

In setting this out there are statements around compact growth, use of brownfield sites and sustainable mobility objectives.  I suppose that although it is on a statutory basis and legislative footing etc., we are expecting it to sit on the top of a hierarchy of plans, with its vision flowing down through the myriad of plans below it at regional assembly level and with the National Transport Authority plans for the greater Dublin area, as well as local authorities.  It is probably not enough in terms of actual implementation.  We must go to the lower-level plans to see the extent to which they set out where a transport-oriented development will be, what the density and mix will be, for example, or how this is to be funded.  Rather than making a criticism of the national planning framework, this is a comment on the extent to which it relies on a hierarchical trickle of authority into those other plans.</p> <p>  An important finding is that there should be a good and fair assessment of what is compact growth on new greenfield or brownfield sites.  We should consider whether brownfield sites fit the definition.  The council in its most recent report has said we must look again at how we assess, designate and monitor sites to ensure the targets within the national planning framework are being complied with.</p></speech>

The target is 50% each for greenfield and brownfield development.  My sense is we would probably be doing well to achieve 50% brownfield development.  It is also important to consider the type of greenfield development.</p><p>The greenfield also can be more or less compact.  One can try to get more compact, good, new urban development that is well linked with public transport, walking, cycling and so forth.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.379" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#EE00200"><p>I can come in here with a few points to endorse what has been said.  It would be a good idea to review the targets.  When the national planning framework, NPF, was released, the targets seemed ambitious.  I thought many of them were simply unachievable, especially for the more rural towns and villages.  I thought we would never do that because we would never have, first, that type of public investment and, second, what was being called for, which was more or less a migration back to these smaller towns.  Covid has proved us all wrong on that and that has been very welcome.  Let us review the targets, even if it is 40% in cities and 50% outside urban areas.  A lot of that is in smaller towns and villages.  If it is reviewed, importantly, it must be tied into those provisions within Housing for All we have mentioned, particularly the land value capture and the urban development zones, and the public investment through Project Tosaigh and the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund to activate those sites that otherwise will not be activated and to regenerate the public spaces to make the towns more attractive so people will want to go there.  It should be tied into Housing for All and we should make sure to hot-wire that public investment, because otherwise it simply will not happen.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has alluded to the fact the issue of compact development is really an issue of affordability.  There are some interesting studies by Professor Patrick Le Gal&egrave;s.  As people become higher income and more middle class, they start to move out, but as they become higher income again and upper middle class, they start to move back in.  People do not want to move away.  They want to move in and live with other people, but it is simply a question of affordability.  Affordable housing, and activating it through the Land Development Agency and helping local authorities to deliver housing where it is needed, is going to be key.  Then, if we are developing the smaller rural towns and villages, it is to connect these places.  It is almost like regional BusConnects type programmes.  The connecting Ireland strategy is very important there as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.381" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alison Harvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#EE00400"><p>Yes, I will add a few points.  We need a data driven system.  We have to examine that.  The OECD has made recommendations in an interesting report in 2019 on a data-driven public sector and the pathway to a data-driven public sector in Ireland.  That is very important.  Ms Teehan and I have stressed that the programme we have set up is data driven and that creates public value in itself.  It also leads to the democratisation of data, which is also important.</p> <p>  I wish to highlight the upper floors of the town centres.  The vacancy levels we are looking at are 80% plus.  The vacancy rates I gave the committee related to commercial, ground-floor retail.  There is a lot of potential there.  The problem is we do not have the data and we do not know the buildings' condition, so we need to get stuck into that if we are going to reuse and target our town centres.  In addition, we would need a national enabling policy to free up how we do infill, try to pay to do up the traditional front of the building and deal with the conservation deficit in the financial model.</p></speech>

Society is about the car instead of it being about walking, cycling and using public transport.</p><p>Mr. Donovan mentioned what we need to do to change that.  Perhaps he will comment a little more on that.  Also, Dr. D'Arcy spoke about access to bicycles.  She referred to the bike to work scheme being a great scheme for people who have decent jobs and wages.  She also mentioned having a shared bicycle scheme, trying to get access to bicycles for more people, and making it cheaper and easier to access.  Is there an example she would suggest in that regard?</p><p> With regard to the Heritage Council, the town health checks is an excellent idea.  It is very positive.  Does it work in an urban setting?  My constituency of Cork North-Central includes Blackpool and Shannon Street.  Blackpool is a village within a city.  It has great heritage dating back hundreds of years.  However, it has been neglected over the years, resulting in dereliction, vacancy and no investment in cycle lanes or green spaces and public parks.  Looking at what happened in Blackrock, I would love to see something similar happening in Blackpool.</p><p> Ms Harvey spoke about vacancy.  There is a report released today which says there are 90,100 vacant properties at present.  In Cork, there are 8,880 between the city and county.  These are a blight on the communities, and if we are going to make communities good places to live and have a good public realm, the issue of vacancy and dereliction must be tackled.  Otherwise, these will not be communities in which people will want to live.</p></speech>

Much of the public awareness is about new cycle routes and new projects that encourage walking and cycling.  What we probably need in each of the regional cities and in Dublin is a cycling strategy that sets out where we are going over the next five, six or seven years.  It is not just the cycling network but things such as public bike share schemes, the maintenance of cycle paths and bike promotion.  One thing that is desperately missing is a modal share target for cycling in cities.  The cycling national framework from 2009 had a 10% target for 2020 for all trips to be by bicycle.  In Cork we estimate, according to the last census, that it is probably 3.6% in the city and suburbs.  Now we have the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy, CMATS, which is forecasting 4% by 2040.  We need a target and we must know how we are going there and have a roadmap.  We made that part of our public consultation and we brought people along.  We could have a way to tell people the story of how we are going to get to where we need to be in a few years' time.</p></speech>

It was the community development people in Cork City Council and it was interesting to get that inquiry.  We are working with University College Cork, UCC, in Cork and doing the pilots in the city area for Blarney and Tower.  We are doing the peer review of the data we have collected.  Everything we do is peer reviewed before we release it.  In fact, the person is coming down to do the peer review this week.  I have also had inquiries from Galway and Dublin.</p> <p>  Given that I have said our waiting list is 45 to 50 towns, it is very unlikely we are going to do the city centres anytime soon unless we get the resources that were committed or promised under the programme for Government.  However, the principles are still the same - to try to gather the data, to talk to the people and to do the participation.  Also with regard to Cork, Cork county is on the waiting list as well.</p> <p>  It is a pity I have not been able to get down to Cork during the lockdown, but there is a wonderful team in Cork City Council.  The conservation officer is working with us, as is the engineer.  The planners are on board.</p><p>It will grow and grow.  We have had inquiries about the area.  We are talking about doing more.  It depends on the resources.  Only one person is involved.</p></speech>

I had a question for Dr. D'Arcy on shared bikes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.392" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lorraine D'Arcy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#GG00300"><p>I agree with the Deputy.  Quite a lot is happening, but it might not be very visible in the public realm.  Shared bikes are a great opportunity for people to try things out.  Shared bike schemes in urban areas have great potential when they are linked with our public transport network for that last mile.  There is also significant potential for them to take a second car in households off the road.  We discussed equity of space.  Car parking is the storage of private vehicles and private property.  When people start to park on footpaths, that is generally a second car that does not fit on a driveway.</p> <p>  There is significant potential for e-bikes in places like Cork, where the topography can be a bit difficult for some people, in particular those who have not cycled for a number of years.  There is a huge growth in the number of women aged in their 50s and 60s cycling on e-bikes.  The cost of a good cargo e-bike is equivalent to the cost of a private car.  Many households are now tied into that asset and will not necessarily get value from an e-bike.  They are probably not willing to take the immediate risk of selling a car to buy an e-bike if it is not going to be suitable for them.  A shared scheme where people can rent bikes and give them a go would be brilliant.  Trips to school are a key issue.</p></speech>

The Scottish have a proposal on CSOs.  To be fair to local authorities, a CPO is very hard to do.  I dealt with them during arbitration hearings when I worked in the private sector.  We need a range of tools.  Clearly, if the vacancy rates are at the level I have said, which I want to highlight are not the norm, we need new and innovative ways of dealing with that.  Economic theory backs up compulsory sale orders.  Dereliction is an unproductive use of a building or land.  Things need to shift.</p></speech>

The exchange on the national planning framework allows us to conclude on a really interesting place.  While we have dealt with a wide range of issues, the primary function of the committee is housing and planning, with a small amount of urban regeneration built into that.  It is to be hoped the recommendations we make to the Department and Minister will focus in the first instance on those, although not exclusively.</p> <p>  Part of the problem with the national planning framework and the fact that between 2018-21 we have not seen compact growth is in part because there is a time lag.  For example, we have very large amounts of suburban and commuter belt development in Dublin, which involves planning permissions granted over ten or, in some cases, 15 years ago, well before the national planning framework.  We need to start thinking about how we ensure planning or zoning decisions that were taken at an earlier stage are forced to catch up when there are significant changes in policy.  Otherwise, there will be significant lags.  Given the urgency around our climate targets, we do not have time to lose.</p> <p>  Likewise, we still do not have new rural planning guidelines or residential density guidelines from the Department, both of which have been enormously delayed.  That creates huge confusion in local authorities and very mixed practice.  The committee calling for those two sets of guidelines to be published as a matter of urgency is crucial.</p><p>I refer to the point made by Dr. D'Arcy on studies on suburban development and isolation.  One of the small improvements is that where we are building new suburbs, such as Cherrywood, Adamstown and Clonburris, we are trying to make sure we do not make the same mistakes.  Densities in Cherrywood, for all its problems, are significantly higher.  Much of the infrastructure, including cycling infrastructure, was built before the houses.  While there are greenfield developments, they are high density, mixed use and have active transport built in from the start.  That is crucial.</p><p> Mr. O'Connor referred to affordability.  Poolbeg is not a suburb, but it is an attempt to have high-density inner urban transport oriented development in a strategic development zone.  There is no affordability in Poolbeg as it currently stands.  In fact, there is a very difficult conversation to be had between a variety of Departments, Dublin City Council and the owners of the site.  Currently, we are being told that the all-in development cost of a standard two-bedroom unit is &euro;500,000 to &euro;600,000.  In an ideal world, we would be doing exactly what the NESC report outlined in 2019.  Crucially, affordable homes are absent.  Even social homes could be under question because the cost of purchasing Part 5 units could be above the Department's ceiling.  Whether it is Poolbeg or the City Edge scheme, which is in the middle of the city rather than at the edge, taking into account those of us who live along the M50, affordability is key.</p><p> We are awaiting legislation from the Government on directly elected mayors.  Many cities in other jurisdictions people have spoken about as being models of good practice have much stronger, and more democratically accountable and devolved, local and regional government.  I am saying these things almost as a checklist because we have to put them into our recommendations.  I thank all of the contributors today.  I learned tonnes from the presentations.  They have been exceptionally useful.</p></speech>

The Mayor of Paris, Ms Anne Hildago, has brought about change in the past three years.  She has a vision for the city and a mandate to bring that vision forward.  It is very clear where the city is going.  It is taking hugely ambitious steps to get to be the city it wants to be.  We would love to see that vision in Irish cities.  It is not just about cycle lanes; it is about changing the whole feeling and character of a city.  It would be an important step.  Limerick is moving ahead with it and there was a vote in Cork.  It is something to think about for the future.  It would give people more of a chance to buy in to change.  We would know where the city is going for a five-year period.</p></speech>

The point was well made in <i>The Irish Times</i>at the weekend that we should not forget the importance and what used to be the pre-eminence of local authorities and local development plans.  National guidelines are very important, but local authorities comprise elected representatives who make the plan and, as was mentioned, that is a contract with the people and they should be empowered to make the plan for themselves.  Directly elected mayors can strengthen that system in cities.<br/><br/>The point on Poolbeg is interesting.  I would like to see a future where local authorities are well skilled and empowered so that places like Poolbeg are put under pressure in terms of attractiveness, as well as places in north and west Dublin and regional cities so that there is an evenness and equality of space.  It is to be hoped that is a future we can envisage and plan for.</p></speech>

Even before the institution came together to solve the collaboration and collective action problems, the vision was set out by directly elected mayors in those cases.  It is an important factor.</p></speech>

It is importance to have the leadership, vision and ability to communicate why we are doing something and what we expect the good result to be.</p><p>Ms Harvey has consistently referred to this aspect as well, namely, the collaboration that is required to ensure a plan is not seen as being solely that of the Government, the council or the planners, but rather as a town's plan that will bring together all the people and stakeholders involved.  That will ensure a plan has more buy-in, which is critically important.  </p><p> I have a slot for my questions now.  Starting with the witnesses from NESC, one of its recommendations detailed earlier concerned the development of large-scale cost-rental schemes serviced by high-frequency, reliable, affordable and comfortable public transport.  Regarding that recommendation, does the LDA, as set up, have the power and ability to pull together the land management elements to enable it to have the required influence on transport policy and infrastructure to realise it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.406" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cathal FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#JJ00200"><p>The establishment of the LDA as a statutory body is important.  Its primary objectives of sustainable urban development and affordable housing are correct.  In that regard, it must be equipped with a planning role and the tools to assemble land, including the ability to use CPOs, adopt a master planning approach and harness the land value capture aspect.  Those elements are probably still not fully attached to the agency.  If it is to fulfil its initial objectives, encompassing regeneration as well as the development of public lands, and assemble lands for those purposes, and even if it does not exercise CPO powers, what we have seen from European examples is these types of agencies operating in the shadow of the law.  They do not necessarily have to invoke some of their powers.  The ability of such bodies to bring actors together in these undertakings, including landholders, to realise a master plan on a statutory footing is important.  Therefore, the establishment of the LDA has been an important development.  From our engagement with it, I know the agency is ambitious about what it is trying to do.  The LDA is an important player in almost all the examples I cited in the opening statement concerning where TOD is beginning to emerge.  My colleague Mr. Cahill may also wish to contribute on this question.</p></speech>

Its proposed projects are the largest developments of this type planned to date, and the agency is well positioned to undertake these large-scale cost-rental developments.  Given the scale of the housing challenge, however, very large-scale provision of cost-rental developments will be needed to really make a difference to rental affordability.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#JJ00400"><p>I thank Mr. Cahill.  For everyone's information, the chair-designate of the LDA will be in with the committee next Thursday at 5.30 p.m., so we will probably be able to follow up on some of these questions then as well.</p> <p>  Regarding planning, I refer to situations where we seek to develop the derelict upper, second-floor and third-floor levels of buildings where people once lived over shops.  Those buildings were once used commercially but never will be again.  In the context of trying to adapt those buildings for residential use, often the ability of those wishing to undertake such development is curtailed regarding the public realm, including extending the footpaths outside doors, for example.  It is hard to encourage people to live in such buildings in town centres if they will be stepping out onto busy streets with only a narrow footpath, perhaps 2 ft or 3 ft wide, in front of them.  Much of the required development in this context is needed outside these buildings.  How do we pull together public realm design and endeavours to address dereliction and vacancy on the upper floors of buildings to enable the development of residential opportunities?  How can we focus the local authority in respect of developing the public realm facet, while at the same time focusing on the redevelopment or reuse of vacant buildings?  Ms Harvey has indicated that she wishes to contribute on this matter. </p></speech>

We are all taken by those designs, because some retail units will never return to that previous use, but hopefully some will.  Perhaps the independents will come in, but that all remains to be worked out.  A design-led solution exists, however, and the Dutch are implementing it.  As I said, they are consolidating their town centres, and we could send information on that approach to the committee.</p></speech>

I am out of time for my questions.  I wanted to get into master planning in this context and at the lower level of local areas, but I will move on to the last member to pose questions.  I call Deputy Leddin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-18a.411" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022011800002#KK00300"><p>I think we would all agree that we could stay for much longer to interrogate this subject because it is so interesting.  We will produce a good report from this session.  Regarding accessibility and urban freight, both topics are frequently used as excuses for not changing the configuration of our streets.  Again harking back to a trip to the Netherlands, I am reminded of an experience where I saw many more people with disabilities than I would see here at home.  It struck me that because the Netherlands has a coherent and complete cycle network that it doubles up as a network for people who use various kinds of mobility devices.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the accessibility arguments in this context and to bring some informed knowledge to this facet of the discussion.</p> <p>  Similarly, concerning urban freight and last-mile delivery, it is often argued that delivery vans, typically white, must be able to access our small streets to make deliveries and keep businesses going.  Outside my office here in Dublin, though, is a cargo hub.  I think it involves DHL or UPS, or one of those parcel companies, and it is run by Dublin City Council.  A trailer full of parcels and deliveries is left in that spot each morning.  Cargo bikes then come and go from it all day long to collect and deliver the parcels to businesses all around the city.  Will the witnesses also elaborate on the public health co-benefits of much of what we have been talking about today?  Not enough is said about how important it is to improve air quality, reduce noise pollution, etc., and I would appreciate it if the witnesses could contribute more to the discussion on this aspect.</p></speech>

We are trying to reduce the number of people needing to travel into city centres by car.  We must also appreciate, however, that there will continue be a requirement for access by car and that some people will rely on cars for such access.  If we are going to retain on-street parking, we must realise that it must be reserved for people who need it.  Fingal County Council has good examples of putting in place small mobility hubs where there is blue-badge and age-friendly parking.  Bike hubs are located next to those spaces.  Therefore, the days of leaving on-street parking as just a free-for-all must come to an end.  If we are going to keep on-street parking, which, realistically, we must on many streets, then it should be provided to people who require and rely on it.</p></speech>

It is about ensuring that those who need to drive into urban centres can do so in the most efficient way possible, while also providing anyone who does not need to drive with full support to walk, cycle or use whatever mode of travel they may choose which is the most efficient for them.</p><p>It is not about stopping people; it is about empowering people.</p><p> We also know there are quite a number of people with disabilities who cannot drive and, therefore, require a caregiver to bring them places.  That, in turn, puts an additional burden on the carer.  Recent work done by one of our students found that to access these carers and people with disabilities to interview them around public transport interchanges, it was so hard to get them primarily because they are so burdened by all the stresses they have.  They do not necessarily engage in public consultation.  We need to think more creatively about how we get real and valuable information from them.  One of the things we have done is create a walkability app, with an international consortium, that we hope to get up and running.  The Walk21 conference that we will be hosting this year is being co-funded by the Department of Health, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and the Department of Transport.  It is an interdisciplinary conversation about how we can better learn from each other and collect these metrics, such as air quality, physical activity and the delay in dementia, for example, if one lives in a more walkable area, and how we can incorporate that into the justification for our projects and funding.</p></speech>

It was good to hear Dr. D'Arcy raise the issue of public health co-benefits.  Using air quality as an example, without sounding too dramatic, poor air quality is one of our biggest silent killers in urban areas, so much so that about half of new asthma cases in Irish urban cities can be attributed to poor air quality due to traffic, which is an astounding figure.  That is based on an international study of air quality by <i>The Lancet</i>.<br/><br/>We have a massive knowledge deficit around that area.  I know it is something the EPA is working on with regard to additional monitors.  That is something we need to know about because we can taste it in the air but we cannot really see it that much.  People do not know about relationships between traffic, for example, and air quality.  The WHO recently changed its guidelines around what it considers to be an acceptable level of risk when it comes to air quality.  We might be quite surprised to find how much we would fail in that area, but there are lots of things we can do.  Low emission zones are an important aspect.  Even measures like widening footpaths and adding street trees.  Not only do we improve the pedestrian experience but we have an ability to start to improve our air quality.  I believe that is a critical issue.<br/><br/>I have a small point to make about the freight hubs.  We should, absolutely, be integrating with logistics a lot more.  That is the whole multidisciplinary side of things.  There is huge potential there for mobility hubs, particularly for the last mile or last few kilometres of journeys.  Freight is changing; there is no doubt about it.  Reference was made to what was outside the window, and that is happening all around the world.  There is a significant area there that we have the potential to tap into as well.</p></speech>

It goes back to research that was undertaken during the early stages of the pandemic.  It was felt the density that was key to transport-oriented development, which makes them so useful and deals with other secondary benefits, was also linked to vulnerability to infection.  Some of the early data indicated that the highest infection and mortality rates were in the more dense cities and metropolitan areas.  We must remember that research subsequent to this found that there were different types of density and that the resources of the people living in those high density locations rather than the density <i>per se</i>was leading to some of those infection rates, including people's ability to take time off if they are symptomatic, etc., and the fiscal resources of the communities and the services available to them.  Insofar as TODs are provision of services as well as provision of public transport, we must remember that it is not density <i>per se</i>that is linked to these types of problems, but the nature of the people living in the dense location.</p></speech>

We are out of time.  It has been three hours of fascinating discussion and the committee appreciates the expertise of the witnesses and the time they have given the committee and their opening statements.  It is quite obvious the role we have as a committee is focused on housing, planning, local government and heritage, but we have definitely gone into the arena of the committees on transport and climate.  It shows how they are inextricably linked.  I note something from many of the opening statements.  They did not stress the importance of compact growth on climate action.  This seems to be something that was missing from many of the opening statements.  To me, this is one of the driving forces behind this.  I know carbon reduction was mentioned in some of them, but to me this should be the driving force behind it.</p> <p>  We talked about affordability in housing as well.  Having to travel long distances because a house is affordable, far away from where a person works, is not affordable for many people.  The cost of the fuel used is only going in one direction.  We have to cover so many areas.  We talked about health, the cleaner air in our communities and all those benefits that accrue from developing, and bring life and living back into our rural towns.  We talked about the working from home and digitalisation that we will see.  In the past, people got up early in the morning to leave their town and came back late at night because of the commute.  They only barely saw their town at the weekend.  However, now that there is an opportunity to work from home, we have come to realise the importance of having those nice spaces around us.  When you walk on a wide footpath, there is a sense of safety about it.  When you see those green spaces and trees, there is a sense of well-being.  Intrinsically, we know what we want as humans and it is about us providing that leadership, collaboration and communication about where we are trying to get to.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their time.  This is our second meeting on this topic.  We will have a third meeting next week.  I wish to correct something I said earlier.  Our meeting with the chair designate of the LDA, Mr. Cormac O'Rourke, is actually at 1.30 p.m. next Thursday and not 5.30 p.m. as I had said.</p></speech>
