While the restrictions are in place, priority is given to members and non-members will have to take their place in the queue.  Members are requested to ensure that, for the duration of the meeting, their mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to aeroplane, safe or flight mode.</p> <p>  The agenda for today is the impact of Brexit on the agrifood industry and it is the second of our meetings to discuss this.  It is getting to a critical point at this stage and no matter what happens, there are going to be headaches on 1 January 2021.  Even with a deal, there are going to be serious headaches for trade on 1 January.  We will hear first from representatives from the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, who are joining us remotely, and the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association, ICSA.  In the second session, we will hear from representatives from An Bord Bia and the Irish Grain and Feed Association.</p> <p>  The meeting will be suspended between each session to allow the desks to be sanitised.  On this note, I remind members that there are sanitisation products throughout the room that should be used when taking or vacating a seat.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020121500002#A00500"><p>I welcome representatives from the ICSA, Mr. Eddie Punch, general secretary, and Mr. Edmond Phelan, president.  I welcome also representatives from the ICMSA who are joining us remotely, Mr. Lorcan McCabe, deputy president, and Mr. John Enright, general secretary.  We received witnesses' opening statements which have been circulated to members.  As we are limited in time due to the Covid-19 safety restrictions, the committee has agreed that the opening statements will be taken as read so we can use the full session for questions and answers.  I propose a limit of four minutes per member, per session for questions and answers.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to give an important notice in relation to parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings is to be given.  They should respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Witnesses participating in the committee meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts should note that the constitutional protection afforded to those participating within the parliamentary precincts does not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given as to whether, or the extent to which, this participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  I now invite questions from the members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020121500002#A00600"><p>I thank our guests for coming in.  It is good to see them.  We are now at a crunch phase.  It depends on the day of the week as to whether we can be optimistic or pessimistic about the outcome but let us hope that the utterings over the past 24 hours mean that there will be a deal in place.  Regardless of that, the truth is that even a deal scenario will present many challenges to ICSA and ICMSA members.</p> <p>  To follow on from some of the remarks in the statements, I will ask a couple of questions first of the ICSA.  As we will be meeting with Bord Bia later on, can the ICSA give us a view as to whether or not it thinks Bord Bia is doing enough for its members in identifying and supporting products at an international level?  In its statement the ICSA referred to the &euro;5 billion Brexit reserve fund as woefully inadequate.  That is a fund of which Ireland will receive only a portion.  Can the witnesses indicate what figures they think are required and how they should be pin pointed and addressed, either at a domestic or an EU level?</p> <p>  One of the big issues is going to be trade and we have spent much time in this committee talking about the potentially devastating impact of Mercosur.  If the ICSA has a position on the CETA trade agreement with Canada, could it share it with us?</p> <p>  The ICMSA expressed concern that much Brexit-related funding is directed towards State agencies and links further up the supply chain, as opposed to farmers who arguably need it more.  Can Mr. McCabe or Mr. Enright outline the types of supports they think need to be in place for farmers?</p> <p>  The ICMSA highlighted that the growth of agrifood exports since 2010 stands at 63%.  Does the ICMSA have an idea of how much of this related to the British market and how much of this has been generated since the 2016 vote on Brexit?  I welcome any views on how this can be mitigated.</p> <p>  How concerned are both organisations about the potential for delays when the land bridge is being used?  We have already seen delays at ports in Britain.  Do they think we have done enough to mitigate that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eddie Punch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020121500002#A00700"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation and Deputy Carthy for the questions.  To answer the first one on whether Bord Bia is doing enough, it is impossible to say what enough is at the moment.  Since Brexit there has been some improvement in diversifying our exports into other markets.  Much effort was put, predominantly of course, into China but China has been disrupted in the past year because of its difficulty with animal disease.  That has been problematic.</p> <p>  Our export of beef to continental Europe has improved.  We have gained in volume in much of the European continental markets, so we have gone up in exports.  In 2015 before Brexit our exports to the Continent were around 219,000 tonnes of beef while in 2019 that was up to 253,000 tonnes.  There has been an improvement in terms of France, Netherlands, Scandinavia and Germany.  That is positive but these amounts are in the tens of thousands while 260,000 tonnes of beef went to the UK in 2019.  Clearly, we have not achieved enough diversification to date.  It is obviously very hard to see how we can find a market for even half of the beef if, for example, half of the beef to the UK had to be diverted.</p> <p>  We welcome that there was an agreement for the development for a suckler brand in the beef task force and we would hope the money there will be used.  We have a concern that the meat industry and some of the main processors are not showing all that much enthusiasm in  trying to develop suckler beef as a premium product.</p><p>Our view is that the suckler brand needs to be managed and owned by farm organisations, farmers and small companies as much as by Bord Bia or big business.  Similar remarks can be made about the PGI grass-fed standard.  We want to make sure that is controlled for the benefit of the primary producer in this country.  PGIs are meant to benefit primary producers.  That is set out in EU legislation but let us see what will happen on that. </p><p> The Deputy mentioned the Mercosur and CETA agreements.  The CETA deal like the Mercosur deal is one in which beef was sacrificed for the benefit of other sectors.  The only thing that can be said about CETA is that Canada has not been aggressive about taking up the quota under the agreement but we would have a concern that the agreement does not work for beef producers.  Overall, it is time to very much reflect on whether these trade deals which were done when there was no thought about Brexit are still appropriate.  Under the Mercosur agreement, there is the potential for 99,000 tonnes of beef to be brought into the European market.  That was entirely the wrong deal at the wrong time.  It was initiated when the gap in the market that could be used to justify it was the fact that the UK was short of beef.  If the UK is out of the European Union, there is no justification for bringing in additional beef to disrupt an already chaotic market.  We have to say it is a chaotic market if beef we would normally export to the UK without the imposition of tariffs is now struggling to find a home but if tariffs that could be imposed on exports to the UK cause a disruption to that market we cannot afford to be bringing in beef from outside the EU.  The logistics disruption through the landbridge is posing a big problem regardless of whether we will have a deal.  Some additional ferry capacity was announced in recent months by Stena Line and so on but there is not anywhere near enough ferry capacity to mitigate the disruption to the landbridge.  In our view there needs to be a serious discussion at EU level about subsidising additional ferry capacity direct from Ireland to Europe.</p></speech>

Mr. McCabe's mic is on mute.  We cannot hear him.  We cannot hear Mr. Enright either.  We are not hearing the witnesses who are joining up remotely.  There is a technical issue.  I ask them to note their responses to Deputy Carthy's questions and we will come back to them.  The staff are trying to sort out the issue.  We will move on to Senator Daly and then return to the witnesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020121500002#B00300"><p>I welcome the representatives from the ICSA and the ICMSA and thank them for their submissions which we received today.  We are all aware of the fact that we are operating in a vacuum at the moment.  Much of what we will discuss could turn out to be hypothetical.  As was mentioned previously, it is not looking good.  Even the best case scenario being flagged would give rise to issues in January or in the early months of whatever agreement is made.  I have a few brief questions mainly seeking elaboration on points.  Most of questions are for both organisations but I will focus initially on the ICSA.  I have been trying to find positives in these deliberations.  I would like to hear the witnesses' opinions on the possibilities for an increased or an improved sheep market depending on the outcome of the negotiations.  We are all familiar with the quantity of Welsh sheep going to France.  If that was not as easy a flight or journey for the UK after the negotiations are concluded, would there be an opening there for our sector?  Have the witnesses' organisations any strategies among their members with an eye to that market or improved markets?  Rather than concentrating on the negatives, we need to look for any positives that may be available and we certainly need to be in a position to take advantage of those if they arise.  I would like to hear the ICSA's position on the possibility of an improvement for the sheep sector as we go forward.</p><p>The two organisations' submissions are very much about increased markets and new markets and putting the ball back in the political court and Bord Bia&rsquo;s court.  What interaction have they had with their membership?  Have they any strategies for diversification, changing farming methods or how their memberships can deal with possible outlooks?  Everybody here will be fighting for us to get as much as of the &euro;5 billion as is possible and for it to be spread out as best as it can be and to the most appropriate areas of need as possible.  What work have the organisations done with their membership or how are their members reacting to how they can, along with the aid, possibly overcome some of the hurdles that may appear?</p><p>The increased ferry capacity is to be welcomed but we could do with much more of it.  Has the ICMSA done any research taking account of the increased ferry capacity with regard to lairage for live calf exports?  Will lairage still be an issue or will the increased ferry capacity open up the lairage that will be available for use?</p><p>With respect to both organisations, but particularly the ICSA. I want to return to an issue highlighted by the Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society in its submission to the committee last week.  It relates to existing free trade agreements <i>in situ</i>between the EU and varying counties.  It highlighted the fact that irrespective of the Northern Ireland protocol Northern Ireland milk, in the small print in some of those agreements, could still  be seen as a third country product and that could be a potential major issue for countries to which we currently export under free trade agreements.  Because of the small print in those agreements, those countries may not be able to recognise Northern Ireland milk other than as a third country product, irrespective of the Northern Ireland protocol.  Has the ICMSA encountered that issue or has any work been done it, or what strategy would it have to overcome that if it were to become an issue?</p></speech>

Will they have the same capacity that was available in the spring of previous years?  Are the witnesses from the ICMSA on the air?</p></speech>

He had a longstanding commitment and could not make it here today.</p> <p>  The two members raised the subject of live calf exports.  We were are very concerned about the landbridge not being available.  That will result in much more capacity being sought on the ferries, especially from Rosslare.  We are very concerned about that.</p><p>The other thing which we welcomed in recent weeks is the granting of protected geographical indication, PGI, status by Bord Bia to grass-fed beef.  Hopefully, that will be a help in future.  I will let our general secretary take over on the other aspects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020121500002#C00200"><p>That is fine.  I ask Mr. Enright to go ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Enright" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020121500002#C00300"><p>A couple of points were raised by Deputy Carthy.  The first concerned supports for farmers.  On that issue, when beef prices collapsed in 2019, while some supports were put in place for farmers, and we acknowledge the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme, many farmers did not receive support for the losses they suffered.  That includes many dairy farmers who had more than 40 dairy cows, which we thought was very unfair.</p> <p>  Ultimately, supports come down to farm income and what income farmers have from their farm enterprises.  In a no-deal scenario, obviously, we would be concerned about the beef side, in particular, but there could also be a negative impact on the dairy side of things.  We believe the &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment fund needs to directly address losses which may occur.  We hope losses do not occur, but we hope farmers will be properly compensated if they do, because this problem has not been caused by farmers and they should not take the hit for it.  We made the point that there was a great deal of support for people further up the supply chain.  The reality, however, is that any losses which occur will eventually be passed down to the primary producers and we will take the hit as farmers.  Deputy Carthy also asked me about the growth in agrifood exports of 63% since 2010.  In 2018, exports of food to the UK amounted to &euro;4.8 billion.  Growth in exports to the UK will continue, although there will probably be better growth outside it.  We cannot, however, understate the importance of the UK market for our farmers, whether they are in the beef, sheep and-or dairy sectors.</p> <p>  Turning to ferry capacity, our deputy president addressed that issue.  The Chairman asked us about our contact with the shipping companies.  We have been in constant contact with the live exporters in that regard.  The major concern is that if there are delays across the land bridge, lorries will go direct to the Continent and then there is the question of whether that will impact on capacity during the key period from February to late April.  We simply do not know the answer to that now, given all the uncertainty.  Everybody hopes a deal will be done, but this issue will have to be watched carefully.  The new year will be a critical time for our trade in our calves.  There is a market for them and we can supply good quality calves to that market.</p> <p>  Regarding Senator Paul Daly's point concerning existing free trade agreements, there are issues with them.  Hopefully, a Brexit deal will be concluded.  In that context, we will have to return to the issue of certification of products, because there is a long-standing relationship between North and South in respect of processing, etc., and it is important that we retain that relationship.  Our deputy president has strong views on that matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020121500002#C00400"><p>I thank the witnesses.  Would Mr. Phelan like to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Edmond Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020121500002#C00500"><p>I will start with the calves.  If there are going to be queues of a day or two days at Dover, then there is no way that calves can go that way.  If there is rough weather during the spring, I would be worried about whether the transport of calves would be allowed to go across the Bay of Biscay.  I do not know if that would be possible, and it is something which will have to be watched.  It is vital, however, that the calves get out of the country, because there will be a knock-on effect on the beef industry if too many of them stay here.</p> <p>  Moving on to sheep, in one sense this situation might actually help sheep farmers in the short term, because up to 450,000 to 500,000 lambs from Northern Ireland and the UK come into Ireland and are slaughtered here every year.  That puts pressure on the price that Irish farmers get.  Much of the lamb produced in the UK goes to France now.  There may be positive aspects in that area, therefore.  The major areas for us, however, are beef and dairy, and they are going to take a hit.  Looking at the overall tariffs being discussed, the estimate for the food industry is &euro;1.35 billion or something in that ballpark.  That is more than the total amount that comes into the country in respect of the single farm payment, so that puts things into perspective regarding how much farmers will be affected on the ground.  We know all these difficulties will end up being passed back to the primary producers.  Mr. Punch will now deal with the figures on the more technical side of this situation.</p></speech>

We can calculate what the value of tariffs will be.  In reality, however, a negotiation must happen between processors and purchasers of beef in the UK.  There will also be impacts in respect of the currency exchange rate movements.  Much damage was done to the beef sector in the past four years, because as soon as the Brexit vote went through the value of sterling dropped significantly and it has never recovered.  We hope that that aspect has been built into the price, but if the ongoing talks end badly, there could be further weakening of sterling and could add more damage to the saleability of our beef in the UK than just tariffs.  We must also consider the impact of economic negativity, combined with potentially dearer beef for UK consumers.  That is assuming there would be a hit to UK consumers and that would impact on the overall consumption of Irish beef in the UK market.</p> <p>  It is hard, therefore, for anybody to forecast the exact outcome.  It is clear, though, that this is not just a matter of tariffs.  It also involves potential exchange rate movements, impacts on consumption in the UK and logistics costs, whether in respect of delays at ports or additional customs clearance bureaucracy.  All of that adds to costs.  One thing we are concerned about even if a deal is got across the line, which we still hope will happen, is that it is now looking like it is late in the day to have this situation sorted out for January.  We might, therefore, have a temporary period of chaos until the deal kicks in.  That may imply trading on WTO terms at the start of the new year, but we do not know yet.  There is also a problem in respect of the European Parliament having to ratify a deal.  Therefore, there is a great deal of potential for uncertainty.</p> <p>  We think significant efforts have been made to get product across to the UK before the end of the year.  That has perhaps helped the trade for beef in marts, and we have seen a great deal of purchasing of beef cattle from Northern Ireland, in particular.  There is a slight concern, however, that that development will have an impact on the price of beef early in the new year.  I refer to the stocking up of products in the UK in anticipation of disruption early in the new year.  All those things point to many difficulties for farmers early in 2021.  The other side of that equation, though, is that some farmers I know of have slowed down finishing cattle because they do not want to have too many cattle for beef markets in January.  That is leading to a problem with the BEAM scheme as well, because we are going that bit slower with finishing cattle.  We had a meeting with officials from the Department yesterday regarding the BEAM scheme 5% reduction, which we see as being increasingly problematic in the context of everything going on with Covid and Brexit.</p></speech>

The real issue is that the next six months, at least, are going to be traumatic.  We will have issues with confidence in the market and in the farming community itself.  How those problems eventually collide will be a major issue.  Returning to the issue of calf exports, how the land bridge is going to work in that regard will be a major issue as well.  We must ensure these animals get to the Continent in an appropriate timeline.  It is debatable, to say the least, whether we can guarantee that in the current environment.</p> <p>  Regarding the calf exporters, this committee did a report on this topic several years ago.  We were hoping the calf exporters would have one organisation that they would all work through, but that does not seem to have happened.  We must look again at having one organisation which could talk about these issues, particularly when one takes into consideration what will happen in the next six months.</p><p>I would like to hear the witnesses' opinions on whether we could have a more streamlined approach.  Could the Department, the calf exporters and organisations like the ICSA and ICMSA work together for the benefit of Irish agriculture in the next six months regarding the exportation of calves?  That kind of forum is very important and we need to try to push it if we possibly can.</p><p> What interaction have agrifood companies had in the past four years to try to ensure access to those beneficial markets?  China has been a huge issue.  In many ways we were hoping that would be one of our biggest markets but, unfortunately, it has fallen away in the past six months.  Where do we need to drive the market now?  Where is the game going to be for Bord Bia in the next six months to drive the product we need to get out of this country?</p></speech>

Be it beef or dairy, if people are not getting bigger they are losing out.  This is being seen more on the dairy side, so I will leave it to the ICMSA to talk about that.  Farmers are going up to 200 or 400 cows.  Where does it stop?  Are we going to go to a New Zealand scenario?  That has knock-on effects for beef as we have overproduction and that is why prices are very poor for beef at the moment.</p> <p>  The calf issue is, again, more of a question for the ICMSA but it does affect us.  I do not know the answer.  The Wicklow Calf Company has said that flying the calves out is just not an option.  The cost is out of the question so that will not work.  It will have to be some ferry, whether direct to the Continent or through the land bridge.  I do not know.  As was said earlier, we need an awful lot more ferries because a ferry can do two trips a day to Wales but it takes two days for one trip to France so we would need four times the ferry capacity to haul the same amount of goods. </p></speech>

We have also increased our market significantly in the Netherlands and Scandinavia.  There is some potential to improve our exports to continental Europe and we should not ignore that.  I am not saying we are doing that but there is still more potential to grow there.  We are still talking about a lot of beef.  The Philippines has emerged as a surprising improvement in our markets.  The demand for beef in China is going very well.  We talked to some Brazilian exporters who are seeing somewhat of a boom in exporting Brazilian beef to China at the moment and there is a slight hope that they will focus on China and keep away from Europe.  There is clearly still a lot of opportunity in China and we have to work very hard with the Chinese to get over the temporary little setback in terms of the atypical case.  It is still a big challenge.  We have gone from exports of just over 500,000 tonnes of beef in 2015 to 560,000 in 2019.  That is a significant increase in beef and we are not going to have less beef in the next few years.  This is a big challenge for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lorcan McCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020121500002#D00400"><p>As Mr. Phelan alluded to, it is just not feasible to export calves by plane.  The farmer would get nothing for them or might even be faced with a bill.  Calves do not go by the land bridge because it takes too long.  It is crucial is that there is capacity on the ferries and we see a problem coming there.  As the land bridge is going to be a problem, hundreds more trucks will be heading for the ferries in Ireland, thereby putting the exporters of calves at a disadvantage.  They have a good business going, as our general secretary said, for February, March and April but the shippers may not listen to that because other people can have 12-month capacity.  While I welcome the trials for exporting calves via airplane, it is just too expensive.</p> <p>  As regards where we see markets in the future, China has to be looked at very closely and Bord Bia is working very hard on that.  Even since Covid came in mid-summer, China has been looking at milk, milk products, yoghurts and cheeses in order to build immunity and strength.  Bord Bia is working very hard on the whole east, including China, Malaysia and Singapore.  Two weeks ago the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, announced the sending away of the application for protected geographical indication, PGI, for grass-fed beef from Ireland.  That is a huge step in the right direction.  We are the only country in Europe that does that and very few countries in the world have that status.  Our general secretary, Mr. Enright, may want to add to that. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Enright" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020121500002#D00500"><p>I will make a brief comment.  The UK market is one of the highest priced markets for beef in the world and it is just across the Irish Sea from us so there is no market that will replace it for our beef.  That is the reality of the situation.  In a no-deal Brexit scenario we would be in a very difficult situation.  That is why it is hugely important that a deal is secured in the next few days, because no market will replace the UK market from our perspective.</p> <p>  On the calf exports, our calves are not shipped via the land bridge.  They are shipped directly to Cherbourg and we have lairage facilities in place in Cherbourg.  The concern is that, if there are long delays on the land bridge, many of those lorries will move to the direct routes.  It is hugely important that that issue is addressed.</p> <p>  As regards the live exporters, we have good relationships and work well with the people involved in that industry.  They have invested heavily in their facilities and I agree with Senator Lombard that it would be helpful if there was one organisation representing them.</p></speech>

Most things have been touched on already so I do not want to go back over them again.  A fund has been set aside to deal with whatever kind of Brexit, deal or no deal, is put in place.  I welcome the ICSA and the ICMSA here today and thank them for being with us.  Have they any idea as to how this fund will be distributed?  The witnesses mentioned that it would be extremely expensive getting calves flown out of the country.  What kind of research has been done on that and is it a possibility that that may be a route of getting our calves out of this country?  The Central Bank recently stated recently that a bad Brexit could well lead to the loss of a third of small farmers.  Has the Government put in place some safeguards in that regard?  Have farm organisations met with the banks regarding farmers who have issues with borrowings?  I hope it will not be the same situation as that of the pub sector.  Many publicans had the moratorium on payments and have gone back to negotiating because their businesses are not open but they are being told to forget it and that there are no more deals on the table.  If that is the case for the farmers after this it will be detrimental.  What interactions have the witnesses had with the banks?  What have the banks been coming back to them with for farmers who may fall into difficulties with payments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020121500002#D00700"><p>I thank the witnesses for their submissions.  I have a few questions for both organisations.</p><p>The two organisations have been in at the task force.  When they were working on the task force, was Northern Ireland being brought in to protected geographical indication status discussed?  What is in return for that?  Do the organisations have any agreement?  Did they look for the nomad cattle rule to be abolished if Northern Ireland wants to come in with us to seek PGI status?  Did they secure that when they agreed to PGI status?  Was the logo that Bord Bia is using for PGI discussed?  Was it agreed by the farming organisations before the committee?</p><p> My final question relates to calves.  It is my understanding that a large buyer in Holland may no longer be functioning.  The buyer was purchasing up to 4,000 calves per week. How will that problem be solved?  I have talked to calf exporters.  There was talk here last week about Spain.  There appears to be problems getting calves to Spain.  Where do the organisations see the outlets?  If there are no outlets, what are we going to do?  Are we going to flood the market here?  What are the solutions?</p></speech>

From our perspective, it depends on where the losses are suffered.  At this stage, we do not know where that is.  Certainly, we believe if there are losses at farm level, they will have to be directed at the farmers who suffered the losses.</p> <p>  We were asked about flying calves out of Ireland.  Our deputy president has covered that point.  Certainly, work is ongoing in that respect but the major concern with that option is the economics of it, which are questionable at present.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the banks.  We have met the banks on several occasions recently.  We have members who are in financial difficulty.  There are practices in operation that we are not happy with, to be honest, on behalf of vulture funds, etc.  Officials at branch level are saying to us that they have not seen too much stress as a result of Brexit or Covid-19.  However, if we have a no-deal Brexit it could become a bigger issue quickly.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about calves.  The reality is that buyers of Irish calves are in Netherlands and Spain.  Over the years, the figures have gone up and down but there has always been a market.  Covid-19 is an issue.  Like everyone else, we hope the vaccine will work and that food service will get back in action as soon as possible.  The reality is that the buyers of Irish calves this year will be in Netherlands and Spain.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about PGI.  Our president and the chairperson of our livestock committee represent us on that matter.  I do not have the details but I can come back to the him on those issues, if needs be.</p></speech>

I believe it is an anti-competitive practice but it is not a regulatory problem.  EU regulations on labelling require country of origin on every specific portion of beef.  Traditionally, the view of UK supermarkets has been that to use a label stating "Born in Ireland, finished in UK" would be too complex for supermarket consumers to understand.  They have simply refused to do it.  The interesting thing is that the Italian consumer, apparently, is more intelligent than the British consumer because they are able to understand it.  In our view, it is an anti-competitive practice in the UK imposed by supermarkets.  There is a question mark in our view about whether processors have been too willing to accept that particular answer at UK level.</p> <p>  I will go back to the question of PGI and what was discussed at the beef task force.  Considerable time was spent fighting to ensure the PGI application and the suckler brand application were controlled by a monitoring committee with majority farmer representation.  It was agreed in the discussions that the monitoring committee would have the final say on how the suckler brand and PGI would be organised.  Obviously, at the moment there is no PGI status, but as soon as it is agreed the monitoring committees have the final say on the use of these.</p> <p>  There is an element of a grey area around this.  Traditionally, PGI status has been sought by co-operatives or groups of farmers or primary producers.  For example, Connemara hill lamb was secured by a co-operative of primary producers in Connemara.  This is tricky because Bord Bia is the applicant.  We want the monitoring group to have a complete say over it.  However, nothing is written in stone.  There is agreement that the monitoring committee for PGI status will be majority farmer represented.  Until such time as the application is passed at EU level, the PGI monitoring committee will not be up and running.  That is all we can say about that.  In private discussions with the Department and Bord Bia we have spent considerable time insisting that the use of PGI status had to be within the control of the monitoring group.  That means the use of the logo.</p> <p>  There are difficulties with PGI.  The EU regulations state that PGI status is available to any primary producer that meets the standard set out in the PGI document.  This is difficult.  Let us suppose some farmers set up a given PGI status and then ICMSA sets up PGI status.  Then, let us suppose another group of farmers meet the standard set out in the PGI status.  We would have difficultly in saying they cannot use it.  That is the EU regulation aspect of it.  If a producer meets all the standards set out under the PGI, it is not permitted, as we understand it, for a group or co-operative of farmers to claim it is theirs alone.  That is why there are challenges in respect of a national PGI status.  Such difficulties might not arise if there was a localised PGI status.  For example, it is obvious that a farmer in Waterford cannot benefit from a PGI called Connemara hill lamb.  However, when there is a national PGI, there are questions marks about restricting the its use.  That will not be solved even after the PGI is granted.  We will have to see what the EU says about it first.</p></speech>

I have always been of the opinion that it suits the processor very much.  The same processors seem to process the majority of stock in the UK and here.  It suits them to keep Irish cattle prisoners in Ireland.  They can keep the price down.  They have many ways of doing that with their own feedlots and so on.  They control the market completely.  Recently, we have seen factory-fit cattle being sold in the marts.  They had no bother paying the equivalent of &euro;4.20 or &euro;4.30 per kilogram.  Yet, they are only prepared to give &euro;3.70 to the farmer directly.  It is anti-competitive, as Mr. Punch said.  However, I do not know what can be done about it.</p><p>Funnily enough, we do not say there is such a thing as nomad sheep despite the number coming the other way.  The committee knows what I am getting at.</p></speech>

There obviously are traits to Irish farming that show in our grass-fed beef, our Bord Bia exports and in the sale of Kerrygold all over the world.  It has worked extremely well for the latter product.  Kerrygold brand foodstuffs are worth twice as much as those of competitors in the USA and New York.  I hope this status will work as well for beef, although it probably will not.  The PGI will, however, apply to 70% of all livestock.  We are all in this together.  That is how I look at it.</p> <p>  In case it is not raised later, I would like the opportunity to address the area of milk processing, including the logistics of cross-border milk processing.  May I do that now or later on?</p></speech>

There are three co-ops or milk processors in Ireland which need that milk to run efficient businesses.  As the committee will have seen in our submission, there are 32,000 lorry crossings of the Border each year.  That issue has to be addressed.  We cannot have the segregation of milk.  It just will not happen.  Even if everything goes right with the Brexit deal, this will be a very big problem.  As I have said, we have seen a perfect marriage between milk from Northern Ireland and milk from Southern Ireland.  Farms in the North produce milk throughout the winter.  This keeps our facilities going winter and summer which puts money in my pocket and the pockets of every other farmer, South and North.  I know the co-ops are doing everything they can in Westminster but the UK Government needs to know this will hurt its farmers even more than it will hurt farmers south of the Border.  I will not go into more detail; the committee knows what I am talking about.</p></speech>

The next couple of weeks will be worrying for us, as will the first months of spring as we finally see how Brexit will play out.  The agri-food sector is by far the most exposed.  Some 90% of the potential tariffs of &euro;1.6 billion that will apply under World Trade Organization rules will fall on the agri-food sector.  We hope a trade deal will be agreed between London and Brussels in the coming days that will allow us to trade with the UK.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions today.

Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings is to be given.  They should respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Witnesses participating in the committee meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts should note that the constitutional protection afforded to those participating within the parliamentary precincts does not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given as to whether, or the extent to which, this participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  There is a huge onus on Bord Bia as the agri-food industry's marketing body.  We find our industry at a crossroads that we never envisaged before where our access to our main market is under threat.  There will be many problems on 1 January whether there is a deal or not.  Many of our processors are extremely concerned.  We heard from the ICSA and ICSMA earlier, as well as from other stakeholders last week.  Many issues, such as the logistics of 32,000 lorries crossing the Border every year, will arise from 1 January.  Will Bord Bia elaborate on the preparations it has made to deal with the problems which will not arise until we are in an actual Brexit situation?</p></speech>

It was highlighted last week that, under existing EU free trade arrangements, such products could be identified as a third country product which would have major implications for dairy exports.  Is Bord Bia aware of this?  Has it any work done on this area?  Has it explored the different existing free trade agreements with which this could be an issue?</p> <p>  I was a bit taken aback when I read the IGFA's submission.  While I was aware of the amount of feedstuff and grain coming into the country, I did not realise how much came from the UK.  Has the IGFA looked at any contingency plans with regard to how we could turn this into a positive and produce or source any of these products ourselves if importation becomes an issue?</p> <p>  If it works out in our favour and the materials can still come in, there was much talk in previous sessions that, if this is seen on world markets as a bad deal for the UK, sterling might drop in value.  While most of the organisations we have heard from are exporters to the UK, the IGFA is an importer.  Could there be a positive there if sterling weakens?  We all know the consequences of weak sterling for our exporters.  Could there be a silver lining in the cloud in such a scenario?</p></speech>

As can be seen in our submission, we have been rigorously focused on that challenge since it was presented, and even before that.  We have been trying to look through all the different manifestations and challenges of the known knowns or the unknown knowns to use those unwelcome words.  The one consistent we have looked at is that we control what we can control.  That is where we have been dedicating all of our focus, namely, on what we can control.  There are so many elements that we cannot control into which we could put significant resources but still be none the wiser from it.</p> <p>  We are well aware of the logistics of the free trade agreements.  We have been liaising with Dairy Industry Ireland and other stakeholders on this.  We handed that to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which negotiates in Europe with regard to trade agreements.  We do not have a presence in Brussels so we have not got directly involved in that issue.  We have looked, however, at the size of prize and the issue the industry itself is facing.</p></speech>

The industry considers all aspects of Brexit as a whole.  We work closely with and are an important part of the link in the chain of the food industry.</p> <p>  On the raw material situation, the peak cost of a basic 15% dairy diet, which comprises barley, wheat, wheat pulp, double-zero rape soya, is &euro;233 per tonne.  Once we go post Brexit, that cost will increase, due to tariffs on the UK side, to &euro;307 per tonne, a 30% increase in the actual feed input costs to the farmer.  This in itself is a huge cost.</p> <p>  We feel it is imperative that the &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment fund is used and that the Government gives much support to the Irish farmer.  The industry feels that there is going to be serious cash flow issues this year and in years to come.</p></speech>

I understood and everybody appreciated that there was a need for a large level of importation of feed material and additive requirements.  However, 50% does not compare well with the 30% that Irish farmer's counterparts in France and Germany require and the 40% that UK farmers import.  Does the IGFA have a view on whether it would be prudent for us to adopt a strategy of increasing the level of production in this country to try to mitigate some of those challenges?</p><p> The IGFA makes a number of sensible recommendations, especially about the need for a singular Government point of contact.  It has been said that the Department's material, technical, bilateral and trilateral meetings have publicly available agendas, minutes and sector-specific briefings.  Will the witnesses from IGFA outline the specific importance and benefits of these?</p><p> Bord Bia's opening statement refers to European-specific research that was launched in October, looking at British exports to the European market should it become a third country.  That would seem like a sensible approach.  My immediate question is why was it only in October of this year that this research was launched?  That should have been done a long time ago as part of preparations.</p><p> The importance of labelling and all that comes with that will be crucial in the post-Brexit scenario.  Will Bord Bia give us an update on the protected geographical indication, PGI, statuses?  I have been speaking to a number of people in Europe who I know would have an interest in this.  In terms of PGIs bringing added value, the narrower the scope the more value they bring to those who fall within them.  A balance always has to be struck, however, because clearly everybody would want to be part of them, but that would bring no additional benefit.  Is Bord Bia confident that the balance is right in the PGI statuses that are being proposed?  Will the farmers who fall within it in terms of their product see a return in terms of a price increase?  Outside of that, a PGI will mean nothing to them, except additional bureaucracy perhaps.  Is Bord Bia confident that the balance is right?</p><p> We have just gone through four years in Europe of setting out the importance of the all-Ireland agriculture market.  We managed to insert that in the heart of the Brexit negotiations and we were able to protect ourselves because of that.  Yet it appears to me that the obstacles to the PGI status being all-Ireland are technical.  I have gone through some of the revisions that have been set out and it appears that the internal IT system, the internal audit and the issues around the companies that operate as nominating agents are technical issues.  Will there be a drive to address those as speedily as possible so that we do not have a situation in which, after all the issues we have raised and the capital we have expended in setting out the importance of having an all-Ireland sector, the first thing we would do is submit a PGI status that eliminates the all-Ireland element?</p><p> Bord Bia referenced horticultural companies as being focused on their existing markets.  That is true, but having dealt with a number of people in that sector, they are also particularly concerned about the availability of peat products.  Has Bord Bia been engaging with those companies and with the Government, or both, to try to resolve the challenges those companies have, considering that Brexit will clearly be an additional burden for them to face?</p></speech>

We would love to see a situation in which there was a lot more native grain available to us, and if it did become available, we would use it.  However, we have to import corn and corn by-products.  We have to import different sources of proteins as well as products such as molasses.  This enables us to get a cost effective animal feed for the farmer.  Ireland being an island restricts our access to and the availability of raw materials, and this is something that we have to live with.</p> <p>  One of the issues that was mentioned in the previous session was that of ports.  It will be interesting to see the development of the situation with raw materials that originate in the UK that are landed in either Derry or Belfast.  That feed is designated for mills in the South, so the question is if tariffs will be put on that because it is landed in Northern Ireland, even though it will be processed in the Republic.  We also need to see what will happen with risk management systems being developed for ports.</p></speech>

I will start with the question on horticulture.  Our team has been engaged with the horticulture industry on that matter and we can follow up with the Deputy on any detail specific to that.  It is clearly a huge challenge for the horticulture industry and it is looking to map its way through it.  There is no obvious solution from the perspective of a replacement product, and there is a quality challenge if peat has to be imported or if a substitute for it must be found.  A paper has been created on that with the industry and this has been shared with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This paper has been discussed by our board and at the horticulture forum.  We are looking, in partnership with the industry, to try to navigate towards the solutions to that.  However, I would not underestimate the challenge of that either.</p> <p>  That was a fair question on the European-specific exports and why that research is only being launched now.  We have been doing lots of other things and we are being very transparent on what we do, when we do it and why we are doing it.  The first piece of work we have been focusing on, especially at the prepared foods industry, has been to look at its capacity first and its prioritisation.  We have looked at a significant lead generation opportunity for those industries as well and the Deputy would have seen detail of that in the Committee of Public Accounts.  Then we were looking at the broader picture to see if we were missing a trick.  This was the further sense check we did with industry to try to navigate who exactly is engaging with the British product.  As it is becoming more and more obvious that the negative scenario may be a more evident solution, we are looking to see if there is any stone we can turn within that.  In the past two sessions, Senator Paul Daly has been consistently asking us to find the opportunity in Brexit as much as the negativity, and that is exactly what that research is about.  The timing of it is related to the resources available to us but we would always challenge ourselves to do more faster, bigger and better.  That is why we are transparent on when we do everything.</p> <p>  I will bring Mr. Brennan in on the PGIs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.55" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Padraig Brennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020121500002#H00400"><p>Deputy Carthy's question was about the balance in the PGI application and the potential, if we are to be successful in the application, for any PGI to extract a premium from the marketplace.  We were challenged from the outset on what that balance needed to look like.  On the one hand, we needed an application that would hopefully be robust enough to get beyond the European Commission in its criteria and in its assessment of it.  At the same time, given the challenges the beef sector is facing in Ireland, particularly at farm level, we sought to ensure that the maximum number of farms could benefit from any PGI if we were to be successful.</p><p>That was the balance we were trying to strike.  There were many conversations through the beef task force meetings over the past number of months as we tried to finalise that.  We got consensus on that at the October meeting of the beef task force.  There was general agreement that the application was robust and ready to be put forward to Brussels.</p><p> When we look across Europe in terms of premia for protected geographical indication, PGI, products, it varies a little by market and by product but if we take examples, we are looking at products carrying a premium typically of between 5% and 20%.  Some of them are on a much smaller scale in terms of the level of output, as the Deputy rightly highlighted, but there is a premium position for a product that carries a PGI label.  In terms of the way we are looking at it, if we were lucky enough to be successful with the PGI application for Irish grass-fed beef it would allow us build a much stronger position for Irish beef than we were able to do heretofore in that we can call out the Irishness in a much more open way and build a brand around Irish grass-fed beef.  We believe that gives us the opportunity to deliver a premium over time.  It may not be overnight but over time we believe it would have the potential to do that.</p><p> In terms of the Deputy's second question around the technical IT systems, the other element of the application was, and based on engagements we had with the European Commission throughout the 20-month process or whatever it was, that we had to have a robust verification system in place.  In terms of the Irish grass-fed beef PGI application, therefore, we have been anxious to be able to demonstrate that to strengthen the application as much as possible.  </p><p> In terms of the technical IT systems in Northern Ireland, we have had ongoing engagements with our counterparts in Northern Ireland over the past number of months sharing how we approach it and the infrastructure that we have in place.  The application that has been submitted to Brussels contains the application itself and an accompanying cover letter discusses the interest and the approach in terms of Northern Ireland being part of that over a period of time.  It is about trying to strike that balance on that element of it also.</p></speech>

This might be outside what people are talking about in terms of grain for cattle but my understanding is that most of our grain for bakeries is imported.  What is the position on that?  I am aware that some of it comes from Canada.  I believe it is mixed in England with some of the British grain.</p> <p>  I have numerous questions for the Bord Bia witnesses.  They might keep a note of them because I will be ticking them off as they answer them.  In Northern Ireland last year, the factories were able to kill Irish cattle and they were certified by Bord Bia.  Are the witnesses aware of any plans that processors in Northern Ireland will take Irish cattle or have they talked about getting rid of this nomad situation?  They Northern Ireland processors have basically said they want to be part of this PGI status.  Is there any deal being done that will help us in that way?</p> <p>  The Brexit process has been going on for five years.  What percentage of the beef going to England have the witnesses moved to other parts of the world away from the British market?  How many trade missions have the witnesses been on in the past five years?  How many live exporters did they bring with them on those missions?</p> <p>  There was great talk about the markets in China.  How much money has Bord Bia spent on trying to open markets in China?  What is the number of exports to China?</p> <p>  Will the witnesses' PGI be a premium price?  I want a "yes" or "no" answer.  Will the price be much higher if one is producing grass-fed beef?  If we are putting in a PGI application that includes, say, 1.8 tonnes of grain per animal, do the witnesses believe that will be classed as grass-fed beef?  When do they envisage the suckler grass-fed PGI application to be sent to Europe for the sucker herd?  Will that be a separate entity from what we are looking at currently?</p> <p>  With regard to our exports to other countries, I understand that one of the biggest buyers in Holland may not be buying this year.  Where do the witnesses envisage all our calves will go?</p> <p>  With regard to horticulture, are the witnesses aware that there is peat coming into the country?  Have they made Government circles aware that that is like bringing water to the well in that we are stopping peat production here for the horticulture sector and leaving them, through planning processes and so on, in a difficult situation while at the same time we are importing peat?</p> <p>  With regard to the logo, will the Bord Bia grass-fed logo be used in all beef brands by processors?  Who will own that logo?  I hear that was not discussed.  Was it discussed at the task force when an application was launched?</p></speech>

There is a live exporters association.  There seemed to have been some confusion in the previous session as to the existence of an association for live exporters.

We would then do a joint trade mission of dairy and beef to markets such as China.  Dairy and beef would be on our agenda almost everywhere we go, whether it is on a beef access issue or whatever.  We were in Korea and Singapore.  We would have been in Japan where beef would have been on the agenda, as would access for lamb and the promotion of pigmeat.  In terms of the trade missions we undertook on live exports, the Turkey trade mission was a dedicated live export.  We also did dairy on the Algeria and Egypt trade mission.  When we went to the Netherlands we brought the live exporters with us but we would have also had conversations about it while there.</p><p>I will have to revert to the Deputy with the detail on the money we have spent in China.  We spend funds on promotion, etc.  I do not know whether Mr. Brennan has a figure in mind for that.  In China, we carry out many EU-funded campaigns that have a smaller contribution from the Exchequer and a larger contribution from the EU.  That is how we originally kicked off our campaigns in China.  It was 80% EU funded and 20% Ireland funded.  I will have to revert to the Deputy with the total figure we have dedicated.</p></speech>

First, the UK market for Irish beef is still one of the highest paying.  To get the best possible return on the beef produced, the UK is really important to us, and that is why we still have approximately 250,000 tonnes of beef going to that market.  At the same time, we have grown the volumes exported to markets such as the German, Italian, Scandinavian and Swiss markets.  Therefore, there has been some progress made.  At any time, it is a matter of determining whether we can, in a different market, get a better return than the return from the UK.  In some cases, the answer has been that we could.  In other cases, it has been that we could not.  That is why the UK-----</p></speech>

Over half of the beef sold through supermarkets in the UK is now minced.  That is what the market is looking for.  That does not mean the market does not return a relatively good price for that product.  Our steak cuts are going to the likes of the German and Italian markets.  It is about different parts of the animal going to different markets.  Given the parts of the animal going to the UK, the market is a high-priced market.</p></speech>

The grass-fed standard has now been approved by the Irish National Accreditation Board.  It works on the basis that at least 90% of the feed consumed by the animal in its lifetime needs to be grass or grass-based forage.  That is the minimum bar.  In reality, based on the data coming through, the amount consumed is probably closer to 95%.  When developing the standard, we examined a number of our key export markets to determine what level of grass feeding would be acceptable to consumers.  We concluded that a level anywhere close to 90% was deemed to be really strong.</p> <p>  The reason we went down the route of having a grass-fed standard in the first place was that, in terms of areas in which consumers are interested, the grass-fed message is one of the stronger ones because it implies a natural production system and a higher-welfare production system.  These are all strengths.  Now that we have a verified grass-fed standard in place, it allows us to robustly communicate that and demonstrate it in the marketplace.</p></speech>

What we are saying regarding the standard is that a minimum of 90% grass or grass-fed forage must be fed to the animal in its lifetime.  The tonnage will vary depending on whether it is a two-year-old steer or a 20-month-old heifer.</p></speech>

In this regard, an oversight group had its first meeting this week.  Farmers make up the majority of its representatives.  Over the coming months, we will be starting to build up the brand proposition and identify the concepts behind it and messages we will be delivering.  Once this is done, as we approach March or April of next year, we will go about launching the brand in the European marketplace.  The brand is for Irish suckler beef.  It is a stand-alone brand, as it stands.  If we are to be successful with a PGI, we will ascertain how brands can be integrated together over a period.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.  I will start with animal feed and the preparation at the ports.  Reference was made to ports in the North.  Are the delegates happy with the work being done at the ports in the South in light of Brexit?  Is there capacity to avoid the traffic delays and to ensure it will be possible to get in and out of ports?  Regarding ports such as those in Ringaskiddy and Foynes, and even Dublin Port, are the delegates happy that it will be possible to get in and out appropriately with raw materials?  Could I have some clarity on this?</p> <p>  Regarding Brexit and the involvement of Bord Bia, I wish to ask about the Brexit barometer published over the past three years, if not four.  It has been very interesting to see how the industry has been working on Brexit.  The delegates might elaborate on that process, including the benefits and pitfalls, and on how they believe industries have been engaging with the process, particularly over the past four years.  What is the position of the next phase?  Without a shadow of a doubt, there will be some element of disruption.  How can we work on getting back into the UK market?  The UK is still our nearest neighbour and we will still be dealing with it.  How can we put protocols in place to ensure we will have the required interaction?</p> <p>  Calf exports were mentioned by many Deputies and Senators.  This will be very topical in the next few weeks and months.  I welcome the remark that I may have been wrong in saying there was no calf forum in place.  I was under the illusion that one of the major exporters was not involved and believed this comprised a major aspect of the issue arising.  Could I have clarity on the membership?  I understand one of the most significant calf exporters is outside the loop and that this was creating issues.  It might be appropriate to have clarity on who the forum members are.</p> <p>  Regarding the levy on live exports, what is the levy per animal?  Where is the money spent in ensuring progress in the live trade?  I am aware that the levy has been reduced over the past couple of years, particularly regarding calves.  Could I have clarity on it?  What is the amount?  How much is collected per year?  Where exactly is the money spent to promote live exports, particularly of calves?</p></speech>

My colleague Mr. Hamill, who led the Brexit barometer project, will give the detail because he has run it from the beginning.  He can bring it to life best.</p></speech>

We have been running the Brexit barometer since 2017.  We have run three Brexit barometers and in 2020, we launched what we called the "readiness radar", expanding the scope beyond Brexit to Covid-19 to sustainability, talent and all the other matters currently facing the sector.  We are confident the Brexit barometer and readiness radar are the most robust and detailed risk diagnostics in respect of Brexit anywhere.  These diagnostics are recognised as such and won European risk awards because of the detailed data sets.</p> <p>  Essentially, this allows us to work with a client on a bespoke one-to-one basis and to identify sector-level trends around Brexit preparedness, whether it is on supply chain and logistics, customs, customer relationships, finance, market diversification and so on.  As it evolved over the year, client preparedness and confidence on certain Brexit matters have climbed significantly.  One example is confidence in supply chain design and partners, and their preparedness has climbed a lot.</p> <p>  We have seen jumps in the gathering of economic operators' registration and identification, EORI, numbers, which is an issue for the sectors outside food and drink.  These are needed to do business with a third country.  Our clients registered for EORI numbers very early on in 2017 and 2018.  We have not seen as much progress as we would have liked in customs compliance, largely because of the distraction around tariffs and companies have missed the fact that customs compliance, which is an inevitability come January, will add cost as well.  All these non-tariff barriers are a concern for companies.  What we have really focused on this year on the back of the Brexit barometer and readiness radar is looking at the hidden costs of declarations, including transit declarations, health certificates and so on, or the cost of hiring a customs agent.</p> <p>  There are other areas that we have not been able to benchmark year on year because the nature of those questions has changed.  We would always have been looking at whether a client has engaged with UK customers on Brexit and outlined issues with respect to delays in the supply chain.  This year we have seen a major jump in the commercial scope of those discussions.  We have moved away from possible delays in the supply chain to looking at the cost of those non-tariff barriers and tariffs, as well as how this might affect commercial contracts.  That is largely how it has evolved over the past four years.</p></speech>

We have used that information to guide the work we do to ensure what we are doing is hitting the pain points of companies.  One part we probably have not spoken enough about is that we have also used this as a toolkit to show confidence to the market.  It is really important that when we speak to our UK customers, they do not have the impression that Ireland is not prepared and their supply chain may be at risk.  We and our team in the UK have been very diligent at making sure that our customers know that if they are looking at anywhere in Europe, the Irish food industry is best prepared for the obvious disruption that may occur.  We have used that data set at every meeting we run to give that confidence, and we are hearing back that it is working.</p> <p>  Many retailers may be frightened about having no product on a shelf because it loses money, in effect.  We can go in with this robust data set to market Irish food, which is fundamentally what we are trying to do, and we are using it for that purpose as much as we are using it to guide our way through any gaps we perceive or getting signals from the industry about.</p> <p>  Even when we speak about the agri-food industry's readiness etc., it is the responsibility of all of us to ensure we do not create jitters in the market.  The market should know the huge level of preparedness, although this does not undermine the huge risks we are facing.  We are very conscious of that but we would never leave an occasion go past without saying that our industry has put huge effort into this.  We can benchmark against any country around Europe and even the level of preparedness, investment and focus on this topic in the UK has been nowhere near ours.</p> <p>  On exports, it is not a "calf exporters association" but a live exporters association.  We have not got involved in who is in or not in it.  We put in a request to the industry so that we and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine could engage with the association.  We have not got involved to the level of who is in it or not.  We did not think it was within our remit.  We wanted to ensure it was representative so there was an efficiency and the committee's report would have suggested it was a requirement for the industry to advance.  We have not got involved on membership in any way.</p></speech>

We do a number of things with that funding.  There was mention of trade missions for livestock exporters and there have been four of those trade missions in the past three years to international markets.  It is a big focus of growth.  There is also the question of inward buyer visits in the livestock trade.  Buyers want to see animals and how they are produced on a farm so over the past number of years, we have had a series of inward buyer visits from six international markets, as well as all our major European markets, including Spain, Italy, the Netherlands etc.</p> <p>  Another area in which we have put more investment is Africa and the committee is aware that Algeria has come aboard as a new market for Irish livestock.  We have a dedicated market expert on the ground working for us in that region and that is important as we try to grow our trade to the region over the years to come.</p> <p>  There is also the area of trade shows, particularly in our main European markets.  These are the livestock shows that are really important for exporters and ourselves to engage with buyers or people who have bought from us in the past.  There is also the area of advertising and promotion.  From a welfare and transport perspective, it is important we are able to demonstrate the quality and integrity of the systems in Ireland for livestock.  These are a number of key areas on which we focus.</p> <p>  The trends in live exports vary annually but this year we are on track to export approximately 260,000 animals.  Our calf exports have been very negatively affected by the fall away in the veal sector in the Netherlands as a consequence of Covid-19 and a massive drop in the food service sector.  The majority of veal is sold through that food service sector.  Even allowing for that, there were 260,000 animals exported this year, we can compare this with approximately 150,000 animals per year in 2015 or 2016.  There has been progress made over the past five years in the numbers of animals exported and I hope we can make further progress.</p> <p>  There is no doubt but there are challenges coming down the track for 2021 as the veal sector is in a very difficult position.  It will have an impact on Irish calves in spring 2021.</p></speech>

There is a big roll-on, roll-off operation for the UK and we ship further afield to the world, going through Waterford or Dublin ports.  That is with the container traffic.  The roll-on, roll-off operation is a big worry no matter what we do.  At this point we have opened our accounts to pay for whatever duties may come and there is frustration at not knowing what will happen, where and when.  I know it is very frustrating for everybody in the room when we are trying to see which way the monkey will jump.  Ultimately, we need to be able to get our products into ports.</p> <p>  Currently, we have taken warehousing in the UK and have approximately a month's supply for customers.  We have a fairly large staff in the UK and have been trading over there since 1985 in horse and pet foods.  The biggest issue we have is that nobody can say exactly what will happen.  We could have anything from 10% duty on horse feed under World Trade Organization rules and even up to 32% on pet foods.</p><p>Many of our transport people ask us what we do about traffic and preparedness.  We would have to go back and ask the Department if it can give us more help.  As Mr. Roche said, our biggest problem is that if tariffs are applied to beef, there will be a shortage of cash and the whole business could stop.  If there is a lack of money and a lack of a market, there will be a serious problem.</p><p> We produce half of our grain requirements in Ireland.  Good quality grain has the same land requirement as good quality grass.  The competition between grass and grain is high.  There is a better return for the beef and dairy sectors for grass, so the competition for land is difficult.  In Ireland, even if we took every acre and put it all into grain, we would still not be able to provide soy beans and maize, which are requirements for the beef and dairy sectors.</p></speech>

It is a high proportion of a calf on which I make &euro;50 or &euro;60 in the ring, compared with a good suckler that goes abroad and makes &euro;1,400 or &euro;1,500.  It does not seem to be equitable.  I am not trying to question the fund.  It would still deliver the &euro;500,000 but it could be more equal.  While I accept that we have increased the amount of live exports, the amount of animals that we have available for live exports has increased dramatically too.</p></speech>

The witnesses might give clarity about what happened this year.  It was an unusual year with, I assume, few trade visits and little activity.  I assume that &euro;500,000 was not spent on promotion work for live exports.  I do not have a crystal ball but will Bord Bia have the capacity to do the visits next year?  If it had a windfall of &euro;1 million from this year and possibly next year, what would the long-term view of Bord Bia be about how it can go out to engage and get the opportunity to get back into these markets?  We do not know what Brexit or Covid will bring.  There will be significant changes to the veal trade, particularly on the Continent.  If we have that windfall, what will be the marketing policy in the new climate to ensure that we can get access to these markets?</p></speech>

They have bigger stands than Bord Bia to promote their products.  I see that Bord Bia went to three different places about live exports.  There is a 6% or 7% changeover in the British market, when we know that there could be serious consequences.  Should Bord Bia see if it can be more effective at selling for the Irish farmer, unfortunately at the bottom of the ladder with the average price over the last years, and having better productivity for the money involved?  Looking at the number of calves exported and the money spoken about here, there does not seem to be much emphasis on live exports.  Could that be looked at again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.110" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020121500002#M00500"><p>Regarding the bigger picture, this has been a challenging year for everybody, with ways of working that we would have expected to undertake when we presented our plans and programmes to our board last November compared with what we could actually do being dramatically different.  However, we were not sitting at home, looking out the window and wondering what was happening either.  We pivoted with regard to how we did our business.  We invested differently.  Many trade fairs that we planned to go to were cancelled.  We had already undertaken a trade mission in February and had planned another three throughout the year but we were grounded.</p> <p>  We have invested in virtual trade missions.  We do not believe it is a replacement for the real thing but it is much better than doing nothing.  We have invested in lead generation to identify who the buyers are and profile the buyers to know who we are targeting.  We have invested in communicating with those buyers so that they know that Ireland is open for business.  We have invested in getting those buyers to come to a virtual platform to meet Irish industry.  We are all experiencing a different world of engaging virtually rather than physically.  We trained companies about how to make a virtual pitch.  One normally gets a feel for a room but cannot do that virtually.  How does one create virtual pitches and what are the key messages that one gives?  How does one bring Irish agriculture to life when doing it on a video or digitally?  We have invested significantly in that to create the assets that the Irish food industry needs, whether in dairy, seafood or any other sector.  We have experimented in that space, attending virtual trade fairs and creating our own virtual trade missions.</p> <p>  Every time we changed a penny in how that fund was allocated, we brought it to our board to ensure that we had the rigour of governance behind it.  We never looked to squirrel away money or such but always went to the board when there was a change of priority or what was available to us, and a resulting change in activities or programmes.  I confirm that in every board meeting from April to December, we came back all the time with new ways of working and new platforms.  In November, we did five days of virtual trade missions.  We were the first organisation in the State to deliver virtual ministerial trade missions throughout the world.  We did virtual top-to-top meetings and had global trade meetings with our global customers.  We have substituted for being unable to go to market in our ways of working and invested accordingly to have the assets to do that.  I hope I have addressed the budget movements over Covid.</p> <p>  Looking at our productivity and how we are looking to return value for money, we have strict governance to ensure there is no opportunity for Bord Bia to hide from any key performance indicator or any deliverable.  We have five subsidiary boards and a main board which can interrogate our accounts and activities, receive advance plans of everything that we do, and receive presentations of what we have achieved and its impact.  We are proud of the productivity of the organisation with regard to the key performance indicators that we work towards, every part of which is shared with our board, on which there is significant farmer and industry representation.</p> <p>  We recruit for every trade fair.  One rule that we have for trade fairs is that only Irish products go on a Bord Bia stand.  If a company wants to sell a product that does not come from Ireland, we would prefer that it is not on our stand.  It is simple.</p><p>I have a question about the future, outside Covid and Brexit.  We do not know; it is crystal ball stuff.  Will Bord Bia be publishing a new smart food strategy in 2021 for the future and will it bring it before the committee at some stage so we can have a outline of what is proposed?  As Ms McCarthy said, we are in a completely new space.  We are living life as we have never lived it previously.  Virtual communication might or might not be the way forward.  Time will tell.  When does Ms McCarthy propose to have the new marketing ideas put forward?</p></speech>

However, we do our plans annually.  We are working and have had the first meeting of our strategic committee that is made up of our board and that supports us in designing our strategy.  That strategy will be worked on this year.  The proposal that we have put to the board is that we should have a ten-year strategy that feeds a three-year strategy that delivers a one-year plan.  We fundamentally believe that the timelines involved for the courageous moves that are required in agriculture probably need a ten-year timeframe to deliver some of the big impact pieces, but we must show what we can deliver in three years within that and what we deliver annually behind that.  We will be delighted to share with the committee the journey we are on for that, but we will be presenting our new strategy for 2022.</p></speech>

I listened to Ms McCarthy speak about the trade missions.  I specifically spoke about the meat industry and meat factories.  Some of them might take their own place at a trade mission.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12020121500002#A00300"><p>My thanks to you, Chairman, and the members of the select committee for facilitating the urgent discussion on these two important international agreements that I signed with Denmark and Estonia last week.</p> <p>  Ireland committed to achieving our 2009 renewable energy directive target of meeting 16% of energy demand from renewable sources by the end of 2020.  While good progress has been made to date, especially in renewable electricity, where we have achieved 36.5% in 2019 as against our target of 40%, it is projected that a shortfall of between 3% and 4% is likely by year end.  In terms of renewable heat, Ireland is projected to achieve approximately 50% of the 12% target by 2020.  Ireland is not alone among member states that will fall short of their binding renewable energy targets.</p> <p>  To meet the 2020 target and ensure compliance with the directive, my Department has negotiated international agreements with Estonia and Denmark to purchase statistical transfers for 2020.  Following Government approval on 24 November, I signed both agreements in Dublin earlier this month and they will enter into force subject to ratification by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>  In terms of costs, the State will pay &euro;37.5 million to Estonia for the purchase of 2.5 terawatt hours, TWh, of energy and &euro;12.5 million to Denmark for a volume of 1 TWh of energy.  In total, the State will procure 3.5 TWh of renewable energy at a cost of &euro;50 million.  This is a significant cost to the State but it is important to point out that the funds received by both Estonia and Denmark will be used to accelerate deployment of renewable electricity in their jurisdictions in line with their national energy and climate plans.  While it was not our preference to achieve compliance via this mechanism, which is available to all member states under the directive, we have exhausted all alternative options for compliance through short-term action.  This mechanism is part of the European architecture under the 2009 renewable energy directive designed to allow member states meet their targets.  Ireland is not alone in that Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands have all concluded similar arrangements in recent years.</p> <p>  Since the Government took office in June, it has launched the first auction under the transformational renewable electricity support scheme.  This will see a major upscaling in renewable energy projects connecting to the grid from 2021, with, for the first time, solar energy and community-owned projects supplying homes across Ireland.  Similarly, we are rolling out schemes to decarbonise and electrify our heat and transport sectors and combine these with a renewable electricity supply that is the envy of the world.  Already, Ireland has surpassed Denmark as the number one in onshore wind power in Europe and soon the first offshore wind farms will be connecting to our grid, charging our electric vehicles and powering heat pumps throughout the country.  Through the support scheme for renewable heat, substantial progress will be delivered in decarbonising our heat sector and weaning ourselves off fossil fuels.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, these policies and programmes will not be deployed in time to contribute significantly towards our 2020 targets, and it is important for Ireland to demonstrate its commitment to meeting renewable energy targets and honouring its EU commitments as part of the wider aspirations of the EU Green Deal.  The necessary funds are available in my Department's Vote this year.  It is important to point out to committee members that the money will be used by the member states concerned to promote renewable energy projects within their countries.  I am confident other opportunities may be afforded to Ireland in future to work closely with our EU partners on meeting renewable targets.</p> <p>  Both of the agreements are with EU members states with which Ireland shares a common commitment to taking robust climate action, to accelerating the roll-out of renewable energy to supply our grid, to heat our homes and to move our people as part of an integrated transport network.  Like Ireland, Denmark and Estonia are small countries with a strong European identity which have a shared ambition in developing offshore wind resources as well as a strong commitment to the digital economy.</p><p>I hope that these agreements will strengthen future co-operation between Ireland and its fellow member states to tackle the climate emergency and put citizens at the heart of the climate transition.    </p><p> Regarding the setting of climate targets more broadly and future compliance costs, I stress that the overarching context of the 2030 climate targets was Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the goals and objectives of the 2015 Paris Agreement and regard for the evolution of climate and energy policy at EU level.  The negotiations led to an EU-wide binding renewable energy target of 32% by 2030, with national contributions to be identified through the national energy and climate plan process.  The solution to avoiding future costs for statistical transfers or other such measures is not to reduce ambition; it is to accelerate delivery across all the Departments and State agencies concerned.  These costs to the State act as a reminder of the shared EU commitment to climate action and the failure to deliver.  </p><p> The programme for Government acknowledges the increased effort required at national level to meet the global climate challenge and commits Ireland to a 7% annual average greenhouse gas emissions reduction between now and 2030.  When compared with the new EU-wide target in the European Green New Deal, the level of ambition in the programme for Government comes out at between 55% and 60%.  The overall objective of the programme's climate and energy commitments is to underpin the long-term, sustainable competitiveness of the economy as we transition from a redundant fossil-fuel based economic model to a carbon-neutral one.  The transition will support further job creation through the development of new and emerging sectors.  The climate action plan, which will be forthcoming next year, will further step up our ambitions with necessary actions to ensure that the cross-government effort required is being implemented and monitored effectively. </p><p> The green economy, including the retrofitting and renewable energy sector, the circular economy, clean mobility, green and blue infrastructure, sustainable agriculture and the bioeconomy, will all create high-quality employment opportunities that will be a source of significant employment growth over the coming decades.  I am confident these enduring benefits will outweigh any short-term costs and I look forward to working with the committee in future on delivering on this ambitious agenda.  I thank the committee for its attention, and I am happy to take questions. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12020121500002#B00300"><p>I thank the Minister for bringing this to us today.  To say it is not ideal is a bit of an understatement.  We are where we are, however.  If anything, this agreement underlines and further emphasises the need for immediate action in respect of our goals regarding the reduction of emissions and meeting our targets.  The figure of &euro;50 million is one we could use here in our economy and put into our own infrastructure, but this is what we have met with.  The point I am trying to make is that this necessity underlines and re-emphasises the importance of meeting our goals.</p> <p>  In that regard, I have some questions concerning updates on particular steps.  The first is marine planning legislation, which is going to be vital in stepping up our ambition in offshore wind energy.  Where does that legislation stand and what kind of timelines can we expect for a Bill coming through the Houses?  I would also like to get the thoughts of the Minister regarding wind energy.  The possibilities of offshore wind are spoken about a great deal, but there is also a major part to play for onshore wind in reaching our renewable energy goals.  It has huge part to play in helping us to do that, although I know it is difficult and can be contentious.  I believe, however, that there should be an emphasis on continuing onshore wind projects, where possible.</p> <p>  Turning to retrofitting, which is obviously a major part of the programme for Government and how we achieve more efficient heating, could the Minister update us on where that scheme stands?  As we know, the current Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, scheme is caught up in administration.  There are some long waiting times, up to six months in some instances, where people are put in applications for the SEAI grant to retrofit their homes.  That needs to be addressed.  Is there a plan to bolster the staff complement administering that scheme so that applications can be dealt with faster?</p> <p>  Finally, and this is not quite under the remit of the Minister, but he might have answers to this question since he is in Cabinet. A robust, extensive and significant agri-environmental scheme is absolutely vital in ensuring that in some years' time we are not facing these types of penalties again.  It is not only that aspect which is important, but also bringing the farming community and the industry with us in reaching our goals.  One of the most important elements of the programme for Government is the introduction of  results-based agri-environmental schemes, where farmers are being encouraged to not only protect but enhance and increase biodiversity on their land.  The sequestration element of native woodlands must also be considered.  Where do we stand with that?  I appreciate that the Minister may not be able to provide a detailed update on that, but I would just like to emphasise its importance.  I have probably gone a bit over my time, I am sorry.</p></speech>

There are questions on four areas there for the Minister - the timeline for the marine planning and development management Bill, plans for onshore wind, retrofitting, including plans, waiting times and SEAI grants, and the agri-environmental scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12020121500002#B00500"><p>I agree with the Deputy that this agreement is unfortunate and we must ensure it does not happen again, as best we can.  I refer to investing in our own country and ensuring that we meet our targets.  The Deputy is also absolutely right that the marine planning and development management Bill is critical legislation in that regard, because we have potential in offshore wind to deliver.  I think there is agreement across most parties on that, and the outgoing Oireachtas agreed it in the climate action plan.  There was a target of 70% renewable electricity, and broad agreement that something like 35 GW of offshore wind could help us to deliver that target.  The full 35 GW will probably happen at a later date, but the path to achieving that will allow us to meet the 70% target of renewable electricity.</p> <p>  The Government has three clear legislative priorities.  I heard the Taoiseach state this on several occasions and he is correct.  We need the climate Bill as the governance structure; we need the Land Development Agency because the housing crisis is a central problem; and the third Bill mentioned as top priority is marine planning and development management legislation.  It needs to be in place so that by the end of next year we go to having an auction system for that offshore wind.  There will probably be some 2.5 GW of offshore wind in the Irish Sea, and then subsequent options in short order after that development to roll-out that offshore wind aspect.  </p> <p>  The planning legislation is critical in this regard so that we can have good environmental planning, manage our agriculture and fisheries and other elements at the same time and ensure that we get certainty, reliability and predictability in bringing costs down.  My understanding is the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has responsibility for delivering it.  Every effort is being made to publish that legislation early in the new year, as I understand it.  The heads of the Bill came to Government a few weeks ago and it is getting top priority from the Office of the Attorney General.  I expect the Bill to be ready, therefore, early in the new year.</p> <p>  Moving on to the issue of onshore wind, the Deputy is correct that it will continue to have an important role, particularly because we have a comparative competitive cost advantage.  It is a lower cost system.  The recent auction where we approved a range of new onshore wind farms, as well as, importantly, solar farms, is critical in this regard.  Going on memory, and my officials will correct me, the contract price we struck was approximately &euro;74 per MWh, which is approximately 20% below that of the existing renewable support schemes.  I want to see the price come down more.  It can and will and should.  Onshore wind energy, therefore, has a critical role to play.  </p> <p>  There is a limit, however, and that is why we are looking at what is possible offshore.  There are planning constraints on that, as we saw recently in Donegal, and we must, therefore, be careful in that regard.  I agree with the Deputy, however, that onshore wind has a critical role to play in this area.  The development of community ownership of onshore wind is also critical, and we are also looking to promote that element.  We did it in the latest auction, and we will do so again.  We also want there to be community gain from onshore wind projects, which is stitched into the auction process.</p><p>The Deputy is correct that the SEAI was limited in its capacity.  Part of our difficulty in the heat sector is that we have not been able to ramp up in both commercial and domestic heat.  That is one of the reasons in the recent budget we sought approval for a significant increase of more than 50 new posts for the SEAI.  This recognises that we do not face this situation in future.  We have seen a massive expansion in the retrofitting budget and the SEAI's management of it.  The company is currently filling those places.  We have significant plans for next year.  We have a budget agreed this year of more than &euro;750 million, most of which is targeted towards local authority housing and the warmer home schemes, where some of the specific backlogs to which the Deputy referred are arising.  The scheme is popular, not surprisingly because it is a 100% grant.  It gives significant health and comfort benefits as well as benefits to the buildings.  It is key.</p><p> I agree with the Deputy on the need for a much wider agri-environmental scheme.  Again, it started in this budget with an allocation of &euro;70 million to a new environmental scheme.  It is well structured in the sense that it will fund a lot of investment in training, soil analysis and scientific preparation for the supports we will need to give to pay farmers for environmental services such as improvements in water quality, storage of carbon and improving biodiversity, as well as food.  These nature-based solutions, coming in tandem with the climate solutions, are absolutely critical to where we want to go.</p><p> Last but not least, we must pay for new forms of forestry such as closer to nature and continuous cover forestry, which are rich in employment, promote rich biodiversity and have a much longer term timeline but have real benefits in terms of high-quality woods for a range of different uses, including renewable heat which will help us meet future targets.  I agree with the Deputy on the need for that.  That will be the start of a big scale-up in our ambition.</p></speech>

I spent 18 months in the Department and enjoyed the work there.  It is crucially important to the future of this country.  The Minister is well suited to the task.  I hope the framework that we sought to put in place over the past couple of years with the climate action plan, the implementation board and the draft climate Bill has laid a foundation for the work he is undertaking.  I welcome the enhanced ambition at 51%, which is going to represent a significant change in the coming decade.</p> <p>  On the 55% decision made by the European Council to reduce Bonn 1990 levels by 55%, at what point will it become clear what Ireland's contribution will be?  What progress has been made in the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auctions, particularly the community pot?  This will be important in building community support over time to the switch to renewables.  How is that going and will we see further development in that area?</p> <p>  On the offshore issue, it will present a real opportunity for Ireland in the long term.  Will the State commit in the new economic plan to putting in the platform infrastructure required to see this take off rather than rely on individual commercial operators bringing renewables ashore one by one?</p> <p>  When does the Minister plan to bring forward the national energy plan, an obligation we have to the EU, and the next climate action plan?  These would give this committee an opportunity to move on from the legislative framework, which is extremely important, to the practical policy initiatives that we now need to be socialising to achieve the targets we are setting for 2030?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12020121500002#C00300"><p>Deputy Bruton's work in those 18 months was of huge importance.  We had an Oireachtas joint committee which worked collectively before.  This was backed up by an approach from the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, which put much of the thinking into the 2019 climate action plan that he devised.  His previous experience with the jobs action plan and in different Departments also went into it.  As I said at the time and have said publicly since, the structure and the approach was the right one.  We are looking to continue that.  We actually submitted that existing plan, as required under European legislation, at the start of the summer.  At the time, we said we were looking to use those structures and the governance approach but, as per the programme for Government, increase the ambition.  The jobs action plan, climate action plan and multiproject timetabled systemic approach is the right approach and a real credit to Deputy Bruton.</p> <p>  Within that, the European Council decision last week to go to a 55% ambition is significant and progressive step.  I will have to come back to talk to Deputy Bruton after this Thursday because I am due to go to the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday.  Some of those details of where we will go next with effort-sharing decisions will only be worked out then.  We could not really decide on that in advance of the climate conclusions.  Just as the committee is finalising its report on climate legislation, there is real urgency in the European Council that we turn the Heads of Government agreement into climate law in the European Union and set out the effort-sharing mechanism for each member state.  That will apply to climate emissions.</p> <p>  I also expect it to apply to both renewables and the energy efficiency targets which are 32% and 32.5%, respectively, in the plans to date.  These will be different from what we are dealing with here in that to date they have not been country-specific targets.  We can expect significant ramping up of both the climate emissions targets, the energy efficiency targets and renewable energy targets.  That is in tune with the programme for Government.  It is appropriate we made that decision back in June and July because it puts us in line with where the European Union and similar states are going.</p> <p>  With regard to the RESS auctions and the community pot, it has been difficult for us and it has taken a long time to develop community energy projects.  In truth, the Templederry community wind farm is the one notable example of a project at scale.  It was welcome in the recent RESS auction system that seven projects were approved in the process.  We are restricted under European Union competition rules as to how much of the auction process can be allocated for a community pot.  It is a 2% overall limit.  We are one of the few countries that has got an agreement from the European Union to allocate a specific community fund within the auction system.  We are looking to continue that with the next auction next year.  It may well evolve towards a 100% community-owned project approach.  We have had a push to date for community projects where private developers can row in with a share of the project.</p><p>I am keen, given the small allocation within that overall pot, for there to be as much community ownership as possible but we will continue to monitor and address that and consider other mechanisms.  This is something that is evolving.  It is not only on the energy side.  We always focus on the generation but forget that efficiency comes first.  The first most important fuel is energy not used.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's work on sustainable energy communities has been significant.  More than 200 plus communities engaged with it to devise plans.  Many of them relate not only to energy generation but to potential energy savings, co-ordination around retrofitting or other mechanisms to go into energy saving.</p><p> On the community energy side, I expect within the coming weeks to issue a public consultation on the switch towards a mechanism for us to be able to sell power back to the grid and to promote what we have been talking about for a long time but which has not taken off at scale yet, namely, the ability particularly for solar power to be done at a community level, with easy access to the grid and a price guaranteed for power that is exported where existing demand has already been met.</p><p> The Deputy raised a wide range of issues.  The development of offshore wind will require a great deal of State involvement in a variety of ways.  First, we will have to look at our ports to see how we can support the development of the offshore wind industry that is coming into play.  That can include in certain ports operations and maintenance facilities, which will be an important part.  In others, it may be a deployment facility where an area is needed to store, assemble and prepare for the installation of wind farms and beyond that, thinking bigger, looking at the generation of a new industrial supply chain around not only the development, particularly in the long run, of the offshore floating wind energy but the development of the use of the power that comes back in, where there is massive potential for economic development in our port areas and regional development.  </p><p> Increasingly, people are considering hydrogen as a storage mechanism for conversion by electrolysis of offshore wind to such power supplies which provide the potential for our ports not only to be assembly or development points for offshore wind but to be the capture point of the energy and the deployment of the energy in new industrial uses close to the source of the power.  That is the long-term prize and the reason the marine planning and development legislation is such a priority for the Government.  It will be a long process and we expect the first auction of offshore wind energy will be at the end of next year.  It will be targeted in the Irish Sea area and will involve some 2.5 GW of offshore wind.  It will deal with many legacy projects which have licensing, in some instances, going back a decade.  In the first instance, because of the short distances involved and many of the existing licensing and other arrangements are in place and grid offers and connections are organised, it will involve tiebacks to the system, particularly being close to Dublin where much of the demand is, that makes sense.  We would be tying industrial development with renewable power.  We have that in terms of offshore developments that will occur on the east coast.  That auction at the end of next year will be followed by other auctions, where we start to move into the Celtic Sea and look at the western coast and offshore floating wind energy.  The scale of power there is beyond compare.  If we were to develop that initial target of 30 GW of offshore wind, particularly floating offshore wind, it would be six times peak demand at the moment, which gives a sense of the scale of opportunity.  However, in this instance to get it right, the State has a key role to play not only in the ports to support that but in the management and development of the grid.  The question at issue is how do we collect, share, distribute and use that power.  In that instance, companies like EirGrid will have a critical role to play.  </p><p> Interestingly, I will be going to the Environment Council meeting on Thursday but I spent most of yesterday at the European Energy Council meeting and I also attended a meeting with the North Sea countries' offshore grid initiative, which is something I was proud to sign ten years earlier.  This is centre stage in European economic plans.  This is what every country is talking about as their main focus.  Most of the meeting of the energy ministers yesterday was taken up with the development of offshore wind and the use of the power using new power supplies like hydrogen.  We have a comparative competitive advantage.  We have the wind dislocation and a sea area ten times our land area.  I spoke to the Norwegian Minister and heard that Norway has already deployed an 80 MW floating offshore wind field.  We can expect the cost to come down and, subject to that, we can expect a major new industrial opportunity to open up for our country, in which the State will have to be centrally involved, particularly on grid planning.  </p><p> I hope I have addressed most of the questions.  Regarding the national energy climate action plan, as I said, we submitted the outgoing 2019 plan to meet our European obligations and they allowed the European Union to close the book, as it were, on the existing national energy and climate plans, NECPs, and to do a new impact assessment on what additional capabilities there are for each country.  The Commissioner is in the middle of that process.  We go into the new year with the aim of having an updated climate action plan which goes with at least a 7% reduction a year in a decade, a 51% reduction over the decade, and set that as our goal.  We aim to engage with all Departments and agencies to have that plan by summer next year.  It will be quite a tight timeline to get the plan completed in that time, as the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, will know, but one of the reasons we have that timeframe is to fit into the European NECP process and for us to be able to go to Glasgow next year with a clear understanding of what our role is in this transformation.</p><p> One of the urgencies around the climate action Bill is that I am keen that work is done in tandem with our ability to have a new climate advisory council in place for it to feed into and for its budgeting and three five-year process to be in sync with that same timetable.  They will not be exactly in sync but that makes sense.  Another reason it makes sense is that I expect those first six months next year to be critical for the review of the national development plan.  It is critical we have the new climate action plan in tandem with the national development plan review.  That is the reason this timing is as tight as it is but it is appropriate in my mind.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12020121500002#D00400"><p>I thank the Minister for attending today.  It is beneficial we are having this discussion and that there will be a debate in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  It is important the public get to see there are not only environmental costs to us not meeting our targets but economic and social costs.  I note the Minister said this money will be going to Estonia and Denmark and will be contributing to them investing in their public infrastructure in renewables.  My preference would have been that it stayed in Ireland and would have been invested in contributing to us meeting our targets.  That would have been a much better use of the money.  The sum of &euro;50 million is a considerable amount of money to be transferring overseas.  It could have paid for 5,000 solar panels on schools or retrofitted 2,500 homes.  It is not an insignificant amount of money but it is good we are having this debate.</p> <p>  I have some specific questions on the cost of the transfer.  If time permits, I also have some broader questions and if I could proceed that way, it would be good.  The statistical transfer is directed to two countries.  The transfer to Estonia is costing &euro;15 per MW hour and the transfer to Denmark is costing &euro;12.5 per MW hour.  There is quite a differential between the two.  One terawatt hour of energy to Denmark is costing &euro;12.5 million and for Estonia it is costing &euro;37.5 million.</p><p>I had a look back and the agreement between the Netherlands and Denmark was also &euro;12.50 per megawatt hour, and similarly with Luxembourg and Lithuania.  Why are we paying Estonia &euro;15 per megawatt hour, as opposed to &euro;12.50, which seems to be the going rate?</p></speech>

My understanding is that there were not many countries where there were potential bidders and there was a limited volume available so that may have been a factor.  I will ask Mr. Confrey to come in on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.142" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Confrey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12020121500002#E00300"><p>It is precisely for that reason: it is a question of supply and demand.  Unfortunately, Denmark was not able to give us any more volume than 1 terawatt hour.  Estonia was, but it drew a higher price.  We are not the only member state that is in the market for these particular transfers.</p> <p>  As part of the agreements, we have purchased fixed and optional quantities.  The fixed is what is before the committee today in terms of the &euro;50 million in overall terms, but we reserve the right to purchase future optional amounts with Denmark at that lower price, should that be needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12020121500002#E00400"><p>The reason for that, as I understand it, is that we are not yet at the end of the year and we will not know our final year figure until next year.  There may need to be a balancing of a much smaller volume, of the order of &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million.  It could be more or less: it is hard to know until we get the statistical analysis as to what the final outcome is this year.  That option is on the balancing figure, whatever number it is.</p></speech>

While Denmark did not have enough to give to us upfront, does it have optional capacity, so we can go back to the table and get some more?  I do not quite understand how it did not have capacity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.145" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Confrey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12020121500002#E00600"><p>Denmark did not have the volume this year.  The agreement Deputy Whitmore referenced was between the Netherlands and Denmark.  The total was 16 terawatt hours.  The Netherlands has purchased 8 terawatt hours, as Deputy Whitmore correctly points out, at &euro;12.50 per megawatt hour.  Essentially, most of the surplus that Denmark has, is going towards the Dutch agreement, if we can put it that way, so that is why Denmark was not able to offer us any more, but they are confident that they can offer us what the Netherlands may not need next year, should we require it, but at the lower price.</p></speech>

I imagine the supply and demand would have been different then.  Why did we not have an agreement in place earlier?  It seems that we could be one of the last countries to establish such an agreement.  Is that correct?  Could we have got a better deal if we had begun to negotiate earlier?  We have missed our targets every year since 2017.  It did not come as a surprise that we were going to miss the target.  Would it have made a financial difference if we had begun the negotiations earlier?</p></speech>

Whether we could have achieved better value remains to be seen.  An opportunity arose this year because of the funds that have become available from savings elsewhere in the Vote.  That opportunity was not open to us in previous years.  It is a significant cost.  We are one of a smallish number of member states that are going to be in deficit so we are, unfortunately, at the mercy, if I can put it that way, of the supply and demand in terms of the costs that are being charged.</p></speech>

The Minister was talking about how we are going to make sure that we do not miss targets on the infrastructure.  It is important that we get moving on the infrastructure.  There is a significant lag time in developing that kind of renewable energy infrastructure.  One of the points that really struck me with the programme for Government is that the target for something relatively simple like retrofitting homes was a 2030 target.  Why was the target back-loaded?  A regulatory framework must be put in place for wind farms and then the engineering of the infrastructure will take a considerable period.  I would have thought retrofitting could have been front-loaded and that we could have invested heavily in it, allowing us to create jobs, plus reduce emissions.  I am just wondering why that was the case.  What I find most difficult about addressing our climate responsibilities is our speed of action for even simple things.  The roll-out of electric vehicle, EV, charging points or smart meters seems difficult.  Does the Minister think that is a barrier to doing the big infrastructure programmes?</p> <p>  My two questions are on why the retrofitting of houses was not front-loaded and on the speed of our implementation.  Does the Minister see it as a significant barrier?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12020121500002#E01200"><p>The retrofitting of 50,000 houses is probably going to be one of the most complex targets because we are talking about 50,000 families and 50,000 different types of house.  Sometimes it is easier to do one big project than 50,000 individual ones.  They are not small projects.  We are talking about deep retrofitting.  The cost is not insignificant at between &euro;30,000 and &euro;50,000 a year depending on the house.  The key will be public buy-in and that it is seen as a good investment and it is the right thing to do.  One of the reasons it may take time to ramp up is due to the fact that at the moment we do not have the workers in place with the necessary skills to do the work at that scale.  As part of the summer economic stimulus package and again in the budget we significantly invested in new apprenticeships and education and training programmes for people with the necessary skills.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, spoke earlier this morning about how we are going to ramp that up.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions estimates that we need something like 30,000 jobs in the area.  In truth, a year ago, if one talked to people in the industry, they could not get anyone as there was a labour shortage.  That has changed now because we have such high unemployment but even then, it will take time for us to ramp up the skills to be able to do that work, which is skilled and labour intensive.  It will also take us time to set up and put in place, but I am confident we can do it in the early to middle part of next year in terms of providing the necessary finance and other mechanisms.  It will be a case of learning from neighbours.  That will help to determine our ambition, which is that it will build up and ramp up very significantly.  That is not a small challenge, and in some ways, it is probably bigger.  It would be much easier to deliver 5 gigawatts of offshore wind in the next ten years than it would be to retrofit 50,000 houses because we are talking about seven or eight projects and one client compared to 500,000 projects.</p> <p>  Increasingly, one of the reasons it seems to take very long to do anything in the country is the planning process.  The timeline for a project of any scale is at least ten years.  That hinders flexibility, speed, action on climate and so on.  On the other hand, one wants to get the planning right.  One wants to get consultation right and to have public support and engagement.  There is an issue regarding resources and planning officers within the planning system.  It is very frustrating for all concerned, whether one is an objector or a developer.  It is a ten-year process one is engaged in whether one is worried about one's local community being affected or what one's investment prospects are.</p><p>In this instance the issue is more about resources the State controls, but the key obstacle to further speed is resources in the planning system.  I will be pushing and supporting my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in every turn to get those supports.  Investing in planning resources allows us to maintain the twin objectives of getting good planning but not having a ten-year wait for everything.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12020121500002#F00200"><p>My thanks to the Minister for the presentation.  I want to comment on what we are doing today.  Most people will look at this and ask what we are buying for &euro;50 million.  In the past, at least, the Minister would have agreed with me that these accountancy tricks - that is basically what they are - completely fail in the attempt to deal with our climate challenge and crisis.  This is a failure and we should acknowledge that it is a failure.  Since we have failed to reach our legally binding targets we are buying fantasy energy credits from Denmark and Estonia.  This energy will not heat homes or help to produce power that will run factories or anything else.  The energy is fantasy but the money - the &euro;50 million - is absolutely real.  That real &euro;50 million could have paid student nurses or could have been involved in all manner of community projects.  As was mentioned, it could have been used to help retrofit homes and solar power schools.  We should spend some time thinking about why we failed.</p> <p>  I do not believe it is simply an oversight or a technical matter.  Ministers may pat each other on the back for what they have done to reach renewable energy targets, but the case remains that we are still overwhelmingly reliant on fossil fuels in every category, including electricity, heating and transport.  It is worth noting that our targets are percentages of the overall electricity and energy demand.</p> <p>  The Minister talks about the drive to industrialise and develop the ports and create all this new economic energy.  Our demand for electricity will go up and, therefore, the overall percentage will go up that is allocated to fossil fuels.  It could actually mean a larger volume of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>  My main point is that the failure of the last Government, the previous Government of Fine Gael with the Labour Party, the Government of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party and all the combinations of Governments is something that we need to be cautious about when we are being given commitments that new targets will be set and that they will not fail.  We hear that the reason they have failed is because of planning difficulties and upsets in the markets.  Although it has not been said explicitly, we hear that maybe even community opposition to some renewable projects is a cause.</p> <p>  I fear that the root cause is none of these.  The reason for past and future failures is the reliance on private enterprise to deliver the targets we need in renewable energy.  Deputy Bruton mentioned the climate action plan, as did the Minister.  We worked and looked at this.  One of the recommendations we made, although I have no doubt it has not been acted on, was that we would look at the possibility of a State-run, State-led renewable energy company that could be invested in to deliver the targets we need to reach instead of always relying on the investment decisions of private corporations and actors which are sometimes nudged and guided by State incentives.  The failure rests ultimately on the policy that holds that we have to rely on the private sector.</p> <p>  This raises an interesting current question for us.  If we continue to do this, if we continue to rely on a sector that may or may not invest or may or may not expand on this area, depending on how profitable it is, then how are we to handle the sector in a situation where we sign off on the CETA agreement?  We did not do it today but I note the intent of the Government to do it in the next month or so.  That would really copper-fasten the idea that the State cannot and will not see any prospect of taking ownership of the kind of decisions we may need to guarantee that we could reach our energy targets in future.  It would really make it impossible for the State to set up publicly owned renewable energy companies if the private sector was already in place.  The legal challenges would be so great.  I would appreciate if the Minister would comment on that and on my overall contention.  I believe we need an ESB-style determined State company, like we had in the past when we had few or no resources in the country.  Such a body could really drive forward the switch to renewables, just as the ESB turned on the lights in every corner of the country in decades gone by.</p></speech>

I have faith in that because I have faith in our European system.  It is something we committed to under the renewables directive in 2007, when it was originally framed.  It was designed to provide what was not a get-out or accounting trick but a mechanism or stick for states.  The idea was that if a state is not meeting its targets, it will have to meet them another way and pay.  This is a stick.  At the same time, I believe it is an appropriate stick that promotes or encourages those who have met targets.  In a sense, it rewards them.  They get the cash, but it can only be invested in renewable projects.  I agree with the European directive.  I was involved in framing it, so I suppose I would, but I believe it was an appropriate mechanism.</p> <p>  Deputy Smith is absolutely right about electricity and energy demand being the key and first priority.  There is always a focus on generation.  That is why, in some ways, the heat target is especially important.  One key project we are going to do involves electrifying the generation of heat through the use of heat pumps.  We all know that heat pumps do not work if they are not deployed in a building that is efficient.  The dual tack involves insulating, and therefore promote energy efficiency, as well as using electricity to power heat pumps, which is a highly efficient use of electricity.  This is where we are going to go.  This is ending the use of fossil fuels in oil-fired and gas-fired burners and heating systems and ending the burning of coal or other smoky fuels.  It means radically investing in energy efficiency first and heat pumps to warm far more efficient buildings.</p> <p>  I want to give a sense that this is possible.  There are many examples of where we are not delivering it.  There is one key issue around electricity demand in the past ten years.  People will know that we recently reached a new peak in electricity consumption.  Two weeks ago, electricity consumption peaked at 5,100 MW or 5,200 MW on a Thursday evening.  In truth, that is the same level, effectively, that had been in place over ten or 12 years ago.  Our economy has grown significantly in the intervening period.  It is possible for us to create employment and run our economy without necessarily having a vast expansion in our electricity use.  Our economy in the intervening ten-year period must have grown by between 50% and 80% if we do the mathematics based on 5% or 6% growth each year, on average.  Electricity demand did not grow commensurately.  Thus, we can promote energy efficiency in everything we do.</p> <p>  Why is it that we did not meet targets?  Why is it that we do not compare well with Denmark or other countries that clearly have done so?  It is demonstrated by the fact that we are paying them or Estonia for their projects.  They have a tradition at it.  They have been going at it for approximately 40 or 50 years.  The Estonians and others, especially the Danes, responded to the first oil crisis in the late 1970s by investing in wind generation.  They developed a comparative competitive advantage in this as well as in district heating.  They developed real efficiency around district heating.  The significance and importance of that area is underestimated in terms of how we meet the next targets.  The 40-year advantage is what those countries have in the sense of understanding that this is going to be good for us as an economy.</p><p>A whole range of companies developed in the areas of energy efficiency, heat management and district heat management out of that strategic decision made 40 years ago in Denmark, and not just Vestas Wind Systems in wind turbines.  We must develop in the same way and have the same widespread public understanding that this is the better solution and the direction in which we are going to go.  I think the Irish people are there.  I agree with the Deputy, and blaming communities is not the approach I would take in this regard.  I think Irish people are waiting for the correct signals, supports and regulatory systems that will deliver this new energy-efficient heating system.  The climate action plan can and will deliver the required systemic approach.</p><p> Turning to the aspect of public versus private enterprise, both will be involved.  The State has a role, as do community energy projects.  Large-scale interventions by the State, such as by the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na, have real scaling efficiencies in energy systems and logistics.  I am committed to supporting Bord na M&oacute;na as it moves from being a brown company to a green one and to defining itself as a climate solutions company, endeavouring to use its resources and expertise in engineering, which it has in abundance, in furthering our renewable energy future.  It is the same with the ESB and any other public bodies moving into this space.  That does not preclude private companies being involved, however.  Those 50,000 homes will be retrofitted by a host of Irish building businesses of different sizes, and that is appropriate.  Many Irish companies have expertise in this area.  We want to encourage that and allow them to flourish so they can grow to become major exporting companies for us, in the same way those Danish companies did in the 1970s.</p><p> In that regard, my clear understanding of the policy of the European Union, in respect of CETA or any other policy, is that public policy aims in respect of the environment are protected.  DG Competition keeps a close eye on whether there is inappropriate market manipulation or state aid which undermines the competitive market, but it is not a matter of ruling differently concerning private or public enterprise in that regard.  In that context, it was interesting that much of the discussion at the meeting of the Energy Council yesterday concerned the need for DG Competition to be aware that we need flexibility in how we apply competition rules so that we can get innovation and development.  A key issue across Europe, as well in the trade negotiations with the UK, concerns how we can maintain a level playing field while at the same time protecting our environmental and social standards.  We need to do that, because this is the future economy and we must ensure that it is not a race to the bottom.  It must allow communities, State companies and private enterprises to work in a fair way.</p></speech>

The former Minister, Deputy Bruton, has left now, but he might have been able to comment on whether CETA impinged on his portfolio or came across his desk when he was in office in respect of being a restriction on any investment or policy decisions.  I have not seen it mentioned once in any consideration of any energy policy decisions so far.  If I do, I will happily share that information with the Deputy and raise similar concerns to those which she would have.</p> <p>  We must evolve our international trade rules and ensure that they are in step with environmental and social objectives.  It is an evolving process, and no one is saying that it is a perfect system now.  We seek to change it as we do further trade deals with other countries.  We have 40 such deals in place now and another ten are on the horizon.  The critical thing is to ensure that we continue to evolve the rules so that they are in step with our climate ambition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12020121500002#G00900"><p>Some of the language here is almost Orwellian.  I refer to anyone looking in and hearing talk of statistical transfers and proposed ratification of agreements for target compliance purposes.  This is a &euro;50 million fine for failing to meet agreed targets, and we should be explicit about that.  It is slightly more complicated in respect of the mechanisms, but we should be straight in this regard.</p> <p>  For clarification purposes, a small number of European states are in the same boat as ourselves, including Malta, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.  Are there others, or is it only those countries?  Regarding the targets, the Minister touched on some of the reasons he thinks we missed them.  It is important that we think about that aspect and seek to address it.  He also mentioned that Denmark more or less had a 40-year head start on us in this area.  Are there other reasons, however, he thinks we have missed these targets?  Were those targets fair and reasonable at the outset?  In the briefing note, it is stated that our starting point was 2005, when it was 3.1%, and we had to make up 12.9% over the 15 years.  When did we commit to that?  Was it in 2009 or later?  I am just trying to get a sense of what the expectation was for us.  Was it to achieve about 1% in reductions per year?  That strikes me as reasonable, and gives some perspective on the scale of our failure, for want of a better phrase.  Regarding the 2.5 TWh of energy, is that the equivalent of the 3% to 4% and is it a direct comparator?</p> <p>  Turning to the Minister's opening statement, and the 55% to 60% equivalence with the EU-wide target, I raise this in respect of the programme for Government commitment and the figure of 51% which has been widely mentioned in public.  Is the difference there in the comparable baseline figure?  Are we talking about a 2018 baseline figure compared with a 2019 baseline figure, for example?  I ask that because it is generally helpful to be clear and consistent in respect of our terminology and how we report these things.  Otherwise, it can seem as if we are massaging figures or using them in different ways.  I am not suggesting that is what is happening here.  I just think there is a benefit in a consistency of approach.</p> <p>On a related issue, the guidelines for onshore wind farms are long out of date.  Will the Minister give us an update on where we are at with new guidelines and when we will see them published?</p></speech>

It is a structure, as I said, which has been designed to be a deterrent and a way of enforcing the targets so that people have something to fear and avoid.</p><p>That is the reason we would aim for it.  The Deputy is right.  With those added complications the fine does not just go into a bunker, so to speak.  It is deployed in a way that is beneficial to the wider environment but there are no two ways about it.  There is no Orwellian mixing-up of language here.  This is not good.  This is not what we want to be doing.</p><p> In terms of other states, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands were mentioned earlier.  France and Poland as well, I understand, are in a similar position.  I presume some of them may be close to their targets.  As I said, it is a 2020 target so in terms of those states reaching their targets, whether they will be there or thereabouts remains to be seen.  Other states may be included but they are the ones I see.</p><p> As to whether that 12% target was fair and reasonable, there are different views on that.  If I recall correctly, that was in 2009 or 2010 - I am advised it was 2007 or 2008, in the run-in to the end of the decade.  Some people would argue that Ireland's was too stringent.  One may see this as a burden but I believe the moving away from fossil fuels is an economic benefit.  It creates benefits in terms of employment and balance of payments as well as environmental benefits.  It develops the local economy.  Having an ambitious target, therefore, is a good incentive.  It is not punitive.  We are going to have to stop burning fossil fuels anyway.  The sooner we do it the better we will become at it and the more economic savings we will make from it.</p><p> If I was to give one reason we have not been good at this it would be that within our wide public, administrative and other systems, for too long we have looked at this as a cost and a burden to be avoided rather than as a necessity and an opportunity to be attained.  One could apply that to the energy efficiency target and the overall climate emissions target.  I could look at specific examples.  There is a further target in terms of our public buildings.  I recall being in this committee room a year or two ago when the Office of Public Works, OPW, witnesses were asking why it was that on that target, where one would think we would have full control in terms of the efficiency in our public buildings, we will not meet it.  It is because in a succession of policy decisions it was seen as a sunk cost or a wasted burden and therefore to be avoided.  We did all the behavioural energy efficiency measures in terms of the public use of buildings, and achieved a fair bit by doing that, but we reached the limit of what was possible in that regard and did not spend the money on the building fabric.  What Deputy Whitmore said is true.  If we were spending this &euro;50 million, my preference would be to spend it on the 5,000 solar panels, water heating systems and so on in our schools to help us meet our renewable heat target.  However, that philosophical perspective of how those targets impinge on us has been one of the real difficulties.</p><p> With regard to the target, unfortunately, this is complicated.  In terms of the Government's target of a 7% reduction in emissions per annum, with a 51% reduction over the decade, that target was based on science.  It was based on taking the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report and saying that that is what we need to do over the next ten years.  For us, the target was best done on the basis of when will be the first year, starting from early this summer.  It was a 2018 target because those were the first statistics we had in terms of where we are and we had to start from somewhere.  Unfortunately, there were further variations in that.  The European Union tends to set its targets from 2005.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, and the Chairman can correct me if I am wrong, sets its target year from 1990.  To make it even more complicated, the UNFCCC includes land use policy and land use changes, although the rules on that are evolving and need a good deal of tightening.  The European Union does not include many of those but in the middle part of this decade need to start to include that, or even sooner depending on political decision-making.  It is a horrifically complicated variety of different targets.</p><p> The reason I said that that 55% target is a positive development, which was welcomed yesterday at the Council meeting, is because it signifies a significant increase in ambition from the 30% original outcome.  There were even further complications in that with the target within the emissions trading system, ETS, and non-ETS sectors.  We have had many targets deployed in a variety of ways and it will require many countries to significantly scale up their ambition.</p><p> Many countries are further along than Ireland.  Having failed to meet our 2020 targets, we are a good 20% behind where we should be now.  For us to meet a 51% target or anything like it is an incredibly more ambitious target than that of almost all other European countries because most other countries are starting off having already achieved a 20%, 25%, 30% or 40% reduction.  It is akin to going into a 55 m sprint race when the other teams have a 20 yd start on us.  That is the scale of the problem.  The ambition we are setting is very significant.  That is appropriate because this is the new economy.  Other economies will be looking to get what the Danes and others have done from being first mover advantage of having the economic capability in heating, transport and energy systems that they then sell to the rest of the world.  We should aim to do the same.</p><p> In that regard, I accept and agree that the slow pace of the development of wind farm guidelines has been a real failing for both those communities that are concerned about wind farms and those people involved in the industry.  It suits no one&rsquo;s interests.  I had hoped we would have them agreed by the end of this year.  That looks unlikely now but I commit to presenting them very early in the new year because as several Deputies said, we need to start acting more quickly.</p></speech>

If I may, I will ask some questions.  First, on the cost in terms of what we are paying to Denmark and Estonia, it is &euro;50 million.  At the start of the year the estimate was &euro;110 million.  Why is the figure less than the estimate?  Is it Covid-19 related?  Is it accelerated progress in the roll-out of renewable energy across the three sectors?  The Minister might address that.</p> <p>  Second, the Minister mentioned the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auctions and the offshore RESS also.  Is he looking at annual RESS auctions onshore?  He might elaborate on those and how he sees them rolling out in the decade.</p> <p>  Third, on transport, we achieved a 10.7% reduction.  That is, by and large, made up of biodiesel and bioethanol coming into the fuel mix.  There is limited capacity to go further in that area and we will have more ambitious transport renewable energy targets as we go forward.  Given that transport accounts for 40% of energy related emissions or 58% of non-ETS energy related emissions, this will be a huge challenge.  Would the Minister outline his thoughts on and plans for the transport area in particular so that we might reduce emissions but certainly increase the proportion of renewables in that sector?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Confrey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12020121500002#H00400"><p>I thank the Minister and the Chairman.  To explain, three or four years ago when projections were being made about what the cost might be, Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland, SEAI, had projected that it could be somewhere between &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million per percentage point.  They were very preliminary figures and were guesstimates at that time.  We then had a couple of the other deals come into the markets.  Luxembourg was probably first into the pool in 2017.  More recently, on the &euro;110 million figure the Chairman referenced, the Comptroller and Auditor General issued a report in September of last year in which he and his team had estimated the figure at approximately &euro;110 million.  The Chairman rightly asked how we arrived at a figure of &euro;50 million now.  As I said in an answer given earlier, part of the reason is because of supply and market force.  The Danish deal that had come into the public arena at &euro;12.50 euro per megawatt hour put a frame on the price.</p><p>Everyone has commented that although a very significant amount of money is being paid over, it could have been an awful lot higher given that we are one of a number of member states that is in deficit.  Unfortunately, in that situation one is at the mercy of those that are in surplus and therefore can drive further price.  I hope this answers that piece.</p></speech>

This is the first important thing to recognise.  The large number of solar projects that bid in was also significant.  The role of the auctions has impacted the development of a variety of things including the critical constraints around grid, access to grid, and the ability of the ESB and EirGrid to deliver grid connections.  Critical in this is the issue of constraint or curtailment and grid constraints.  This is not very glamorous but we are already starting to see a significant amount of curtailment of the wind we do have, because of grid restrictions.  That is one of the limiting factors in it.  I expect it to be, if not annual, certainly very regular.  Similarly, offshore would not be annual, but not multiannual gaps.  It takes a long time to go from the auction to delivery of the projects.  We have ambitious targets to meet and we want to go further and faster if we can.  Doing it in a step basis where there are regular auctions is much better than betting it all on one big auction system.  I would expect in each case maybe two or three auctions within the lifetime of this Government for each area, if not more.  That is the sort of timeframe.  Effectively it would be annually, but with a variety of different approaches, onshore or offshore.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right with regard to biofuels.  Most of the generation of the target was reached with the use of blending in bioethanol and biodiesel.  On the ethanol side there are technical limitations as to how much the engines can actually cope with.  On the biodiesel side the real constraint is around environmental constraints such as land use implications and long-term or major expansion in fuel supplies.  We absolutely want to use waste materials and convert them to biofuels.  While there may well be further developments in that regard it is limited.</p> <p>  The original directive, from memory, included electricity as a renewable fuel in meeting that renewable target.  We see the real potential in the switch to the electrification of transport.  Another key point, and going back to the argument of efficiency being everything, is that the key metric should be how to reduce the amount or volume of travel needed.  Nobody looks for a long distance commute as a quality of life measure.  There is nothing low-carbon in having a really sprawled development model.  There is everything to be gained from a 15 minute city with services in close reach of community.  This is for social and community reasons as well as for zero carbon reasons.  Our first key target should be looking to see how we can reduce the amount of long-distance commuting as a quality of life measure as well as to reduce the use of fuel.  With Covid there is now a strange opportunity to deliver on this.</p></speech>

Before we begin, I request that members sit only in the permitted seats and in front of available microphones to ensure they are heard.  This is important as not doing so causes serious problems for broadcast, editorial and sound staff.  I remind those present to please maintain social distancing at all times during and following the meeting.  Before we start, I invite those attending the meeting virtually to unmute their devices to allow the sound to feed into the committee room.</p> <p>  Our meeting today is to discuss consideration of the Ombudsman for Children report, entitled Unmet Needs, with the Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, who has responsibility for disability.  I welcome her to the committee.  This is her first time to address the committee.  She has been in her role for several months, but I wish to formally congratulate her on being appointed as Minister of State.  I also extend a welcome to the officials accompanying the Minister of State, Ms Jenny Andersson, assistant principal officer, and Mr. Noel Byrne, special adviser to the Minister of State.</p> <p>  Before I invite the Minister of State to deliver her opening statement, I wish to advise her of the following in relation to parliamentary privilege.  She is protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation she makes to the committee.  That means that she has an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything she says at the meeting.  However, she is expected not to abuse the privilege and it is my duty, as Chair, to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if her statements are potentially defamatory to any identifiable person or entity, she will be directed to discontinue her remarks and it is imperative that she comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The purpose of the meeting is to discuss with the Minister of State the issues identified in the report published in October 2020 by Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children, and entitled Unmet Needs.  The report identified serious shortcomings in how assessments of needs of children are now conducted and the unacceptable waiting lists that face children who require an assessment of their needs.  Before I invite the Minister of State to commence her opening statement, I wish to remind members that, when putting their questions to the Minister of State, they should adhere to the agenda item scheduled for this meeting, which is to examine the contents of the report by the Ombudsman for Children.  I invite the Minister of State to deliver her opening statement, to be followed by a question and answer session with members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020121500002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for this opportunity to address some of the issues raised in the recent and very welcome report of the Ombudsman for Children on unmet needs.  The assessment of needs backlog has been a top priority for me since taking up office as Minister of State with special responsibility for disability.</p> <p>  To put it simply, the current waiting times for services for children with disabilities are totally unacceptable and they need to be improved dramatically.  I have made that clear to all in my meetings with the HSE on this very issue.  I have watched previous meetings of the committee on this subject and many valid points have been made by various people on the many aspects of the assessment process.  Most importantly, the impact on children and families left waiting for assessments and interventions has really been brought to the fore.  From the sheer volume of representations from families to my office, I am very aware of the delays in the assessment of need process and the incredible stress and upset this has caused children and their families.</p> <p>  I agree with the ombudsman when he says steps must be taken to fix this problem.  We are on the exact same page in that regard.  In order to fix the problem, we must ensure that a permanent solution can be found; not just a temporary one.  We must develop a sustainable and child-centred model of service.  This will ensure timely access to assessments and interventions for all children who require them.</p> <p>  The key to providing responsive children&rsquo;s services lies in the rolling out of progressive disability services for children and providing services based on need rather than diagnosis.  A report on assessment of need published in 2011 by the National Disability Authority found that the assessment of need process worked better and in a more streamlined way in areas that had reconfigured into network teams.  In those areas, there was also less emphasis on using the assessment process to develop a diagnosis as a means to access services.</p> <p>  The report of the ombudsman is an honest and thorough examination of where the State stands in terms of its provision of appropriate intervention therapies for children by way of the assessment of need process.  There is no doubt that we have failed many children and their families in this process.  However, I hope that several steps I am taking within my remit will dramatically improve access to services within 12 months of my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for disability.</p> <p>  On the issue of resources, the report of the ombudsman states that, "a much greater resource commitment is required in the longer term".  Even before taking office, it was clear to me that this requirement needed to be pursued.  This is why one of the first things I did as Minister of State was to secure an allocation of &euro;7.8 million Sl&aacute;intecare funding to eliminate the unacceptable backlog of assessments of need that has built up in recent years.  I am sure the committee will agree this is very welcome news.</p> <p>  To ensure that real and tangible progress is being made in clearing the backlog, I have been holding monthly meetings with all the community healthcare organisation, CHO, heads of disability services.  The most recent meeting took place on 8 December.  I can confirm to the committee that of the 6,558 overdue assessments of need as of 30 June 2020, a total of 1,798 have been completed through September, October and November.  This means that by the end of November, the backlog had already been reduced to 4,760.</p> <p>  Of course, that is only one part of the solution as there is no point having an assessment of need completed if one cannot then access the therapies.  The elimination of the backlog will free up therapists to devote more time to providing much-needed interventions for children.  The more time therapists can spend with children, the more they can help them.</p><p>Beyond that, I also secured additional funding in budget 2021 to add another 100 therapy posts to children's disability services next year.  That is on top of the 100 therapy posts secured last year.</p><p> The ombudsman's report also makes a recommendation for an interdepartmental group on children with disabilities to be established.  I would like to point out to the committee that such a cross-sectoral group already exists and meets quarterly to discuss significant issues on children with disabilities.  The group comprises members from the Departments of Health, Education and Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth, as well as associated agencies.  In addition, there is, at any given time, a number of cross-departmental and cross-agency initiatives being pursued. </p><p> In conclusion, I remind the committee that the Government as a whole has committed to a range of actions in order to improve services for children with additional needs and it is my absolute intention to deliver on that.  I am proud to hold the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities and I hope that over my time in this position, I will, once and for all, bring an end to the constant breaches of the Disability Act when it comes to assessments of need.  If that is achieved, the Ombudsman for Children will not, I hope, have a need to publish such a report on unmet needs ever again.</p></speech>

I am going to open up the session to questions now.  We will start with Deputy Whitmore.  Each member has five to six minutes, which will include responses from the Minister of State.  We will take each individual contributor, rather than two or three at a time.  I call on Deputy Whitmore.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020121500002#B00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for being here today and having this discussion.  I understand that she is relatively new in the role but it is great to hear her determination to get this right for children.  I imagine that in her previous role as a party spokesperson for children and as a Deputy, she has had an awful lot of interactions with parents and children on this issue, as have we all in our offices.  I am sure the Minister of State has a thorough understanding of the difficulties that are faced by parents in not only trying to get the assessment but thereafter trying to get the services.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has, unfortunately, inherited a broken system.  She says that steps must be taken and the ombudsman has said the same and we all agree with that.  However, it would appear from what we have heard and the information we have received over the past number of meetings, the path that she is going down is completely the wrong one.  I am not sure if the Minister of State had an opportunity to listen to last week's committee meeting or to review the transcript.  A representative from the Psychological Society of Ireland, Mr. Mark Smyth, was before the committee.  He also was representing the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland and the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists.  Mr. Gareth Noble, family courts lawyer, and parents from Enough is Enough were also before the committee.  Each and every one of them spoke about how the current system is failing children and their families.  I will read out some of the discussion with Mr. Mark Smyth about the new procedure that is being implemented to try to address the problems with the assessment of needs process.  He said "The implementation of the new [standard operating procedure, SOP] has proceeded despite our professional bodies clearly stating that it is not in the best interests of children" and that it "will, in many cases, prove detrimental to children and their families".  He noted the clinicians are also "concerned that compliance with the SOP could lead to them being in breach of codes of conduct and ethics".  He also said that in the majority of cases, it will not be possible for a clinician to answer the questions or to feed back to parents "within the maximum timeframe permitted within the SOP of 90 minutes" or to come to a determination as to whether the child has a disability.  Those are stark statements for someone representing the Psychological Association of Ireland and the other groups to make.</p> <p>  What is the response or feedback of the Minister of State to those statements made last week about the SOP?  It is clear that it was always envisaged that this SOP was going to be difficult.  The previous committee directed the HSE to consult with these groups but it did not do so and we are now seeing the result of that, which is a system being established that is not going to meet the needs of parents or children and will cause difficulty for clinicians.  I will cut to the chase.  Will the Minister of State agree to suspend the roll-out of this new operating procedure until the consultation can happen with the clinicians and parents to ensure that procedures that are being put in place will actually do what they need to for children and not further disadvantage them or stick them onto another waiting list to languish for another three or four years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.182" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020121500002#B00400"><p>I thank Deputy Whitmore for her questions.  I watched the meeting last week.  I have watched the committee proceedings for the past number of weeks, to be honest.  I compliment the committee on all the speakers it has brought in because it is getting a wide flavour of all the challenges that are there.  I was a spokesperson for children and youth affairs and a week never went by in my constituency office in Portumna or Loughrea when I did not have families come before me who were awaiting an assessment of need and it was not weeks or months but years that we were talking about.</p> <p>  When I took office in July, the standard operating procedure or SOP as it is known, had come into operation in January of this year.  It had started before I ever arrived in office.  In actual fact, the SOP is there now but because of Covid-19, it is probably not up and running to its full potential.  As far as I was concerned when I took office, my issue was to address that backlog of 6,500 people.  I want to crack the nut on this.  I want to get to the stage where we are talking about interventions.  We do not want to be in the position of facing the sorts of cases that Mr. Noble talked about last week around the country.  We should be delivering on time and getting straight to the intervention piece.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if I will pause the SOP for further engagement.  I have asked what is happening with the SOP and was told that F&oacute;rsa was the staff representative organisation with negotiating rights for clinicians involved in the assessment of need process.  I was told that the SOP was implemented in January following successful conclusion of the HSE engagement with F&oacute;rsa.  That is exactly what has been presented to me.  I have heard what Mr. Mark Smyth said last week about the clinicians.  We absolutely need to listen to all parts of this discussion.  I will make a suggestion, if the Chair does not mind.  The committee needs to bring before it Professor MacLachlan, the disability clinical lead of the HSE, Dr. Cathal Morgan, head of disability services of the HSE, and Ms Angela O'Neill, national disability specialist and national lead on the assessment of need of the HSE.  When the committee has had all of those people before it, has talked to the HSE and received presentations from the various representatives that have come before the committee, I will then further review the roll-out of the SOP.</p></speech>

They are the leads.  They are the people who have been engaging in the process so far.  That is my understanding and if we are to look at it in the round and have a fair understanding of why we have decided to use this model, I want it understood that this model is not adding an extra layer but is the right thing to do by families.  It is not based on an idea of protecting the State from the requirement to meet the needs of the child or protect the State from litigation but because is the right thing to do.  If that is the case, we will continue with it and if it is not, we will have to review it.</p></speech>

As Deputy Whitmore said, the Minister of State has inherited a broken system and has only recently come into her role.  It is good to hear her say that she wants to end the constant breaches of the Disability Act.</p><p>The backlog of assessment of need is coming down quite dramatically.  On the face of it, that is a very good thing.  These are assessments that have been caught up under the terms of the new standard operating procedures, SOPs.  As we have seen in previous weeks, the standard operating procedures are just not up to scratch.  They do not provide a quality assessment and they themselves appear to be in breach of the Disability Act.  Will the Minister of State commit to reviewing them?  It seems we are playing with smoke and mirrors in reducing the backlog of assessment needs but not actually meeting the needs of the young people who are being assessed.</p><p> Constituents have asked me to raise a few things with the Minister of State when they heard she was coming before the committee.  One was the availability of therapists.  Many front-line staff have moved on to Covid tracing.  When will they return to their work?  Constituents asked if the Minister of State thinks it is acceptable that these people are being moved from therapeutic services to Covid tracing when there is a backlog in therapeutic services?  Are we making the best use of clinicians?  A senior psychologist might be doing a parenting course which could equally be delivered by a social worker or social care worker on a multidisciplinary team whereas a social worker or social care worker could not do the same work that the senior psychologist can.  Tied to this is parents' frustration at a lack of consistency.  Often, when they go to services, it is with a completely new person.  We all know that a lack of consistency can be a problem for many reasons which I do not need to go into.</p><p> Will we ratify and follow through on the optional protocol for the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020121500002#C00200"><p>On the backlog and the SOP, the reason I sought the funding was that, as of 30 June, there were 6,500 children on a backlog and only a very small proportion related to the SOP at all.  They were historical.  They were not sick for three or six months but for nine or 12 months.  That is primarily what the funding was for.  The proportion of those on the SOP was minute.  The first would have gone on in June because it only came in on 1 January.  There would be children who are only six months on it, but the majority was the backlog.</p> <p>  I agree on the therapeutic services.  I totally understand parents' frustration, and there is no doubt of that, that a therapist could be out contact tracing or swabbing.  It is unacceptable that it would have continued for so long.  There are still people on it, but between the disability teams and the primary care team, 189 therapists are still part of it.  They are not on contact tracing now, but they are on swabbing.  When I came into office, the number was twice that if not a hell of a lot more.  It has reduced considerably.  I met with Paul Reid on 5 October on the issue and met with the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, twice on the matter.  There has been a recruitment plan to address it and get the clinicians back to the front line of doing what they are supposed to.  I have acknowledged the frustration, which all members of the committee and every parent speak of.</p> <p>  The current target to enact the optional protocol is 2022.</p></speech>

While we are on very friendly terms and I am conscious of not throwing any brickbats at her, I have some very direct questions.  I think she will appreciate that.</p> <p>  I represent the area covered by community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4, which comprises Kerry, north Cork, north Lee and south Lee.  Of the &euro;7.8 million that was allocated for the 6,558 people, &euro;1.1 million was allocated to CHO 4.  The Minister of State said that as of 30 June, a total of 1,798 assessments of need have been completed over September to November, inclusive.  Will she provide me with a breakdown of how this cuts across CHO 4?  I ask because it is still not clear to me whether these assessments of need, which the Minister of State says are historical, are under the new SOP and are, therefore, under the 90-minute bracket.  If the answer is that they are, then, given evidence that has come before the committee, I have serious concerns about that.  The case for CHO 4 can be extrapolated to all the CHOs in the country.  I need some words of comfort from the Minister of State for the families and children whom I represent so that they do not come back to me in a matter of months, having received the initial assessment of need, to say there has been no follow-up of services, or saying the assessment of need, as previous witnesses have suggested, is a sub-par method by any international standard of assessing a child with needs.  That is the first reassurance I seek.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020121500002#C00400"><p>I am more than happy to provide Deputy Sherlock with an answer this minute.  As of 30 June, CHO 4 had 1,098 children on the backlog for assessment of need.  The funding was provided and the HSE put in place a plan.  The numbers at the end of each month are as follows: in September it was 1,069; on 31 October it was 1,000; and on 30 November it was 743.  To reverse it, in CHO 4 during September there were 29 assessments of needs carried out, in October there were 69, and in November there were 257.  The definition of "carried out" is completed in its entirety.</p></speech>

As this will be an ongoing issue, I would appreciate if she offered to communicate with the committee's Chairman to give figures for each of the CHOs to assess those numbers on an ongoing basis.  This would be very useful.  We will put down our own parliamentary questions anyway.</p> <p>  When the ombudsman was before the committee, he suggested without any ambiguity that some sort of a refund scheme could be established for those families who wished to procure private assessments.  The Minister of State, in a parliamentary reply to me dated 30 October 2020, referred to a letter from Dr. Cathal Morgan in which it was stated that, in relation to Sl&aacute;intecare funding, which is the &euro;7.8 million provided on a once-off basis and which is time limited, the CHOs would engage with private providers in their areas to procure private assessments where appropriate.</p><p>Will the Minister of State provide us with a breakdown of the cost and the number of private assessments?  As I understand it, the &euro;7.8 million is not fully allocated or spent yet.  To what extent is that funding being given over to private providers?  Once that funding is spent, is there scope for families who wish to seek private assessments to get a refund?  That would provide a massive alleviation because the &euro;7.8 million will not cover the full extent of the demand.  That is the point I am making. </p></speech>

All members have a breakdown of the &euro;7.8 million per individual CHO.  The CHOs were then tasked with addressing it and they set their own timelines and targets.  I did not set them.  As part and parcel of that, they had to engage with private providers to have the assessments done in a timely fashion because this is time sensitive.  They went out and spoke to other section 38 and 39 organisations and some private providers.  They also spoke with the HSE, which had given staff the option of working extra hours or overtime if they wanted.  The money has already left the Department of Health and it has been given in its entirety.  I asked about this matter last week because I wanted to see more progress.  That money has been given in its entirety.  As the Deputy can see from the figures, and I can get other figures for any Member who wants them, all the organisations that have signed up to this are making progress, right across the board.  The money will be there to ensure everybody gets an assessment in a timely fashion and that the backlog is cleared.  We are engaging with private providers to do that.</p></speech>

After this backlog is cleared, or even if this backlog is cleared, there will always be demand and the resources will not always follow.  The Minister of State will know from her own experience that families are forced into a situation where they are waiting on the public list for an inordinate time.  The pressure comes on them to take out a credit union loan to get a private assessment.  All families will do that if needs be.  Is there any scope, as per the ombudsman's suggestion, for some sort of recoupment of those costs for individual families at the family level?  Could the State intervene to facilitate that family or, if the family made a request for the recoupment of expenses, could an application or some sort of protocol or process be set up to facilitate that?</p></speech>

Out of that, I would see exactly what was delivered through the HSE, what was delivered through the section 38 and 39 organisations and what was delivered through private providers.  We need to drill down to see that the money being provided by the Department is being spent in a time-sensitive fashion because it has not been in the past.  There is no denying that whatsoever.  If had been, I would not have a backlog.  That is the point of this whole exercise.</p> <p>  I am not gong to give an answer to the Deputy's question because I do not know the correct answer.  I know exactly where he is coming from and I appreciate it.  I understand why families had to resort to doing what they did, at enormous expense to themselves, to get therapies or supports in the schools their children were attending.  I understand where the ombudsman is coming from and I understand the line of the Deputy's question but I do not have a clear answer on this at the moment.  I want to do a cost-benefit analysis to see whether this is an issue right across the State or in a particular CHO or where exactly the problem needs to be addressed.  However, I am not ruling the Deputy's suggestion out.</p></speech>

She said she listened in to this committee and she would have heard the ombudsman talking about a three-card trick and how he felt that children were being moved from list to list without getting adequate services.  One issue that has been mentioned relates to the SOP.  We heard last week from the Psychological Society of Ireland that a child may incorrectly be deemed not to have a disability as the disability is not evident or fully reported by parents or carers at the screening assessment.  We also heard from the parents' group, Enough is Enough, and those parents are absolutely terrified that they may miss something that will delay their child's developmental needs and the services they need to develop.  These parents are under enough pressure without adding any more.  As they said last week, parents are not therapists.  They are parents and they want the best for their children.</p> <p>  I will probably ask some questions that have been asked.  Does the Minister of State think the SOP is adequate?  Will it be reviewed or can it be suspended?  She can correct me if I am wrong but she said that of the 1,798 assessments completed since June 2020, the vast majority were standard comprehensive assessments of need.  If we have gotten that many done since June 2020, why do we need a standard operating procedure?  If we are getting through them comprehensively, why are we putting parents under this pressure?</p> <p>  I want to touch on two more areas.  This year, there were 691 investigations into complaints by parents to the HSE, under the Disability Act 2005, that their children did not get their assessment in a timely manner, and 634 of these were upheld.  That is 92%, which is a damning indictment of the AON system.  However, it is a good indication that the complaints system is working.  That leads me to the second part of my question.  Since late 2018, 115 cases have been taken to court by parents.  Those parents had to go to court for an enforcement order for the assessment of need.  Defending this system must cost the HSE a significant amount when it knows that 92% of the complaints are being upheld.  Why is the HSE making parents who are already under enough pressure go to court to get enforcement orders instead of providing the services they need?</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned that the &euro;7.8 million in Sl&aacute;intecare money that is being AONs is time sensitive.  Will that time run out?  If the money is not used, can we get a guarantee that it will be ring-fenced and that it does not go back into a black hole of the HSE or some other area?  If it is not used in time, will it still be there to be used for assessments of needs going forward?</p></speech>

I will start at the end.  He asked me if the money will go into a black hole if it is not used.  It will be used because every one of those 6,500 children is going to get their assessment of need.  This money is going to be used.  That is why I am holding monthly meetings and that is why I can tell Deputy Sherlock what has happened in his CHO in the past three months.  I can tell every member what is going on in his or her CHO because my finger is on the pulse as regards assessments.   The money will be spent in a timely fashion and it will be delivered, so we will clear the backlog.</p> <p>  The Deputy's first question is well-put.  He asked why we need a standard operating procedure if the backlog is being cleared.  I said at the beginning that this is a nut we need to crack.</p><p>I want to get to the intervention element.  By spending as much time as we have been in simply addressing backlogs, we would not deliver on intervention.  For the information of some members who may not be aware of this, when one get an assessment of needs and, say, it relates to speech and language therapy, one has to go a speech and language therapist to get an assessment.  One then gets a first round of therapy and that could continue for six weeks and if one needs further follow-up one is directed to a list of speech and language therapists further up the line.  I am trying to get to the intervention piece.  That was the reason I sought funding to clear the backlog so that everybody concerned could get to the space where we are discussing intervention. </p><p> Regarding 92% of the cases being upheld, they were being upheld because they were not being dealt within a timely fashion.  We all know this.  The Act clearly stipulates one has a right to an assessment within six months.  If one does not get it, the law will uphold that right.  That is enshrined in law since 2005.</p><p> It is important to realise that 100 therapist posts were sought under the confidence and supply agreement in last year's budget.  Some of those therapists who came on stream never hit the network disability teams because they went straight into contact tracing and swabbing.  They are only starting to come back to this work now.  I have also sought another 100 therapist posts in this budget.  If I am fortunate enough, and with the support of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, I would like us to block book the funding for those posts whereby we would recruit the therapists in one block.  I would like that to happen in quarter 1 rather than over quarters 1, 2 and 3 and in that way, we could populate our network disability teams and the intervention could continue at an accelerated rate.</p></speech>

While the Minister of State answered me she did not answer the question I asked.  I appreciate the focus on moving from assessment to intervention as that is exactly what is needed.  The Minister of State said 1,978 comprehensive assessments of need have been carried out since June of this year.  Why do we then need to go from the comprehensive assessment of needs process to the standard operating procedure exercise?  They are two different things.  One is comprehensive, as the Minister of State said, and the other is a 90-minute desktop assessment, which parents are being put under undue pressure to fill out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020121500002#E00300"><p>There are two answers to that question and I do not want to evasive.  First, the reason we have to deliver on the comprehensive assessment of needs is that the backlog was there before 2020.  That is what has to happen.  To my understanding, the reason the standard operating procedure was brought forward was to streamline the entire procedure.  People are of the opinion that the standard operating procedure, SOP, is a desktop exercise.  That is not what I am led to believe.  It is a face-to-face exercise.  I acknowledge the role of the Chairman and the members of the committee in bringing in various speakers.  The committee needs to have a conversation in the entire round by bringing in HSE lead personnel in this area to get their vision of the roll-out of the SOP and whether it is another layer, is it a face-to face appointment, whether it has the same value and if it gets us to the intervention element quicker.  The final question I would ask, which must be asked, is why are so many of the clinicians not in favour of it.  While we need to have those conversations, the important element that needs to be addressed is whether it gets people to an intervention at a direct point of access quicker.</p></speech>

I have a few questions and I might ask them together, if the Minister of State can take note of them and reply to them together.  To follow on from Deputy Ward's point on pre-assessment, the Minister of State said it is her understanding that was brought forward for it to be streamlined.  What exactly does "for it to be streamlined" mean?  That is a word that is used and everyone says the process is streamlined but what does that even mean?  To be honest, the comprehensive assessment is what children need and "streamlined" is a made-up word that is used for people to think something is happening but it is not happening.  I would like the Minister of State to explain what she means by &ldquo;streamlined&rdquo;.</p> <p>  I have a question related to the pre-assessment, that is, the 90-minute exercise.  We spoke on foot of Deputy Costello's question on the ratification of the optional protocol.  It feels like that 90-minute pre-assessment exercise is a breach of the Disability Act, which leaves us further away from meeting the requirement to have the optional protocol in place in time.  We want to remove obstacles for people to be able to take cases but there is a sense we have created the 90-minute assessment to stave off court proceedings rather than have a system that is streamlined.  </p> <p>  The report also explains where the Disability Act 2005 covers assessment for health needs.  The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act covers assessment for special needs assessment.  The report outlines how essentially, both Acts go hand in hand.  However, due to the fact that different sections of the EPSEN Act were deferred because of financial constraints in 2008, the provision of a education service to a child is often neglected or not pursued.  For example, where the assessment of needs identify the need for an education service for a child, the assessment officer would refer the matter either to the principal of the child&rsquo;s school to practically meet the educational needs of the student concerned or for a special educational needs assessment.  However, the second option does not exist since the relevant sections of the EPSEN Act have not yet commenced.  This means that despite the fact that the need for additional education services are stated in this statement of assessment, the child could potentially never receive the appropriate supports because the relevant actions of the Act have not commenced.  The question I have for the Minister of State in that respect is whether the Department has looked at implementing these relevant sections of the EPSEN Act to ensure children are receiving an adequate assessment of needs process, as outlined in both Acts. </p> <p>  Through the assessment of needs, the only gateway to access services is through a disability finding.  This means if an assessment officer finds that a child does not have a disability, a liaison officer cannot provide a service statement, regardless of the child&rsquo;s other identified needs.  This makes the 2005 Act a diagnosis-led rather than needs-led model.  The question I have for the Minister of State in that respect is whether the Department has looked at different ways of reconfiguring the current regime to adopt to a more needs-led model.</p> <p>  Finally, what is the cost of providing the SOP system?  Would that money have been better spent in going with the funding she allocated to address the backlog?  Have we redirected funding?  What is the cost of the funding to do the pre-assessment?  Would it have been better spent in helping the Minister of State to continue to address the current backlog with a more comprehensive model?</p></speech>

Regarding the pre-assessment and the word "streamline" that is used, I asked about that and the answer I got was that we would have the same procedure happening right across every community healthcare organisation, CHO, in the country.  To reverse back to 31 December 2019, it was not the case that all CHOs in the country operated at the same level with respect to how they did an assessment.  The idea of the SOP was to streamline it.  I have to be clear with the Senator.  Certain CHOs are getting through their backlog is a very timely fashion but that is not the case for other CHOs.  I ask them what is the story, that they told me last month this would happen but it did not happen and they reply that consultation is taking place or conversations are happening where teams have to meet to come to a final decision about assessment.</p><p>That is part and parcel of where the SOP ended up and what has added to the backlog.  I am not ascribing blame to anybody in making that statement; I am stating a fact.  The idea was to have streamlined assessments.  The idea was that every CHO would have the same.</p><p> The Senator made a valid point, asking if it came in just to save the State a fortune not to end up in court cases.  It is part and parcel of it and I will not deny that.  It is important to qualify it by saying that the HSE sought legal advice on it.  When the HSE is before the committee, it is important and integral to ask if it was about the legal bill or about delivering a standard of intervention at the same level across the country.  Was it part of putting a tool in place that every clinician could work to?</p><p> The Senator mentioned the EPSEN Act.  I have asked that question and tomorrow I will meet with the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, about the issue the Senator raised, and I will provide the Senator or Chair with a follow-up to that meeting if they so wish.</p></speech>

It is important that the question is asked again when it comes before the committee.  It says that one can have an assessment done in a timely fashion and a child that presents with speech and language needs will get intervention straight away, but a child with more complex needs will go on for further assessment, which is like the comprehensive assessment of need that we have at the moment.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that in the absence of a diagnosis, even if the needs are identified, the liaison officer cannot actually provide a service statement so that some of those needs can be addressed.  If there are needs but no diagnosis, the service statement should still accompany that child to address what needs the child may have in the education sector and so on.</p></speech>

Does she have an update for CHO 8, which is my area?  If there has been a reduction in numbers, when does she see that backlog clearing?  When the backlog is cleared, there will still be many unmet needs, which she is well-versed in.  There seems to be a gap between investment and therapies.  As the Minister of State mentioned, many staff are not doing what they are supposed to be doing and looking after the children.  "Unmet need" is a simple term to describe children who are not thriving and achieving as they should be.  There are also unmet needs for many families.  Many parents come to me who are struggling, almost grieving the loss of what could be, and concerned about how they will cope with the next 15 to 20 years of getting their child through education or whatever the case may be.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State's openness to reviewing the SOP.  We heard from the Ombudsman for Children and Mr. Gareth Noble about their concerns.  The Minister of State mentioned clinical concerns too.  I welcome that and have listened intently to discussions on it.</p></speech>

I am trying to get to a point where we do not have a backlog for assessments of need and timely intervention and therapy become the priority.  The Senator and I have both seen the letters to say that a person is on a two-year waiting list for speech and language therapy.  That is unacceptable.  We have to stop that and we have to get to the root of delivering therapy.  The Senator talked about people in contact tracing and swabbing.  At the moment, there is nobody from the network disability teams involved in contact tracing and there are nine from primary care.  Last September and October, when I started to have these conversations, there were 866 involved in swabbing.  That 866 is down to 189.  It is still 189 too many and I will not justify it, but at the same time, I want to demonstrate where we have come from and what we are trying to get back into the teams, for the simple reason that that leads directly to the unmet need of the children and families, the frustration of families and how they must feel, that nobody is thinking of their child or their child's education.  That is why I have met with Mr. Paul Reid and spoken with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly.  In fairness to the HSE, the Department of Health and the Minister, they are acknowledging it and getting a turnaround.</p> <p>  My next step in that is to ensure, in the roll-out of the vaccines, that our front-line clinicians do not become a casualty of delivering the vaccination.  After we got disability acknowledged as an essential service in September, clinicians have returned to posts and the reconfiguration of the children's network disability teams is taking place.  We are down to the last seven team leads in the 91 different positions around the country.  That is right across the country.  We should build on those teams and ensure that those staff do not become part of the vaccination programme.  They need to stay to address the unmet need and support the families that the Senator speaks about.  We do not want to see those families left for another year without timely intervention.</p> <p>  Regarding CHO 8, as of 30 June, it had 764 children awaiting an assessment of need.  As of the end of September, it had 698; at the end of October, it had 630; and as of 30 November, it was back down to 475.  Some 66 were completed in September, 68 in October, and 155 in November.  The target for completion there is February.  I have spoken to the lead for AONs.</p></speech>

For a very young child who is one of those lucky ones to have received an assessment and moved on to therapy, virtual sessions are difficult for a two, three or four year old.</p><p>It is very difficult for a two, three or four year old to deal with the virtual environment.  It is just another screen with a woman on the other end.  It is no good to them.</p><p> As a matter of priority, I would appreciate efforts being made with younger children and those who are newly assessed.  The older children who have a relationship built up with the therapist are linking in and benefitting far better from the virtual environment.</p></speech>

Where the therapist has built up a relationship with a young person, it is very easy to continue in the virtual environment, although it does not work for everybody.  We are trying our best to get back to face-to-face therapy and we must do that.  We must learn to live alongside Covid-19.  I will take on board the Senator's comments and I am sure the HSE has listened to them as well.</p></speech>

I thank her office for being so engaged and accessible.  I really appreciate that.</p><p>My home constituency is Dublin South-Central, taking in a little of Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W.  In that there seems to be exceptionally long waiting lists and it has been considered quite the black hole.  One of my emails to the witnesses argued there is a postcode lottery and this area is particularly badly hit with very long waiting lists.  I welcome comments on where we are at in that regard.  I received a briefing from the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Feighan, indicating who was deployed where or redeployed into services but figures were missing for the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7.</p><p>Within the area there are a number of families with children with Down's syndrome.  There is a commonality of experience.  One of the families has been advised that a new ophthalmology service is beginning in April 2021 and I would appreciate an update on that.  The family has been placed on a waiting list so what length of time are we looking at for an assessment?</p><p>One of the difficulties of being on such a long waiting list is that a child may be in second class is ready to go to a school with an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit but if that child has not been assessed, he or she does not qualify to get into the unit despite obviously requiring such support.  The lack of assessment is having a detrimental effect on educational needs of children.  In such a case, a paediatrician may have written to the HSE to say that an assessment is urgently required but has not occurred.  Parents in such cases are getting quotes of &euro;1,850 to get a private assessment but do not know if such an assessment would be accepted.</p><p>Children with Down's syndrome are much more likely to suffer from arthritis, at one in 50 children as compared with one in 1,000 for the rest of the population.  Such children need an MRI done under a general anaesthetic.  If a child has pain now, the earliest appointment for the diagnostic is apparently January 2022.  That type of delay is quite common and a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>indicated a delay in waiting times of between four and seven years, which sounds astounding.</p><p>I appreciate that there are many questions but I would not mind an update on where things stand with section 39 organisations.  I have plagued the witnesses about that before.  I thank the Minister of State, as always.</p></speech>

The questions must be asked about the involvement of the HSE and the section 38 and section 39 organisations that would be supported.  What was the involvement of private operators coming on board?  I responded earlier to Deputy Sherlock and spoke about 29 cases being dealt with in the same period.  There are questions to be asked.</p> <p>  The Senator spoke about issues affecting people with autism.  I come from rural Galway and when a child goes into junior infants, he or she does not leave the school until sixth class is finished.  It is a different sort of mechanism in Dublin, which I learned by meeting representatives of Involve Autism, and it is possible the Senator met those people as well.</p></speech>

Deputy Sherlock asked about that earlier.  The children must move from junior to senior school and they are not in the same school settings.  Some of the families, as the classrooms are not in a local community school, may have to travel for an hour or an hour and a half across the city to access services.  It is one of the main reasons I am meeting the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, tomorrow.  It is to get an understanding of our roll-out plan for classrooms not just in Dublin and the areas identified by the Senator but right across the country.</p> <p>  The Senator spoke about children with Down's syndrome being affected with arthritis.  She mentioned a ratio of one child in 50 being affected as opposed to one in every 1,000 children who do not have Down's syndrome.  The last time I inquired about this I was told there is a recruitment problem.  It is a major difficulty but it is not new.  It is something that needs to be prioritised.  There are six posts that deal with rheumatoid arthritis but only two are filled.</p> <p>  The Senator spoke about section 39 organisations.  It is wonderful to see that great work has been done through the Labour Relations Commission as of last Thursday evening, with the HSE and unions coming to an understanding.  It is very welcome news.  The next 250 bodies for the section 39 organisations are now moving forward with pay restoration.</p></speech>

It was an excellent job.  Well done.</p></speech>

The report from the ombudsman was a real indictment of the State's failure of children with special needs, their families, carers and supporters.</p> <p>  I really welcome the Minister of State's appointment.  As a spokesperson for the Opposition she demonstrated passion and energy and she has brought that to her office.  I am greatly encouraged.</p> <p>  I will not go over everything that has been discussed because it has been well articulated.  The Minister of State knows these challenges.  I can make a couple of suggestions for the committee.</p><p>I absolutely agree with the Minister of State that the HSE has to come into the committee, which is scheduled, and that we, as a committee, engage very energetically.  We need to challenge it on behalf of all the children and families and we will do that.  The Minister of State could help the committee if it could be provided with a monthly report to give members a breakdown of how the assessment of needs is progressing.  That would be useful for this committee to have.  The Minister of State clearly has the information and the data are available.  The committee should be looking at that once a month so that the issue is on our minds not just at a committee meeting such as this.</p><p> I am very mindful that it is distressing for parents.  They demonstrate love, energy and care for their children but it is very distressing for them to have to battle for an assessment of needs to start with, and then the therapies and supports.  Does the Minister of State have a report, similar to the one available on the assessment of needs, on waiting lists for therapies and supports?  Again, perhaps this could be provided to the committee monthly.  It is important that this committee would track that and engage with the HSE on it.  It would also create for the committee the transparency on how children and families are being responded to in every area.  It may give us an opportunity to assess whether there is a uniformity to the quality and timeliness of the response, and to the appropriateness of the supports provided to the children and their families.</p><p> With regard to the ongoing support and care, I am very aware that when parents and their children have overcome the initial challenge of getting their assessment of needs, the young child - hopefully but not always - will get the required supports, therapies and interventions.  As that child becomes an older child, a teenager and then a young adult - this is my experience from dealing with families - every time there is a developmental change there can be a kind of disconnect in the ongoing and projected assessment of needs, and especially into adulthood.  In the Minister of State's short time in office has she had a chance to examine that, or is it something she could take on and examine into the future?</p><p> I would also appreciate the Minister of State using her office to raise the issue of the appropriateness of the housing needs assessment that takes place with local authorities in the State for families who have a family member with special needs.  The local authorities generally do not take intellectual needs into account.  Very often a key requirement to cope with intellectual challenges can be having an appropriate built environment within which to live.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could also look at that.  I thank her for her time.</p></speech>

The committee members know me and my work on the children and youth affairs committee over the past four years, and members know exactly the sort of person I am.  I am very open and transparency is very much part and parcel of the person I am.  I would welcome the opportunity of laying before the committee every month the figures on the assessments of needs.</p> <p>  I would welcome also the opportunity to provide to the committee the figures monthly of everybody who is waiting for a clinician's appointment in the State and I commit to that.  I gave the example earlier of the speech and language therapy figures, including those who are on their original assessment, those who are waiting in their first period of time on the waiting list, and those who are going on further.  I will save members the bother of putting down parliamentary questions every single month.  It takes time out of the Department and it takes time out of the HSE.  I am doing it myself and I will share my information with the Chairman and the committee monthly.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact the committee has made this issue a priority in its first term and I want it to be kept front and centre.  Every one of us knows that intervention has to be key to what we are doing.  If we all work together, my office and I, along with the committee, the Department of Health and the HSE, and if we are all accountable to ensuring that children get a timely intervention, and if we work hard, then that is how we will get it done.  I have no fear in sharing the information.  It is not going to be locked in a vault.  I am happy to publish it.</p></speech>

It also came up at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, which it is building in as part and parcel of its piece also.  Universal design is very important.  The Senator referred to local authorities.  I do not wish to bring up again the standard operating procedure, SOP, in the context of assessment, but different local authorities view disabilities on different levels.  A particular local authority in the State, for example, did not view autism as a disability, so when families applied to the local authority it did not see autism or having a child with autistic needs on the housing list as a priority, or even take autism or intellectual disabilities into consideration from a space point of view.  There is much work to be done there but I am totally open to it.  I am aware that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is also very open to that.</p> <p>  On the issue of older children who age out from school-years services, we talk about the primary care system that is there.  My Department is very much entwined with the role of primary care when it comes to assessment of needs and the delivery of services.</p></speech>

In her statement, she outlined the &euro;7.8 million to clear the backlog.  This is very important in the assessment of needs.  The Minister of State's monthly meetings with the community health organisations, CHO, heads have been an important part of doing that.  What has the feedback been from the CHO heads?  Being from the west of Ireland, like the Minister of State, we see many issues and barriers in trying to get information from the different service providers within the HSE.  They outline the challenges they have in meeting the needs of children with disability services.  They are conscious of the impact it has on children and families.  I would like to get an understanding of what the dialogue is within those meetings.</p></speech>

There is a massive team working within the HSE and it is led by Dr. Cathal Morgan and Mr. Bernard O' Regan, with whom I meet or chat to at least once a week.  Since taking office, I have seen that that train had started when I arrived and the commitment was there before I arrived.  These people were committed to the roll out and the reconfiguration of the children's network disability teams.  When I talk about the 91 network disability teams, this was already in progress.  Unfortunately, Covid landed, but the commitment and enthusiasm for delivery was there.  This has been borne out in how they have addressed putting a focus on the assessment of needs.  I cannot thank them enough for how they co-operate and work with me and the Department.</p></speech>

Much of our difficulty is access to therapies.  The Minister of State mentioned that previously.  I refer to the lack of occupational therapists and speech and language therapies, the significant delays and parents losing faith in the system.  Where are we in terms of trying to recruit in areas, such as community healthcare organisation, CHO, 2 and is there a plan in place for 2021?</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge the work that CHO 2 does.  The Deputy and I live in CHO 2.  That is Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, and under the lead of Mr. John Fitzmaurice and Ms Breda Crehan-Roche, they have done phenomenal work.  The number there in June of 2020 was 100 and as of November, the number has been brought back to 55.  That is a commitment and a demonstration of the HSE's staff but also the section 38 and section 39 organisations that they have worked closely with.</p> <p>  I already said that if the HSE disability team can get the block funding to recruit in block the third post that is required, it would mean that we would have everybody in place at the beginning of the year in quarter 1 as opposed to looking at recruitment going on for those 100 therapist posts that would lead us to having it finished by the time we would arrive at the next budget.  I would like to see the recruitment start now and fill them out.</p> <p>  Of the 91 network disability teams, of which there are nine in CHO 2 to be delivered between the three counties, from what I can gather right across the country, we are down to the last seven team lead posts being filled.  A lot of positive work has been done.</p> <p>  However, we have an issue in relation to unmet needs.  While I might be meeting the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, tomorrow, I am also meeting the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, with a focus on the CAO offers perhaps providing additional availability to help address some of my unmet need in the disability sector.  I refer to occupational therapists, OTs, physiotherapists, and speech and language therapists.  Tusla will be recruiting for social care.  I need to recruit for social care.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will also be recruiting as part of her school inclusion model for therapists in the schools.  We need to accelerate and make more posts available so that we do not have a retention crisis or a recruitment crisis.  The funding is there.  We now need to match the funding with the people.  That is a challenge.</p></speech>

I agree with everything the Minister of State said in terms of additional college places because it is an area where we fall down in getting people into full-time positions.</p> <p>  I have one final question.  In regards to availability of funding for speech devices, a number of parents have come to me about speech-generating devices used by children who are non-verbal.  They find it difficult, especially in Mayo, with the limited funding that is available.  Multiple families have access to funding through their speech and language therapists.  The Minister of State might provide a note on when funding can be granted.  These devices cost up to &euro;6,000.  It is causing some difficulty between some families.  I might send the Minister of State a note on that after the meeting.</p></speech>

That was the motto at the start of Covid and it should still be the motto.  That was one of the reasons when I provided the additional &euro;20 million after the budget that some of the providers, if they were making a request for funding, must also address technology to bring everybody with us.  I will provide the Deputy with a note on it.</p></speech>

I like the approach Deputy Rabbitte takes in the Department.  The Minister of State has been backed by Government with an increase in budget which always helps but it is not only about money.  It is about how measures are rolled out.  The Minister of State is certainly taking a hands-on approach with the Department and I appreciate that.</p> <p>  There are a few points I would like to raise.  As the Minister of State will be aware, up until February of this year, before I was elected to this House, I was a teacher.  There are some overlapping functions, both for Deputy Rabbitte's Department and, indeed, her colleague, the junior Minister, Deputy Madigan.  There is an acute shortage of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units in County Clare.  At present, the incidence of autism among children in Ireland, which depends on the level of diagnosis and assessment, is between 1.6% and 2%, but our availability of ASD units is grossly short of that.  In a town such as Ennis with a population of 30,000, or Shannon with a population of 10,000, there is only a handful of places.  When a unit opens, it only caters for six children.  There is a huge shortage.</p> <p>  Increasingly, special educational needs organisers, SENOs, have been going around to schools, speaking with and writing to principals saying that they want them, in September 2021, to open ASD units in their schools.  That is brilliant, but there is no accommodation.  They are saying to principals that they should find some place in their schools.  Some of these schools have not a place for a mop bucket or their physical education, PE, equipment.  Suddenly, they are expected to clear out cupboards and find a place for an ASD unit.  It will require joined-up thinking, both within the Department of Deputy Rabbitte, as someone who is a champion for disability, and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  Ultimately, the Department of Education has to also step up and say that this school is willing to provide an ASD unit and it will need additional accommodation.</p> <p>  The next issue I wish to raise is that of SENOs.  They wield an awful lot of power when they come into schools.  With the Education Act 1998 and the Disability Act 2005, there are many legislative pieces that empower youngsters living with disability and there are many parents who go out and battle for them.  I have seen it on many occasions.  One sees parents come into one's classroom knowing that they have to fight a battle and they realise pretty quickly that the teacher is onside because we are fighting that battle too.  The reality is volumes of paperwork go before a SENO.  There is every type of psychological report.  There could be occupational therapy reports.  With a stroke of a pen, they can strike out many of these recommendations.  I made this point in this very room a few weeks ago.  In the case of many of the recommendations they are striking out as being invalid or not reaching a threshold, they are not qualified to make that interpretation.  I am not an educational psychologist.  I am, by profession, a teacher.  I am not qualified to go in, dissect a report, and say that makes sense and that does not.  There is something wrong in that and Deputy Rabbitte's Department and, indeed, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, should look at that.  They do the same with assistive technology recommendations.  They will approve some laptops and some devices and they will strike out others.  That is fundamentally wrong.</p> <p>  In March and April, there was a need for speech and language therapists and others to be reassigned to tracing and testing roles.  The same occurred with orthodontists and others within the broad spectrum of health services.  There was a need for them to be redeployed.  They simply had not the caseload coming into their offices.  That has changed now.  Testing and tracing has changed.  There is still a small few, certainly in the mid-west, I know of who are still testing and tracing and we need them back offering the service that they are most qualified to do.</p> <p>  The final question I wish to ask the Minister of State is about the waiting lists in CHO 3, County Clare, and the neighbouring counties of Limerick and Tipperary.  I am hoping the Minister of State can give some good news about waiting lists for children who have been awaiting assessments or appointments in that locality.</p></speech>

I am not saying that the Minister of State cannot answer.  In fairness to the Minister of State, it does not fall into the discussion of assessment of needs.</p></speech>

As of 30 June, the backlog of assessment of needs was 589.  In September, it was reduced to 559.  In October, it was 503, and in November, 449.  I will turn those figures on their head.</p><p>One can see that CHO 3 had completed 30 in September, 56 in October and 54 in November.</p><p> Last night, I participated in a Zoom call with pals from Loughrea in County Galway.  They said they are experiencing the same ASD issues that Deputy Crowe mentioned.  There is an acute shortage of ASD units.  Many schools do not have enough space for a mop bucket never mind trying to convert a classroom, which is a very serious issue.  This seems to be happening across the country because any of these units can only cater for six people.  </p><p> Last night, I also heard the following and it is something that I have heard on a regular basis in addition to being well articulated by the Deputy.  Parents must continually do battle for services, the teachers assist them in their battle but the reports are shredded when they have been completed, which is a situation that needs addressing.  Parents and teachers have articulated to me their belief that barriers have been put in the way of progress to assist their children in educational and development spheres.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I will work well together to ensure that we address this important issue because the current situation cannot continue at the level that I have heard is happening right across the country.</p></speech>

I do not want to tar everyone with the same brush but the organisation wields way too much power.  It is in the realm of education, in which it plays a major function, but it also delves into the realms of occupational therapy and educational psychology.  The organisation is empowered to interpret large volumes of assessment paperwork but it can strike out elements with devastating effects thus denying a child access to key enablers such as educational supports, occupational therapy supports or assistive technology.  The parents are absolutely infuriated at times and there needs to be standardisation across the board.    The issue comes down to a very moral and possibly legal argument that I cannot go into a person's realm and challenge him or her about a report if I am not equally, if not more, qualified yet the organisation does so.  An educational psychologist will have spent between four and six years studying for a degree and his or her Master's qualification yet his or her report can be torn asunder by someone who is not equally qualified.  I am not being snobbish when I say that and there is a legal point to be made.  I could not disregard an assessment by a plumber, mechanic, doctor or an accountant because I am not qualified in any of those disciplines yet a SENO can dissect everything in a report that has been submitted by a school and an educated psychologist or occupational therapist thus denying a child key supports that would enable him or her to live a more structured life in education.  I know that these functions overlap with another Department.  The Minister of State is a good ambassador and champion for those who have disabilities and I hope that this is an issue she will take on during this term in government.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, I am responsible for providing supports for these children.  Yes, I will champion their needs.  I will work with all parents and all elected representatives on these issues and I hope that we reach the stage that the Deputy has articulated.  With his level of experience working in the profession of education he speaks with authority but I agree with what he said about the reports.  It is not the first time that I have heard that reports have been rubbished and shredded.  I will raise the matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, tomorrow.</p></speech>

I know that all these committees produce reports after deliberating.  I would like the following noted in the minutes of this committee:  We, as a committee, have heard concerns expressed that the SENO organisation nationally lacks standardisation and on a whim can have a devastating impact on supports that children desperately need; that there is good and bad but we, as a committee, are concerned at how things have been rolled out heretofore.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the Minister of State has said she will give us a monthly breakdown.  I would also appreciate us having a follow-up on the meeting that she will have tomorrow.  Can she supply the CHO 5 figures from her document?</p></speech>

Is that partly due to the monthly meetings?  Will increases continue?  I ask because it would be excellent to have accountability going forward.</p></speech>

Again, to turn the figures on their head, the number of assessments of need completed in CHO 5 for September was nil, for October it was 24 and for November it was 118.</p> <p>  The monthly meetings have proved very fruitful and I will continue to hold them but in two phases.  I mean I plan to hold a monthly meeting that will address the assessment of needs.  When we get on top of the backlog I plan to remain there.  The backlog will still be on my agenda every single month but I will flip its priority and make it the intervention piece.  I will start my intervention according to exactly what we have on our list as of 31 December.  I know what we have as of 30 June so we will start there and every month I will be able to read the data line by line, just like I read out earlier.  When we do not achieve on a line I will try to find out why, what barriers exist, how I can assist, what lessons can be learned and what learnings can be taken from one CHO to another.  For the last number of meetings that I have had with the HSE I have found the sharing of information on that particular platform has been really helpful to everyone involved.</p> <p>  I am a new Minister of State who wishes to work hard but I also represent the views of the people who elected me.  Not one of us, as elected representatives, would want to see a child on a list for a day longer than he or she should be or any day.  I have found the sharing of information very helpful and believe in transparency.  Yes, I will give the numbers to the committee every single month. </p></speech>

As she will know, having watched or listened to these meetings over the past few weeks the stories told here have been heartbreaking.  It was not just in this committee room that we heard such stories because we have all experience in dealing with people in these situations and we all want to find a solution.  Therefore, we, as a committee, welcome the opportunity to engage further with the Minister of State.  We are on board with doing anything we can to further such provision for these children and their families.  I welcome the monthly meetings and the fact that they will continue.  I thank the Minister of State and her officials, Ms Jenny Anderson and Mr. Noel Byrne, for appearing via video link.  We look forward to an ongoing engagement with the Minister of State.  Is it agreed that we publish the Minister of State's opening statement?  Agreed.</p> <p>  As this is our last meeting before Christmas, I wish everybody a happy Christmas and thank everybody, the members and the secretariat for all of the work that they have done.  This year it has been a lot more difficult than normal to organise meetings due to the arrangements that must be observed to prevent the spread of Covid, including only having two hours for a meeting.  Thankfully, the arrangements have worked well so far.  I wish everybody, the Minister of State and her staff a very happy Christmas. </p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy, director of consumer protection at the Central Bank.  We very much welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee today and discuss banking matters and hear the committee members&rsquo; views on the sector.</p> <p>  I would like to address the committee&rsquo;s invitation to discuss the NatWest strategic review of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s future direction.  In order for us to supervise effectively and for connected legal prohibition reasons we are not able to publicly discuss our engagement with individual firms on confidential matters.  In the same vein, it would be inappropriate for us to appear at a hearing with a regulated firm.  This is why we respectfully declined the request to attend last week's meeting.  We indicated in our response that we remained available, as always, to the committee on all matters relating to our mandate.  We take our engagement with this committee and our accountability to the Oireachtas very seriously.  Such engagement is one of several ways in which we demonstrate accountability for the work we undertake in safeguarding monetary and financial stability, and working to ensure that the financial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy.  We would welcome the opportunity to discuss further how we can improve our engagement with the committee such that we can help support it in meeting its objectives.</p> <p>  I will now briefly outline some of our current areas of focus in respect of the retail banks in Ireland, with households, businesses and the wider community as a whole to the forefront of our minds.  Much of the Central Bank's focus this year has been on mitigating the unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Central Bank's intertwined responsibilities of consumer protection, monetary policy, prudential regulation, payments and so on have strong interconnections with each other.  This positions us well to understand and mitigate the effects of the pandemic through monetary policy, macro prudential tools and supervision. </p> <p>  A key priority for us is that there are suitable supports in place to help borrowers affected by income shocks caused by the pandemic and that lenders continue to seek to sustainably resolve borrowers' longer term distress.  We have made our expectations clear on how borrowers should be treated and how lenders should engage constructively with distressed borrowers to ensure appropriate and tailored solutions to borrowers' circumstances are put in place.  We expect all lenders to have appropriate strategies, the necessary financial and operational resources and a suite of appropriate sustainable solutions to resolve distressed debt, whether it arose before or as a result of the pandemic.  We are also continuing to engage with a range of stakeholders on this issue and have been listening closely to borrower representatives such that our work continues to evolve.</p> <p>  The culture of firms is important in delivering our aspiration of a financial system that sustainably serves the needs of the economy and its consumers.  The failures of the past decade or so, notably relating to the tracker mortgage scandal, demonstrate this importance and also highlight that more progress is required.  We expect to see boards taking responsibility for the culture of their firms, overseeing product development and usage, actively promoting diversity and inclusion at all levels to improve decision-making and ensuring that robust internal systems are in place to drive effective cultures, including well-developed risk management frameworks.  Where this does not occur, we will take appropriate supervisory action.  Where serious or egregious breaches occur, we take enforcement action.  We are also seeking to strengthen the regulatory framework.  We are currently working with the Department of Finance to progress the individual accountability framework.  This seeks, among other things, to enhance the accountability of senior individuals in banks.</p> <p>  For the consumer and the taxpayer, safeguarding financial stability is one of the most important ways in which the Central Bank works to protect their interests, including seeking to ensure that the banking system operates in a safe, sound and sustainable way.  Banks need to be in a position to absorb shocks and have the ability to build buffers to withstand future shocks in order that they can serve the economy and consumers over the long-term.  The Irish banking system entered this crisis with substantial buffers of loss absorbing capital and considerably more robust business models, less risky loan books and better operational resilience than compared with the situation before the global financial crisis.  This ensured that they have been better able to continue to support their customers and the real economy through the pandemic.</p> <p>  The shift to digitally enabled services within the retail banks is already profound and is accelerating, including due to the behavioural changes arising from the pandemic.  As we look to the future of the retail banking sector, we see a rapidly changing landscape.  During the pandemic we have seen changes in consumer behaviour around use of cash, including significant increases in online transactions.  This acceleration of existing global trends is connected with consumers moving away from using banks in a number of ways.  Challenger firms, for example, providing payments services, often specialise in one service meaning they can be more agile and responsive to customer needs in that area. This is putting increasing pressure on banks to improve their digital offerings and change their approach to engaging with their customers.  While there are many benefits to this development for many people, it does increase the risk of financial exclusion, for example, due to age or income factors.</p> <p>  We recognise the importance of the credit union sector in this regard, with its wide network of community-focused and highly trusted co-operatives.  Irrespective of how retail banks choose to serve their customers they must, at a minimum, meet the standards we have in place for protecting consumers.  While decisions about the provision of services and branch networks are commercial matters for individual institutions, we have clear expectations on the need to take a consumer-focused approach.  The consumer protection code sets out the requirements on firms to ensure clear, timely communications with customers regarding any such permanent changes to a bank&rsquo;s branch network and to have alternative channels available to consumers to avail of banking services.</p> <p>  In the event that a regulated entity intends to withdraw from the Irish market, the withdrawal must be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of Irish financial services legislation, including the Central Bank's statutory codes of conduct.  Where a loan is sold or transferred, the protections that were available to borrowers prior to the transaction continue to be in place with the new loan owner.  This ensures that borrowers whose loans are sold or transferred maintain the same regulatory protections, including under the various Central Bank's statutory codes of conduct, such as the consumer protection code and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.</p><p> There are, of course, many other issues relevant to the Irish banks.  We have also been continuing to work to mitigate the risks posed to the economy, consumers and the wider financial system of the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU.  Brexit has already led to a significant growth in the size of the internationally focused banking sector in Ireland.  Going forward, we will be increasing our work on climate change, which is relevant to all banks operating in Ireland.  I look forward to our discussion on these and other important issues and developments relating to the banking sector.</p></speech>

There are two matters I would like to address separately, the first of which picks up on the issue we discussed at the previous meeting and Mr. Sibley's correspondence in regard to Brexit and its impact on the Irish financial system.  Mr. Sibley referred to significant growth and mentioned that the issuing of banking licences or the reallocation of staff is not necessarily the best indicator in that regard.  Is it possible to get a breakdown of the areas within banking or the business models in respect of which we are seeing that growth?  For example, is it focused in one particular area or is it spread evenly?  Which spreads are more important?  Mr. Sibley also referred to the strategy to avoid empty-shell policy on the part of banks.  Can he provide a little more detail on that?  I will refer to the second matter following Mr. Sibley's responses to those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.260" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2020121500002#B00300"><p>The change in the banking landscape is primarily focused on international activity and investment banking-type activity rather than on retail banking or Irish customers.  Brexit has necessitated that the banks operating out of the UK and providing services into the EU across a range of areas, be that corporate lending, investment banking, transaction services and so on, need to locate in EU countries.  As a result, here was a movement of part of the banking services from London to Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam.</p> <p>  On the second aspect of the Deputy's question, we seek to ensure that the hearts and minds of the organisation are operating out of Dublin.  If they are authorised here, they need to have boards, strong management capability and effective risk management here.  We recognise that they are interconnected.  They are typically part of wider international groups so there is a reliance on other parts of those groups for the provision of services such as, for example, those relating to IT.  There has been a transition process for capability to move from London to other parts of the EU.  Some of that transition has been slowed by the pandemic but we continue to expect that there will be hearts and minds here.  I would add that we operate very much as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  We are party to the European approach to banking supervision and there is a strong degree of consistency regarding how we expect entities to operate.  We expect firms to operate in Dublin as they would be expected to operate in other parts of the eurozone.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2020121500002#B00400"><p>I thank Mr. Sibley for his responses.  Before I move to my second substantive point, can he tell me, in the context of growth, if there are entities from certain jurisdictions whereby it is recognisable that there is a particular emphasis?  That feeds into my wider question, which is not necessarily Brexit-related but which relates, rather, to resilience and banking provision in the State as much for the consumer as for employees.  I know there are specific cases Mr. Sibley will not go into and I do not expect him to do so.  However, I would welcome the general opinion of the Central Bank on how well the banking system in this State is currently operated and serviced for consumers in terms of it being a viable market for other markets.  Is there any concern that, perhaps, it is over-dominated by certain institutions or, more worryingly, that certain entities looking at the model in Ireland are concerned that it could force them to make decisions in the coming 12 months or so which would have major consequences?  If so, what role is the Central Bank playing in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.262" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2020121500002#B00500"><p>As I understand the question, it relates to the banks that are serving the economy, businesses and consumers here rather than those that are coming to Ireland as a result of Brexit.  By international and European standards, the Irish retail banking market is somewhat concentrated.  It is more concentrated than in other jurisdictions in terms of the level of competition in the market.  There are definitely more competitive banking markets.  That said, we have seen more competition across and between the Irish banks over the past few years.  We are seeing some degree of competition coming in from outside, either from other banks or from other types of more specialist financial services providers.  In addition, the retail banking market is, from an SME perspective, even more concentrated.  There are primarily three banks that are providing services to SMEs of any real scale within Ireland.  The other two provide some such services but not of particular scale.  That potentially is an even more concentrated market.</p> <p>  In terms of our role if a firm decides to leave, in the system we operate we expect firms to be able to enter the market and, also, exit the market.  If they are to exit, it is important that they do so in an orderly fashion and without too much risk of externalities or cost to the taxpayer or the State.  Whenever there is a significant business change for a large institution, we would engage extensively with that firm about the approach it is taking to that change and how the risks associated with the change would be managed.  We do have particular requirements under the consumer protection code in terms of engagement which, my colleague, Ms McEvoy, will provide a little more detail on.</p></speech>

For example, in the context of the closure of branches, while our code requires that at least two months notice is provided, in practice, the notice period should be longer than two months.  The approach is very much around ensuring that consumers are considered, factored into any key decisions and that there is continuity of service, which is critical in this context.</p></speech>

Is that a concern from the bank's point of view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.265" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2020121500002#B00800"><p>I said that the banking market here is somewhat more concentrated than in other jurisdictions.  There are some challenges in that regard around, for instance, interest rate transmission from a monetary policy perspective.  This issue has been subject to much discussion, including by this committee.  As stated earlier, we are seeking for the financial system as a whole to serve the economy, businesses and consumers.  There are a number of aspects to that, resilience being one, and governance mismanagement being another.  We do not have a direct role in terms of competition.</p><p>We can see some positive developments, not necessarily linked to the banking system in terms of different types of competition coming into the market and different types of service provision.  I think we will see technology and innovation accelerating and continuing to disrupt the sector somewhat.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2020121500002#C00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  The tracker mortgage examination has taken up a large part of this committee's work in previous years.  Unfortunately, we have not concluded with it.  These are statements I would have made to the Central Bank when it issued its final report in July 2019.  I know the Chairman was also very vocal in saying that there were outstanding cases.  When the Central Bank closed off on the tracker mortgage examination in July 2019, its final report outlined that 40,100 customers were affected with &euro;683 million paid out by lenders.  A total of 99 family homes and 216 buy-to-let units were lost.  A number of months roll on and what happens?  AIB had to pay out millions of euro to 5,900 other victims when it had to announce in April that it also denied these individuals tracker mortgages, following a single case taken to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman which upheld the finding.</p> <p>  We talk about cohorts of people in different types of contracts.  Nearly 6,000 people in this type of contract were missed by the Central Bank.  Claims that were being made went through the independent process with AIB and were refused.  The Central Bank oversaw that and signed off a final report stating that it was done and dusted, although it was going to continue to monitor the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  That does not absolve it from its responsibilities, in terms of the consumer protection role that the Oireachtas has given the Central Bank.  In the middle of such a serious examination how could it miss that nearly 6,000 customers were also denied and wrongly impacted by AIB over their tracker mortgages?</p> <p>  If that were not good enough, three months later, in July last, AIB announced that there were another 1,000 victims of the tracker mortgage scandal, again as a result of an examination following a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Each of those affected through EBS and Haven, which are subsidiaries of AIB, were paid approximately &euro;6,000.  The earlier group of 6,000 victims were offered &euro;1,650.  We discussed this at the previous committee.  Members of the previous committee said that these people were entitled to a tracker mortgage and the &euro;1,650 did not deal with the issue.  I am baffled that the Central Bank continued to miss this, despite warnings from me and other committee members and from advocates arguing for it.</p> <p>  How did the Central Bank miss seeing that one bank had more than 7,000 additional victims of the tracker mortgage scandal, which the Central Bank, when it signed off on the report in July 2019, believed did not exist?</p></speech>

As the Deputy mentioned, the final report was never presented as the end of our work.  It was the end of that aspect of the investigation and we committed to continue to engage, to look at and, particularly, to monitor the work of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  I will let Ms McEvoy talk more on this.</p></speech>

In the first instance, the Central Bank had included the 6,000 AIB customers within the tracker mortgage examination.  They received a certain amount of redress and compensation from AIB.  However, by virtue being included in the examination, they had access to engage through the channels that were set up under the framework supporting the examination.  That includes access to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman which ultimately ruled in their favour, as the Deputy rightly cited.</p> <p>  It is important to reiterate Mr. Sibley's point that while the supervisory phase of our work had concluded last year, we continued and still continue to monitor the decisions in appeals out of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and, ultimately, if any of those cases are escalated to the courts system in Ireland.</p> <p>  Almost all - more than 99% - of the redress and compensation has been paid, amounting to &euro;710 million paid to 40,500 customers.  Those outstanding are those who are difficult to track down or seek to have points of contact.  I note the Deputy's points, but from our perspective, by virtue of them being included under the examination, they had access to those channels which ultimately yielded a different outcome for those consumers.</p></speech>

It was broader than the role the Central Bank plays regarding the tracker mortgage examination.  It ensured that all the protections afforded to consumers which are available at a national level are accessible to those customers.  More importantly, while we will look at things at a systemic level to see where redress is compensated and require those firms to make those payments of redress and compensation, it does not close the door for those customers.  They can accept that payment.  If they are unhappy, they can still progress their case through the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and in turn through the courts.  An important aspect of the framework is to ensure that those supports exist for those customers.</p></speech>

Throughout the tracker mortgage examination, we pushed the banks incredibly hard to try to take a customer-centric view of their sins regarding tracker mortgages.  We have outlined to this committee some of the resistance we have experienced in some of the enforcement investigations we have had.  There are limits on how much I can go into this.  We would have pushed cases such as these as hard as we possibly could - to the edge and beyond of our legal mandate.  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman has a different mandate.  We have ensured that the judgments made by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman are being more broadly applied when they are made.</p></speech>

If that individual had not taken the case, they would not have got up to &euro;30,000 in compensation because the Central Bank had finished its supervisory role when it completed its examination into that part.</p> <p>  Is Mr. Sibley suggesting to me that when the Central Bank concluded its final report, it believed that there were up to 6,000 further victims of the tracker mortgage with AIB?</p><p>As Mr. Sibley said, he was pushing AIB regarding this cohort but was not getting a response from it.</p></speech>

However, in this case, we are six or seven years into a major scandal where money was wrongly taken from the accounts of 40,000 people with respect to overcharging.  People lost their family homes.  Where did the Central Bank&rsquo;s consumer protection role feature for these 5,900 consumers?  How could it have missed something so blatant?  That was missed not only once but three months later there was another case involving 1,100 consumers.  The witnesses appeared before the members of this committee and those points were made to them.</p></speech>

Witnesses from the Central Bank are before us.  The bank has a statutory obligation in terms of consumer protection.  The witnesses were fully aware through the tracker mortgage examination that banks had been fleecing their customers.  Members of this committee pointed out this cohort of individuals, other forums such as Askaboutmoney, which I am sure the bank monitors, and other groups were campaigning on this issue but the Central Bank completely abdicated its consumer protection role for this cohort of individuals.  I acknowledge what the bank did at later stages for others but for this cohort, how could it get so wrong?  We cannot turn back the clock but we need to have faith in the Central Bank that this will not happen again.  It is terrible that an organ of the State, which is in place to protect consumers, in the middle of a major scandal basically washed its hands of these customers and left them to decide whether they would or would not take it any further.</p></speech>

It is for that very reason they had access, if they were unhappy with the outcomes they received bilaterally with AIB, to bring those issues forward through the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, FSPO.  It is important to acknowledge that.</p></speech>

The bank included them in the examination but when it examined them, it did not come to the conclusion they should have been awarded a tracker mortgage.  Is that correct?  That is what AIB was also arguing, including right through its appeals process.  That was then overturned by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  That is the core of the issue.</p> <p>  How did the Central Bank come to the conclusion - given this was within the scope of the examination and it considered this cohort - these individuals were not entitled to a tracker mortgage and, therefore, the administrative penalty of &euro;1,615 that was offered to them was appropriate?  That was the Central Bank's conclusion.  </p></speech>

It looks at individual circumstances and takes into account a far wider set of criteria than we would have the power to do.  That is a key delineation between our role as a systemic regulator and the ombudsman's role to ascertain and review individual complaints.  It is also important to note the framework the bank established and developed ensured that the individual&rsquo;s outcome that the Deputy referenced was applied right across the board to all the customers impacted by that decision of the FSPO.  From our perspective, that is a critical component of the framework.  We continue to challenge the institutions and lenders in that context to make sure that individual decision has a read right across to all customers who were impacted in the same manner.</p></speech>

Ms McEvoy spoke of an informed view and I am sure it was, but does she acknowledge it was the wrong view and that the bank came up with the wrong conclusion?  She referred to different criteria the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman can take into account but at the core of this was the question of whether these individuals should have been offered a tracker mortgage.  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman ruled they were entitled to a tracker mortgage.  The Central Bank, in the examination which went on for years, came to a different conclusion.</p></speech>

How did the bank miss those?  Three months later, in July, AIB announced its subsidiaries, EBS and Haven, also took money.  At the core of this is overcharging and entitlement to a tracker mortgage.  Those subsidiaries deducted money from people's bank accounts that they had no right to do because these individuals had a right to a tracker mortgage.  Some &euro;6,000 in compensation was paid to 1,100 customers.  How did the bank miss that one?</p></speech>

It is important to note that right from the outset, the Central Bank challenged each of lenders within the scope of the tracker mortgage examination and pushed hard.  That resulted in an additional 20,000 customers being included from where the banks initially drew the line, if that makes sense.  Those additional customers came about through thorough and further engagement with AIB where it discovered those customers were also caught within the confines of the tracker mortgage examination.  It is very much back to the core point that the intervention and continuous challenge - Mr. Sibley spoke about that being quite difficult and fraught in certain cases - resulted in more customers impacted by the actions of the banks being caught within the confines of the examination.</p></speech>

I ask the Central Bank to update its final report.  We know there are at least another 7,000 victims and more money has been paid out.  I ask the witnesses to update the bank's report.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about the accountability regime.  Mr. Sibley has mentioned this in his opening statement for the past three years and it is three years since the bank has called for this.  We still do not have legislation on holding senior executives accountable.  I refer in particular to KBC.  We know the breaches in which KBC was involved saw 11 families lose their homes as a result of the tracker mortgage scandal.  There was an &euro;18.3 million fine and 3,700 victims in that bank.  We know that the stop the harm principle was not adhered to, rather the approach was to inflict harm right up to the endpoint.  KBC continued to inflict harm during the tracker mortgage examination.  Has anybody in KBC been held accountable or queried in respect of fitness and probity standards?  Has anybody in KBC been asked to resign by the Central Bank given that in the middle of the examination, it continued to repossess homes?  Am I correct that a home was repossessed from somebody who should not have had their home repossessed?  KBC continued to overcharge during that entire period.  Has there been any individual accountability in KBC?</p></speech>

I think that was the adjective she used in our statement following the publication of the investigation into KBC.  Clearly, its behaviour was atrocious and has had a devastating effect on families and individuals.  We continue to investigate.  Our enforcement investigation remains open at this stage across all that we saw in our tracker mortgage investigation.  One reason we pushed for the individual accountability framework is because of the challenges in holding individuals to account under the current legislation.  We think the individual accountability framework can be improved.  We are working with the Department of Finance and are keen for that to be in place as quickly as possible.  Clearly, matters relating to what happened in KBC are to the fore of our minds when we look at fitness and probity for instance and absolutely have been part of our of considerations in terms of further fitness and probity applications.  Unfortunately, some of that is not transparent to the Deputy at this stage but certainly our enforcement investigations continue to try to hold the individuals who were responsible to account.</p></speech>

Finally, I wish to ask about a case with which Mr. Sibley may be familiar.  A letter related to it was shared on social media platforms.  It involves a loan that was sold by Ulster Bank to the vulture fund, Promontoria Scariff.</p><p>It was a loan about which there was engagement with Ulster Bank until June last year.  There was an expectation of an arrangement being entered into and documentation to verify that.  The loan was sold unilaterally to this vulture fund, Promontoria.  The individual continued to make partial payments as they had been, expecting Ulster Bank's arrangement, although it was not signed off on, would be adhered to by Promontoria.  Promontoria then said that it does not do that type of arrangement and would not do anything that Ulster Bank was offering.  It called in the full loan on 23 October 2020, and has since issued a repossession order, asking the family of two adults and three teenagers to vacate their family home in the mouth of Christmas, before 21 December.</p><p> We hear from the Central Bank all the time that the same regulations and oversight apply to vulture funds as to main street banks.  This is what vulture funds do because they have no interest in the long term.  What do the witnesses say to a case like that and to people who may be concerned about Ulster Bank selling its loans to a vulture fund, Cerberus, which is one of the worst in the market?  The word that comes from the Central Bank is that the protections follow but the reality is that the bank can call in the loan if one falls into any difficulty and increase the variable interest rate at any time.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that the protections that are in place are the same whether it is a bank or not, and expectations are effectively the same.  I cannot comment on the individual circumstances because I have not seen the detail.  As ever, if the Deputy has information that he would like to share, we will look at that.  We have significant empathy and sympathy for anyone in that circumstance.  There are protections in place for people, especially if it is the family home, in the code of conduct for mortgage arrears and what needs to take place, with repossession as the absolute last resort.  There are also protections in place in the courts system.</p></speech>

The due diligence that was undertaken by the original lender passes forward so that the new lender has a full suite of information about the borrower and is not making decisions based on its shorter-term experience with the borrower and has the background to the case.  We have publicly communicated that if the borrower is communicating, the new loan owner should not unilaterally move or change the arrangement that the borrower has.  That is critically important.  On Mr. Sibley's point, the code of conduct for mortgage arrears applies to both banks and non-banks, and there are strict criteria about repossessions.</p></speech>

That expectation may not have legal effect.  If one gets a loan from a long-established bank, one expects it to behave in a certain way, then when the loan is sold to another entity which may not have the same record in the market, one would probably still hope and expect to be treated the same way, but that expectation does not have any legal effect, does it?</p></speech>

Part of it is a factor of the crisis we had.  We still have the legacy of that crisis today.  It is evident that mortgage lending in Ireland has historically been riskier.  That results in banks having to hold more capital relative to that lending, which also has an influence on price.  We are comparing averages, but there are significant differences in different markets around the eurozone, including length of mortgage lending, for example, and having longer-term fixed rate mortgages in some jurisdictions and, atypically, non-interest costs in some jurisdictions.  There are multiple reasons for the differences, but competition is evidently part of the reason that banks can charge higher interest rates in Ireland than those in other countries.</p> <p>  What we have done is to seek to address some of the fundamental issues affecting the functioning of the mortgage market, including trying to address the longer term mortgage arrears and trying to put in place a more resilient system, with business models as well as macroprudential rules to enhance the resilience of borrowers.  We have sought to encourage and facilitate greater switching.  We are doing some more work on the behavioural triggers that could be applied to facilitate a greater degree of switching.  That will not only have an impact in terms of the individual borrowers but will help to drive greater competition into the market.  Finally, we are seeing very nascent signs of potentially more competition coming into the mortgage market, not necessarily exclusively through the banking system.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-15a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2020121500002#F00500"><p>I thank our guests for appearing before the committee and giving us the benefit of their knowledge.  I, like others in this room, have been critical of the Central Bank over a long period in the past.  This is not personal and I do not want any of the witnesses to take it as personal, but there are issues which public representatives have had to face which were unusual, to say the least.  They still continue.  To put it in the vernacular, the banking system in this country still punishes borrowers above and beyond other borrowers across Europe for something they did wrong during the crash, and I will come to that momentarily, or for something they are about to do wrong on the basis that they are a higher risk than those elsewhere.</p> <p>  There is no such thing as risk-free lending anywhere in the world.  It does not exist.  However, we were led to believe during and immediately after the financial crash that it should have been risk free.  It is not, never can be and never will be, nor should it be.  That is why there is speculation in markets and so forth.  I also realise, like everybody here, that we must have a stable banking system.  That is fundamental to an open economy, and we must be sure there are good practices that protect the economy and protect the consumer.  Reference has been made to this at length.</p> <p>  One of the problems I and all of us have faced is sitting down across a table from the representatives of banks which had lent money to borrowers, knowing they should not have done so.  They knew it was impossible to meet the demand at a later stage but, clearly, they were of the mind that it would be all right because there was an inflationary situation and property prices would exceed all expectations.  What in God's name was going on at that stage?  Nobody would think like that and presume that it was going to continue.  It could not happen.  I am sure you, Chairman, other members of the committee and I advised countless people that under no circumstances should they borrow in the way that was being suggested to them.  Obviously, people did not always take that advice.  It was harsh advice at the time, and they saw people like us as impeding them and their progress.  In the long run, we were speaking for their well-being.  To outline what happened, no worthwhile regulations were applied at that time.  Hence, the full extent of the problem.</p> <p>  What happened next was worse.  The banks retrospectively applied good conduct on borrowing after the event.  It was the most amazing performance.  When the horse was well and truly bolted and galloping down the far end of the track, suddenly the banks said they were going to apply good banking practice and good regulations on the borrower, who had already borrowed far in excess of what his or her capability of repayment could and should be.  On the one hand, there must be good confidence in the banking system, but on the other we must restore public confidence where the consumer is concerned.</p> <p>  There has been reference to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That has been quoted to me several times.  The code of conduct benefits the bank over the borrower to a great extent.  The bank tells the borrower his or her borrowings are unsustainable and, as a result, this is how we must proceed.  The limit is that it repossesses the property.  It might take a while, but the bank will repossess it.  It will pile on interest and so forth, in many cases piling on the interest with no regard to what it is doing to people, to such an extent that there is no other way out except to liquidate the debt and repossess the property.  I will not go into the emotional situation of the thousands of people who found themselves in the extraordinarily sad position of having lost or losing their homes.  That was on the cards for perhaps six months or a year or whatever the case may be.  It is still happening.</p> <p>  Does the Central Bank have the power to impose on what are now regarded as vulture funds some type of recognition for the fact that they acquired the loan books at a knock-down rate in many situations, with a discount of 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% and up to 80% in some cases?  Of course, the borrower never knows what the full discount was, but the borrower must pay for it.  The borrowers are now falling into what is known as distressed debt, because they have not been able to repay or discharge the loan.  That is because they were never going to be able to repay it.  It was not possible from the outset.  The unfortunate borrowers include business borrowers and the businesses involved, who gave personal guarantees in respect of their households and so forth.  They ended up in tragedy.  I and everybody else in the committee have sat in front of vulture fund representatives while men and women cried openly, sought mercy and got none.  That is a very sad thing with which to conclude.  However, that is the way it happened.</p> <p>  All the time, members of the committee were tabling parliamentary questions.  We could not ask too many questions in case we would cause a flight of funds, and we could not ask too many pointed questions.  We asked questions as to whether the banking system and the economy were based on sound economic fundamentals.  As to the number of times we tabled those questions, I sometimes dream about them.  The reply was "Yes", they were.  In fact, it was "No", they were not.  However, nobody recognised what we were trying to say at the time.  Nobody cared.  There were financial regulators, ombudsmen and the Central Bank.  That was presided over by all these agencies, without demur, and we know what the consequences were.</p><p>The Chairman will be glad to know I have come to this conclusion.  We need some hope for those who are in what are called distressed loan scenarios.  We need some recognition that the banking system, whether a vulture or original lender, is going to take into account the circumstances.  They say to us "that was then and this is now".  In other words, it was fine then but the banks are not part and parcel of the previous regime and the new rules will be applied now, whether people like it or not, and nothing can be done about it.</p><p> We may not be able to do anything about it now but we might have to.  Instead of a continuing reference to the code of conduct and the last review of the code of conduct in 2018, I ask that the code be urgently reviewed again with greater recognition of the hardship caused to many borrowers.</p><p> Incidentally, we all know these borrowers as people who ran their businesses and homes very effectively for many years, borrowing money and paying it back, never leaving money owing to anybody.  They were always able to pay it back, except when there was a convergence of a massive amount of overhang of borrowing at the same time and place, which rendered the State and the banks insolvent.  It was an incredible performance but nobody accepted responsibility.  Nobody came with us to the table to speak on behalf of the people who find themselves with distressed mortgages.  It is within the capacity of the banks and the Central Bank to oversee a system that is fair to these people.  It is a matter for the Central Bank at this stage.</p><p> A final point relates to banking competition.  A number of raiders introduced themselves to this jurisdiction before the banking crash, undermining the banking system in the country by undercutting others, offering mortgages and borrowings at a rate never known before.  Loans were granted on interest-only terms, so what sort of system were we in?  This was meant to be the system for the foreseeable future, and it was seen as good banking according to the system that applied at the time.</p><p> I am not asking the witnesses to comment on an individual bank but if a bank moves from our system now, it will not be in the interest of the consumer or the business people served by that bank, particularly if that bank's loan book is to be transferred to a vulture fund.  There is now a conundrum that the Central Bank must resolve.  We cannot do it.  These controls are in the hands of the Central Bank.</p><p> I would like to see us retain the level of competition within the banking system in this country and on a sound footing.  Everything must be done to ensure it continues without interruption, and that in the event of vulture funds deciding they can seize an opportunity to take over a major chunk of the banking system in the country, we must remind them that they are only here in sufferance and they are only partially accountable to the Central Bank.  We have asked all these questions before and there are unregulated third parties involved with borrowing in this country and taking over loan books.  We asked the questions many times and were told they would be subject to usual rules and regulations but these bodies are not subject to such rules.</p><p> It is all fine to complain about this but somebody must do something about it fairly soon.  I have gone long over my time, for which I apologise, but at any time in future if the Chairman wishes members to attend a meeting with the Central Bank or representatives of banks or vulture funds, we will be more than happy to attend and support.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the time limits but I am certainly happy to engage within this committee and bilaterally if helpful.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the financial crisis and the behaviour, business models and approach in the entire system failed leading into the financial crisis.  I have no disagreement there.  We have worked very hard over the past decade or more to both deal with the crisis that enveloped the country and to put in place a much more resilient system that protects the country, borrowers and consumers from any recurrence.  It very significantly enhanced the regulatory framework both from a resilience perspective but also from a consumer protection perspective.</p> <p>  We have also undertaken much work to try to address the level of distress that resulted from the banking crisis.  There has been much progress over many years on that.  We can looked at the level of restructuring that has taken place across mortgages; approaching a quarter of loans that existed at the time of the crisis have had some degree of restructure.  More than 130,000 loans were restructured to address elements of distress and another approximately 60,000 were addressed pre-distress.</p> <p>  When I reference numbers I am acutely conscious that I am talking about individuals and households.  Unfortunately, there is still a legacy of distress, primarily with mortgage holders, the majority of which are now more than two years past due on mortgage repayments, both sitting within the banking system and some outside the banking system.  We are absolutely committed to continuing to try to address that to the greatest extent that we can.</p> <p>  The majority of these borrowers are paying something and about half are deemed to be co-operating.  There are potential solutions within the financial system for many of those borrowers but there are also challenges that go beyond the financial system where the borrowers are not co-operating or making repayments.  We must consider the safety nets available for those types of borrowers.</p> <p>  Even right up to the courts system it is never too late to engage and we can see that with what comes out of the courts.  We are pushing hard from a lender perspective to ensure they continue to strive to engage and we have also taken the hard lessons from the financial crisis into how we deal with the distress evident from the Covid-19 pandemic.  We are trying to ensure the issues that arose immediately after the financial crisis do not arise again.  This relates to borrowers whose incomes have been affected by the pandemic, and they should be supported to the greatest extent possible so they do not go into longer-term arrears.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to raiders coming in and affecting the market.  For any firm authorised in Ireland and any bank authorised within the eurozone able to branch into Ireland, we expect it to have a robust business model that is likely to be sustainable over the long term.  It should have sufficient financial resources, including in times of stress, and it should have a good grasp of its risks.  It should be well run and be able to be resolvable in the event that it fails.</p> <p>  I hope this addresses some of what the Deputy raised but as I said I am happy to engage bilaterally if that is helpful.</p></speech>

Our banking market shows enormous supplier power.  The banks exert far more power than they normally would if there were healthier competition within the market.  We have two pillar banks, in the words of the Government, and they have about 80% of the market.  Instead of seeing that much increased competition, we are seeing one of the significant players probably leave the market over the next while.  Is it not therefore a significant objective of the Central Bank, given its responsibilities to consumers, and a significant objective of the Government to see a radical transition from this overly concentrated market - dangerously concentrated, in my view - to a functioning competitive market over the coming years?  For example, banks have enormous power over interest rates.  Ireland has either the highest or the second highest mortgage interest rate in the European Union.  I understand that the banking difficulties we have had play a part in this, but the banking structure also plays a radical part in it.  There is no doubt that if there were tighter competition, it would chase those interest rates down somewhat.  Consider even the way the banks interact with customers.  The banks can determine most elements of the engagement with customers because they have this enormous supplier power.  The locations of banks and the banks' closing down of their units in smaller provincial towns and throughout the country have an enormous effect on enterprise, families, etc.  Is it not a very negative element of the banking industry that it is so concentrated?</p></speech>

As I have referred to a couple of times, our aspiration is for the banking system and the key markets within it, including the mortgage market, to function better than they do today.  Competition can play a role here.  We are not the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, so there is a limit to our direct responsibilities but, as I have touched on, the overall functioning is important to us and part of our aspiration.  As to how we go directly at this issue, we think about what the underlying issues are and about the underlying cases of dysfunction, to the extent that it is there, and we recognise that barriers to entry to deliver banking services to Irish customers are, for European banks, incredibly low.  If one is operating within the EU today-----</p></speech>

For example, Permanent TSB will not pay any taxes until 2038.  AIB will not pay any taxes on its profits until 2037.  If I were a European company coming into a market and was competing with companies that were not paying tax on their profits, would that be a barrier to entry?</p></speech>

If we were to look at what the Deputy refers to in isolation, perhaps that is the case, but I would not have thought it is a compelling reason that European banks are not seeking to enter the Irish market.  We try to look at the biggest issues in the system as a whole, from an overall functioning perspective, a borrower service perspective and a consumer perspective, and how best we can help address them.  We cannot force lenders to lend.  We cannot force new entrants.  We do not have a direct role from a competition perspective.  What we can see is that there have been issues with how banks have been operating.  There have been issues with the challenges around distressed debt, which we have talked about already.  There are issues as to how markets function in terms of, for instance, the amount of switching and so on.  We are trying to address some of these underlying factors within our overall responsibilities.</p></speech>

However, the three potential blocs within the financial system that could operate in competition more directly with the banks are An Post, a public banking system and even the credit union system.  The barrier to those who wish to enter this market is, therefore, Government policy.  I am sure there are regulatory constraints and that it might be difficult for some of these organisations to operate under their current structures.  There is no public banking system here but, between An Post and the credit unions, surely if there were the policy will to develop An Post and the public banking system on the model of the Sparkasse system in Germany, for example, or to empower the credit unions to operate within that space, they could offer a significant competitive opportunity for people throughout the country.</p></speech>

He is absolutely right about that.  We have taken action to facilitate and allow credit unions to lend significantly more, both in long-term mortgage lending and to the smaller SME sector.</p></speech>

There are a number of issues here such as the scale of individual credit unions and the capacity of the credit unions to move their business models with any kind of scale.  I think there are potential opportunities for more of a shared services model within the credit union sector.  Some individual credit unions are proving very successful in growing their loan books, but in aggregate across the system not so much.  It is important also to think about the technology changes we are living through and which are, to my mind, accelerating, not just from a mortgage market perspective.  I refer to the likes of Revolut and other payment service providers, the potential for peer-to-peer and so on.  I think that will continue to shake up the industry here.  I have had a number of engagements with the likes of Irish Rural Link.  I met representatives of the Sparkassen when I was in the UK.  I was responsible for the supervision of the Landesbanken, which are connected with the Sparkassen, so I am familiar enough with that business model.  Ultimately, it requires investment for a public bank to operate in Ireland, but that would be subject to the same criteria as for any bank looking to be authorised in Ireland.  Ultimately, banking licences are the responsibility of the ECB, but we would have a role to play.  It comes down to someone putting in the money behind it.</p></speech>

Mario Draghi said in 2018, I think, that the mortgage market in Ireland operates as a de facto monopoly.  That was the language he used.  There is no doubt but that a de facto monopoly hurts consumers significantly.  That is the nature of monopolies.</p> <p>  I will change tack.  It has been reported to me by a number of people that there seems to be an upsurge in receivers disposing of distressed properties.  These are people who are in a distressed situation with their banks.  They have a property, a business, a farm, etc.  They are finding almost after the fact that their property or farm has been sold to a vulture fund or some other kind of fund and that the value that has been achieved in the sale is far less than what was offered in negotiations between the individual and the bank itself.</p><p>Is it not the responsibility of the receiver to achieve the best possible price for the property in that scenario?  Has the Central Bank analysed the volume of transactions and values achieved in those sales?  The data would help us decide if a major problem is happening all of a sudden.</p></speech>

As the Deputy has described things, it sounds as though circumstances are such that the legal title has already been transferred.  I do not think that he has described a sale of a loan but a sale of a property so the ownership of that property has already transferred.  I guess a court order has been applied but not executed in terms of repossessing the property.  There are strong protections in place for an owner-occupier or family home.  Some farms are classified as a commercial premises so protections are different.  If the title has already been transferred through the court process then the same level of protection is not there.  We are actively tracking court orders for primary dwelling homes.</p></speech>

To the end of quarter 2 of this year, the number of court orders for owner-occupier houses has consistently been coming down for a good while.  Unsurprisingly, the number really came down in the second quarter because of the pandemic.  We can also see that right up to the court cases being heard engagement still worked.  Many cases were settled on the steps of the court so court orders were not executed.  I can certainly share the information we have in that regard.  The Deputy's question is partly that but partly something else in terms of those who have been sold post-title transfer.</p></speech>

It is not just owner-occupiers.  I have heard from people who have buy-to-lets and businesses or farms.</p> <p>  The Central Bank warned at the start of the process that there would be a &euro;22 billion hole in the Government's finances this year due to Covid, etc.  What does the future hold in terms of the European rules being reapplied and the timescale?  What policy options are available to the Government in order for it to achieve the European rules in the future?</p></speech>

The Central Bank is in the unenviable place of defending the indefensible.  We have heard about some Irish banking practice and, unfortunately, at best the banks seem to use the Central Bank like a mudflap.  The threat of fines that the Central Bank has sanctioned, and the threat in other cases, have not had a great bearing on the behaviour of the banks, as pointed out by the good Deputies here today.  Has the Central Bank issued a threat to revoke or withdraw the banking licence of an existing bank, banks or in terms of banking that has been issued through Ireland?</p> <p>  As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has mentioned, I, too, want to talk about what happens when banks sell loans to so-called vulture funds.  I know that banks sell a book of loans and loans are bundled together.  However, banks do not pick the price to sell a loan at out of the air so every property has a value in a loanbook.  Is the Central Bank informed when a loan is sold, for example, by Ulster Bank to Pretorius or whoever?   </p></speech>

Does Mr. Sibley think that is a possibility?</p> <p>  Online fraud and the variety of such fraud has become a massive issue in Ireland.  As banking increasingly moves towards online banking and faceless banking, online fraud will become an even bigger problem.  One of the major banks, Bank of Ireland, recently ran an advertising campaign to make its customers aware of online fraud.  What else can we do to combat online fraud?  </p> <p>  Some of my friends run a company but they had a lot of money taken off them because somebody pretended to be somebody else and money was sent to the wrong account.  My friends found dealing with their bank to be fine but they are afraid to say much about the incident.  Can protocols be put in place?  Can safety measures be strengthened by the Central Bank or the ombudsman?  Can a branch of the Central Bank act as an intermediary in such cases?  The banks do return the moneys stolen if one has not done anything intentionally.  In fairness to the Irish banking system, there is a lot of cover for affected customers.  However, there are many instances where there is no cover and people lose their money simply by making a mistake in good faith.  Can something more be done to protect the consumer in these cases?</p></speech>

Personally, I do not feel that I am here to defend the indefensible.</p><p>We are grateful for the opportunity to be here.  We take our responsibility to be accountable and transparent, in respect of the work we do, incredibly seriously.  There are clearly issues in the financial system and it is helpful for us to come to the committee to discuss those issues.  I welcome the opportunity to continue to enhance how we engage.</p><p> Regarding the specific questions raised, concerning the five retail banks, which I think was the aspect raised, I am not aware of any threat we have made to revoke the licences of those five banks.  That could possibly have been before my time, but I have been working in the Central Bank for more than eight years and I am not aware of it.  What we have done, and continue to do, as appropriate, from time to time is to apply restrictions on licences for various reasons, for example, if we have concerns regarding the safe operation of an institution, its business model, its financial stability or aspects of how it might be interacting with its customers.  We do that from time to time, and beyond banks.</p><p> Moving on to loan sales, typically, they are sold on a portfolio basis.  They are dealt with in commercial terms and the lenders, typically, decide to not share that information.  To my knowledge, those portfolios would not be valued, from a mortgage loan perspective certainly, on an individual loan basis.  What I would expect to happen is for a purchaser to do a level of due diligence, which would probably be sample based rather than looking every loan, and then offering a price based on that due diligence, which would also include forecasting of future performance and the like, as well as underlying property values.  It is a matter for those purchasers concerned whether they choose to disclose are not.  Typically, the prices are overall aggregates.</p></speech>

When the buyers are going to that bother, at that stage, to write and provide notification, I think the moving price at which the loan is being sold should also be included in that notification.  I have no doubt that the purchasers will have an idea of that information, because they will be on the phone the next day to the people whose loans they have bought telling them they are in charge now.  It is no problem if it is a tickety-boo loan, but most of these types of loans are bundled in certain packages, such as performing, non-performing, etc.  A figure exists in that context.

We hear of customers quite often, whom Deputy Doherty speaks of every day of the week, who seem to be in the dark all the time in respect of their loans.

We have certainly acknowledged that we have seen an increase in this practice.  I have a great deal of sympathy for those consumers who have been impacted by phishing attacks and alerts.  This happens, however, in an environment outside of the regulatory parameters.  We have, though, issued warnings for consumers on our consumer hub and bringing to their attention the likelihood of the format that such attacks can take.  I refer to informing customers to not click on links which they do not recognise, and all those kinds of things.  That is in the area of trying to enhance consumers' awareness of, and educate them about, the risks contained within those kinds of email attacks.<br/><br/>At a broader level, a European directive entitled the payment services directive, EU 2015/2366 PSD2 is in play.  It has existed since 2015 and has since been amended.  The premise of that directive and the background behind it is to increase security in respect of transactions online and to minimise, as far as possible, fraud or other types of attacks which may arise.  We have worked closely with our industry in recent years to ensure that it is fully <i>au fait</i>with the requirements of PSD2 and that those companies concerned have updated their IT systems and channels of interaction with consumers to ensure compliance with the requirements of the direct, particularly in the area of strong customer authentication.<br/><br/>That aspect is increasingly common and, as a consumer himself, the Senator will probably have experienced situations, when seeking to complete a transaction online, where an additional code might have been required, or a security question may have needed to be answered, or, depending on the technology, a fingerprint might be required.  All those enhancements seek to strengthen how consumers interact with online transactions and to minimise, insofar as is possible, the risks of fraud or attacks.  It is fair to say in many cases, however, that legislation, regulation and the industry were probably a step or two behind the attackers.  That does not mean, however, that we should not do all we can to ensure that the interests of consumers are best protected.</p></speech>

Last week, we had representatives from the Financial Services Union, FSU, before the committee.  Unfortunately, it was only representatives from that union who were available to speak to us then.  I feel strongly about the future of Ulster Bank, because it supports 3,000 people in jobs on a regionally-balanced basis.  We are concerned about the major impact of any change in that regard.  In 2019, Ulster Bank provided new lending of &euro;3.1 billion into the southern economy, with deposits of &euro;22 billion.  Ulster Bank is the third largest mortgage lender in this State and provides 20% of lending to our SMEs.</p> <p>  We are concerned about its future.  The parent company of Ulster Bank, NatWest, has stated that it will undertake a strategic review of the operations of Ulster Bank, including the potential closure of the bank's operations in this State.  It was also reported recently that Goldman Sachs has been employed to undertake that strategic review.  The witnesses will be aware that Goldman Sachs itself has been involved in the Irish mortgage market, namely, in setting up vulture funds which have bought up distressed debts from our retail banks and then selling on those debts, without paying a cent in tax on its profits, through section 100 structures.  Can the witnesses tell us what contact there may have been between them, the FSU and Ulster Bank staff in respect of NatWest or Ulster Bank regarding terms of reference of this strategic review?</p></speech>

Can Mr. Sibley explain what impact this will have on Ulster Bank borrowers, customers and mortgage holders?  He stated earlier that there should be no place in Irish banking for vulture funds.  I would be interested in hearing if he would support Deputy Pearse Doherty&rsquo;s No Consent, No Sale Bill, which would prohibit the sale of mortgage loans to vulture funds without the consent of borrowers.</p> <p>  Another question concerns the impact of the withdrawal on the Irish market.  I know that Deputy Pearse Doherty wrote to the Central Bank on 25 November about the withdrawal and the impact that would have, and that the Central Bank said in response that the exit of one entity from such a system, all other things being equal, could contribute to upward pressure to lending interest rates and could potentially lead to weaker credit availability.  For Mr. Sibley, what would the withdrawal of Ulster Bank mean for the Irish banking sector and consumers?</p></speech>

If one of the larger banks, or any of the banks, given their number and the amount of competition in the market, was to exit, clearly, there is the potential for that to have significant implications.  I completely empathise in terms of the concerns of and uncertainty for those people working for an organisation where there is this type of strategic review ongoing.  There was a similar example previously in connection with KBC.  A strategic review was undertaken in regard to KBC a couple of years ago and there was similar speculation.  At the end of that, KBC decided to stay.  I cannot comment or speculate on what will happen with Ulster Bank but it is not a total given that it will leave.  I appreciate that there is uncertainty for people who are working for Ulster Bank, and that must be challenging.</p> <p>  In terms of the competition point the Deputy makes, and she referred to my letter, where I would be most concerned is in regard to SMEs.  We are seeing a degree more competition in the mortgage market, so the trend is downward and one measure would be interest rates.  There has been an increase in competition and we are, as I touched on earlier, seeing signs of potential other competition coming into the market, both from banks and non-banks in mortgages.  However, the SME lending is more concentrated again because, of the banks, there are only three banks that are lending to SMEs at any kind of scale.  In terms of potential implications were Ulster Bank to decide to leave, that would be the area that is most concerning in terms of the functioning of the market.</p> <p>  There are other options out there for SMEs, and the other two banks and the credit unions are able to lend to smaller SMEs, but none of that is approaching the scale of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s lending to SMEs.  Clearly, that potentially is an area where both the provision of service and lack of price competition might well be a factor.  I would agree with the Deputy on her concerns.</p></speech>

When the FSU was here, it stated that one concern it had was that if the branches close, and I appreciate we do not know and, hopefully, it will not be the case, we would lose local knowledge.  As Mr. Sibley knows, if there is a banking branch, there is that local knowledge of the people, of the farmer and of the local business, so that is one issue that would be concerning.  I thought it was quite an interesting point by the FSU and, in that sense, if that were to happen, I think a greater importance would be set on the credit union sector.  Mr. Sibley stated that he recognised the importance of the credit union sector.  Specifically, we need to recognise the help it can provide people in terms of increasing financial exclusion and, obviously, that would be a great concern with the increasing digitisation of banking.  We know there are huge swathes of the country that just do not have broadband, so that is not a factor for them, and there are people who are not able to undertake online banking, as well as the fact we are, unfortunately, moving away from community-based branches.</p> <p>  The Central Bank said recently in regard to the banks that there can be a distance between what they say and what their customers experience.  Many credit unions have contacted me because they are concerned about their future.  They would be concerned about what the Central Bank says and what they themselves experience, and this is what they have come to me about.  They are concerned about the scale of the crisis facing them in the next five years.  They have said the regulations being placed on the sector at the moment put them at a competitive disadvantage to the banks, and that this has stymied their ability to lend and, therefore, is strangling the customer's ability to borrow.  At the same time, we see that Ulster Bank could potentially exit the market, which would add to that.  We cannot underestimate the huge opportunity that credit unions have and the positive impact they can have if there is this move towards the closure of local bank branches.</p> <p>  I want to refer to a number of concerns the credit unions raised with me in regard to-----</p></speech>

Larger credit unions can lend up to 15%.  This was seen as an advancement of regulation but the credit unions are quite concerned about it.  We know that in large, developed credit union movements in other countries, credit unions are allowed to lend up to 60%.  We also know that over half of the consumer credit market in Ireland is for mortgages.  How can credit unions provide a real alternative with this kind of restriction in place?  Given that they feel they are stymied in terms of having a more balanced loan book, is this creating a greater risk for credit unions?  Some credit unions have come to me and stated that they want to set their own limits for what they can lend.  I would be interested to hear Mr. Sibley's views on that.  Those are the issues they have come to me with.</p></speech>

With the new regulations coming in, I think it is in the order of &euro;1.5 billion to &euro;2 billion of extra lending that the credit union unions can do within the limits, so they are nowhere near hitting the limits and they are such a long way from it.</p> <p>  There are some real challenges within the credit union sector in terms of the longer-term sustainability and viability of their business model.  There has been a lot of hard work done by the credit unions and the membership bodies.  The Central Bank has done a lot of hard work in terms of supporting the credit unions over the past decade or so.  There has been a significant amount of consolidation in the sector and some growth of some much bigger credit unions, while at the same time maintaining much of the credit union footprint around the country.  That challenge of being very attractive to savers, and part of that has a demographic aspect, but less attractive for borrowers means they are significantly under-lent relative to their balance sheets.</p><p>There is capacity and, as I have said, I am very happy to come back and discuss credit unions in more detail.</p></speech>

I do, however, wish to put them on the record.  Perhaps he could come back to us with answers.  I thank him for the comprehensive response to the various issues raised at the previous meeting which we received earlier today.</p> <p>  The committee and I sent some material to bring an issue to the attention of the bank.  Money was borrowed from Anglo Irish Bank, most of which was paid to an associate of that bank and ended up in an Anglo Irish Bank deposit account.  Over time and through the process, this destroyed the individual's business.  What is the response of the Central Bank to cases of serious money laundering such as this?  Who deals with it?  Is it Ms McEvoy or somebody else?  Is it considered a consumer protection issue?  Where in the Central Bank should the detail of such a case be directed for a comprehensive and early response?</p></speech>

Chartered Accountants Ireland has confirmed that it allows banks to conceal losses while its counterpart in the UK has admitted that the same loophole is contrary to European company law.  There was reported an article in the<i>Financial Times</i>by Matthew Vincent on 7 May, which shows that the Central Bank of Ireland relied on this flaw.  There was a similar article by Niall Brady in<i>The Sunday Times</i>on 31 May covering the same issue.  Why has the Central Bank not challenged the facts as presented in these articles?  Should it not do so to allay public fear or to ensure public understanding and to give the public a better grasp of what is going on?</p></speech>

I will put some specific questions to Mr. Sibley.  I raised the issue of EBS tied agents.  We were told that it is a matter of tied agents versus the bank and that the courts are involved.  Within the complaint of the EBS tied agents is the detail that EBS knowingly misrepresented its financial position to the markets, creditors and the Central Bank.  Knowing that this is part of the complaint, surely it is the Central Bank's job to investigate.  I am not asking about individual EBS agents or specific instances related to the ongoing challenge.  I am asking whether the Central Bank has looked at the complaints made by the EBS agents, rather than acting on any one individual case.  Has the Central Bank looked at the matter of the flawed accounts used to exploit the very same loophole about which we talked earlier on?  Is anybody at work on that?</p></speech>

As I have said previously, it seems to be primarily a civil dispute.  It is working its way through the courts.</p></speech>

It goes beyond that.  That is the point I am making.  It is a civil dispute in that the agents are contesting their contractual arrangements, but there is also the issue of the bank's activity as outlined within the tied agents' argument.</p></speech>

I recall that we wrote to the committee on the issue previously, but I will check on that.</p></speech>

I am going to pursue it because I believe that, outside the contractual issues between the two parties, an investigation should take place into EBS as regards its accounting practices, the information it gave about the bank and so on.  I am putting that on record and I will come back on it.</p> <p>  On the tracker mortgage issue, a number of banks have told customers that the tracker examination does not apply to non-home mortgages.  Buy-to-let investors are, therefore, exposed to deliberate banking malpractice, as are farmers and others.  They were charged interest rates higher than were expected.  Is that a fact and can these cases be examined?  Does the Central Bank agree that banks cannot exclude commercial mortgages from tracker redress?  Are commercial mortgages on tracker rates excluded from redress?</p></speech>

Ms McEvoy was talking about consumer protection.  I correct her on the following issue every time.  It is impossible to deal with Start Mortgages.  Customers find it impossible, as do I as a third party.  One cannot get through to the company on the phone.  There are issues and concerns it will not address.  The word "abhorrent" was used with regard to KBC.  The other side won a court case against the bank.  It was to pay out on that basis but still has not done so.  It just refuses to pay.  Deputy Doherty will be aware of a particular case regarding Bank of Ireland.  It was specifically mentioned in correspondence that an individual had a tracker mortgage but the bank has refused to acknowledge this.  It has conducted internal investigations.  The way the banks are handling issues is bizarre and they are getting away with it.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty raised the issue of evictions and repossessions.  How many repossessions have occurred over the past while?  How many occurred during the pandemic?  People continue to be brought to court and dragged all over the place, even at Christmastime, with regard to their mortgages.  It seems that no one is intervening.  Deputy Doherty put the letter on record and he was right to do so.  What legal practice or bank in its right mind would tell people to be out by 21 December?  Somebody, perhaps the consumer protection unit, should intervene.  I will say it again; the protections do not travel with the loan or with the customer.</p><p>That just does not happen.  In the cases I have come across, of which there have been quite a few, Deputies Durkan and Doherty have been at pains to point out at every meeting that this does not happen.  Usually, it applies to those who are not well heeled with lawyers.  In the case of lay litigants, who may have a damn good argument, the bank just kicks them around the place, showing them no respect whatsoever.  We have to find somewhere we can turn.  I apologise for ending the meeting abruptly but I am obliged to conclude it because we have reached 3.30 p.m.  As Chairman, I will write to our guests because the matter in question has been raised during the meeting.  I will put the various questions to them and allow them to respond in writing with the details of what they have outlined during the meeting.</p></speech>
