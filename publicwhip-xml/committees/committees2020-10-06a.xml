    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020100600002#A00900"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to appear before the Oireachtas Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, in connection with the 2020 Estimates for the Department of Finance, Vote 7, and for the other Votes within the finance group: the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Vote 8, the Office of the Revenue  Commissioners, Vote 9, and the Tax Appeals Commission, Vote 10.</p> <p>  I thank the committee and its officials for arranging this meeting at short notice last week, and I also thank the committee for its understanding with respect to the delay in sharing the briefing material, which I believe only went out yesterday evening.</p> <p>  I will focus on the Department of Finance first.  The Department is structured around two directorates - the economic and fiscal directorate, programme A; and the finance and banking directorate, programme B.  There are also a number of support divisions that ensure the smooth operation of the Department.  In order to provide an accurate cost of the two programmes A and B from a management reporting and oversight basis, the costs of these support divisions are allocated on a 50:50 basis to each of the two programmes.</p> <p>  The net funding allocation sought for the finance group of Votes for 2020 totals &euro;460.9 million, which compares to a 2019 group Vote of &euro;440.2 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;20.6 million or 4.7%.  The primary driver of this increase is the provision of &euro;21.3 million increase for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners relating to increasing staff numbers and other staff costs, which I will address later.</p><p> Under Vote 7, the gross allocation to the Department of Finance in 2020 is &euro;39.8 million, of which &euro;10.5 million is provided for a fuel grant scheme for disabled drivers and a further &euro;768,000 is to fund the office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Leaving these aside, the Department&rsquo;s allocation provides for the administrative and non-administrative costs of the Department.  The vast majority of this, some &euro;20.6 million or 72%, is provided to cover salaries and allowances, with a further &euro;4.9 million, or 17.4%, to cover facilities and non-pay administrative costs.  The remaining &euro;3 million, or approximately 10%, is provided to cover the legal, advisory and committee costs necessary to support the Department in the proactive delivery of its remit.</p><p> Vote 8, which is the allocation to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is applied towards a single audit and reporting programme.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is an independent constitutional officer whose mission is to provide independent assurance that public funds and resources are used in accordance with the law, managed to good effect and properly accounted for, and to contribute to improvement in public administration.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is required by law to issue opinions on the accounts of Departments and public bodies that are audited by him, which was completed last week in respect of the 2019 financial year; publish reports on important matters at his discretion relating to value for money and the administration of public funds; and authorise under the comptroller function the release of public money from the Exchequer for purposes specified by law.  The office assists the Comptroller and Auditor General in his statutory functions and is staffed by civil servants.</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s financial audit role covers approximately 290 sets of accounts produced by public bodies.  Together, these bodies have financial transactions totalling more than &euro;200 billion of public money each year.  The allocation for this Vote in 2020 is &euro;9.116 million.  Given that it was &euro;8.657 million last year, this represents an increase of approximately 5.3%.</p><p> Turning to Vote 9, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, which is the Irish tax and customs administration, plays a vital role in our economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State.  For 2020, Revenue requested a net budget allocation of &euro;403.975 million, which was an increase of &euro;21.29 million, or 6%, on the 2019 Estimate.  Nearly three quarters of the budget is related to payroll for an increased employment ceiling of 6,714 staff.  In this regard, an additional &euro;18 million was allocated to Revenue in the 2020 Estimates to cover Brexit funding requirements.  That allocation related to the full-year cost of an additional 330 staff to manage the implications arising from Brexit and for additional Brexit-related infrastructural and operational requirements, for example, vehicles and detection equipment.  This outlay is required to facilitate import and export traders and to implement the customs controls and checks that will be required following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.</p><p> The 2020 allocation also provided for some &euro;2 million in order to move dividend withholding tax to a real-time platform as part of Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing programme of developing online business solutions for taxpayers.  However, this funding was instead used to provide for the speedy development of the wage subsidy schemes that were rolled out by Revenue as part of the Government&rsquo;s economic supports to Irish businesses and their employees during the Covid-19 emergency restrictions.  Some of that funding also helped to develop the stay-and-spend scheme.  Taking account of a reduction in capital and appropriations-in-aid, the balance of &euro;5.9 million provided to Revenue in 2020 is in respect of the restoration of pay under the public service stability agreement.</p><p> It is worth noting that, along with most sectors of the economy, Covid-19 has significantly impacted on Revenue&rsquo;s operations during 2020.  Revenue has responded by quickly putting in place a range of measures in addition to the wage subsidy schemes.  For example, it has implemented special measures to support businesses by deferring or warehousing VAT or PAYE debts resulting from the impact of Covid-19 on businesses.  Revenue is also continuing to support the delivery of other essential public services to combat the pandemic, including contact tracing for the Department of Health and the HSE and processing applications for income support payments for people affected by Covid-19 for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  These economic support measures have been implemented by Revenue without incurring additional costs to the Exchequer.</p><p> As we approach 2021, Revenue will continue to prepare for, and manage, the impact of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.</p><p>Revenue will implement customs controls in a manner that encourages legitimate trade, enhances competitiveness and supports business while managing compliance risks.</p><p> The 2020 budget allocation for Vote 10, the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, is &euro;3.233 million, a slight increase of &euro;25,000, or 1%, on the 2019 Estimate.  The 2020 Estimate is to provide for the TAC to further advance its programme of modernisation and reform and to address its caseload in an efficient and effective manner, while also meeting its obligations and accountability as an independent body, under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  The Estimate for this year provided for the establishment of a new role of chairperson of the TAC in 2020.  I am pleased to say that Ms Marie-Claire Maney has been appointed as the chairperson of the TAC with effect from 1 July 2020.  The 2020 Estimate also provided for further appointments at various administrative grades to bring the staff complement to 33, as per the recommendations of the independent review of the operation and workload of the TAC.  I am confident that the Estimate provides for the increased staffing and supports that the TAC needs to make progress on clearing the backlog of appeals.  This year there has already been a significant increase in the number of determinations issued by the TAC.</p><p> I thank the Members for their attention and commend the 2020 Estimates for the finance group of Votes to the committee.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions on Vote 9, which relates to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  In 2020, &euro;18 million in extra funding was allocated in respect of Brexit and the appointment of 330 staff to deal with the customs infrastructure.  Have those positions been filled?  If not, where are the gaps and can they be filled?  Looking at the year ahead, has consideration been given to funding, indirectly or otherwise, for customs agents.  Obviously agents are not employees of the State but it is going to be one of the huge issues facing the collection of revenue and the engagement of business with exports, particularly to the UK.</p> <p>  Finally, I commend the Revenue Commissioners on the excellent work they did last summer on the uptake of economic operator and registration identification, EORI, numbers by exporting companies.  Up to 97% of companies have registered for these numbers.  Can the Minister confirm whether the percentage has increased?  Are his office and the Revenue Commissioners happy with the percentage?</p></speech>

Most of the recruitment commenced in 2019 so we are seeing the completion of the process in 2020.</p> <p>  In terms of agents for the State in 2021, everybody will appreciate that because of the general election and the formation of the Government, we are very late in coming forward with the Estimates for the calendar year.  In a week's time, we will have the Estimate for 2021 published on budget day.  The issues mentioned concerning 2021 can only be dealt with when the Estimate is published on budget day.  I am not in a position to answer for 2021 but we will have the Estimate for next year, and so the answer, on budget day.</p> <p>  Finally, I do not have the number concerning Revenue.  However, I will have a note sent to the committee as promptly as possible.  I do not have the answer today.</p></speech>

We have a fragmented and soft system for this in Ireland.  This is not a question of the funds specifically but in general, do we understand the views of the ombudsman on the further powers he desires to be able to fulfil his role in that area?</p> <p>  I mention Vote 8 for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does an important job and there is a reasonable and stable figure in that Vote.  The Comptroller and Auditor General writes reports and the implementation of those reports is a key element.  Would it be possible to find out exactly what reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General have not been followed up on or progressed as they should have been?</p></speech>

That supplementary allocation was required to cover the payment of &euro;24 million in legal settlements in relation to the air travel tax litigation.  It is the final settlement amount and is in accordance with the legal advice given by senior counsel and approved by the Office of the Attorney General.  That was approved in the appropriation accounts for last year with a Supplementary Estimate but it is still in the documentation for this year.  That happened about 12 months ago, not in 2020.  That is the big issue and maybe the Deputy can follow it up separately.</p> <p>  On the powers of the financial services ombudsman, we have no indication that his office has any difficulty in that regard.  The Deputy was talking about the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></speech>

Policy is a matter that this committee will deal with and it is not an Estimates issue.  I suggest that this committee can consider the role, brief and remit of the financial services ombudsman but all we are doing today is seeking to grant a request from the ombudsman for a certain amount of money for this year.  There is a wider debate to be had at this committee with the ombudsman rather than just discussing a specific allocation but this is the allocation the ombudsman is to be given.  The 2021 Estimate, which will be published next week, is where that debate can move on to next.</p> <p>  As members will know, the Comptroller and Auditor General issues a report and audits at the end of September each year on each of the Government Departments.  That report normally has about 20 chapters and it was published last week.  During the course of the year, the Comptroller and Auditor General can issue a number of special reports.  It could be two, three, four, five or six reports, depending on the Comptroller and Auditor General's priorities.  Each of those reports is considered by the Committee of Public Accounts and to wear my hat as the last Chairman of that committee, we were assiduous in issuing quarterly reports to follow up on the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Committee of Public Accounts follows up on the recommendations in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Then when we issue that report it goes back to the Minister for Finance for a considered response, having taken in a response from the relevant Department.  It then comes back to the Committee of Public Accounts and the committee accepts that there has been a good response, that progress is ongoing or that there is a good reason something is not happening.  It can refuse to endorse the response from the Minister at that point.  That completes the chain of accountability in the Oireachtas and those reports have been consistently operating.  Those reports are published on the website of the Committee of Public Accounts and that issue can be followed up by the Committee of Public Accounts for the last year or so because it is over 12 months since the last time the committee issued a report.</p></speech>

There is a difference between the amount of resources the Revenue Commissioners looked for and how much they were granted.  They were granted a couple of million euro less than what they sought.  Can the Minister of State explain the rationale for that?  They looked for an increase of just over &euro;21 million and they were provided &euro;18 million.</p></speech>

Some &euro;11 million of that was to cover the 330 staff, which was the full complement of staff required.  Those staff have already been assigned, mainly to work in the ports and at a small number to information technology facilities.  The other &euro;7 million was for non-pay items, including refurbishments at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort.  The OPW carried out that work and was reimbursed.  It is included in the &euro;18 million.  Given that Brexit is scheduled to happen at the end of this year and that further costs will be encountered as we move into the new year, I will ask that that be fully taken into account for the 2021 Estimate, which is being finalised at this stage.  This allocation is a request from budget day last year.  What was allocated and approved last year has been fully committed in terms of staff and the works on the ports.  I accept the Deputy's point that it may not be sufficient as we are now getting to the crunch time.  The Estimate to be published next week will be the most important.  As I said, we are essentially playing catch-up having this Estimate so late in the year because of the election and no Government being formed.  Normally this debate would have happened in March or April.  At this stage, what has been allocated has been utilised and I will ensure that in advance of next week, the Deputy's points are brought back-----</p></speech>

Essentially, those who were recruited to Revenue over recent months were all immediately put to work on the contact tracing.  They would number approximately 30.  Rather than taking up work immediately in Revenue, because of the priority that was there, they went straight into the contact tracing.  That is essentially the group from the Revenue who went.</p></speech>

Are those 30 staff across both contact tracing and the applications?</p></speech>

Essentially, this time last year when the Estimate was published there was a significant provision in it to work on a new dividend withholding tax scheme because many dividends, especially in light of the financial services sector here, are paid to persons outside the State and we wanted to have a more modern method of accounting for the withholding tax on dividends being paid to them.  As a result of Covid, work on that project did not proceed as planned.  The staff and the resources allocated for that project this time last year were used on developing the employment wage subsidy scheme, the stay and spend, and putting together the warehousing programme for the PAYE and VAT payments at no cost to the Department.  This was because some of those, especially the employment ones, are closely related to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Some staff in Revenue doubled-up because one cannot work one without the other.  It is not possible to say how many staff were allocated.  They all remained working in the Department but it was a cross-Department project.</p></speech>

The necessary diversion would have taken away these staff from other areas of activity.  Are we able to identify the areas of activity within the Revenue that were not able to be followed up, outside of the dividend withholding tax expenditure of &euro;2 million?</p></speech>

Staff who would have been working on debt enforcement have moved to work on projects I mentioned, such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme.  The biggest single issue was that the dividend withholding tax project did not proceed.  That was the big event to happen this year and it did not proceed.  In addition, the debt enforcement work has been scaled back dramatically during Covid.</p></speech>

Essentially, that was a once-off item in 2019 which went through by way of a late Supplementary Estimate.  That is why that figure is particularly high last year.</p></speech>

One of the output targets for 2020 was the summer economic statement, which gives us an indication in regard to the budgetary parameters, but it was not published.  At that time, there was no communication with Opposition spokespersons that a normal statement would not be published, which is bad form.  Some of us have just come from a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, where the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council stated it is not satisfied at all that such a statement was not provided.  It makes the point that it provides outlooks over a five-year period and that the Department of Finance has the ability, capability and wherewithal to do the same.  It believes policies need to be guided not just by what is happening this year or in the next 24 months, but over the next period.</p> <p>  There is an acceptance that things are in flux and that the July provision of &euro;8 billion or &euro;9 billion of expenditure would have been added to what was presented.  However, there could and should have been a summer economic statement.  Will the Minister of State provide a justification as to why it was not published, given that, over the summer, there was more calm within the economy than there would have been in March-April when the pandemic hit us?</p></speech>

Because of Covid, when it came to the time of the summer economic statement, all resources in the Department went instead working on the July stimulus package.  Essentially, we had to make a choice as to whether to do the usual or to work on the July stimulus package.  Those working in the Department would have produced that every other year and will do so next year.  I accept there is a gap in the information but the Government took a strategic decision to progress the July stimulus.  That is why we did the July stimulus in place of the normal report that should have been issued in the summer.  I think people understand that it was probably the right call.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.61" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020100600002#G00300"><p>The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, which is the independent oversight body, does not believe it is the right call.  Why did the Government not publish work on the summer economic statement after the July stimulus was announced?  It was still July; it was still the summer.</p> <p>  The fact is we are going into a budget next week without any document, regardless of how much the budget diverges from that document, which we know it does every year.  There are no projections in regard to where the Department of Finance foresees the economy going prior to the budget.  Therefore, there is less scrutiny and less oversight, not only by the Oireachtas, but also by the independent body that was one of the major outcomes of the last financial crash, when it was decided we needed this type of independent oversight and advisory body.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is not able to benchmark against a document.  Why was this not done after the July stimulus?  </p></speech>

It was being implemented and staff were continuing to work on developing the &ldquo;stay and spend&rdquo; scheme, which was announced in the July stimulus but not implemented at the time, and dealing with commencement notices.  While the July stimulus was published and enacted by the end of July, most of the commencement, the setting up and the statutory instruments came through during the period after that.  The reason we did not have the forecast at that time was there was just so much uncertainty that it would have been a very risky business trying to say with any certainty what was going to happen in the next three to five years at that point, which was at the height of Covid.</p></speech>

I think people are reasonable and understand there is more risk of those forecasts being significantly out this year than any other year.  However, it is important for the Department to Finance to note where it sees the economy going.</p> <p>  The Minister of State should take us to the next stage.  The summer economic statement has not been published.  I acknowledge things were in flux and I also acknowledge the work going on within the Department.  In regard to the budget that will be announced on Tuesday, the Department planned not to provide medium-term forecasts.</p><p>At the time of probably the highest level of expenditure we will see in the State, which is needed to stimulate the economy, support incomes and so on, the Department will not publish its forecasts of where it sees the economy in three, four or five years, as it normally would.  If the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and others are able to put on paper where they see things going, surely, as part of the budgetary process, the Department of Finance should give an indication, however right or wrong it might be, of where it sees economic recovery in the medium term as opposed to giving us what is planned, which is a very short-term view.</p></speech>

We get these at very short notice and the budget figures sometimes have to be changed over the weekend.  We are fortunate that, because of the calendar, these figures came out last weekend so now, ten days in advance, there is more information available for everybody to see in advance of the budget than has been the case in recent years.  It is fortunate and helpful that it worked out that way.  Figures normally come out on the Friday night before a budget and these can send other figures askew.  That will not happen this year.  We have a little more information in the public arena as we enter the last week of budget preparations than we normally have and that information is more up to date.  The only commitment I will make is that we will publish our forecasts, although it will be spring before we do so.</p></speech>

This is always impacted by the results at the end of September, the last figures before the budget, because it is a very significant period of the year in terms of corporation tax.  In every recent year I can recollect, the size of the envelope could not be fully decided on until the September Exchequer returns had been seen.  On this occasion, we have seen these results ten days out.  These are significant figures, which are in the public arena.  With regard to speculation on the budget, the Deputy will know that I cannot go into what might be in next week's budget today.  I just cannot go there.</p></speech>

In that summer economic statements, we would normally see the totality of the planned package.  The Minister of State is correct that the revenue figures for September can influence the package, but we would still know what it is.</p></speech>

This is Covid-related and just intended to keep the lights on over the coming period.  There is to be a &euro;1 billion increase in capital spending, which was already flagged in last year's budget, and &euro;1.1 billion in carryover spending relating to a number of different measures.  There is also to be a discretionary package of &euro;900 million.  That is what would have been in the summer economic statement if we had one but we do not have one.  Will the Minister of State therefore confirm that is the package we are looking at before the Government decides on any additional policies it may want to introduce?</p></speech>

Everything the Deputy has just outlined is dependent on resources being available.  It will not be announced until the day.  I indicated earlier that, with regard to withholding tax, the Department of Finance had to prioritise the temporary wage subsidy scheme, the employee wage subsidy scheme and the July stimulus package.  These matters took precedence over things we normally would have done.  I have accepted that.</p><p>A valid question was to ask what was not done this year that we do every year and that we had to put to one side due to the Covid-19 and to do those other measures.  I accept that there was no summer statement.  I, and I think most people, preferred to have the July stimulus that dealt with the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and then the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, because it affected the sustainability of people's income.  I accept the point-----</p></speech>

In the other document, to which I refer, on page three it states that the funding has been reduced from &euro;950 million to &euro;768 million.  I imagine that the tracker mortgage scandal and the increased caseload of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman may have put additional pressure on the organisation, although some cases have not yet been closed.  A significant number of cases relate to business interruption.  Indeed, court proceedings have commenced today in respect of same, and the findings will emerge in due course.  I do not like the fact that there is a significant reduction in the allocation of funding to this office, without which, we would not have known about the &euro;1 billion theft by the banks in relation to mortgages and many other issues besides.</p></speech>

When the office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman was set up, the contribution from the State was around &euro;960,000.  The funding allocated is decreasing because the funding to that office from Financial institutions is increasing commensurately.  Like the regulation of the banks, we have moved from the situation years ago in which the taxpayer would carry the burden.  Now the financial institutions bear the full cost of financial regulation. Similarly, in relation to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, financial institutions will pay an increased percentage of the cost of running the office, and the cost to the taxpayer, through the Vote from the Department, will continue to reduce.  It is not a reduction in service, but a reduction in the funding method.</p></speech>

Therefore, the &euro;768 million is our commitment for the year, and significant costs will be borne by the financial institutions.  It is only a matter of timing whether we pay in early or late.

We are three months away from Brexit, which may be a no-deal Brexit.  Will the extra 330 staff allocated to the Revenue Commissioners be sufficient to deal with the extraordinary consequences of a no-deal Brexit?  Alternatively, if there is a deal on Brexit, will all those staff be necessary?  If they will not, are there plans to reassign them elsewhere?</p></speech>

The biggest risk will be to small businesses that have not yet fully grasped that there will be issues with customs clearance.  This morning, I met Enterprise Ireland, the main job of which through local enterprise offices is to ensure small businesses are aware of these risks.  Large businesses will be able to cope with all of the customs clearance documentation that will be required, but I do not think the owners of garages or repair shops in Kilkenny or Letterkenny, for example, know the extent of the significant extra work in respect of customs clearance that will be required to get a part in overnight to repair a car.  It is really microbusinesses that will experience difficulty.  That is why, through the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and local enterprise offices, we are making sure they are all Brexit ready.  Revenue is satisfied that it is ready.  The biggest issue will be backlogs and queues in places such as Dover which are outside the responsibilities of the Revenue Commissioners.  The issues will be in respect of small business that do a little importing and exporting.  The challenge over the next three months is to make those businesses Brexit-ready, not the Revenue Commissioners.</p></speech>

It depends on the products they are importing.  The ability to use the land bridge means that businesses that get customs clearance leaving Ireland when travelling via Dover to mainland Europe will not require further customs clearance.  That will also be the case in respect of goods being transported in the opposite direction.  The issues will arise in respect of products coming into Ireland that originate in the UK, rather than coming via the land bridge, which is really a bridge between Ireland and France.  There will be customs issues for businesses importing or exporting product, depending on the tariffs involved, which have yet to be established.  The single biggest issue will be in respect of small businesses.  That is why I referred to local enterprise offices.  There has been a big uptake in the number of businesses getting ready and getting their Revenue customs clearance documentation.  We will eventually get to a situation whereby truck drivers and van drivers will have their customs clearance on their mobile phone and be able to wave it to clear customs.  The biggest issue is in respect of small businesses.  The Revenue and the Department are ready, but we believe small businesses are not fully ready.  I am afraid that some of them will just wait and see what happens on the day.  They may experience delays receiving products that would normally be delivered overnight.  That is where the issue lies, rather than on the State side.</p></speech>

I will not rehash those issues.  I refer to the section of the Estimate relating to law charges.  The Estimate for 2019 was &euro;11.3 million, but the final outturn for 2019 was significantly in excess of that figure.  Will the Minister of State explain that overrun?  Is the Estimate for this year too conservative in that regard in light of the higher amount in 2019?</p> <p>  I refer to the allocations relating to the Ombudsman.  I would expect that in a year such as this, there would be more queries in that regard.</p> <p>  I attended the meeting last week of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.</p><p>The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, stated clearly that the Government should provide medium-term projections.  A period of five years should be examined, and the Government should set out what it expects the debt to be in that context.  In May, for example, IFAC gave projections based on three scenarios, and the Government should be taking that on board.  I ask the Minister of State to comment.</p></speech>

The final outturn, therefore, for 2019 is not expected to be a benchmark for this year.  We are basing this year's figure, therefore, more on the original Estimate for last year, and, if we do not have any unusual once-off items like we did last year, we think that will be a better basis on which to start.  I stress, at this stage, that there is no basis for suggesting that this Estimate is not sufficient.</p> <p>  I take the point that we did not publish all the documents in July as we normally would have done.  I tried to explain why that was the case, in that we were concentrating on the July stimulus, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the Department and the Revenue Commissioners have only so many officials to do all that work.  What was requested today, however, will be published in the spring.  The point is also well taken that we should have these economic forecasts coming out regularly on a guaranteed timetable.  This year, however, some projects, in all Departments and agencies but in the Revenue in particular, had to be put to one side to allow some of the items concerning Covid-19 to be dealt with.  That was for this year only.</p></speech>

All of us, from time to time, requested that the scheme be reformed or made more accessible.  Are there discussions in the Department regarding reform in this area?  Turning to the loss of a disabled driver permit, such a decision will mean that the relevant tax will be due for collection again.  A disabled driver availing of tax relief for a car but who subsequently loses that status will, therefore, be obligated to pay back the tax concerned, or a portion of it.</p> <p>  Such a situation puts the holder of that status at a disadvantage in dealing with the Revenue, and that agency does not have an appeals system.  It is necessary, instead, to go back to the HSE and the relevant section in that body.  There are, therefore, anomalies in this scheme that should be addressed, and I am just using this opportunity to bring those anomalies to the attention of the Minister of State because this situation puts the taxpayer at a serious disadvantage.  Will the Minister of State provide us with a note on this issue and in respect of the Department's intentions regarding the scheme?</p></speech>

As was said, rightly, the medical board is run by the HSE, which is not within the remit of this Department.  The Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, however, is within the remit of the Department of Finance, and that is where appeals come.  We have a figure of &euro;370,000 in the Department's Vote for running the medical board of appeal.  It includes the costs for the medical consultant who is the chairman of the board and the administrative staff, which amounts to about &euro;270,000.  It is important to note that a judgment of the Supreme Court on 18 June 2020 found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them the primary medical certificate.</p><p>The appeals board lost on the basis of the judgment of the court that the medical criteria set out in the regulations did not align with the regulation-making mandate in primary legislation to further define criteria for a severely or permanently disabled person.  My interpretation of this finding of the Supreme Court in the summer is that the statutory instrument and regulations that have been underpinning the implementation of the scheme are not in line with the primary legislation passed by the Oireachtas some time ago.  The court's decision has raised major policy issues that will require careful consideration.  The matter is being examined by the Attorney General's office and it will bring forward for consideration to the Minister any policy or legislative proposals necessary as soon as possible.  The Supreme Court decided in the summer that the statutory instruments which people felt were unsatisfactory are not in line with the original legislation, which is a very serious issue.</p></speech>

I am asking that the matter be addressed in terms of policy and that we look at how the &euro;370,000 provision is spent.  I would like to know what the breakdown of that figure is and the policy direction the Department will take to ensure we get value for money for taxpayers.  We must address the situation of those persons who were benefiting from the scheme but, for some reason, were later taken off it.  They were examined by the medical board and told they were disabled for life and therefore eligible for the scheme.  Subsequently, for some reason, they are told they should not have that benefit and it was taken from them.  As a consequence, they had to pay back part of the tax incentive from which they benefited.  The second issue is that if they want to appeal that decision, they cannot appeal to Revenue but must go back to the medical board.  There is no flexibility from the board and it does not give any reason as to why a person was considered eligible in the first case but then, after a number of years, found to be not eligible.  I do not know how a person can have a disability for life three years ago and subsequently be told that, actually, he or she does not have such a disability.  Someone is wrong in such cases and the person central to it is deprived of any means of appeal.  I ask the Minister of State to examine the unfairness in the system and give it the attention that is needed.</p> <p>  The second question I want to ask relates to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is responsible for examining 291 different sets of accounts.  In the context of this Estimate, can the Minister of State confirm that all of the requirements set out by the office are funded?  In other words, does the Comptroller and Auditor General have the full complement of staff he has indicated he requires?  Has he full access to the IT, consultancy and professional inputs he needs, or are we leaving him short-changed in terms of the work we are asking him and his office to do?</p></speech>

It is not for me to speak for an independent office, but I believe it would benefit from having, for example, a number of staff who could provide technical services internally.  In addition, the office does not have any medical people even though one third of the public services it audits are under the remit of the HSE and the Department of Health.  There are more than 100,000 people involved, between the section 38 and section 39 organisations and Government bodies.  In my opinion, the office should have some people who are medically competent to examine those types of issues when they are conducting financial audits.</p></speech>

Specifically, has he included in his requirement for this year any specific request that has not been granted by the Department?</p></speech>

I would make the point that there are public sector agreements which determine the number of cases the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General can outsource for external audit.</p><p>There has often been a backlog even though it has improved significantly.  There has been a regular question of why he does not outsource some of the auditing, because there are many auditors to outsource to.  The public sector agreement specifies the percentage of business that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General can outsource.  That in itself is a result of the public sector agreement.</p></speech>

Regarding the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General, I would like to mention that the fact that local government, which is one of the biggest spending parts of Government, is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This has been spoken about for years but it seems that either the Department of Finance is afraid to take them on because of the strength of their operation or there is some other reason.  In the context of policy, the local authorities and Irish Water should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is as if there is a bucket with holes in it and the Comptroller and Auditor General is looking after it, but there is also another bucket with no bottom at all, and that is Irish Water and local government.  They seem to be getting poor scrutiny regarding value for taxpayers' money.  I would like to see that included in any discussion that the Department has about the control of finances, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and what is required.  I bring it to the Minister of State as a policy issue.</p> <p>  I will address the matter of Revenue.  For those who have found themselves employed from home, it has been proven that productivity has gone up.  The outcome for those employees is quite satisfactory.  Will they get the opportunity to continue to work from home now that Revenue has seen how well it operates?  Will Revenue develop a working from home policy for certain categories of Revenue employees in order to take up the increase in productivity that is occurring because they are working from home?</p></speech>

It is not just the Department of Finance.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be the key player in working with public services.  It is listed as an issue in the programme for Government.  We have learned a lot about working from home in the past six months.  That is a policy issue and there could be a discussion between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and this committee.  It is not so much an issue for the Estimate for the current year but it is definitely an issue for future years and for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

If we do not start to get it right in the State, we will continue to get it half right and half wrong.</p> <p>  In the context of Brexit and our direct connectivity with Europe, does the State have any plans to purchase the services of container ships for transport directly to Europe rather than through the UK?  Has that been discussed by the Department of Finance in the context of Brexit?</p></speech>

While it is an operation for the private sector, if they do not have the appropriate services, then we will not be able to get our products to market in as efficient a way as we should.  Therefore the State would need to have a plan.  Would the Department of Finance encourage that plan because of the nature of the business being transacted?  It is for the State and requires oversight to make sure that policy is being followed.</p><p>Is there any planning within the Minister of State's Department for that?</p></speech>

Has there been any investigation or consideration of tax incentives for commercial operators who would operate direct links from Rosslare Europort to the Continent, including Netherlands and France?  We see today reports of shipments of Irish evaporated milk and baby formula going straight from Wexford to Rosslare on a 15-day train journey to China.  These are the sort of processes we should be looking to and the Department of Finance has a major role in this.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Chairman on his appointment.  I thank the Minister of State for his attendance today and his statement.</p> <p>  I take up the Chairman's point on the requirement for investment in better roll-on and roll-off facilities or a direct port connection to Europe.  Rosslare Europort springs to mind in that regard.  It is a port that has land and capability around it for expansion and improvement.  It also has the advantage of being connected by rail to the Dublin-Belfast rail line.  A small portion of the port is not connected to the western rail corridor, which is the section between Rosslare strand and Waterford central.  There is a rail line there so has the Department considered the prominence that Rosslare Europort may take because of Brexit?  Will it actively consider engaging with the Department of Transport to look at the section between Rosslare strand and Waterford central with a view to providing a commuter, tourist or sail and rail link from Europe and facilitating shipping and freight services along the line?</p> <p>  Page 34 of the Estimates document refers to receipts in respect of the environmental levy.  This is a charge with respect to the "Department of Environment, Community and Local Government" and that may have been the name of the Department when the plastic bag levy was introduced.  The cost or charge to the Department seems to remain steady and this is in line with previous years.  Does this charge remain constant, regardless of the levy?  I imagine the levy must be considerably lower than what it was when introduced.  Why does the charge to the Department remain constant if the levy is much smaller?</p></speech>

The first is Brexit and the other is the virus.  Is the Minister of State satisfied, insofar as he can achieve satisfaction, that the Department has provided for all the unquantifiables?  A former US Secretary of Defense mentioned "known unknowns" and "unknown unknowns".  This is somewhat similar but there are unquantifiables and we will not know how to deal with them until we get there.  Brexit has been raised by the Chairman and others with respect to market access.  I strongly urge that whatever happens, there would be provision made for direct access to Europe from Cork, Rosslare or elsewhere so we can get as far into the centre of the market as is possible, with less dependency on the whims of our next-door neighbour.  They will have other pressing matters that may well have an impact on us.</p> <p>  My apologies for being late but there were three other meetings.</p></speech>

The issue of expanded facilities is a matter for the Department of Transport and is not within the remit of my Department.  The remit of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners relates to customs matters, which are well up to speed.  I am concerned that some small businesses in Ireland are still not fully aware of what could happen on 1 January but there will not be any problems on the Revenue Commissioner's side.  Revenue has very good technology and is very quick to implement any changes required.  We are satisfied that the Revenue side of things is okay.  </p><p> On port facilities, the biggest issue in the context of roll-on, roll-off is that some products are perishable while others are not.  In theory, it is quicker to go through the UK once there is not a five-hour tailback somewhere along the line on the land bridge.  Some products are not time sensitive and can be transported over the longer period involved with the roll-on, roll-off system.  Some businesses do not like to hold large amounts of stock and like to order items on an as-necessary basis.  These are issues for the Departments responsible for business and transport rather than for the Department of Finance.</p><p> On the environmental levy, the Deputy asks a very fair question.  The figure appears to be historical and was probably set a long number of years ago.  I will ask the Department to look at it to make sure it is still a fair charge and not one that just continually repeats itself, which seems to be the case.  I will make sure that is examined prior to the next Estimate.</p></speech>

There were 25 such cases.  The legal costs paid by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners were &euro;33,000, the legal costs awarded came to &euro;166,000, compensation paid amounted to &euro;86,000 and the total cost was &euro;285,000.  In contrast, there were only 11 claims by Revenue employees but the total cost was &euro;418,000, with compensation paid out amounting to &euro;233,000.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on that and on the fact that miscellaneous expenses from work-related incidents amounted to &euro;5,000.</p></speech>

Damage to property tends to relate to road traffic incidents involving a Revenue vehicle.  On the matter of claims by members of the public, the figure for legal costs awarded is almost twice the figure for compensation which is dreadful.  Wearing my hat as Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, this is an issue to which I will certainly revert to the Chairman on.  It is a live matter for this committee.  Business insurance is a live matter as the Central Bank is the regulator for the insurance market.  Lots of claims are dealt with through the courts which are independent but some of these claims may have been dealt with by the State Claims Agency and this is a recoupment to that agency.</p></speech>

We agreed at the previous meeting that members would submit topics or suggestions for the work programme and members have received the proposed or draft list of topics.  There are submissions from all the groups and most of the members and it is proposed that we go through that.  There is some overlap and some Deputies and Senators have proposed similar items.  We will go through them individually and if there is overlap, the relevant members can come in at that point for clarification.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has proposed two sections so will he go through those suggestions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020100600002#A00200"><p>I start by saying that there are nine sitting weeks left in the session, so not including this week, we will have nine meetings in this room.  We can have additional virtual meetings but it is nevertheless a short period.  I assume we will have at least one, if not two, pieces of Government legislation during those nine weeks for which we will have to provide time.  These are the marine planning and development Bill and the legislation for the Land Development Agency.  The Minister might tell us about that today.</p> <p>  Members should also consider that there will be Bills from the Opposition and pretty much all the parties here that will come before the committee at various stages.  We will have to find some space for dealing with those.  I have two lists, with the first an indication of the topics I would like to consider between now and Christmas, and the second an indication of topics to be flagged for consideration after Christmas.</p> <p>  I would like to bring in the Minister at some stage in October or November to review the programme for Government implementation.  It is a general quarterly questioning of the Ministers and officials on matters.</p> <p>  I am quite concerned by a very significant increase in the number of recorded deaths of people in emergency accommodation or rough sleeping in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  By midway this year, that rate had reached the same level it reached by the end of last year and the year before.  It is a big issue.  Some of the media commentary has been a little sensationalist but there would be value in the committee considering the matter and bringing in relevant people for debate.  There has been some really good research and developments across the water in Britain that we could usefully look at.  Perhaps a short report could be done by the secretariat to raise matters of concern to the Minister.</p> <p>  Most of our constituencies have seen the effects of Celtic tiger latent defects.  The Minister is doing some good work in engaging with the Construction Defects Alliance and the Apartment Owners' Network.  My understanding is the Minister will set up a working group to consider those matters from now until next June or July.  It would be good for us to do a hearing and bring in the various players in order to discuss the matter.  It is something we did before in committee.  Given that there is a mica and pyrite scheme in Donegal and Mayo, with the extension of the pyrite scheme in Limerick and calls from people affected by pyrite in Clare, this exercise could be useful.</p><p>I had put a written proposal to the last housing committee to do an own-authored report on the relationship between land values and affordability.  There have been seven separate Government-commissioned reports from 1972 to the present on all of this.  The suggestion was made to us by an academic from Technological University Dublin, TU Dublin, not to do another report but to get people involved in the preparation of those other reports to appear before the committee to talk about the reports' recommendations and which ones are relevant for today.  I am not suggesting that we conduct those hearings this year.  I think we could do them in the first quarter of next year but I would like this committee to consider granting me permission to start work on this project.  When one does a self-authored report, one has a lot of one's own research to do.  The previous committee's secretariat and I had done a fair amount of preparation.  I hope the committee is willing to allow me to proceed, bearing in mind that committee reports must get the approval of the full committee and that members get to amend them.  It is simply that I would be the author which would make the distribution of work a little easier.  It is something that we were meant to do from January to March of this year but with the election we obviously could not do so.  I would like the committee to consider it.  All of the other propositions are just things for us to consider early next year.</p></speech>

These broad issues were raised in almost all submissions received.  What exactly is the Deputy proposing when he refers to a review of the five previous Government reports on land management and housing affordability?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020100600002#B00500"><p>It might be useful if we re-circulate the original proposal that was agreed by the last committee.  Essentially, my proposal is very simple.  Instead of this committee producing a big report involving meeting representatives of the industry, experts and so on, the idea is to invite one person who was directly involved in the production of each of the five reports published between 1972 and three years ago to appear before the committee.  This will be possible in all cases but one, namely the Kenny report.  There is nobody still alive who was involved in its production but we could bring in some independent expert on it.  The idea is that those invited will just talk to the committee about the recommendations of each report and which ones they believe are relevant today.  It is almost like we are trying to conduct a review of the recommendations of those reports.</p> <p>  The key issue here is very simple.  Periodically there is a spike in land prices which then pushes up the costs of development which pushes up the cost of delivering residential units, particularly in our urban centres.  The political system gets itself in a kerfuffle, somebody says that we need to do something about this, a report is commissioned, recommendations are made and then the report sits on the shelf until the next affordability or land-price bubble crisis.  The idea is to look at those recommendations and for the committee to consider whether any of them is relevant today.  Dublin city Deputies will know that the unit price of land for residential development, for a house or an apartment, is between &euro;60,000 and &euro;100,000, which essentially adds that amount onto the purchase price.  In suburban Dublin, where I live, the unit price is &euro;25,000 to &euro;35,000 and it falls as one goes further out from the centre.  Cork has similar problems, as does Galway and Waterford.  I am suggesting that we simply review the previous reports' recommendations.  I refer to reports by the Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and the Kenny report.  </p></speech>

There have been 34 or 35 recorded deaths of people in emergency accommodation or sleeping rough.  There is no official count, but those are the deaths that have been reported in the press.  Dublin, Cork and Galway reported them.  Last year there were 34 deaths in total, and the previous year there were approximately 32.  By June of this year, we had already exceeded last year's total.  There are some very good people in the area, including Professor Eoin O'Sullivan from Trinity College Dublin, who is one of the country's leading homeless experts, and those involved with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  Maeve McClenaghan of the Centre for Investigative Journalism in Britain has conducted some very good research on this.  I suggest that the committee should bring in experts to see if something is going on, something has changed or something is happening.  Are there recommendations that the committee could make to the Government on how to address this?  When someone dies on the street or in emergency accommodation in Britain, for example, an adult safety review can be requested.  It looks back not to apportion blame but to see if there was a systems failure, or if an intervention could have been made that could be worked into the system to reduce future deaths.  We conduct such reviews for young people who die in care but not for homeless deaths.  There are other things.  Some people say we are over-reliant on congregated dormitory-style accommodation.  People with mental health or addiction issues are often nervous about going into those centres.  There is a good commitment in the programme for Government to phase out congregated dormitory-style emergency accommodation.  We should consider all these things in the context of the rising deaths.</p></speech>

I would like the committee to examine homelessness from the perspective of Dublin city.  I raised homeless deaths in the Seanad in July.  In one week, there were five homeless deaths in Dublin city.  It is a very serious issue and one the committee should consider.  The phasing out of dormitory-type accommodation is welcome, but the committee should also examine the move towards the provision of private emergency accommodation.  It is not only the quality of the accommodation but also the support and service being provided.  From the perspective of the north inner city, I am concerned about the over-concentration of homeless facilities in very small geographic areas, which is not good for those being accommodated or for the communities and businesses already in the area.  Can the committee examine both parts together as a theme under homelessness?</p></speech>

For those Deputies who represent rural constituencies and, in particular, those in the Dublin commuter belt, the flip side of that is the lack of provision of emergency accommodation in other areas.  As a result of this, people are forced into the parts of Dublin with larger volumes of emergency accommodation.  One recent change is that the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive has adopted a policy of turning those people away and sending them back to from where they came.  That has resulted in an increase in rough sleeping and vulnerability.  This is not just a Dublin issue.  Senator Fitzpatrick's point is absolutely right; it has implications for counties as far away as Mayo, Tipperary, Kilkenny and Carlow.  All of those issues can be fitted into the mix.</p></speech>

Homelessness in my area of Carlow is not on the same scale as in Dublin.  Lack of accommodation is a big issue.  We are now finding that people coming in from bordering places such as Kildare, Newbridge or Laois are told they cannot go on our housing list if they are homeless.  These people might have family living in the area.  Years ago, a person could be on two or three housing lists.</p></speech>

This is my issue.  Previous speakers defined homelessness.  There are ten types of homelessness.  How do we decide what is and is not homelessness and how to go about dealing with it?

This does not just affect apartments.  Any observer of large new residential developments will notice that an increasing number of houses are being brought under the remit of owners' management companies, sometimes in very questionable ways.  We are seeing this in Adamstown and parts of Lucan.  I would support a stand-alone review of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 that would take place before or just after Christmas.  We could call on the Apartment Owners Network to give evidence.  Cl&uacute;id Housing produced a really good research report on the operation of the Act.  The author of that report could be invited to appear before the committee.  A full review would be really useful.</p></speech>

That issue needs to be separate from the defects issue.  The first phase of the evolution of owners' management companies was essentially about local authorities divesting responsibility.  We have learned that this has not worked because cases where they have had to step in are more messy, difficult and complex.  If there is going to be a significant programme of home-building, and I very much hope there will be, it will include apartments.  We need to make put the legislation in place to protect the people who live in them and to allow communities to grow.  A full review of Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 is really important.  The legislation should not just tidy up local authority responsibility.  It should give real power to owners and those living in apartment complexes.</p></speech>

The EU is working on legislation to do with building materials, and that will have to come in here.  I have spoken to the Department about it and the officials briefed me on it.  Perhaps this committee should also have a briefing on what is coming in the next number of years.  If it happens in the new year, I am fine because I know there is a lot of stuff around it.</p></speech>

It is to do with the fact that in Ireland we have very limiting or prohibitive building regulations when it comes to building with timber.  They need to be reviewed.  I assume we would get the Department in and other experts.  There are experts in the field who can talk on this.  I am happy if this goes into the new year.</p></speech>

The development plan for Kill, for example, has 1,230 houses, and the board has recently granted permission for an apartment complex of 400 to 500 units.  The planners in Kildare would typically look to see, when a planning application comes in, the provisions for schools, transport and so on.  In this case they are completely overlooking these provisions and are just pushing stuff through.  I submitted a parliamentary question asking what the Minister was doing in this space around obliging An Bord Plean&aacute;la to comply with the development plans.  I believe we should get An Bord Plean&aacute;la in to the committee.</p></speech>

This is 15 months of planning applications.  It is really shoddy planning and I assume that no one here wants to be associated with a Government or a Parliament that is allowing bad planning to happen.</p></speech>

The reality is we are stuck with this for a further 15 months.  If we could have shortened it, we should have.  Enough people said this and we raised a number of concerns about it.  This is the regime that we must deal with now, but much damage could be done.  This issue is a priority.  The regime is meant to finish in 15 months' time, but the Chairman can bet his bottom dollar that there will be resistance to that.  As Deputy Duffy stated concerning national, regional and local plans, people across the country are frustrated and cannot understand the situation.</p> <p>  It would be important to have the board appear before us.  Its chairman has attended previously and we have had good sessions with him.  We would need a great deal of time with him, given that every time he has attended, he has run out of time.  There is considerable engagement on matters relating to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It would be great if we could have the chairman attend early.  With the agreement of the committee, we could prioritise this issue.  It is a matter of serious concern around the country.</p></speech>

One of the issues with SHDs relates to what An Bord Plean&aacute;la generally gets from a planner's report.  The SHDs that have been tested in the courts have been upheld.  However, there is a wider issue concerning how An Bord Plean&aacute;la and people engage with the planning system.  I suggest that, while the SHDs should form the part of our work, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not fit for purpose when it comes to submissions being made to it.  It does not have an online system in 2020.  It did not develop an online system during Covid even when SHDs and other large-scale applications were being processed.</p> <p>  Might we also make suggestions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la instead of just focusing on the SHD process?  There is much that we need to interrogate, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la's democratic accountability and public accessibility.</p></speech>

This is one of those instances of "We told you so".  Members from a variety of parties who opposed this legislation when it was introduced in 2016 highlighted that it was designed to circumvent the city and county development plans.  The legislation is clear.  When taking a planning decision, local authorities must abide by city and county development plans.  The board does not.  The whole purpose of bypassing the local authority as the primary decider on planning applications is to make it easier for planning applications that would not have otherwise got permission to get permission.  The problem is the legislation.  I am not disagreeing in any respect with some of the decisions of the board.</p> <p>  We should review SHDs, but if we are to do so, we should invite the Irish Planning Institute and the City and County Management Association, CCMA, to comment.  They will have strong views.</p> <p>  I would warn against adding many other issues to our discussion.  We normally have the board attend once per year to throw all sorts of question at it.  We should do that in our first calendar year.  The Government gave a commitment to phase out the SHD legislation in 2021, but that could be in January or December.  A strong report from this committee could have the effect of putting some pressure on the Government in a helpful way to deal with this significant issue much earlier.  I suggest that we discuss the SHDs with the board, the CCMA and the Irish Planning Institute.  The Department will also wish to comment, so that would make four.  All of this would mean that other board-related issues would have to be kicked to a second meeting, which would realistically be in the first half of next year.</p></speech>

Although some areas are covered by local area plans, LAPs, or master plans, there are numerous applications in areas where no mass plan applies.</p><p>Where local authorities would taken an holistic view of all those multiple applications, An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not seem to be doing so.  It is really important that that is prioritised in the course of this.  We all have areas of our constituencies that are impacted by that.</p><p> One of the positive elements of strategic housing development, SHD, process was that it gave local authority members a statutory role in a report that was submitted to the application.  That had never been done before because each member put in their own application and there was no statutory process or statutory meeting about same.  There has to be elements of it that do not drop and we must make sure that we give local authority members that strong role in the plan.</p></speech>

Some of the presentations received, as a councillor, on SHDs and the websites had much more information than one would normally get in a normal planning application.  It would improve the planning system to include that as well.</p> <p>  The last issue raised by Deputy Duffy was the affordable purchase scheme.

There are many ideas and suggestions as to how best to provide affordable housing solutions throughout the State.  It would be helpful if members could feed into that process and perhaps with officials from the Department in the room who are drafting proposals on the matter.</p> <p>  We should look at, and Senator Fitzpatrick commented on this as well, the various housing initiatives, what is and is not working, the reasons for that, and all of the different schemes like the repair and lease scheme.  Senator Fitzpatrick asked for a cost-benefit analysis on various schemes.  I suggest that we consider all of them.  My understanding and experience is that some of these schemes work exceptionally well in certain parts of the country.  Let us take, for example, the repair and lease scheme in Waterford where the highest number of one and two-bed solutions is being provided in the State.  The uptake in other parts of the country is not there.  Why?  If something works in an area, let us take the best examples located around the State and analyse why they do and do not work in other parts.</p></speech>

The State is using many different models to deliver homes, ranging from emergency accommodation to the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, the housing assistance payment, HAP, homeless HAP, public private partnerships, PPPs, turnkey and long-term leases.  From my experience, we always look back and ask whether something was good value for money.  An exercise needs to be undertaken to examine the various models from a financial perspective, but also taking into account the time and the quality of the deliverables, and to rank the projects that give the best value for money, not just in monetary terms but also in terms of quality of homes and the quality of communities being completed.  I seek the same thing as Senator Cummins and it would be preferable if we could incorporate both issues into one.  My proposal primarily seeks a financial modelling exercise to be done.</p></speech>

We know the Minister is due to introduce a new affordable housing scheme and there might be more money in the budget for it, so that is something we should do.</p> <p>  On Senator Fitzpatrick's proposal, the Department is doing an assessment of the financing of all the different delivery mechanisms for social housing.  It is not looking at affordable housing but there are ten different delivery mechanisms for social housing being examined.  We will not get the two issues into one session.  I like Senator Fitzpatrick's idea but to do it justice we would have to separate them out.  It might be worthwhile trying to get to the affordable housing bit early and finding out from the Department when its assessment will be complete because the Department will have all of the data.  As soon as the Department has completed that report, its representatives should come in, share it with us and allow us to give them our views.  The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have also done some good research which they presented to us previously.  That research looked at the difference between the housing assistance payment, HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and leasing versus new builds, and there were some good data there.  Given that the Department is doing the research, we should bring it in the moment it is ready.  We would have a more productive session that way.</p></speech>

The national differential rent scheme is something that was proposed or promised four or five years ago when we amalgamated our councils to make Waterford City and County Council.  There were three different rent schemes and we did not amalgamate them because we were told there was one coming.  It did not come so I want to know where that is because it is essential work.  I am not hung up on when these issues are scheduled in as we have a limited time.</p> <p>  The next issue is the approved housing bodies.  There are more than 280 approved housing bodies in the country, ranging from tier 1 to tier 3 housing bodies.  We need to look at the benefits versus the drawbacks of this, the possible case for streamlining them and doing a report on the quantum of them.  I am not tied up on witnesses but we need to look at the model.  They do fantastic work in the provision of housing but are there too many of them?  It is a valid question to ask.</p></speech>

We have a very large project in the north quays in Waterford which has received funding from the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF.  Based on my experience of dealing with this and having engaged with officials on it, they readily admit that while we have a process for cost-benefit analysis for a particular road, building or specific item, regeneration often includes multiple projects coming together and we do not have an evaluation framework for that.  We will do the cost-benefit analysis for one piece of the jigsaw but one cannot look at anything in isolation.  It has to be combined into the overall project.  Given that there will be significant urban regeneration projects around the State over the next number of years, it is important that we have a framework and look at best practice.  There is a very good model and framework in the UK.  The officials who are assessing these applications need to appear before us.  The north quays project, ironically, has now created a framework, so it is a case of refining that and getting those officials' feedback and opinions on it.</p></speech>

However, my understanding is that, pre-pandemic, a commitment was given that the report would be implemented this year.  I am just wondering about the effectiveness of bringing Sarah Moorhead and the other representatives in when this matter will be before the Minister much sooner than that.  Some tweaks to the Moorhead report are needed as some councillors will be left very badly off but our focus should be on the decision-maker rather than on those who prepared the report.</p><p>I should say that in discussing remuneration of councillors anybody who is in receipt of a gratuity payment under the retirement scheme should declare a conflict of interest because we would benefit from that.  I am happy to take the heat on that because councillors need to be remunerated correctly.  It is the single biggest failing in the local authority system.</p></speech>

The reality is that if there is not additional provision in the budget, this issue in respect of councillors is not going to be dealt next year.  I agree with bringing the Minister in.  That would be the Minister of State responsible for this, Deputy Peter Burke.  Bringing the author of the report and the Minister of State in is fine.  That is the way to do it.  However, we may want to wait until after the budget given that, realistically speaking, one will not get a meeting beforehand.</p> <p>  I would say we had an appalling scene in the previous D&aacute;il - Senator Boyhan will remember this well - where we had the most packed committee meeting we ever had dealing with councillors' pay.  Now I am a strong advocate of giving councillors proper pay but there was literally four times the membership of the committee coming in to make the case.  Only the week before, we had a meeting on homelessness and there were almost no members of the committee present.  The point I would make is there is a public perception around this issue that we need to get right.  I share that with the members because the committee was heavily criticised publicly, and knocked by any comment of any member of the committee, about it.  It was a real issue for us.</p></speech>

I speak as a former city councillor.  Genuinely, it is the weakest link in our democracy that we have people democratically elected to represent their communities who are massively undermined and under-resourced to do the job properly.  I think we need to do it.  Covid could be our friend.  We will have a shorter meeting and only the committee members will be probably entitled to speak.  As a committee, we need to bring the Minister of State in and talk to him about this.  Moorhead wrote the report but the Minister of State will make the decision.</p></speech>

I am a former councillor of many years and therefore I think it is right.</p> <p>  What Deputy McAuliffe said is correct.  We need to get the Minister of State in because it is a matter for the Minister of State and the budget.  If it is not in the budget, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, it will not happen.</p> <p>  Many people are unhappy with the Moorhead recommendations.  Let us be careful what we wish for.  I know from talking to councillors of all parties and none, most of them are not happy with Moorhead's recommendations.  We need to be clear what Deputy Peter Burke, the Minister of State responsible for local government, will do.  We should have him in because it is a political decision now.</p> <p>  We have belted this issue up and down, inside out, and north, south, east and west.  We had many promises and we have got nowhere on it.  Getting the Minister of State in would be the priority.  That is the point we need to make.</p></speech>

Clearly, it may come before the select committee and may be addressed by it.</p> <p>  The other side to it is that while I take Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, the councillors are on the ground working for people's quality of life on a daily basis on the simple issues, such as footpaths.  I refer to the fact that they are remunerated.  More importantly, there has been a misconception of their status.  The amount of work that they do that arises out of Moorhead needs to be addressed and interrogated rather actively by this committee.</p> <p>  The media has already reported the alleged increase in councillors' pay on numerous occasions.  If the councillors were to have received all that has been reported in the media they would be on up to three times their current wages.  It is important that the truth of it comes out and that it is ventilated properly in defence of councillors.</p></speech>

D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis as a phost nua mar Chathaoirleach an choiste.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm a bheith ar ais anseo leis an gcoiste mar Aire ar a bhfuil freagracht as tith&iacute;ocht, rialtas &aacute;iti&uacute;il agus oidhreacht.  Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir dom &eacute;.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n obair th&aacute;bhachtach &aacute; d&eacute;anamh againn.  T&aacute;im ag tn&uacute;th leis an obair sin a dh&eacute;anamh ar mhaithe &aacute;r muintir.</p> <p>  I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach for the invitation to appear before the committee today.  Having served on this committee, it is a great honour to return as Minister for this important portfolio.  I look forward to working with all members of the committee in a constructive way.  We face big challenges in the area of housing and we may have differences of opinion from time to time, which I think is healthy.  I do not have all the answers, nor does anyone here, but we are charged with working together for the good of the people, and I am committed to doing so.</p> <p>  As the Cathaoirleach previously mentioned, my statement has been circulated to members.  It would take longer than five minutes for me to deliver the statement, so I will not go through it now.  However, if there are elements within the statement or questions that we do not get to today, members should submit them to my office or approach me directly.</p> <p>  I will now outline some of the main points of the statement.  It concerns the Revised Estimates for public services for this full year 2020.  Obviously, having taken over at the end of June, there are elements within it which were not under my immediate control for the early part of the year.  Once the committee has agreed its work programme, there will be another opportunity for me to advise members of the Government priorities in line with the programme of Government, which I am sure all members have read cover to cover.  If they have not they have an opportunity to do so in the meantime.  Perhaps Deputy &Oacute; Broin got somebody else to read it for him, or he might have done it himself, particularly the Housing for All section.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Deputy will get it right the next time.</p> <p>  On a serious note, we are facing some significant challenges.  A priority for all of us is to eradicate homelessness, and we must drive down the numbers of homeless.  We need to deliver social and public housing on public land; ensure that there is affordable housing, both for purchase and rental; and also make changes in planning and in local government.  Reforms in local government are significant and concern the workings of how councils and local democracy.  </p> <p>  Investment in water is a big issue.  If we are going to grow our housing stock and house our people, we need to deal with the deficit in capital infrastructure and in capital funding in the area of water, both for fresh water and waste water.  </p> <p>  Heritage is also something which comes under my portfolio.  It is an important part of the role for which I and Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, will be responsible.  I will be working very closely with him on this.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, will be responsible for the planning and local government side.  Fire and emergency services and various other elements are also included in this diverse and important portfolio.</p> <p>  I would like to highlight a few points from my statement.  This year the Department will spend more than &euro;5 billion.  That is a significant spend.  Additional funding amounting to &euro;691.5 million has been included in the Revised Estimates for public services and flows directly from the jobs stimulus programme announced by the coalition Government, comprising Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, in July.  A significant portion of that is the &euro;600 million to fund the commercial rates waiver, which business across the Twenty-six Counties badly needed.  It is a waiver that ran from March to September 2020.  Following the noting and passing of the Revised Estimates in the D&aacute;il tomorrow, the disbursal of this &euro;600 million to all of our local authorities will then take place, which explains the urgency of the matter.</p> <p>  On top of that, I have announced a &euro;43 million Irish Water leakage reduction programme, which has benefited all 31 local authorities within the State.  This important work will be completed this year.</p> <p>  We have also allocated &euro;40 million for every local authority as part of the largest voids programme.  As most of the members will know, voids are the vacant social housing stock that have remained for longer than 12 months - a matter that has been discussed in this committee a number of times.</p><p>Some of it has been vacant for more than 12 months.  That matter has been discussed by the committee on several occasions.  We allocated &euro;40 million for every local authority, targeted to bring in 2,500 local authority homes back into stock.  Those homes will be occupied, or at the very least allocated, this year.  Those will be back in stock this year and it is very important that that happens.</p><p> The Estimate includes &euro;95 million which has come with the transfer of responsibility for heritage to my Department.</p><p> A critical focus this year must be and is the area of preventing homelessness and helping our homeless community.  It is envisaged that approximately 5,500 adults will exit from homelessness and into homes in 2020, utilising the various social housing supports.  There is an allocation of &euro;196 million in that regard in the Estimate, an increase of &euro;50 million on 2019.  This will allow the continued provision of emergency accommodation and supports to individuals and households experiencing homelessness, while also allowing for the very important continued expansion of the Housing First strategy for rough sleepers.  There is a firm commitment in the programme for Government to expand that service.  What I have done is establish the homelessness task force, which I chair.  It is made up of the chief executives of many of the housing charities with which members will be familiar, along with my officials.  It meets every week to focus directly on how we can drive down homeless numbers, clear blockages in the system and ensure bureaucracy does not get in the way of helping people to get back into a home.</p><p> Other elements relate to the planning side.  I have instructed all approved housing bodies and local authorities that estates and new developments should be designed for community and to ensure that we do not have a dearth of one-bedroom and two-bedroom properties.  That is why earlier this year, within four weeks of taking over this portfolio, I announced the call for housing initiative, which has a particular focus on one-bedroom units.  Frankly, we do not have enough of them.  Some 73% of homeless adults are single people, but there is not enough appropriate accommodation for them.  I will address that issue.  In the short term, we are seeking to purchase those homes through the Housing Agency.  Another element is the issue of larger families.  Approximately 50 of the families who have been homeless for a sustained period are larger families.  We do not have the requisite appropriate accommodation to house those families.  I have asked the housing associations, in conjunction with my Department and local authorities, to purchase homes where they can to ensure that these families are housed.</p><p> How long do I have left?</p></speech>

I have covered a lot of ground.</p> <p>  On energy efficiency and the health and well-being of those who live in social homes, it is very important that we seek to upgrade older social homes in particular.  The Estimate provides &euro;10 million for 400 social homes under the energy efficiency programme, which is a good start.  More significantly, in conjunction with the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, my Department has announced the midlands retrofit programme which is part of the Just Transition.  It will cover eight counties and 750 homes.  It involves an investment of &euro;20 million and work has already commenced in areas such as County Longford.  An investment of &euro;20 million has been made to upgrade those homes and make them healthier and safer and more energy efficient places for people to live in.  It is a pilot programme.  Many members have interacted with me on it.  It may involve action by their local authorities.  I am anxious for the pilot scheme to be concluded by the end of quarter 1 of 2021 such that we can look at how it has worked.  NUI Galway is carrying out a longer-term study on it to ascertain its effects on  the people and families living in those homes.  This is a really important piece of work that we are undertaking and will go some way towards meeting our just transition commitments.</p> <p>  The Estimate provides &euro;59 million for home adaptations to be undertaken, an increase of &euro;2 million on 2019.  On the issue of remediation works, I have allocated &euro;40 million in the Estimate to remediation works, which include the mica and defective blocks scheme which I, along with colleagues, launched in Donegal in July.  That scheme is now up and running and open for adaptation.  It is a matter into which this committee and some members of previous committees had a significant input.</p><p>I refer to the continuation of the pyrite remediation scheme, which I extended into the city and county of Limerick last week.  Deputy O'Donoghue will be aware of that, and we will keep that programme under review.  </p><p> While &euro;6 million might seem a small amount in the overall scheme of &euro;5 billion, that has been allocated to increase the number of home and rental inspections that local authorities undertake.  It has been a regular concern for this committee, and for me, when we are bringing in additional regulations and giving new responsibilities to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to ensure that the private rental stock is also up to scratch, and that is why we must also invest in those homes.  </p><p> Many other items are covered, and I turn briefly to Irish Water.  This Estimate is more than &euro;1.2 billion, with just short of &euro;600 million going to current spending and &euro;635 million to capital spending.  Those seem like significant amounts, but there is a challenge regarding capital funding for Irish Water.  We want to improve our wastewater infrastructure, reduce leakages, improve our drinking water and ensure it is up to standard.  We also want to expand the network so we can build more homes.  To do all of that, we will have to make some serious decisions regarding the funding of Irish Water.  </p><p>I conclude by stating that this meeting is timely.  We are coming toward the conclusion of budget negotiations.  The country is in the grip of a global pandemic, and that has had a significant effect on output in our construction sector, public and private.  We must keep the pandemic under observation as we move into next year if we are dealing with second and third waves regarding the impact on the sector and what are considered essential services.  I am committed, however, as the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to delivering on the ambitious programme for Government negotiated between Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  </p><p> As I stated at the outset, however, I have experience of this committee.  It is an important committee and, generally speaking, while we may have had disagreements in the past it has worked very well together.  I intend to engage proactively with members of the committee to try to assist in making real strides in tackling our housing crisis by providing public homes on public land, providing affordable housing, driving down numbers of homeless and investing in our wastewater infrastructure, while also driving forward the significant local government reform programme detailed in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future.</p></speech>

I thank him for covering several of the topics and I look forward to working with him, especially when he responds in respect of the work programme.  Turning to the Estimates, will the Minister remind us how many boarded-up voids he thinks will come back into stock?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2020100600002#C00800"><p>In the July stimulus, we had a target for 2,500 and, so far, we have had submissions from local authorities of about 2,410 properties.  That involved spending slightly less than &euro;40 million, and that was in the July stimulus.  An overall figure regarding some previous voids, dating from before I took over, is included.  The full figure, therefore, is about 4,000 voids but, focusing specifically on the July stimulus, the number is 2,500.  There is a condition imposed, however.  Every local authority has a target and every authority will know what it needs to do, but those voids must be back in stock this year.  We are reviewing that situation weekly.  If one local authority is not meeting that condition, we will take the money back from it and transfer it elsewhere-----</p></speech>

There is major frustration when people see boarded-up homes.  Regarding the mortgage-to-rent scheme, and given what is going on with the banks, the programme for Government referred to expanding it.  If payment breaks stop, what else is in place in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2020100600002#C01000"><p>The report from the fourth quarter of last year showed that a significant number of mortgages were in distress due to mortgage arrears.</p><p>There is an issue with the mortgage to rent scheme that concerns both my Department and the Department of Finance.  We are committed to expanding the scheme and there is money in the Estimate for this year for that purpose.  However, we can do a lot better.  We need to simplify the scheme and we know that a number of local authorities do not engage with it.  There are people like David Hall at iCare Housing who have been doing a super job in this regard, as well as the Housing Agency, which is under the remit of my Department.  The scheme offers a solution for people in systemic mortgage arrears failure, which is, in effect, the transfer of ownership to a local authority.  We need to do a lot better in this area.</p><p> In regard to mortgage payment breaks, I have provided for an additional three months for local authority loans.  Fewer than 500 people have availed of that facility or are still availing of it.  More than half of those who availed of it in the first three months of the Covid-19 crisis have gone back to full payment.  That is a good development but we need to work with those people who are still having difficulties paying their mortgages due to losing their jobs or having a serious reduction in their salary as a consequence of the pandemic.</p></speech>

If he does not have enough time to respond now, he might come back to me in writing or at the end of the meeting.  First, I welcome the provision for adaptation grants.  That is an issue on which all of us have been working with the local authorities.  From what I have seen myself and also what I hear from colleagues, the local authorities are experiencing difficulties in this regard because of the Covid-19 restrictions.  Are their staff able to make house calls and undertake assessments of grant applications?  If not, what will be the implications of that for the scheme in the long term?</p> <p>  Second, capital funding for Carlow County Council is one of the lowest in the country.  I have spoken to both Mary Hurley, assistant secretary at the Department, and the Minister about this matter.  Is there any update in that regard?</p> <p>  Third, the Minister knows I am adamant about the need to address the threshold to qualify for local authority housing.  Again, Carlow County Council has one of the lowest provisions in this regard.  We need to look at the threshold for qualification because some people are becoming homeless.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2020100600002#D00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for her questions and will try to answer all three points.  I am glad she raised the first issue because it has been brought to my attention that house calls are not happening in some local authority areas.  That should not be the case.  Adaptation work is deemed to be essential work and the workers carrying it out are essential workers.  It goes without saying that it should always be done with the permission of the residents.  We have provided additional funding this year in the area of housing adaptation grants and what was known before as the disabled persons grant, DPG.  It is not acceptable for local authorities to say that they are not carrying out inspections.  It is really important that they are undertaken, particularly given that a lot of the adaptations are for health reasons.  Adaptations mean that people getting out of hospital will not need to go into step-down care and can go straight back home.  The Deputy's intervention on this matter follows other feedback I have had in the past few days, in consequence of which I am writing to the chief executives of all the local authorities.  This issue is arising in some but not all of them.  Where they have concerns, they can engage with us.  This is essential work and it needs to be carried out.  The Covid restrictions do not prevent it provided the recognised safety measures are taken.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy' point in regard to Carlow County Council.  I knew there was no way I would come here today without Carlow being mentioned.  Maybe one day it will happen that there is no mention of it, but I doubt it.  In regard to the qualification threshold, the previous Government commissioned a report on the whole area of social housing and what reforms are needed.  This was something I had also sought.  Thresholds need to be looked at and I will do so.  The report is there and I will implement its recommendations in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2020100600002#D00600"><p>We will move on now to the Sinn F&eacute;in members.  Is Deputy &Oacute; Broin sharing time with Deputy Gould?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2020100600002#D00700"><p>Yes.  I welcome the Minister.  I have a series of very practical questions to put to him.  On the Estimates for local authority funding, the rates funding is hugely welcome but there is a significant volume of funding at issue in regard to the loss of non-rates revenue, particularly for some western seaboard counties, as well as other Covid-19 factors.  I understand it was &euro;10 million plus at the last count.  Will the Minister indicate whether there will be any movement or discussion in that regard?</p> <p>  Will the Minister indicate when the social housing output pipeline report will be published?  We are all keen to see how that is working.  Is he willing to give a commitment to providing pipeline reports in respect of housing delivered through both the serviced sites fund and the Traveller accommodation budget?  We have spoken previously about the need for the Traveller accommodation programme to be pipelined so that it can be tracked properly.  The underspend this year so far is worse than it was last year.  It is likewise in the case of the serviced sites fund, under which only 50 units are under construction thus far.  The Minister's frustration on this matter, as well as my own, was well expressed at a previous committee meeting.  A pipeline report would be really helpful.</p> <p>  I will not get into a row with the Minister today about voids.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2020100600002#D00800"><p>The Deputy can do that later.</p></speech>

It would be helpful if the Minister were to provide a report on voids, broken down between long-term voids and casual vacancies.  Some 1,200 properties were funded through a similar programme last year.  Only 300 of those were long-term voids.  The rest were casual vacancies.  Likewise with homelessness, inside the 5,000 exits figure are preventions.  We need to separate those two.</p> <p>  Regarding pyrite, is the Limerick funding coming from the old pyrite fund or the new &euro;40 million for pyrite and mica?  Is the Minister actively considering County Clare for inclusion in that?</p> <p>  Regarding the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, some 20,000 units were to be funded by 2019, with 8,000 at a discount.  Only 925 of the discounted units, or 8%, have been delivered to date.  The Minister's frustration and mine was well expressed before.  What is the Minister's plan for that?</p> <p>  On legislation, while it does not strictly relate to the Estimates, it would be helpful to the committee if the Minister could indicate when he hopes to bring legislation forward, particularly relating to the marine development plan and the Land Development Agency.</p></speech>

With regard to underfunding and Covid losses not related to rates, we are working on that right now.  We are in detailed negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I recognise that local authorities will have spent more because of bringing in Covid measures relating to the public realm, open spaces and various amendments.  We will look for more money this year.  Those negotiations have not concluded yet but as soon as they do, I assure the Deputy that the D&aacute;il and this committee will know.  It is an issue.</p> <p>  With regard to long-term voids, we are concluding a report which breaks down the voids by different categories and county by county, as well as what they submitted for.  One will be able to know whether it is in Wexford or Wicklow, how many voids the local authority said it would deal with and how many it has actually done.  I will not count voids as new builds or new accommodation.  It is reported separately, and rightly so.  They are part of our existing stock and should be seen as such.  We need to get better at how we de-tenant and re-tenant properties.</p> <p>  I am awaiting a submission about County Clare.  I have extended the scheme into County Limerick and the funding for it is in place.  It is not a significant number of homes.  It is important to those people whose homes are affected by pyrite.  I have not yet received a formal submission from County Clare but when I do, I will look at it with the Pyrite Resolution Board.  The board makes a recommendation to me on whether it is appropriate to extend the scheme.  Regarding the marine planning and development management Bill, the programme for Government gives a commitment of nine months from the establishment of the Government.  Work has been ongoing for some time.  It is pretty detailed.  It is the first time that a marine planning and development Bill has been done where the mapping has been done around the country, so we are looking to obtain that mapping.</p> <p>  On the Land Development Agency, we are in weekly discussions with the Office of the Attorney General.  The Deputy will see in the programme for Government that the heads of Bill that we looked at before in this committee contain feedback from that committee, which I have put in in preparation for the revised heads of Bill.  I hope that the heads of Bill will be published this year and that in the next couple of weeks, we will be able to circulate them to other Government Departments for observations.  It is October.  There are complications relating to many issues that the Deputy and I raised in the last D&aacute;il and they need to be ironed out.  We fundamentally all agree that we need a land management agency in the State.  I hope we will be able, at the very least, to have published legislation this year.  If I have missed anything, we have taken notes and I will come back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin.</p> <p>  I am sorry, Deputy Gould-----</p></speech>

I kept my submission to two and a half minutes.  I am 35 seconds into it now.  The Minister took over two and a half minutes to make a response.

I have a question on the homelessness task force, although it may not be strictly relevant to the Estimates.  How will the metrics for that be set and how will progress be reported to this committee?</p> <p>  There is the &euro;600 million fund for the rates waivers being given to local authorities.  How quickly will that happen?  The Minister spoke about a pilot programme regarding energy efficiency and its inclusion in the Estimates.  Is there any scope for rolling out the process included in the 2021 programme?</p> <p>  Will the Minister explain in a little more detail how the money will be utilised by Irish Water for fixing leaks?  For example, in my area of Lucan, we have felt the effects of the need for investment in the Leixlip water treatment plant.</p> <p>  My last question is on affordable housing.  There is much funding baked into the serviced sites fund from an affordable housing perspective.  Will the Minister talk us through that?  I have been as quick as I can.</p></speech>

The homelessness task force has been very useful.  I will report to the committee and we publish minutes of those meetings as well.  We are tracking those numbers but we know that behind each number is a person and family.  We are tracking it weekly and there is a monthly report.  It has been very useful to focus minds and it is the first meeting we do every Monday.</p> <p>  The matter of the &euro;600 million fund goes to the D&aacute;il tomorrow, and if it passes, which it should, we will start the dispersal of those funds pretty much straight away.  There will be no delay on our side.  It will be a matter of days.</p> <p>  The pilot scheme related to energy efficiency is up, and running and other work has also been done on social homes.  We will expand it further but I want to see how the pilot scheme works.  The programme for Government commits to a significant retrofit scheme, and I want to show that our State can lead with our social housing stock, which is under my control, in that.</p> <p>  There is a detailed report on where the &euro;43 million for Irish Water is being spent, and specifically the leak reduction projects.  This is small money in the grand scheme of things.  The works in Leixlip have nearly concluded.  This committee investigated the matter and I intend to visit Leixlip in the next couple of weeks.  I was in Blanchardstown on Friday looking at significant capital investment, with &euro;88 million being spent on new wastewater treatment and attenuation measures there.  We are now negotiating our capital funding for next year, and I hope there will be an increase.</p> <p>  There has been a slow initial delivery with the serviced sites fund and I have been critical of that before.  There is funding for approximately 3,200 homes and, of that, approximately &euro;127 million has already been allocated.  There is more there and I am looking at how we might be able to speed up the process or change the serviced sites fund to deliver more, and particularly affordable homes on State-owned land.  We are looking at other affordability measures, including affordable rent and affordable purchase, which I am currently negotiating.  We got approval at Cabinet last Monday to move that through to the detailed preparatory stage.  That is good.  If the Deputy has anything else, we can come back to her.</p></speech>

One-bedroom homes are absolutely a waste of time and a two-bedroom home could be built for an extra 13% or 14% on the cost of a one-bedroom property.  Some people in one-bedroom homes have been separated but others have partners and children, so this demographic could be covered with an extra 13% cost.  Two-bedroom homes would work out cheaper if a property has to be extended as set-up costs would be huge.  Build two-bedroom homes.</p> <p>  We cannot build houses in rural Limerick because we do not have the infrastructure.  Oola is full and Askeaton has been promised a sewerage system for 30 years.  We have heard the promises of previous governments going back 30 years but it has not yet been upgraded.  It is the same in Abbeyfeale and Oola.  They are full to capacity and no planning permission can be sought because of that.  The infrastructure issue is huge.</p> <p>  Conservation is holding up the conversion of voids in towns and villages around Ireland.</p><p>Iconic buildings should be saved but there are other buildings whose facades and roof scapes could be retained but which could be modernised at the back and put back into use.  So many towns and villages have been desecrated by voids because conservationists are preventing them from being developed.  </p><p> Another issue for the Minister relates to a ten acre site which was purchased from Limerick City and County Council by the Limerick 2030 development group.  An application for funding under the Department's urban generation scheme was lodged in July.  The group applied initially for &euro;6 million to get the site through the planning and detailed design stages.  The design team planners-----</p></speech>

This is huge for Limerick and we need the funding, which is in the Estimates that I am looking for.  This project includes education, offices, residential and tourism development.  It covers all of these areas.  Finally, when are we going to get funding for infrastructure for rural Limerick and rural Ireland?  It has not happened for years but it needs to happen.  In the context of the pandemic, people want to move out of our cities and get space so infrastructure is hugely significant.</p></speech>

He has a point with regard to family breakdown where people might need extra space.  The provision of one and two-bedroom units as well as larger homes is a big problem.  I have already said to our partners, including the approved housing bodies and local authorities, that when they are designing schemes they must design for communities, meaning that there should be a mix of unit types.</p> <p>  On voids in town and village centres in particular, I have spoken previously about how our planning guidelines are holding back development in some instances.  We want to see people back living on our main streets.  One really good scheme in regional towns and villages that has worked well so far and in which the Peter McVerry Trust has been involved is the repair and lease scheme.  The buy and renew scheme also has a lot of potential.  A number of units have been brought back into use in Fermoy and several other regional towns.</p> <p>  Applications under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, URDF, including from Limerick, are being assessed at the moment.  The assessments are being done by an independent team and will come to me for final approval.  I expect to be making an announcement at the end of October or in early November in that regard.  Funding of &euro;2 billion will be provided out to 2027, which is significant.  I have figures here on the draw down so far.  Call one funding, a lot of which was for the planning stages, was &euro;16.7 million.  As I said, call two funding decisions will be made before the end of the year.  I am aware that some really good applications have been submitted and they are being assessed right now.  Those assessments will then come to me but I note the points made by the Deputy on the importance of funding for Limerick.</p> <p>  Infrastructure is crucial, as I said at the start.  We have to bite the bullet on water infrastructure at some stage.  I hope that we will be able to make some progress in the forthcoming budget on further investment in capital infrastructure for water in both rural and urban areas.  </p></speech>

I seek a Yes or No answer from the Minister.  It appears that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not complying with the local, regional and national development plans being created by public representatives, planners of local authorities, regional assemblies and Government Departments.  Local authorities are objecting to An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decisions on applications but their objections are falling on deaf ears.  One example of An Bord Plean&aacute;la contravening a development plan is in Kill in County Kildare, where a 400 to 500 apartment complex was granted permission in a village of just 1,200 homes.  This is bad planning and is not sustainable.  Is it possible for the Minister to oblige the board to comply with our statutory development plans?</p></speech>

I want to be positive and constructive.  We want to work together.  The single biggest issue people come to me for is housing - social, affordable and affordable private rented.  People want leadership and are looking to us to provide solutions.  During the pandemic, my office was inundated with people on housing.  I thought housing was a problem before the election but it is much worse now.</p> <p>  The Minister's Estimates include extra investment into vacant properties for local authorities.  Cork City Council almost got down to 100 vacant properties approximately 18 months ago but that has increased to over 300.  Why not just give it the money to do the work without having to apply to draw down funds?  Cork city and county councils have really good housing departments, as the last Minister noted.  There are hundreds of derelict properties in Cork city and county but the local authorities do not have the money to compulsory purchase the sites.  I ask the Minister to give the local authorities funds to do this.  There is a property, an old butcher shop in Blarney Street in Cork city, which has lain empty for about 30 years.  How can that be right?  They are in Blackpool, Barrack Street, and right across the city and county.  I come here with solutions.  These are properties that could be turned around quickly to get people housed.</p> <p>  Finally, there is positive news on the disabled people's grants but it is still taking too long.  Many people have issues, especially local authority tenants, having funding turned around as quickly as possible.  We must protect people with disabilities, especially during the pandemic.  I will continue to be positive and look for solutions.  That is what we are here for.</p></speech>

I will respond to each item.  On voids, I have been around a while, including on local authorities, and have found that having a specific target for each local authority and allowing them make submissions has really focused delivery on that.  I take the point and will respond to the other items, including dereliction.</p></speech>

That is almost &euro;4 million a week primarily spent on emergency accommodation.  How much of that figure will be spent on prevention?  How much is on expanding Housing First?  The national strategy on Housing First identified 1,346 people with high support needs and it is planned to meet only half of those.  Is there funding in the Estimates figure to meet the supports of all with high support needs?</p></speech>

I have seen the benefits of the Housing First approach, particularly for many homeless people who have addiction and also mental health issues.  Housing First gives the wraparound supports to help people through homelessness.  The programme for Government commits to a housing-led health interaction, with health and housing working together, to ensure that supports follow the person and stay with them.  I have had a bilateral meeting with the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, on that.  The HSE's winter plan includes direct funding from the HSE towards housing and health solutions.  I will give the example from the Dublin Simon Community at Usher's Quay.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is funding &euro;30 million to what is effectively a 100-bed treatment facility.  We are paying for the capital expenditure and the Department of Health will pay for its day-to-day running.  Housing First needs to be expanded and we are looking to increase its funding in next year's budget.  It is crucially important, especially for those who have been homeless for a very long time, a sizeable proportion of whom fall into the remit of Housing First.</p><p>I will make sure they are not forgotten.  I know the Deputies will do the same.  There will be a particular focus on this.  That is very much the focus of the homelessness taskforce which meets every week.  Groups like the Society of St. Vincent De Paul, the Simon Communities and the Peter McVerry Trust are briefing me on it directly every week.  We will not be found wanting in that regard, but we need to do better and we need to focus on it.  I am hoping that when we see the detail of the housing budget next week a continued focus on the expansion of Housing First will be evident. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.435" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1583" speakername="James Lawless" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2020100600002#A00400"><p>This Bill will be coming before a number of committees, but I believe that the provisions that relate to this committee are in the majority.  The purpose of this meeting is to receive a briefing from the Minister on the draft scheme of the Bill, as it relates to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice.  Members will recall that the Minister had previously provided a written briefing to the members.  On behalf of the committee I welcome the Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee to the meeting.  We look forward to working with the Minister over the term ahead, and I am sure we will have lots of engagements during that term, with this being the first of many.</p> <p>  The format for this part of the meeting is that I will invite the Minister to make a brief opening statement, which will be followed by engagement, questions and comments from members of the committee.  Given the short time available to us I ask members, today and every day, to be as focused as possible in their questions for the Minister.  Although I will not strictly adhere to it if people have particular issues on a given day, the order of speaking as agreed at our first meeting will follow the general rule of thumb of Government first, Sinn F&eacute;in next, other party and group members next, and then members in the order in which they raise their hand.  The last round may include non-committee members who wish to come in.  I do not believe we have any non-committee members today.  Where non-members are participating they will be asked to make it known some 24 hours in advance.  There will be flexibility and this will not be a strict rule.  If people want to get in or to get on I will try my best to accommodate those situations.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  With that formality and introduction out of the way I welcome the Minister and invite her to make a brief opening statement.  The Minister has the floor.</p></speech>

I echo the Chairman's sentiments.  I look forward to working with him and all the committee members, and to continued engagement in the months and years ahead.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the justice elements of the withdrawal legislation.  It is timely to consider these provisions with less than 100 days to the end of the UK's transition period.  The committee will be aware that the Government remains focused on delivering its Brexit-readiness programme.</p><p>Indeed, this work on Brexit has been supported by all parties in the Oireachtas.  An important part of this work involves the introduction of this new legislation.</p><p> As members may recall, last year legislation was enacted to provide contingency measures to address issues arising in a no-deal cliff edge scenario, that is, where the UK left the EU without a withdrawal agreement.  However, because the UK withdrawal agreement was concluded, the majority of the provisions in the 2019 Act cannot be commenced.  By contrast, this proposed Bill is intended to deal with permanent changes that will arise at the end of the Brexit transition period.  It forms a vital part of our national Brexit readiness preparations.</p><p> The general scheme of the Bill was approved by the Government on 4 August.  The Bill includes provisions in areas falling under the remit of 11 Ministers and is being co-ordinated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  If there is no agreement on a future relationship between the UK and the EU or if any such UK-EU future partnership agreement does not encompass justice and home affairs matters, then a wide range of EU legislation relating to justice and home affairs matters will no longer apply to the UK.</p><p> While there are a number of Brexit implications for the justice sector, key risks have been identified in three specific areas - extradition, immigration and family law.  To address these areas requires new primary legislation and they are dealt with in Parts 16 to 18, inclusive, and 20 of the Bill.</p><p> Part 16 provides for two amendments to the Extradition Act 1965.  These amendments were previously included in the 2019 Act, but with the withdrawal agreement concluded, their provisions could not be commenced.  A key issue identified by my Department is to ensure that effective extradition arrangements are maintained between Ireland and the UK.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the provisions of the European arrest warrant would unfortunately no longer apply to the UK.  The optimal solution identified by my Department is to apply the Council of Europe's 1957 European Convention on Extradition.  Ireland and the UK are both parties to this convention.  While the extradition procedure under the convention is not as effective or as efficient as that of the European arrest warrant, it will provide a workable solution in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  To facilitate this, two legislative items require to be addressed.  First, the 1965 Act does not permit extradition of own nationals unless explicitly provided for.  Second, transmission of extradition requests is via the diplomatic channel and in hard copy.  The Bill will address both of these issues.</p><p> I next turn to Part 17 of the Bill, which deals with an issue relating to the application of the Immigration Act 2004, specifically an anomaly that we will be changing.  British citizens are currently exempt from most of the provisions of the Act, reflecting our long-standing common travel area arrangements.  However, a situation has been identified in the definition of "non-national" under some sections of the Act.  Unless amended, this would bring British citizens within that definition.  The amendment in Part 17 will correct this and provide a clear legal basis for the exclusion of British citizens from passport checks within the common travel area.</p><p> Part 18 of the Bill deals with a number of amendments to the International Protection Act 2015.  This is probably the only new measure compared with last year's legislation.  If the transition period expires without a relevant agreement between the UK and the EU, the Dublin regulation will no longer apply to the UK.  The Dublin regulation provides that the country that played the primary part in a person's entry into the Union is responsible for examining an application for protection.  It also provides for the applicant to be transferred to that EU member state.</p><p> Two concepts in EU law allow for applicants for international protection to be transferred to a third country.  The first is the safe third country concept and the second is the first country of asylum concept.  The first country of asylum concept is already transposed into Irish law.  It allows applications for asylum made here to be determined as inadmissible where the person has already been granted asylum in the UK.  The amendment in Part 18 will address the safe third country concept.  It essentially enables the Minister to designate a country as a safe third country where certain criteria are met in accordance with EU law.  This means that an application for international protection can be deemed inadmissible where an applicant has arrived in Ireland from a country designated as a safe third country.  It is intended that the UK will be designated as a safe third country.</p><p> Part 18 also introduces a mechanism to return applicants for international protection to the UK.  This will provide for the return of a person to the UK where his or her application has been determined as inadmissible on the basis that he or she has arrived in Ireland from a safe third country or another country is considered a first country of asylum for the person.</p><p> Part 20 sets out arrangements for the recognition of divorces, legal separations and marriage annulments granted under the law of the UK.  Currently, the recognition in Ireland of a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment obtained in the UK is governed by a European Council regulation known as the Brussels IIa regulation.  Under this, divorces, legal separations and marriage annulments granted in all EU member states except for Denmark are entitled to recognition in other member states if granted in accordance with the jurisdictional criteria specified in the regulation.</p><p>Habitual residence is the key governing criterion for recognition.  This is a more objective and easier to understand criterion than the domicile criterion which applies to the recognition in Ireland of a divorce granted in a country outside of the European Union.  Reverting to the domicile rule as a basis for recognition of UK divorces would be a regressive step given that habitual residence has been the primary basis for UK divorce recognition in Ireland for more than 20 years.  The Government wishes to ensure that following the end of the transition period, the arrangements for recognition in Ireland of divorces granted in the UK will continue to be on the basis of habitual residence rather than the domicile provisions in the Act of 1986.</p><p> I expect that the final version of the Bill will be brought before the Oireachtas next month.  I look forward to working with Members in progressing this legislation and minimising uncertainty for business and citizens.  I thank all of the Members for their attention and I am happy to respond to any questions they may have.</p></speech>

An update would be valuable for everybody and give us a sense of what is happening with other committees.  Of course, the Minister cannot answer for other Departments but what is the general state of preparation?</p> <p>  The Minister's opening statement was very helpful but I ask her to go into a little more detail about the family law provisions, particularly domicile and habitual residence provisions.  Will anything change?  How will the provisions affect practitioners?  What are the practicalities of the changes for family law?  People worry that this will have an impact on family law.  There are also many families who live between England and Ireland for whom the provisions may apply.</p></speech>

The most recent publishing of it happened on 9 September.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, is leading the Bill through his Department.  It is intended that the legislation would be enacted and ready before the end of the year and before the transition period ends.</p> <p>  As I mentioned in my opening comments, for me there are four key areas of this legislation.  One of them is potentially new so a lot of the work has been done.  A lot of the legislation had been prepared previously but it could not be enacted once the withdrawal agreement was approved.  Taking into account that this is on a more permanent basis, the final work that needed to be done is being done.  I cannot say where all the committees are, but at the moment other committees are engaging with other Ministers on their relevant piece of legislation.  It is an attempt to move the Bill on as quickly as possible and ensure we are not doing things at the very last minute which, unfortunately, has often been the case with Brexit.</p> <p>  In terms of family law and recognition of divorces, anything that we do here, where there is not full agreement, is never going to be as good as what we had before.  In particular, ensuring the manner in which we look at this, particularly around divorce, and the way that we have done it over the past 20 years does not change is extremely important.</p> <p>  In terms of family law and civil law matters, it is important to say that where there is not an agreement in place, we will have to revert to conventions of which both the UK and Ireland are members.  Whether it is international maintenance recovery, the fallback instrument is the Hague maintenance convention of 2007.</p> <p>  In terms of UK and civil law in general, we will have to work to ensure that there is co-operation on four broad areas.  We have international jurisdiction, enforcement of judgements based upon such jurisdiction rules, applicable law rules, judicial co-operation procedures such as arrangements for the service of documents, and specified EU procedures such as obtaining an order for payment for a pecuniary claim that is not contested.  There are also other challenging areas around commercial litigation, the taking of evidence and insolvency.  What we have has worked well.  If we do not have an agreement in place, then the following will happen.</p><p>It will not enable us to work as seamlessly as we currently do, which is a challenge in itself.  That highlights what Brexit means; it means change, and we have always said that, even with an agreement in place, work will have to be done, particularly in the area of law if we are falling back on conventions that might not allow us to work with the same ease that we do now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.442" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2020100600002#D00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and I thank her for her opening statement.  The issues of immigration, family law, etc., are complex within one state and even more so when taken into a separate state.  I come across many people living in the Border area where we have situations in which children are separated between parents.  In other words, they are living in separate jurisdictions and different arrangements are put in place.  At present, such arrangements work well.  There are issues in respect of all of that and how those arrangements will work in future.  There are also issues regarding sex offenders registers and so on to the effect that there will have to be a continued sharing of information between both jurisdictions.  In addition, we will have to ensure that there will be the same level of co-operation as has been the case up to now.</p> <p>  Many people from abroad live in this State.  The highest proportion of them are from the UK.  Many are applying for Irish citizenship and are trying to straighten out that matter.  I had a woman in my office yesterday who has been living here for almost 20 years.  She is married to an Irishman but is still a UK citizen.  She has been paying taxes and working here for that period and she has to pay almost &euro;1,000 to apply for Irish citizenship.  This is something that needs to be looked at in the context of people who have lived here and contributed to our society for so long and who then have this huge bill to pay when they want to take on something which is natural for them.  This lady considers herself as Irish as anyone else who lives here.  She still has a slight English twang but that is all.  Something needs to be done about these scenarios and many people have raised that issue with me.  The cost of that application is a serious problem for many people.</p> <p>  To go back to the legislation itself, the issues here are highlighting the difficulties of Brexit.  Everyone talks about Brexit in the context of the economic impact it will have but it will also have a societal impact.  Every effort that can be made to deal with all of that in the most efficient way possible needs to be made.  I am a bit concerned about the short time we have to deal with this.  It is running towards the end of the year and if there is no deal, which is looking increasingly likely, we could be in a crisis situation in respect of many of these issues as we move forward.  Again, the efforts that have been made have to be intensified over the coming months.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that this is concerning and that is why it is important that we move this legislation forward as quickly as possible.  This legislation will not only support business.  As the Deputy rightly said, it will also put measures in place to protect people and ensure that the changes which happen will be as minimal as possible.  However, we cannot prevent all kinds of change from happening and we will have to deal with that if we find ourselves in a no-deal scenario.</p> <p>  One of the biggest concerns people have - and the Deputy has outlined a number of scenarios - is that there will be continued co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI and that there will be an ability to continue to share information and intelligence where needed.  Data-sharing is currently governed across the EU by the law enforcement directive and in Ireland by the Data Protection Act 2018.  National security information is outside of the scope of these matters but in the absence of an alternative agreement between the EU and the UK, the fallback option is to create and retain records of every data transfer.  That would have to be done between Ireland and the UK in the form of a bilateral agreement.  It is not the direction we want to go in and we would prefer if there was an agreement on an EU-wide basis but that is something that we have to look at, given the huge level of co-operation that has happened between the Garda and the PSNI and how that relationship has evolved in recent years.</p> <p>  I accept what the Deputy says about Irish citizenship.  This is something that has come across my desk in the short time I have been in my new post.  I accept that it is a barrier for some people and it is something I previously stated that we will examine.</p><p>It is challenging to do so in the current context, but I understand that it is even more challenging for the people looking to become citizens and the cost is potentially a barrier for them.  I will take the Deputy's point on board.</p></speech>

I have four brief questions.  The first relates to the extradition issue, which those of us who remember the time before the European arrest warrant would be fearful of.  The new arrangement under the amendment to section 23 of the 1965 Act would provide for applications to be sent directly to the Minister for Justice and Equality rather than through diplomatic channels or the Department of Foreign Affairs.  How will those applications be handled?  What is the process under these new arrangements when extradition is sought by Irish authorities externally or by British authorities here?</p> <p>  My second question relates to immigration and the Dublin Convention, which will obviously no longer apply to the United Kingdom.  The Minister mentioned both safe third countries and first country applications, both of which are dependent on Britain accepting them, under the legal framework the Minister has set out.  Where are we in our negotiations with the United Kingdom on accepting either people who have been accepted for asylum in the United Kingdom and end up here or people who have transited the United Kingdom and come here, who we would normally ask to return to a safe third country?  Is it agreed that that would happen?</p> <p>  My third question is about secondary legislation.  The Minister says in her submission that other matters are being examined for secondary legislation.  Exactly what other issues will be dealt with by secondary legislation?  I think the committee would like to know what they are.  If the Minister cannot give us a comprehensive analysis of those issues now she might come back to us in writing.</p> <p>  My final question has been touched upon in the Minister's response to Deputy Kenny.  Due to the closeness of our relationship with the United Kingdom and the common travel area, will we seek to develop bilateral arrangements with the United Kingdom outside the scope of the normal United Kingdom-EU justice arrangements?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.446" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2020100600002#E00300"><p>To respond to the Deputy's final question, the main area in which we would seek to engage in a bilateral arrangement is that of data sharing between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, to ensure we can continue to co-operate and that the day-to-day functions and carrying out of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's work can continue.  It is not an ideal scenario for individual member states to have bilateral agreements on specific areas outside of an overall agreement.  That is why the focus and the priority is an overall agreement on this between the EU and the UK.  However, I think we need to be realistic, so if that does not happen we need to make sure that, given the shared nature of this island, we have something in place.  It is essentially a fallback position.  We are working on that.</p> <p>  As regards secondary legislation, in addition to Parts 16, 17, 18 and 20 of the Bill, amendments to secondary legislation are also required in three areas.  We need a statutory instrument which designates the UK as a safe third country after Brexit for the purpose of processing international protection claims.  We also need regulations to facilitate UK citizens becoming members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Reserve.  In addition, we need a statutory instrument to recognise UK solicitors' qualifications post Brexit.  Those are the three areas in which secondary legislation is needed. </p> <p>  As regards negotiations with the United Kingdom, we are working on the basis that reciprocal agreements will be in place and I have no reason to believe otherwise.  We will work on the basis that extradition would be reciprocal.</p></speech>

It is my understanding that applications will be handled through the same administration system within the Department through which the European arrest warrant currently functions.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na office would examine a request and would then submit a request to the High Court, so it is not going to change in that regard.</p></speech>

In relation to the European arrest warrant, if we go back to the 1957 Council of Europe Convention, will the political offence exception be revived in any way and the terrorism exclusion have to be extended?  If the Minister is not in a position to answer this now I fully understand.</p> <p>  Second, as to the Dublin regulation, there is a real problem that we may face a situation that people who are dissatisfied with what is happening regarding their application for refugee status in the United Kingdom, not only people who have been refused asylum status but people who think they are about to be refused asylum status, would come here.  I hope that whatever the Minister does covers both situations, that the safe third-country measure automatically extends to anybody who has applied in the UK.</p> <p>  Third, I note Denmark was slow to join the EU IIA regulation for its own reasons.  Should we not consider, if the Minister is bringing in a Bill to deal with this, some provision giving the Oireachtas the power to extend the customary residence rather than the domicile rule to Denmark because we should not have obstacles with Danish people?</p> <p>  My last point is very much domestic.  The Minister mentioned solicitors.  Will the regulations the Minister is bringing in also apply to barristers using the European professional recognition arrangements?</p></speech>

I do not think that will change.  That is why it is important that we have these measures in place and that there is a reciprocal agreement in place.  I do not think the numbers will change much because we already see that the vast majority are coming from them.</p> <p>  In terms of the political offence exemption, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that exceptions and restrictions to the definition of political offence have been made by statute to the extent that the term is quite narrowly defined by both Ireland and the UK.</p></speech>

The Minister indicated that she may have to take advice on one or two points.  Perhaps at the end of the engagement, if there are any additional points or points that were not got to, the Minister's office can forward them to the clerk to the committee and we can circulate them to the committee so that those matters can be covered.</p> <p>  Senator Ward had indicated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2020100600002#F00700"><p>I thank the Chair and welcome the Minister.  There is obviously a considerable body of work to be done in this area.  Probably, in this committee we are only touching on a small bit of the legislation involved.</p> <p>  I will raise two issues.  The first is in respect of extradition, where that will be based and where the applications will go.  I presume, certainly, since 2013, the Department has a vastly increased competence in that regard in relation to the operation of the European arrest warrant framework.  I presume, therefore, that any new applications under the 1965 Act or under the Council of Europe protocol will go through the same section, which has experience and competence in that area.</p> <p>  The other small issue I wanted to raise was in relation to the use of the term "non-national", which is varied in the Statute Book in so far as the immigration legislation tends to refer to non-nationals and even aliens going back to 1935.  In the 1950s, or certainly by the end of the 1990s, we were changing the word "alien" and using the word "non-national".  However, employment permits legislation, specifically the Employment Permits Act 2006, changed the definition that had been used since 2003 or changed the term from "non-national" to "foreign national".  I wonder if that is something that the Minister might take on board because it is an important distinction.  There is a distinction in law between a non-national and a foreign national.  Potentially, a non-national is a stateless person.  The use of the term "non-national", in immigration terms, can be misleading.</p><p>I also think it is kind of dehumanising to suggest that those people who seek to immigrate to Ireland perhaps do not have their own national status which, more often than not, they do.  Will the Minister give consideration to the use of the term &ldquo;foreign national&rdquo;, which has been deployed in an employment permits context, rather than "non-national"?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2020100600002#G00200"><p>On the last point, that is something I could consider.  Obviously, it is not something we are considering for the purpose of this Bill, where the particular section under Part 17 is to change an anomaly whereby those from the UK would automatically be termed as &ldquo;non-national&rdquo; and that would, of course, mean that citizens coming from the UK to Ireland would have to produce a passport or some form of identification.  This legislation seeks simply to change that anomaly.  Nonetheless, I take the Senator&rsquo;s point.  I accept what he is saying and that is certainly something I would consider taking on board.</p> <p>  In regard to the extradition request, as the Senator rightly outlined, these are handled by the central authority, which is located within the Department of justice currently.  What we are attempting to do here is to remove a layer whereby such requests would initially come through the Department of Foreign Affairs in a hard copy &ndash; essentially, in a diplomatic bag.  We are trying to remove that so it comes directly to my Department in order to make the process easier overall.</p></speech>

Other speakers have alluded to the overall situation and the chances, or lack of chances, of striking a deal.  I hope, to quote the British Prime Minister, that common sense will prevail, moreso on his part than on the part of others.  We remain hopeful that will happen.  Those of us who live along the Border certainly hope it happens because this will make for profound changes in everyday life for those of us who live there.</p><p>The Minister mentioned the evolving co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI, which has improved with the passing of time and is extremely welcome.  It is a vital component of policing along the Border because there is a level of crime committed by those who come into the South and escape via the Border, and <i>vice versa</i>.  Co-operation in such situations is vital.  In the event of a deal, we are still going to be left with serious problems going forward, whereas a no-deal does not bear thinking about.  Is the Minister confident that with regard to the investigation of crime along the Border, there will be a level of co-operation similar to what applies currently?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.459" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2020100600002#G00400"><p>I am assured that, as with all other Departments and State agencies, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is preparing for potential outcomes by the end of the year.  Obviously, we hope there will be a deal but they are also preparing for the potential of a no-deal between the UK and the EU.  As the Senator mentioned, there has already been close co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI, with a particular focus on combating security threats and cross-Border crime.  They have a cross-Border policing strategy which aims to improve a number of things, in particular addressing public safety, disrupting criminal activity and enhancing the policing capability of both policing services, and that will continue irrespective of the outcome at the end of the year.  The Garda Commissioner has also assured me that garda&iacute;, in preparing for Brexit, are looking at a wide range of operational matters, including personnel, infrastructure and technology, and all of that will be done in co-operation with the PSNI.  We hope there will be an arrangement in place so some measures will not need to be implemented but, irrespective of what happens, I believe the cross-Border policing strategy will ensure there can be that continued close co-operation north and south of the Border.</p></speech>

I was trying to see how I could work the refurbishment of Tralee courthouse into this but I do not think I can, so I will have to move on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.462" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1488" speakername="Pa Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2020100600002#H00200"><p>I have just a few short questions.  One relates to the "prescribed place" or place of detention mentioned in Part 18.  I presume these are existing prisons.  Is that what is meant by "prescribed place"?</p> <p>  With regard to the new arrangements for returns to the UK, will people have a right of appeal?  How long will be allowed for such an appeal?  Will it be the normal ten working days?  In cases such as these, people often have difficulty in accessing legal representation, so a reasonable length of time, such as two weeks or ten working days, should be allowed.</p> <p>  My second to last question is on the section on marriages and divorces.  This was mentioned in the briefing document but is not in the heads of the Bill.  Is there any particular reason for that?</p> <p>  My last question is on the people who are subject to the arrangements regarding safe third countries.  Will such people be outside the international protection scheme and process?  Will they be entitled to avail of direct provision or to get social welfare supports?  I have noticed that it is difficult enough for Irish people who have been abroad for some time to return because they have not been ordinarily resident here, which causes difficulties with regard to taxes and social welfare supports.  Will these people be entitled to such things?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.463" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2020100600002#H00300"><p>The answer to the first question is that the existing infrastructure will continue to apply.  I am not aware of any other proposed arrangements in that regard.  With regard to the right of appeal, people will continue to have the same right to appeal as they do at present.  The same timeframe will apply.</p> <p>  On the section on marriages and divorces, this was simply a result of the timeline.  The Brexit omnibus Bill was presented by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 4 August, and at a subsequent meeting on 15 August, two more heads were approved.  It is just the case that they were not ready at that time.  There is no other reason for their absence.  This section was not ready but was subsequently approved by Government along with one other head, although I am not sure which one.</p> <p>  As to whether people will be entitled to avail of direct provision and so forth, we are again trying to mirror our current arrangements.  If somebody is entitled to apply, having not come from a first country or third safe country, they will still have the right to apply for direct provision and all that is associated with it.  That will not change.</p></speech>

Naas courthouse is also on the list.  We will have a module on that issue in due course.  I am sure there will be a lot on the list by that stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1667" speakername="Vincent P Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2020100600002#H00500"><p>Senator McDowell mentioned an issue regarding lawyers from the Republic.  We are a common law English-speaking country and have a special relationship with our nearest neighbours.  I hope there will be no prohibition on Irish barristers, coming from a member state, being called to the Bar or the inns in England and Wales and that the British will make it as easy as it always has been.  I hope there will also be access for solicitors.</p> <p>  We hear a lot about Northern Ireland.  I wish those in Northern Ireland good luck and hope they get the best of both worlds, but it would be very good if unique special arrangements could be put in place on this small island for people living in the Republic of Ireland.  Will the Minister assure us that, although we do not have a direct negotiator at the table with Michel Barnier, she is satisfied that the Republic of Ireland will be properly represented when negotiating the finer details?  There are things which may not have become apparent which the Good Friday Agreement did not anticipate as it was not expected that the British would leave.  One cannot look around the corner often enough to anticipate the unintended or the unexpected.</p> <p>  It is by no means a big issue but could we also look at any implications for the Bosman ruling?  I do not expect the Minister to have an answer on this today.  Jean-Marc Bosman was a footballer better known for his court challenge at the European Court of Justice than for his skills as an underage footballer with Belgium.  I mean it as no poor reflection on the League of Ireland but we do sometimes take players in the autumn of their careers who are out of contract.  I hope no fees will suddenly be levied on professional footballers who would like to grace the Republic of Ireland with their skills in the autumn of their careers.</p><p>Then there is the extra anomaly with Derry City Football Club being in the League of Ireland, but situated within Northern Ireland.  I would like to see a special arrangement being made for the Republic of Ireland in the unique and straining circumstances, to make the most of this situation and do our best to turn a negative into a positive.  I know the Minister is doing her best here.  She is most welcome here today and it is great that she has the portfolio she does, given her experience in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  We need to address those smaller points as best we can at this stage.</p></speech>

With regard to advocating on behalf of the legal profession or any other business community, we have been in a unique and lucky position at the centre of many of the negotiations as they have taken place.  Granted, a huge focus has been on the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, and the overall Northern Ireland protocol, but that has allowed us to have access to those who are negotiating at the very top and those negotiating within the various different structures and sectors that are up for discussion.  The Senator can be assured, and I am confident, that we are represented at every level throughout these negotiations.</p></speech>

In the event that there is a no-deal Brexit, which is something that we all hope does not happen, the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill will be enacted in the UK and there will be no checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland.  Has there been any planning or preparation within the Minister's Department with regard to how the internal market will be protected in such circumstances?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-06a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2020100600002#J00800"><p>It is not something for which we are preparing within my own Department.  The First Stage of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill has been progressed.  If it is implemented, we will find ourselves in a very challenging situation should the UK breach international law and an international agreement.  We know that there are already checks on certain amounts of goods coming from the UK through Northern Ireland and into the South.  That would not change even if the Bill were to be implemented.  However, what is required under the Northern Ireland protocol is that additional checks be made to ensure the integrity of the internal market.  It is not legislation that I am working on within my Department, but it is something that we will have to look at.  There is an obligation, and I think we would all be very shocked and surprised if the UK were to breach the commitment it has made and its international obligations in this regard.</p></speech>
