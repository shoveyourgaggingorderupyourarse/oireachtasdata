    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022062200002#A00200"><p>Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  As numbers are quite high at the moment, we strongly advise members and others in attendance to practise good hand hygiene and to leave some distance between themselves and others attending.  They should always maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence by witnesses who are physically present or by those who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.</p> <p>  Today, we will engage with the Department of Finance, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to consider tax expenditures.  After some debate and consideration, the committee has agreed to examine three specific tax expenditures almost as a kind of model for how we might look at them in general.  Those expenditures are related to research and development, the knowledge development box and the film credit.  The committee has written to a number of stakeholders inviting written submissions regarding the review of these tax expenditures and, next week, will hear evidence from some of these groups.  Today, the committee will hear from evidence from the main officials and bodies with the remit of these three tax expenditures.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Deirdre Donaghy, head of business tax; Ms Aisling Greene, assistant principal officer, R&amp;D tax credit and KDB tax credit; Ms Ian Kavanagh, assistant principal officer, film tax credit; Mr. Matthew McGann, principal officer; and Mr. Paul Cotter, principal officer, Department of Finance; Mr. Alan Carey, principal officer; and Ms Jacqueline O&rsquo;Callaghan, principal officer, Office of the Revenue Commissioners; and Mr. Dermot Coates, principal officer; and Mr. Felix O&rsquo;Kane, assistant principal officer, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I thank each of the witnesses for attending today and for providing information regarding the three tax expenditures in advance to the committee.</p> <p>  I call Ms Donaghy to make her opening statement.</p><p>On behalf of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, I thank the committee for their invitation to come here today to discuss expenditure reviews of the research and development tax credit, the knowledge development box and the section 481 film tax credit.  The Chair has gone through the names but I will mention that Mr. Matthew McGann and Mr. Paul Cotter are from our economics division and they have oversight of the tax expenditure guidelines and also provide the economic analysis elements of tax expenditure reviews.<br/><br/>My colleagues from Revenue will be speaking on the detail of the three tax credits in their statement, so I am going to focus on the expenditure review process.  Subsequently, colleagues from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will provide an opening statement.<br/><br/>Tax expenditures represent a reduction in tax revenues which would otherwise accrue to the State, so it is appropriate that they should come under scrutiny to ensure they are fit for purpose.  This scrutiny takes a number of forms, ranging from annual consideration as part of the budget process, to consideration in tax strategy group papers, to full econometric reviews.  The work of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has also contributed to the process of tax expenditure reviews, and I recall engaging with a number of the current members in this committee's formation under the 32nd D&aacute;il in January 2019.<br/><br/>In 2014, the Department developed and published tax expenditure guidelines to set out a best practice approach to the review of tax expenditures.  The guidelines indicate that tax expenditures should be used in limited circumstances of demonstrable market failure and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention, and that expenditures should be reviewed regularly.  A proportionate approach to the scope and frequency of <i>ex post</i>evaluations is recommended to be guided by the expenditure cost.  For example, it is recommended that a level 1 expenditure, which would be one with an annual cost between &euro;1 million and &euro;10 million, should have a criteria-based review every five years.  Level 2 expenditures with a cost between &euro;10 million and &euro;50 million, which would include the knowledge development box, should be reviewed every five years with an interim review after three years if annual costs exceed &euro;25 million.  Level 3 expenditures costing more than &euro;50 million per annum, which would include the research and development and film tax credits, should be reviewed every three years.  The briefing paper provided to committee members provides an overview of the expenditure review process and the questions to be considered in <i>ex ante</i>and <i>ex post</i>reviews, and also contains a link to the full tax expenditure guidelines document if further detail is required.<br/><br/>Stakeholder engagement is a key element of the review process for all formats of review.  As the body with responsibility for the administration of the tax system, and therefore also having the most comprehensive taxpayer data, the Revenue Commissioners are essential contributors to the review process.  The data, where available and suitably anonymised, can be used to analyse existing expenditures or to model potential new measures.  However, of equal importance are Revenue&rsquo;s operational insights into the tax system, which can inform the design of new measures to ensure they are operable in practice.  In the case of existing reliefs, Revenue may also identify and bring to our attention issues of concern, or unintended consequences arising from legislation, which may require further review.<br/><br/>We also engage regularly with other relevant Departments - for example, with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in respect of the research and development tax credit and the knowledge development box, and with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media in respect of the film tax credit.  Tax expenditure reviews often also incorporate a public consultation in order to seek views of taxpayers, representative bodies and other interested persons.  Department officials may meet with respondents to discuss their submissions, particularly where detailed technical matters are the subject of consultation.<br/><br/>More broadly, the Department is also committed to the regular publication of information on tax expenditures, for the purposes of transparency and to inform contributors who wish to engage with the policymaking process.  For example, each year the Department prepares and publishes a series of papers for the tax strategy group, a group chaired by the Department of Finance with membership comprising senior officials and political advisers from a number of Civil Service Departments and offices.  The papers contain analysis of a range of issues, often including reviews requested by Members of the Oireachtas during finance Bill debates.  A significant volume of analysis is also published each year on budget day, containing analysis of the budget and expenditure measures and economic forecasts.  This includes an annual tax expenditures report, containing an analysis of tax expenditure data, the outcomes of reviews completed since the previous report, and tables of tax expenditure costs across all tax heads.<br/><br/>I hope this overview and the briefing paper provided to committee members is of assistance in framing discussion at this meeting.  I am happy to engage with any questions from members, following the remaining opening statements.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Jacqueline O&rsquo;Callaghan, who is also a principal officer in the business, taxes, policy and legislation division of the Revenue Commissioners.  I understand from the invitation letter that the committee wishes to discuss matters relating to the following tax expenditures: research and development tax credits, knowledge development box, KDB, and film relief.  I am sure the committee will appreciate Revenue&rsquo;s role in relation to the review and evaluation of tax policy measures.  As the tax administration in the State, Revenue collects taxes and duties.  Through this, Revenue has access to, and is able to provide, statistical information and analysis of tax returns and receipts as well as insights from our compliance activities.  To assist the development and evaluation of tax policy, Revenue publishes information in relation to tax statistics, tax receipts and costings on a dedicated section of the Revenue website.  While it is Revenue&rsquo;s role to provide facts and advice to inform the policymaking process, it would not be appropriate for us to make any comment on policy matters.</p> <p>  I will give a brief overview of the three tax reliefs under consideration by the committee, including some high-level statistics in relation to them.  We will be happy to address any questions the committee might have in relation to these topics.  While we will provide whatever assistance we can, the committee will appreciate that Revenue is constrained by law, and specifically by section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, from discussing the tax affairs of any taxpayer on confidentiality grounds.  This includes providing any information that might lead to the identification of any taxpayer.  </p> <p>  The research and development tax credit allows a company to claim a 25% tax credit in respect of expenditure incurred on qualifying research and development activities.  The credit is available in respect of expenses incurred in the carrying on of research and development, as well as on amounts spent on plant and machinery used and on buildings used to house research and development.  The research and development credit is available for offset against a company&rsquo;s corporation tax liability in both the current and preceding accounting periods.  Where there is an excess research and development credit remaining, a company may claim the excess as a payable credit, with 33% of the payable credit available in the first year, and the balance payable over the next two years.  There is a limit on the amount of the payable credit a company can claim, with the limit being determined by reference to the amount of corporation tax paid by the company in the previous ten years or by the amount of payroll taxes paid by the company.  </p> <p>  The latest year for which claims and cost figures for the research and development tax credit are available is 2020, when the total cost of the credit was &euro;658 million in respect of 1,616 claims.  In that year, small and medium-sized enterprises accounted for approximately 88%, or 1,420, of the total research and development tax credit claims.  Larger companies dealt with by Revenue&rsquo;s large corporates division, LCD, accounted for 73% of the total value of research and development claims made in 2020.  Companies which claimed these tax credits in 2020 paid &euro;5.6 billion of net corporation tax receipts in that year - that is, net of the research and development credit.  </p> <p>  Table 1 sets out the total cost of the research and development credit for each of the years from 2004 to 2020 and the total number of claimant companies in each year.  Table 2 provides a breakdown of the cost and number of research and development tax credit claims between large companies dealt with by LCD and small and medium enterprises which are not dealt with by LCD.  Table 3 provides an overview of the total value of expenditure, in respect of which the research and development credit is claimed, for each of the years from 2012 to 2020, broken down between small and medium enterprises and large enterprises.  In 2020, of the &euro;3.1 billion total value of expenditure on research and development, &euro;2.6 billion was by foreign-owned multinational companies.  Research and development credit expenditure by Irish-owned multinationals was &euro;215 million and non-multinationals accounted for the remaining &euro;293 million. </p> <p>  The knowledge development box, KDB, was introduced in Finance Act 2015 and applies for accounting periods commencing between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2022.</p><p>The KDB provides for relief from corporation tax on income arising from qualifying assets such as computer programmes and inventions protected by a qualifying patent or, in respect of smaller companies, other intellectual property that is similar to an invention which could be patented.  A company qualifying for the KDB may claim a deduction equal to 50% of its qualifying profits.  This means that the company&rsquo;s qualifying profits may be taxed at an effective rate of 6.25%.  A company has 24 months to submit a claim for the KDB.  Table 4 provides a breakdown of the overall cost of the KDB for each of the years 2016 to 2020.  Statistics for 2020 are provisional due to the 24-month timeline for making a claim.</p><p> Regarding the film tax credit, a tax relief relating to the film industry was first introduced by section 35 of the Finance Act 1987.  Prior to 2015 the scheme operated by giving tax relief to individuals investing in the film industry.  Since 2015 the scheme provides direct support to film producer companies in the form of a corporation tax credit.  Producer companies that meet certain requirements may claim a credit at a rate of 32% in respect of the production costs of a qualifying film.  The credit is available on the lower of: eligible expenditure, 80% of total qualifying film production costs or &euro;70 million.  The maximum value of relief that may be claimed is &euro;22.4 million.  A total of 186 producer companies have received &euro;600 million in respect of film tax credits relating to the making of 592 films.  Table 5 provides a breakdown of the value of claims and the number of projects for each of the years 2015 to 2021.</p><p> When the corporation tax credit scheme was first introduced, the Revenue Commissioners administered both the certification and the payment of the credit.  Following amendments in Finance Act 2018, the producer company must apply to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media for a cultural certificate in advance of commencing the film.  A cultural certificate is a confirmation that the film is a qualifying film for the purposes of the film tax credit.  The credit was moved onto a self-assessment footing from March 2019 to bring applications under section 481 within the normal penalty and prosecution regime where an incorrect claim is made.  Producer companies are required to calculate the value of credit due and make their claims through their corporation tax returns.</p><p> In summary, the role of the Revenue Commissioners in the review of tax expenditures is primarily to support the process through the provision of statistical information and insights gathered as part of our administration of taxes.</p><p> We will answer any questions from members of the committee on these issues, subject to the constraints I noted in my opening comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Dermot Coates" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022062200002#C00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to participate in this meeting of the committee.  I am chief economist in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Felix O&rsquo;Kane, professional accountant in our economic and tax policy unit.</p> <p>  With regard to the matters under consideration today, it is important to note that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not involved in determining which tax expenditures will be selected for review in a given year.  My understanding is that the Department of Finance generally follows guidelines as laid out in the guidelines for tax expenditure evaluation which were published in 2014.  While the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has an interest in the tax expenditures on which we are concentrating today, in addition to a number of other similar tax incentives, it does not have a role in deciding which expenditures should be reviewed or when those reviews should take place.</p> <p>  Officials from the tax policy unit in our Department tend to engage regularly with officials from the various taxation areas within the Department of Finance.  Each year our Department prepares a pre-budget submission which proposes options for adjustments to aspects of the tax system, including tax expenditures, often in the form of proposals for amendments to existing legislation aimed at enhancing the taxation landscape for enterprises.  This document is the Department&rsquo;s primary means of communicating enterprise tax proposals to the Department and Minister for Finance.  In the event that a tax expenditure review has been decided on by the Minister for Finance, officials may discuss aspects of the review, for example, timelines would frequently come up for discussion, but these discussions tend not to guide the focus of the review.</p> <p>  With regard to tax expenditures more generally, it is useful to point out that many such expenditures can also be considered as tax incentives.  There is little doubt that from an enterprise perspective, tax incentives can bring about many positives.  Indeed, the OECD states that the tax regime is a key policy instrument that may negatively or positively influence investment and the achievement of wider policy goals.  While our Department is supportive of ongoing and timely reviews of tax incentives, it is important that the members of the committee appreciate that measurement of the revenue forgone relating to a specific incentive is unlikely to provide a complete picture of the impacts of that incentive.  Benefits resulting from the changes in behaviour which incentives drive are extremely challenging to assess and cost-benefit analyses should be used where possible, but even these will have limitations.  It is often the case, therefore, that evidence must be generated from a wider variety of sources than would ideally be the case.</p> <p>  Looking at the research and development tax credit, for example, establishing the counterfactual position around innovation investment in the absence of the incentive would be very challenging, so we must seek other evidence.  In the case of this tax credit, it is instructive to see that similar innovation incentives are offered by 25 of our fellow EU member states.  Recent contributions to the ongoing review of the research and development tax credit also reinforced the importance of the credit in incentivising activity in Ireland.  For example, a KPMG survey found that 74% of respondents would markedly decrease activity in Ireland in the absence of the incentive.  Similarly, the American Chamber of Commerce reported member feedback indicating that in the absence of the credit, there would be a significant reduction in the proportion of research and development activities taking place in Ireland.  These contributions back up findings from the 2016 review of the credit by the Department of Finance which found that 60% of research and development activity conducted by firms since 2009 was additional research and development activity which would not have occurred in the absence of the tax credit.</p> <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment believes that to best support enterprise to achieve its potential, a mix of direct expenditures and tax incentives will work best.  There are instances where each method of support is more appropriate.  Some of the advantages of tax-based supports are that they tend to require a lower degree of administration, they are more generally accessible and they are more flexible than direct supports in that they allow the taxpayer to largely determine the nature of the expenditure within defined legislative parameters.  These benefits lend themselves to innovative activities, in particular where the prescriptive nature of direct subsidies can inhibit progress in fast-moving sectors of the economy.</p> <p>  In conclusion, while the Department has no role in the selection of tax expenditures for review, it does feed into the review process on an ongoing basis via our interactions with Department of Finance officials and our engagement in the budgetary process.  The Department is supportive of regular review of these expenditures and acknowledges the presence of the expenditure review guidelines and adherence to them as being an important advance which provides protection for the Exchequer and ultimately the taxpayer.  Regular reviews present opportunities to examine the effectiveness of incentives and make changes if they are not achieving their desired policy objective.</p> <p>  We look forward to participating in the discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022062200002#C00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before an coiste and for the three presentations.  I will start with the research and development tax credit, the larger of the three being discussed.  All members of the committee recognise the importance of developing innovation, high productivity and a high-wage economy, and the importance of research and development in that regard and in fostering research and innovation, particularly in indigenous companies.</p> <p>  It is clear from all the statistics we heard in the presentations and the statistics we have that there is an imbalance in the beneficiaries of the research and development tax credit, with the vast majority of expenditure under research and development going to foreign direct investment.  The figures for 2020 show that 84% of the &euro;3.1 billion in expenditure in respect of which the tax credit was claimed was by foreign-owned multinationals.  Committee members will know that since 2018 and over the following years I have been calling for an increased rate of 30% to be made available to small and micro companies under the research and development tax credit.  In fairness, the Minister took up this proposal in the Finance Act 2019, but it has not been implemented due to the communications his Department has received from the European Commission with regard to state aid.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses clarify the specific issues which resulted in this measure, the increase of the research and development tax credit rate from 25% to 30% for small and micro companies, not being progressed and being dropped?  Can they expand on the different criteria that would have to apply to the two elements of the claim were it to be adopted?  Can they outline whether state aid approval was given and what would need to be done to give it effect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Donaghy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022062200002#D00100"><p>As the Deputy said, in Finance Act 2019 we introduced some measures which were introduced following the budget that year.  We did a review in that year specifically looking at aspects of small companies and how we could try to incentivise that.  A number of measures were introduced.  It was intended they would operate by having the existing research and development tax credit which is available to everybody and gives a rate of 25%.  Micro- or small-enterprises would be able to top that up by an extra 5% in order to get an overall rate of 30%.  As that element would be targeted it would have to get state aid approval because it would be a targeted aid.  When we began discussions with the Commission on that we looked at the various ways in which it could be introduced under the various approvals processes that exist.  Essentially in order to approve it we would have to make slight changes to the definitions, for example, the definition of what qualifies as research and development or to the reporting procedures that would apply and to how it is declared and reported as an aid.  The difficulty created there was that, for example, if you were doing &euro;100 worth of research and development in order to get a credit of &euro;25, you would have one sets of rules applying to it, and to get the next &euro;5 credit there would be slightly different rules.  That would mean that some of the &euro;100 might not qualify and then again something else that did not qualify for the main &euro;25 credit could potentially have qualified for the &euro;5.  They did not match up.  We were talking about small and micro companies and some of the biggest issues they consistently raise with claiming the credit in the first place is that there is an administrative burden to it and they have a difficulty in understanding and following the criteria and having the right documentation to prove it and meet the science tests.  If we then brought in a system where one set of rules applies to the first 25% of the credit and slightly different rules for the next 5% that would have been overly complicated and we did not think it would be practical to do that.</p></speech>

Why do we not disentangle them?  Why do we not have a separate research and development tax credit using the definitions the Commission is asking us to use in regard to having a targeted, state aid approved support package?  We could have two separate applications and a micro business could apply to either, technically.  Why do we not do that?  You would then not have two different sets of criteria or reporting for the same type of research and development.</p></speech>

The worst situation is to have somebody stuck between the two, or half in one and half in the other.  When we ran into the problems with the Commission that is what we then started to look at.  If this is not a viable avenue, what are the alternatives because there is still a policy imperative to try to support the micro and small companies?  To be honest, the main difficulty and why it has not progressed is that Covid-19 intervened.  There was then a significant diversion of resources by both ourselves and Revenue to Covid-19 measures.  We are hopefully coming out of that now and can come back to this.  We are doing the review again this year and while there are other policy objectives we have to address this year as well, we are coming back to the idea of looking at what can we possibly do.  We have one potential difficulty in the avenue suggested by the Deputy which was to separate it out.  We then need to look at what happens with the main tax credit.  If you separate it out and just have it for the uplift it becomes a 5% credit.  That is probably too much of an administrative burden for just 5%.  Ideally you would look to do that for the whole amount.</p></speech>

By excluding businesses you make the main tax credit a targeted credit and therefore it needs state aid approval as well.  Why would you have to go down that road?  Why can you not have in legislation that if you claim the micro, enhanced, targeted credit that you automatically rule yourself out of the main credit?  Therefore it is not targeted because it is eligible to all business but you self-withdraw from that.  Why can we not do that?</p></speech>

Many SMEs do not have access to the large accountancy firms.  It is acknowledged that the process in Britain and in the North is much simpler and less risky for SMEs.  The Department commissioned the OECD in 2019 to do a report on SMEs and entrepreneurship policy in Ireland.  Part of that stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The cost of preparing, filing and defending a claim is too high.  The criteria for making claims, recording and justifying claims and so on as laid down by Revenue are onerous for SMEs &ndash; the rules appear to have been designed with large established R&amp;amp;D intensive (e.g. pharmaceutical) companies in mind, where development processes are very detailed and structured.  In contrast, the rules are not a good fit with, for example, new, agile software development companies, where processes are fluid and fast and documentation is less necessary. </blockquote> <p>Helpfully, it went on to make three proposals, namely, to simplify the approval procedure for research and development tax credits to facilitate the participation of SMEs in this initiative; to introduce a pre-approval procedure of research and development tax credits to help reduce uncertainty for SMEs - in Norway, for example, there is list of things that are likely to get approval; and to maintain the research and development tax credits while trying to increase their update by smaller enterprise by design change and awareness raising.  </p><p>That was commissioned in 2019 from the OECD.  What actions has the Department taken to achieve these objectives, specifically in regard to the simplification of the application process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Donaghy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022062200002#D01700"><p>I might take them in reverse order, if that is okay.  On simplifying the approval, pre-approval and design changes, the thing to consider with that is that if you do things like pre-approval and design changes, they will help to a certain extent.  If something is pre-approved you always have to retain the ability to come back afterwards and audit to verify that what was pre-approved was done.  When it comes to trying to raise awareness or to assist, in particular smaller firms to claim credits, both ourselves and the Revenue Commissioners work on that to try to engage.  There are industry representative bodies which represent all research and development active firms.  It is not just the big four but specifically research and development bodies.  They will have annual conferences at which ourselves and Revenue give presentations and give the context in order to try to build the awareness of it and where to find further information about it.</p> <p>  In regard to the administration of it, my colleague, Ms O'Callaghan, from Revenue might have more information on it.  Revenue has done a lot of work in trying to give templates for how to make the claim and so on to help matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022062200002#D01800"><p>That is helpful.</p><p>The key finding from UCD and what we hear from SMEs all the time is that this was designed for FDI, that is, it was to design an R&amp;D tax credit for SMEs in terms of the application process and the reporting process.  We all recognise the importance of FDI and the R&amp;D tax credit, which need to be maintained, but we have two different and completely unequal systems for SMEs which really want to get involved in research and development and help with wage growth in that sector, and so on.</p><p> It is done in other areas.  I hear all of the time from people who are working with companies.  They say they are working with SMEs and with FDI in the South and they are working with SMEs and with FDI in the North, but it is like night and day.  There is a simple application process in the North, although I do not know the detail of it.  Bringing awareness of the existing rules would be very helpful in making it easier for them to comply but it cannot happen if the rules are designed initially with FDI and big pharma in mind.  I would like to hear if there is thinking within the Department or within Revenue so that, as we are looking at the rates for SMEs, we would look at a simplified approval procedure for the R&amp;D tax credit for SMEs as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Donaghy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022062200002#E00200"><p>There is definitely an openness to looking at anything we can do to make things easier or more straightforward.  It is not designed specifically with FDI or pharma in mind.  Clearly, those are large claimants and they would probably have the most experience with it.  In terms of how it was designed originally, things like what is qualifying R&amp;D refer back to wider international definitions, and there is a Frascati definition of what is research and development.  Things like that have an origin and there is a reason why they are there.</p> <p>  Revenue can probably give more information on this.  We get feedback from the consultations with small businesses that those who engage with this have a reasonable amount of positive things to say about it.  There is definitely a fear of it that seems to put people off engaging, and while we will do what we can to try to address that, it is clearly there.  There is no policy objection to trying to simplify it but there are some basic underlying criteria that we have to satisfy.  We have to be able to show that it is R&amp;D and that it is pursuing scientific or technological uncertainty.  We have to have a reasonably fair way of saying how we determine how much of the cost is to do with that.  It is rare enough that there will be a company that is doing nothing but R&amp;D because every person involved might be doing part R&amp;D and part something else.  There has to be some kind of fair system of doing it.  Working within all of that, if we can find a way that is robust, there is no policy objection to trying to simplify and it is just a matter of trying to find a way that works.</p></speech>

Another question on this area that we have been putting forward is in regard to the timeframe in which the credits can be drawn down.  Ms Donaghy mentioned 33 months whereas we would argue that should be available in one instalment in 12 months.  Again, there is a cost to this but it is a cashflow cost because these are being paid out anyway.  As we are supporting businesses which are doing R&amp;D, the idea is to have the credit drawn down in one year as opposed to over three years.  Can Ms Donaghy explain to me the rationale as to why Revenue or the Department has not moved in that direction?  Is there something I am not seeing here in terms of why we would not allow for the payable credits to be drawn down in 12 months as opposed to 33 months?</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, it is only a cashflow cost but, nonetheless, it is a cost.  At the moment, the way it works is that when someone claims it in the first year, they work out how much their R&amp;D credit can be, they work out what their corporation tax is that year, they do an offset and they see how much is left, and they can claim a repayment, and it carries forward.  Again, in that year, they have to first offset against corporation tax and then claim a bit.  All of the time, it is trying to link it to make sure it is something that has substance in the State.  The real objective of the R&amp;D tax credit is that it has that activity happening in the State in real, substantive businesses that generate all kind of spinouts around it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022062200002#E00500"><p>The activity happened in year one because the credit was realised in year one.  The only thing is that it is not being fully realised or cannot be drawn down for up to three years, which, for a company that is emerging or growing, is a big issue in terms of cashflow.  Obviously, it is not able to draw it down because it would not have the corporation tax liability, so we are not talking about massive profitable companies.</p></speech>

When it became payable, it was a way of staggering the cost, so cost is a significant consideration in that.</p></speech>

The surprising figure is that only 17 companies are availing of this.  Can Ms Donaghy give us any indication in regard to FDI versus SME or indigenous companies?  There is a crucial question I would ask in regard to the knowledge development box.  What is Ms Donaghy's understanding of how the knowledge development box and the R&amp;D tax credit could be affected by the US tax changes, particularly the global intangible low-taxed income, GILTI, credit and also the pillar 1 OECD agreement?  Where do those lie?  Some of those carve-outs have not been agreed at the minute.  Can Ms Donaghy give us any insight into the importance of that in terms of the final agreement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.39" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Donaghy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022062200002#E01000"><p>In terms of the claimants, we have very limited information because my colleagues in Revenue will tell me they cannot give it to me either.  When the numbers come down so low, they are prevented from going into details that would identify.  The numbers are low but not unexpectedly low on the knowledge development box because it is quite a restricted relief.</p> <p>  In terms of the future changes, R&amp;D and the knowledge development box are both potentially being affected, particularly by pillar 2, which is the minimum effective tax rate.  The changes to GILTI are obviously tied in with that as well.  Under pillar 2, a country has to calculate a minimum effective rate of 15% based on the global anti-base erosion, or GloBE, base.  The question is that if someone has a tax credit, is that something that reduces their effective rate or is it not?  All of the countries involved recognise the value of R&amp;D and recognise it is something they want to be supported.  Provided it meets the definition of what they called a qualifying refundable tax credit, it is not treated as reducing someone&rsquo;s effective tax rate.  The idea is that if someone has something that is not a qualified credit, the credit is treated as basically reducing the tax they have paid, which reduces their effective rate, which makes it more likely they have to pay a top-up, whereas if they have a qualifying tax credit, it is treated instead as income.  It effectively comes in almost above the line, in a way.  Instead of saying that someone has &euro;100 in income and they paid &euro;12 in tax and got &euro;5 in tax credit, it means they only paid &euro;7 in tax.  That would be the non-qualifying version.  The qualifying version would be that they had their &euro;100 in income, they paid their &euro;12 in tax and, with the &euro;5 offset of the tax credit, the way it is treated is that they still paid &euro;12 in tax but they had &euro;105 in income.  Therefore, it increases their income and, effectively, they will have to pay the 15% on that, but it preserves the majority of the value of it.</p> <p>  There is a definition in those rules of what a qualifying refundable tax credit is.  Our R&amp;D tax credit is very close to that.  It is possible there may need to be some small changes to it but that is something we are looking at this year in the context of the review.</p> <p>  For the knowledge development box, it is a different element of pillar 2 that might affect that.  Outside of the GloBE rules, there is a separate element called the subject to tax rule.  This is where a jurisdiction has any element of its tax system that provides an effective tax rate of less than 9%.  Because the knowledge development box effectively allows a tax rate of 6.25%, because what it does is halve the income and it then taxes that-----</p></speech>

That is potentially in scope of the subject to tax rule.  The way that one works is there is not any turnover threshold that applies to that.  With the main part of pillar 2, you are only in scope if there is global turnover above &euro;750 million.  With the subject to tax rule there is no cap, so anyone is potentially within the scope.  The way it works is it is designed primarily to help developing countries.</p></speech>

I have a couple of general questions but mostly I want to ask about the film tax credit.  In the case of the research and development credit, what market failure is being addressed?  It is supposed to address a market failure and it seems to me there is not a market failure, especially for those that are the biggest beneficiaries of it.  They are companies that have enormous wealth and resources and whether we gave them a tax credit or not they would be innovating.  Are we giving a tax credit that is supposed to be responding to market failure in an area where there simply is not a market failure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.48" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Donaghy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022062200002#F00900"><p>It goes as well to Deputy Doherty's points on it.  There are two separate parts of who is engaging.  If you have the smaller companies there is certainly more of a financial pressure on them to try to do research and development because with research and development, in order to meet the definitions that are there, you have to be trying to resolve an uncertainty, so there is no guarantee anything beneficial for your business will come out of it.  It is a much higher risk than investing your business's money in something you know for sure will deliver a return, albeit possibly a smaller return than if your research and development works out for you.</p> <p>  When it comes to the larger companies, what the Deputy needs to consider is whether there be a market failure in Ireland without the credit.  What we consistently hear from all the companies that engage with us is some of the biggest competition they face in trying to locate research and development projects here is from other arms of the same firm in other jurisdictions because there will always be a lot of competition to get the research and development located in any jurisdiction.  The reason people want it to be there is it brings a lot more with it.  If you locate your research and development here it is more likely you will have manufacturing processes associated with it, for example, or that you will build other functions around it because whatever the outcome of it is, you need to manage it, develop it and protect in the long run.  The very strong reports we get back when we do consultations on this is that in the absence of the research and development tax credit there would be a significant market failure in Ireland of research and development.</p></speech>

The bulk of the value of this thing is going to big, very wealthy, very profitable multinational corporations and the threat is if we do not give them this tax break they will do that research and development elsewhere.  The contrast I always draw is if we put &euro;700 million into our public universities for research and development or into Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, what might we get in the form of more targeted research and development that was actually beneficial to society as against beneficial to already spectacularly wealthy corporations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Donaghy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022062200002#F01100"><p>It is a question we ask.  As part of the review process, we will ask stakeholders to tell us - to essentially defend why we need to have this credit.  When it comes to putting money into the universities, the straightforward thing is if we have &euro;600 million, for example, which is the cost of the credit, then we can spend &euro;600 million as a State to get &euro;600 million worth of work done or we can do &euro;600 million of a tax credit which incentivises &euro;2.4 billion in work to be done because we provide &euro;1 in &euro;4 of that.  We do as much as we can to ensure the research and development credit builds those links with the third level institutions and has the spillover effects.  It is one of the things we are trying to examine and get more information on in this year's review.  From an economics point of view, you can take the numbers and the tax forgone and how much research is done, which are the things that are quantifiable and easy to review.  It is much more difficult to try to determine those kind of spillovers but we are asking and if nothing else we will have reported our outcomes.</p> <p>  There are many things happening with the universities in terms of college courses being developed specifically around the types of research and development that are happening here, both in pharma and software, and internships that are sponsored from one to the other.  Basically, in order to have the quality of a college course or of a third level course that is bang up to date and really delivering value it helps hugely if you have a real-life industry that is at the cutting edge of research in your jurisdiction and nearby and with a link to that university.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.51" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022062200002#F01200"><p>Okay.  One of the things the PBO, in looking at all this, is saying, and I am in agreement, is we are not having a proper evaluation on a regular enough basis of these things and hearing from stakeholders as to the arguments and pros and cons of this.  I do not think we are.  Ms Donaghy can put that case and I am sure people will put that case but then I think of the fact that educational counselling and psychology are not funded for people to do doctorates, yet we have a chronic shortage of psychologists to do assessments for children.  I want to hear that discussion on evaluating if this is the best expenditure of public money in the area of encouraging research, advancing research, and so on.  We are not getting that level of scrutiny, oversight and hearing from the different stakeholders so we can make a proper evaluation.  We should find ways to have that discussion with all those stakeholders in a more structured way.</p><p>We have discussed the film tax credit many times.  According to the EU, state aid to film must meet two tests, namely, the industry development test and the culture test.  The industry development test is worth reading out.  It states there will be:</p> <blockquote> 	... [an] aim to generate the critical mass of activity that is required to create the dynamic for the development and consolidation of the industry through the creation of soundly based production undertakings and the development of a permanent pool of human skills and experience. </blockquote> <p>Then there is &quot;... the primary cultural aim of ensuring that the national and regional cultures and creative potential are expressed in the audiovisual media of film and television&quot;.  How are we evaluating that?  I believe we are not doing so at all, to be honest.  Margrethe Vestager, as the Commissioner with responsibility for state aid, wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, in 2019 to express concerns about whether we were meeting the cultural test.  There are very serious question marks.  It is interesting that on foot of that that this year an Irish film won a load of awards at the Irish Film and Television Awards.  I do not think that was a coincidence.</p><p>I am sure it was deserved, but it was very interesting because it was the first time it had happened for yonks .  In my view, that was because it was being called out on it.</p><p> How are we evaluating this?  I would be interested to know if anyone has ever been refused section 481 support on the grounds of not meeting the culture test.  Has anybody ever been refused on the grounds of not meeting the industry development test?  One of the biggest recipients of section 481 support is producing &ldquo;Vikings: Valhalla&rdquo;, which is being shot in Wicklow at the moment.  It was reported in the newspapers recently that: "A note attached to the accounts states that the majority of workers employed are contract workers."  This raises serious questions about the industry development test.  If the majority of people working on a production for one of the biggest - if not the biggest - recipients of section 481 tax relief year in, year out, are contractors rather than individuals who have an employment relationship with the recipient, that is a big problem.  In the context of any reasonable understanding of the EU rules around this test, that clearly does not meet the industry development test.  It is not creating a permanent pool of skills, and it involves using a load of contractors who have no employment relationship whatsoever with the recipient of the relief.  That relief is given specifically on the grounds of creating quality employment and training, and creating a permanent pool of skills.  How are we checking this?  It appears to me that we are not.  We are listening to the producers who get the relief and they are saying that it is brilliant.  Of course they are saying it is brilliant because they are getting the relief and benefiting from it.</p><p> Previously, this criticism was coming from people who were employed on construction crews, stage crews, etc.  I do not know if our witnesses have had a chance to read the Equity submission.  Equity raises some very interesting questions and expresses concerns about section 481.  Equity, the film workers who have expressed deep concerns and I all want to see money going in to create an industry.  However, Equity has asked some serious questions.  It states that the risks regarding the way in which it is done at the moment relate to: excluding new and emerging independent producers and having a large amount of industry power concentrated within a small group of players; the potential abuse of the tax credit through a range of practices, including internal pricing and artificially depressed income strategies; and the flaunting of national and international copyright legislation. This latter concern relates to the question of residuals and royalties.  Nearly all of the major recipients of section 481 relief in this country tell people who want to work in film productions that in order to get jobs, they have to sign up to buy-out contracts where they sign away all of their royalties and residuals.  Their counterparts in Britain are not asked to do that.  This is absolutely outrageous.  Residuals are one of the major ways whereby artists and performers who are in very precarious situations might get a little bit of money back over the years from a film that continues to be shown again and again.  The recipients of section 481 in this country are insisting that most performers and artists must sign away their rights to the particular production in question.</p><p> This also raises a very interesting question as to whom those rights are being assigned?  Who then gets the royalties over the years?  Is it the DAC that disappears after 12 months following the end of the production?  This is the mushroom-like nature of the DAC.  Where employees have grievances and go to the WRC and raise issues relating to their employment on a production or in respect of instances where they may have been wrongfully dismissed or badly treated, the film production company, which receives the money on the basis of developing the industry, quality employment and training, goes before the WRC and the Labour Court again and again and states that not only is the relevant person not its employee but also that the structure of section 481 means he or she could never be an employee of the company.  The employer is the DAC and the DAC is gone.  As a result, nobody is accountable for how a person is treated on a particular film production.  I do not even know the answer to the question as to what happens to the royalties and residuals because they are not going to the performers.  Where are they going?  I presume they are going to the production company, which has always existed and which is the recipient of section 481 relief.  This is the company that has managed to disown responsibility for everybody who has worked on the film production and got all of them to sign away their rights to further royalties.  When are we going to start looking seriously at these things?</p></speech>

I may have probably missed some of the questions along the way.  In that context, I ask the Deputy to feel free to ask me again if I do not answer any of the questions.</p> <p>  I could not say if anyone has been refused a culture certificate because that is dealt with the by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  The application goes to the Department, which then carries out the assessment.  I know that officials from the Department have appeared before various committees to discuss this matter previously.  The Department will be able to give the committee any data specifically around that.</p> <p>  When it comes to the issue of quality employment, it is one which we have discussed with the committee on many occasions over the years and we have been paying attention to the issues.  We do not just listen to Screen Producers Ireland.  In fact, it complains that we do not listen to its members enough.  We have met with employee representative groups also and deal a great deal with Screen Ireland, which is the official body.  There have been many changes over the past three or four years in order to try to ensure that we are substantiating that in the screen development aspect of it.</p> <p>  I know that the committee has received a submission from Screen Ireland that gives some of the detail around that but, essentially, back in 2019, the skills development aspect of it was much less well developed.  It went around a system that for every X amount of credit you claimed, you had to have Y amount of interns or trainees.  Queries were raised - and they were fair ones - as to how we ensure that someone will not be an intern or a trainee forever, that there is proper development and that people can make actually make progress through the industry.  From 2019 onward, Screen Ireland has been progressively developing an entirely new process for that and is now focusing on skills development.  It is not just interns or trainees; Screen Ireland is looking at skills development at every level.  It is not just about getting a trainee in; it is also about getting a mid-level unit manager and training him or her up to be a head of unit.  This is happening at all levels to show that the company involved is actually developing somebody&rsquo;s career as it goes along.</p> <p>  When we split the credit in 2019, one of the benefits of that was that the application has to go in for the culture test before the application with the financial details goes through to Revenue, which can be further along in the process.  One has to engage upfront on one skills&rsquo; development plan with Screen Ireland and with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  That is staggered because the bigger the production, the more you have to engage and the more detail you have to provide.  In the case of a larger production, there is a compliance stage at the end of the production to ensure that this is signed off and that the company has met the criteria.  The Department has sent through details to say that since April 2019, over 140 skills development plans have been submitted to Screen Ireland for approval and more than 1,500 skills participants have been tracked through those productions.</p> <p>  On a regional basis, because we also have a focus on trying to move those talent pools out of Dublin and Wicklow and around the country in a more broad way, we have the regional spend uplift.</p><p>If you are applying for the regional uplift, there have to be additional skills development participants for that to show that you are developing the talents in those areas.  Since April 2019, Screen Ireland has had over 45 regional skills development plans, over 500 participants have been tracked and it is continuing to move forward.  It has engagement now on higher and further education and training.  There are new Springboard and traineeship programmes at institutions like the Technological University of the Shannon, the Atlantic Technological University and Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board and Screen Ireland is establishing five new talent academies across Ireland, in Wicklow, Limerick and Dublin and two in Galway.  It is moving so far forward in that respect that it is the first to link this type of structured skills training to the film tax credit and other jurisdictions are now coming in to learn from Screen Ireland about what it is doing.  The latest innovation being introduced towards the end of this year is a new digital skills tracking system, so there should be more transparency and accountability about what is there.  I know Screen Ireland has sent-----</p></speech>

They have been put in the public domain.  The royalties and residuals are shocking and outrageous.  They have publicly made the case strongly that the contracts and conditions of employment for people working on film productions here are significantly worse than in Britain, for example.  That is very serious.  We will hear from them and the detail will be seen in the report but they have made public statements to that effect.</p> <p>  That echoes the views of a group Ms Donaghy has heard from before, namely, the Irish Film Workers Association, whose leading figures have never worked n the film industry after they made these things public.  Some of the people who work on those film productions have just said to me straight, "I'll never be working with those people again."  It is as black and white as that.  You get blacklisted if you say certain things in the film industry.  I still do not see where the protections are, nor do I see how a situation in which people can be blacklisted is compliant with a state aid and EU requirement, and a legal requirement in terms of the relief here, that something called quality employment and training be in place, along with a permanent pool of skills.</p> <p>  The database is something workers have been screaming for.  It used to exist many years ago.  Who will draw up the database?  I suggest we find out and I think the answer will be interesting.</p></speech>

I have read it but the questions are how you get on that database and also concern the tracking of trainees.  They have been designating people as trainees on films for yonks.  That does not tell me anything has changed.  They can put a document in stating they have a certain number of trainees.  The big question is whether any of those trainees are working on the next production.  Do they have any obligation to those trainees?  Do those trainees have a qualification?  The answer is "No".  There is no pathway to qualification.  We are still way behind on that.  It is like we are ticking a box that someone is a trainee and, by the way, we have run a course that the trainee may have participated in.  Does that actually give people a qualification and will they have any greater security in the industry than they had previously?  The answer, in my opinion and from what I hear, is "No".  There is still absolutely nothing to prevent someone being designated a trainee on this production and on the next production it is a different bunch of trainees.</p></speech>

The purpose of this is to show the development of the skills and address the suggestion that fully qualified people are still being designated as trainees.  There has to be a pathway.  It has to show a person's skills are being developed.</p></speech>

These are being addressed and the proper forum for that is through forums such as the Workplace Relations Commission and the bodies that can do that.  I know cases have been taken and my understanding of taking a case to the Workplace Relations Commission is that it needs to be taken, in general, within six months, or up to 12 months in certain circumstances.  There is a requirement for the designated activity company, DAC, to stay in existence for at least 12 months after the end of the production so-----</p></speech>

There is a problem with that.  The big film producers might be a year or 18 months between big productions.  When people are laid off at the end of a film production and the same production company makes a new film with a new DAC, the old DAC has expired.  If someone does not get employed 18 months later, it is too late to take a case.  The DAC under which that person was employed no longer exists and there is no recourse.</p></speech>

People acquire through the operation of law a contract of indefinite duration when they work a certain amount of time over a certain period for a particular employer.  The difficulty in this situation occurs when those cases are taken and the employees go in.</p><p>Every time, without exception, as we can see from the transcripts of proceedings, the recipient of the section 481 relief states something like, "I have never been that person's employer and I could never be that person's employer because the DAC is the employer."  What the recipients are, in effect, saying is, "I set up the DAC and I only set it up as an accounting tool, but somehow I am managing to separate myself, the recipient of section 481, from this DAC thing, which is only an accounting tool, but legally it is allowing me to absolve myself of any responsibility for the people who worked on the film production."  That is continuing to happen, even after all the compliance certificates and all the rest of it, because of the DAC structure.</p></speech>

In the case of producers who are making series, the days of annual series are almost gone now.  Every six months or nine months, a new series comes along.  The question then is whether a case will be taken that will come within the timelines and have a decision made.  The impression I have is that this is not a simple issue of timelines and there are many complicating factors such as employees working with other productions in the meantime and still trying to say they had a continuous contract of employment.  I am not in any way qualified to give the Deputy an opinion on those issues.  They need to go to the right bodies in the State, with the people who are the experts on these matters.</p></speech>

The Government needs to make a decision on this issue and stop batting it back to the WRC.  The latter does not know what to do with it.  Somebody needs to clarify the situation.  The relief is given out with a purpose, which is to support the industry, create a permanent pool of skilled employees and create employment.  The Government, using public money, is trying to meet a particular objective.  Whatever about precisely how the WRC may interpret it, nobody looking at the situation can say the test is being met because the people who are getting the money are saying they have no employees.  I do not see how that is an industry or how it can be described as such.</p></speech>

If members wish, there will be a second round of questions.  First, I would like to do some housekeeping on behalf of the committee relating to the consideration that was given to this matter during the Thirty-second D&aacute;il and the report thereon that was written.  The tax strategy group in the Department of Finance subsequently made a report that, from my reading, was very much an answer to the work of both the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, and the predecessor to this committee.  The immediacy of that report to the work done in the Oireachtas meant the language used included a lot of &quot;we will consider&quot; and &quot;we will do work on this&quot;.  Will the officials from the Department of Finance give a general update on the work that has been done in this regard since then?</p><p>In the original report by the PBO in 2019, one of the requests was that there be a shared list between Revenue and the Department of Finance and some kind of clarity around why some things are considered tax expenditures and others are not.  Some concern expressed was on the issue of sunset clauses, which I may have time to comment on presently.  Will the witnesses also comment on data and measurements that are calculated <i>ex ante</i>?  There needs to be clarity for everyone around the measurement of whether a tax expenditure is working well.  I do not know whether they have that information.</p></speech>

In terms of the list, the main confusion comes up because we publish a document every year at budget time listing tax expenditures.  That list is based on the definition of a tax expenditure as per the tax expenditure guidelines.  Separately, and for longer than we have had the tax expenditure guidelines, Revenue has been publishing its own list under the title "Tax Expenditures" that is not based on the same definition and includes some things we would not consider to be tax expenditures because we consider them part of the benchmark tax system.  It is undeniably problematic that there are two lists that both have titles referencing tax expenditures but that include different things.</p></speech>

The solution probably is just to give one of the lists a different name.  The issue is that the two lists give different information.  If we try to resolve them, we will end up with less information.  There is a real purpose to Revenue publishing everything it has because it is publishing a lot of information on parts of the tax system we do not consider to be officially tax expenditure, but it is still valuable information to have.</p></speech>

All tax expenditures operate in different way depending on what they are and some of them are very easy to quantify.  For example, research and development is a very clear cash benefit and it is really easy to pick that out and say, "This is the cost of your research and development tax credit."  Some are more like offsets or are otherwise harder to quantify.  We are talking about something that is so fundamental to the system, it is considered part of the benchmark and we do not call it an expenditure.</p></speech>

A tax expenditure is a departure from the benchmark, if we think of the latter as the baseline system.  Colleagues from Revenue will correct me if I am wrong but I understand they do not take a view on what is a benchmark system.  The Revenue report just lists all the costings without saying whether they are a departure from the benchmark.</p></speech>

The information we got from the Department, however, suggests that at least some of these policies have been in place since 1999.  They have not changed and they have no sunset clauses.  Are we really still categorising them as policy initiatives, if they have not been reviewed, they have not been changed and they have no sunset clauses?  </p></speech>

If we took something, for example, like the blind person's tax credit, it is an extremely targeted measure aimed at helping a particular cohort of people.  It is therefore clearly an expenditure.  It is considered every year as part of the annual budget process.  All personal tax credits are considered in that context.  It is unlikely that we will see a cost-benefit analysis of the blind person's tax credit, though, because it is hard to see anyone proposing the removal of something of this nature.</p></speech>

Instead, the approach taken by Revenue is to publish all available information on tax expenditures, broadly defined as those moneys gathered as part of the role of the administration of taxes.  To go into that aspect further, we source data from the returns of income tax, corporation tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty, value-added tax, VAT, and other available sources.  Those data show the estimated cost in respect of revenue forgone, as well as the numbers of people who availed of the tax credits and main reliefs and deductions allowable.  Several reliefs that may apply to individuals and companies are also included.  The costs shown in respect of those reliefs cover income tax and corporation tax.  On <i>www.revenue.ie</i>, it can be seen that we publish a statistics link.  The cost of tax expenditures can be found there.  Additionally, there is a method statement concerning how those figures are arrived at.  Therefore, this is about the data we have available and it is the information therein that is published.</p></speech>

Having had that conversation, we will return to the issue of sunset clauses.  If we are talking about policy initiatives, then, and I did some quick calculations regarding the latest list we received, it looks to me like 75% of tax expenditures, big or small, do not have sunset clauses.  If these are policy initiatives, that is a surprising figure.</p></speech>

The lessons learned in this regard came from the early 2000s, in the context of the property incentives.  They were good and rational policy incentives to begin with and if they had ended five years before they did, we would all have been a lot better off.  Therefore, the lesson learned from that experience, and that came out of that period, was that if we were to bring in something new, that it should have a sunset clause.  That would ensure that a review was triggered to make us look at the measure.  It would also ensure that we were not in a position where such measures could just passively keep going.  If a policy decision were made to continue the measure, that would require a legislative amendment.  It will be seen that there are sunset clauses in the measures that have come in since then, from about 2012 to 2015 onwards.  Almost everything that has come in since then has a sunset clause.</p></speech>

What the Chair is saying about the sunset clauses goes back to her previous statement that there might be better ways of delivering initiatives.  It is important to state that just because measures do not have a sunset clause does not mean that we do not consider whether there might be a better way of delivering the desired outcomes.  Just because something has been on the books for a while does not mean it is never looked at again, even if a formal cost-benefit analysis is not undertaken etc.  The only issue regarding extending the use of sunset clauses is that we must be realistic and honest in this regard.  There is a resource constraint concerning the number of tax expenditure elements we can examine annually.  To be honest, it is about-----</p></speech>

We are a small administration.  When a sunset clause requires a legislative roll-over, we are forced to look at it.  A lesson we learned from the original tax expenditure review guidelines is that we can end up crowding out other work because we must examine the measures with sunset clauses.  Therefore, this is just a trade-off and there is no perfect answer.</p></speech>

We can see from the relevant table that some of these have been there since 1999, some 23 years.  They have never been reviewed or at least there are no records of there having been a review.  They do not have a sunset clause, and this is a good argument to put one in them, if it forces the Department to review them.</p></speech>

In the context of the 2009 Commission on Taxation report, for example, it was important to go back, to explore all those measures, to recognise they had been on the books a long time, to ask if they were serving their purpose anymore and to determine whether many of them needed to be rowed back on or removed.</p></speech>

Many other things happen instead of a formal econometric review.  The PAYE tax credit, for example, does not have a sunset clause and it does not get formally reviewed.  It is a measure, however, that is highly unlikely to ever be taken away.  What happens is that it is considered annually in respect of whether it should be increased or decreased.  It is-----</p></speech>

We discussed this aspect at the Committee of Public Accounts recently, when I asked a similar question.  A certain percentage of measures have never been reviewed.  I got a similar answer on that occasion, in respect of certain packages being reviewed during the budget process.  On the flip side of that, however, some of the briefing we have been given is that a proper review of these measures can take more than 12 months.  If we are dealing with tax expenditures or tax reliefs that never get a full review, and are rolled over every year because someone is taking a passing glance at them, but not a full, in-depth review, I am not sure that is the kind of oversight that would satisfy the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, this committee, the OECD or any of those kinds of groups.  I am aware that there are different levels of review, depending on the type of tax expenditure.  How many of the 165 are over &euro;25 million?</p></speech>

I could not find that information anywhere, or at least I was not able to collate it in the way I wanted to.  How many of these 165 tax expenditure elements are over &euro;25 million?  That is the limit that triggers the three-year review.  If only four of these measures are being reviewed annually, then I suspect that the Department is woefully understaffed in this regard to undertake this kind of work.  I also suspect that the ratio of what is being reviewed is not 1:1.  It is very low.  In respect of the &euro;25 million limit, I would appreciate knowing how many of these 165 tax expenditure measures meet that stipulation and are meant to be reviewed every three years.  That would be very useful.</p><p>I will stick to an overall view of how we do this.  This might be more an issue for those who deal with trade and employment.  Some of the measures we are speaking about today have very specific employment requirements.  This is not always the case with tax expenditure.  Is there a different quantitative requirement for reviews of these?  Who gets involved in this?  Does it all happen in the Department of Finance?  Are other Departments involved where aspects of the expenditure are more complex than simply handing over money to be tax compliant?  This may be the case where there are employment clauses.  I ask this very specifically because we will soon deal with gaming development tax expenditure.  I am very keen on this.  I would like to see it treated in the same way as film tax expenditure is treated, with goals to support the industry in terms of staff and training.  Is there a difference between how we look at these types of tax expenditures as opposed to standard tax expenditure that does not have an employment cause?</p></speech>

This is similar to a planning permission that requires local employment.  It has a clause that we might not see in other tax expenditures.  Is there a more comprehensive review of how it is working?  Unlike direct expenditure, there is no performance budgeting for tax expenditure.  The committee spends a lot of time speaking about equality budgeting, gender budgeting, well-being budgeting, poverty proofing and child poverty proofing.  There are all these metrics we are trying to push Departments to put in place.  It does not really happen.  Perhaps the newer ones are better at saying what the measurements are.  It is not yet happening at the level of tax expenditure, which, in real terms, is spending.  Where there are particular clauses, are we doing something different?</p></speech>

There is not really a role for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to follow up on it.  We are not really involved in any way.  Nothing really springs to mind.  Perhaps in general one thing we mentioned in the opening statement is that it is very difficult to try to assess the benefits of any tax expenditure or incentive.  In trying to quantify these things, we have to look for other sources of information.  It is not something that is there as part of the overall process that I am aware of.</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had already published something on expenditure.  We are in the early stages of looking at green budgeting, as are other countries.  It lends itself more to expenditure than to tax.  We have set out the issues with green budgeting before taxes apply.  It is a green tagging system for various tax measures based on existing measures.  This could be used on a per year budgetary basis to assess, as a first step, the monetary value of the greenness of the budget.  The only people I have seen who are ahead of us on this are the French.  They have more developed criteria.  They assess the environmental effect on six criteria rather than just the monetary value.  They have a four-point scale of how green a particular measure is.  With regard to the tax base, even though our system is relatively rudimentary, it is one of the most advanced.  The European Commission is asking us to present to other countries on what we do.</p></speech>

I suspect with the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity, one of the suggestions will be to broaden away from monetary evaluation.  I do not think it will end at green budgeting.  Tax expenditures often benefit people who pay sufficient tax to take advantage of them.  I suspect equality budgeting will also be quite challenging.</p> <p>  I want to continue to discuss how exactly we are going about reviewing tax expenditures.  Perhaps it is an issue for Revenue.  I am not sure who it is for.  If tax expenditures relate to EU programmes or have a relationship with EU goals or EU funding, is there increased complexity?  Is this something that comes up?  Is there any tax expenditure that has an EU aspect?  Does the greenhouse gas emissions allowance have something to do with the emissions trading system, ETS?  That would have an EU component in it.</p></speech>

I thank Ms. O'Callaghan.</p> <p>  I want to go back to the film relief.  I was perusing the numbers.  This is a minor detail in the greater scheme of things but I noticed a noteworthy change was made between 2019 and 2020.  The expenditure went from &euro;1.3 million to &euro;2.2 million but the number of people or groups in receipt of the tax expenditures went from 41 to 47.  The increase in the number of groups receiving it was 14% but the increase in expenditure was 66%.  What is happening there?</p></speech>

Two thirds of the claims are for &euro;500,000 or less.  The most on one production could be up to &euro;22.4 million.  We can see how one big production can really skew the numbers.  We spoke about the information published by Revenue.  It is accurate but it probably needs a bit of context.</p><p>When a producer company is claiming the credit, it is a little bit complicated.  If, say, they get a certificate in 2022, they have to go back and amend their corporation tax return for a previous year.  I might use an example to clarify this.  To a 31 December year-end, if a company wants to claim relief on a certificate in 2022, the previous tax return, for 2021, can be amended depending on the stage of the year.  This is assuming that the specified return date for the corporation tax return has passed, which for December year end would be September 2022.</p><p> If it has not passed, however, and if the company wants to make the claim in June, it would go back to the 2020 return.  The information the Revenue statistics branch produces and publishes shows the returns that were amended.  If a film were certified in 2022, for example, some of that could be shown for a 2021 return being amended and some of it for 2020.  Those numbers need to be contextualised.  On the beneficiaries list we publish every quarter, it is shown by reference to the year in which the state aid was granted and the money received.</p></speech>

This DAC thing drives me around the twist.  How is anybody supposed to know?  We will get on to the Equity issue next week, and our guests will have read the submission.  One phrase that strikes me - people do not use phrases for nothing - refers to depressed income strategies and internal pricing.  I know exactly what that means and I think our guests all know what it is alluding to.  That kind of stuff needs to be scrutinised and, as policymakers and legislators, we need to know whether these mechanisms that have been set up to stimulate the industry are being abused.  We need to know the detail.  I am curious about the DAC in all this business.  Do we ever see the DAC's accounts?  Can I see them?  All the accounting is done within the DAC even though it is the producer company that gets the relief.  It does not give us transparency, does it?</p></speech>

A DAC is a company.  It must be established and have a normal company returns office.  A certain degree of information can usually be availed of by the Companies Registration Office, although I am not sure of the level of detail.  Revenue gets the returns under confidentiality, so they are not publicly available, but the returns go through Revenue's risk-profiling systems as well.  If there were to be any suggestion of something being done that was fraudulent or incorrect, there are avenues by which that should be reported and it can be investigated.</p></speech>

I had to step out to another meeting that lasted much longer than anticipated.  If I double up on questions, therefore, I apologise for that in advance.

By definition, we know about the ones that do get approved.  Officials in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media are the people who would be able to give information about whether any companies that apply for the cultural certification do not get it, given that is a hurdle they have to jump over to get there.</p> <p>  I do not have information on collaborations, but Screen Ireland might.

If there is a sunset clause, it prompts a review and the Department tends to look at those that have a larger cost, for example, the research and development and film would be higher cost ones that are reviewed more regularly.  The tax and expenditure guidelines give the suggested review and the best practice timelines based on size.  Then there are other things that prompt reviews as well.  During budget or finance Bill debates, the Minister may often commit that something be examined, for example a tax strategy group paper might be produced on it.  Political debate can prompt something to be reviewed.  We have discussed that there are many more expenditures than the Department has capacity to review so it is always a case of trying to identify those that give the best value.  We have to do a cost benefit analysis of doing a cost benefit analysis really.  It is always a case that there is more work to be done than the Department has capacity to do and those are the criteria that bring the ones that get reviewed up to the top of the list.</p></speech>

One last thing, the stakeholder issue is a theme that comes across in terms of the reviews and I ask the committee to consider that we significantly up the ante on that.  We had an arts committee that recommended a stakeholder forum around section 481 a few years ago.  Certain participants said they were not participating and then, even though a Minister and a committee was in favour of it, the committee was gone because one or two stakeholders decided they did not want to participate.  I seriously recommend that this is just not allowed.  If people say they are not participating, they are the ones who should be penalised.  How on earth can somebody get public money and then refuse point blank to participate in a stakeholder forum that the elected representatives and the Minister say is going to happen, and they are let away with that?  It is beyond belief to me.  I ask the committee to consider that point because we need more stakeholder engagement and a proper structured process.  Frankly, if stakeholders and beneficiaries of these reliefs are not playing ball, they should be told to take a hike.</p></speech>

The reason there is a relief is that there is no real economic change in the owner.  It is still owned within the same group and provided you meet the criteria, stamp duty is not charged.  It would not be viewed as a loss of revenue to the State because if there was a stamp duty charge on it, moves just would not happen.  It exists for things like reconstructions, amalgamations, moving things around a group.  They are all part of the normal way in which a group operates.  It is not one the Department sees as a loss of revenue as such.</p> <p>  On stakeholder participation, and I know Deputy Boyd Barrett will not agree with me------ </p></speech>

I know Deputy Boyd Barrett has a particular focus on film and that is one instance.  I cannot talk to that particular instance but certainly the Department has a very open engagement policy across all elements of taxation.  We do public consultations, take pre-budget submissions and meet with representative bodies.  Over the last number of years we have been making huge changes to the corporation tax system from the anti-tax avoidance directives and we do a whole process of consultation papers, of feedback statements and public meetings.  The Department ran a public stakeholder event a couple of years ago specifically targeted at SMEs and small businesses where we looked at the EII relief and the key employee engagement programme and the small business aspect of research and development.  There is always something that has not been done but looking beyond that one particular instance, a huge amount of stakeholder engagement goes on although undoubtedly we cannot meet everybody.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his officials to the meeting.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask that members participating via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contributions, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  If attending in the committee room, members and officials are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  I remind members that, should a vote be called, they must come to the committee room physically in order to vote.</p></speech>

In discussions with the insurance industry, it became clear that the requirement to notify the Department within five days - a tight timeline that was set out in the 2016 Act - of an inspection in which a vehicle was written off because it was deemed not roadworthy or had come to the end of its life should be amended to ten days.  In these provisions, we are amending the 2016 Act to allow the industry ten days to report rather than five.  The requirement to report within five days was never commenced.  We are now ensuring that it can be commenced, but as a ten-day timeline.  It was felt that a five-day period was too short.</p></speech>

The change is to insert additional text to extend the existing powers to include the disclosure of records to vehicle owners or persons nominated by the vehicle owner.  In other words, it is the ability to get national car test, NCT, data in order that one has the right to access to data if one wants to buy a vehicle.  It brings the position regarding privately owned vehicles into line with work already commenced in respect of the commercial sector.  For example, if one is buying a commercial vehicle, one is allowed, under the Commercial Vehicles Roadworthiness Act 2012, to get access to the NCT data.  This allows the same powers for a prospective vehicle owner or his or her nominee.</p></speech>

It speaks to consumers in that they will know what type of car they are buying.  The Minister mentioned at a previous meeting he was considering setting up a type of national database for electric vehicles in order that people buying second-hand vehicles would know their battery history or powers.  I take it he envisages that the amendment will also contemplate that.  We all know what is under the bonnet of the petrol and diesel cars.  We are already seeing the second and third iterations of electric vehicles.  People want to know the electric vehicle they buy in seven or eight years' time is as good as it was when it left the garage and that it is still roadworthy.  Does the Minister envisage such provision being contemplated by this amendment?</p></speech>

A significant percentage of new cars are already electric plug-ins or hybrid plug-ins.  This amendment allows access to technical vehicle data, including test dates, the outcomes of tests, mileage, fuel types as well as battery types.  It is not personal data; it is purely about the performance of the vehicle in previous tests and the characteristics of the vehicle.  That would apply for electric as well as petrol cars.</p></speech>

People might be aware of the Landsberg case, which was before the High Court last November.  The court gave a clear direction in that case, and we are very happy to follow it.  These amendments give a person, on showing his or her temporary residency certificate or right to it on arriving in the country, the capability of accessing a driving licence.  In circumstances where a person might be in the protection process, and who, thankfully, will now be able to work, this will ensure that if he or she can drive and meets all the other requirements, he or she will be able to access a licence.</p><p>There is another series of amendments.  I will not go into all the details but the amendments before us set out how that will be allowed.  The amendments provide for the endorsing of a licence, for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to retain a licence and forward it to the Minister if it is revoked and for certain provisions under the relevant Act that apply to learner permits to also apply to driving licences.  The key intent of these legislative amendments is to make provision in law for the consequences of the Landsberg case and to provide for people in the international protection process to obtain licences.</p></speech>

I am quite sure the judgment stated that a legislative change was not needed to give to the ruling and that the State should get on with it.</p> <p>  I support the move to the master licence record, but there is an opportunity to go further.  There are anomalous situations whereby, for example, a vehicle can be sold to a child who does not have licence.  I raised, during the pre-legislative scrutiny phase, the issue of the potential to create databases that would talk to each other, so to speak, in order to address that anomaly and it was indicated the master licence record would help in that regard.  We will bring forward an amendment on Report Stage in my name and the name of my colleague, Deputy Gould, whose constituency in Cork has had some tragic experience of the implications of that anomaly.  We hope the Minister will give it due consideration.</p></speech>

This relates to a variety of the technical amendments I am presenting.  It has been drawn to our attention since the original drafting of the Bill that many insurers operate through what are known as managing general agents, MGAs.  A foreign insurance company might not be directly selling its products in Ireland but it would have administrative agents operating here.  These measures are to give them the same powers or capabilities in terms of access to the database and there are also requirements to pass on information to the database.  Such agents are common and are an important part of the insurance industry.  These amendments are to make sure they are recognised legally as intermediaries under this legislation.</p></speech>

To answer Deputy O'Rourke, this database is very important.  It provides knowledge of what is happening, which will benefit us in a whole variety of ways.  One of the issues with regard to the database of the motor insurance register was that it was felt that there was no need for the actual address.  Many of those details are captured because details of the driving licence have to be included and this includes much of this information.  It was felt that it was better to capture the person's name and licence details and that the address is not required.  There is a benefit there with regard to ease of use, management, monitoring and updating the database.  Not having to put in the address in that particular category makes the database simpler and more efficient to use.  It is to simplify the working of the database.</p></speech>

Approximately 8% of private cars are fleet vehicles.  In the published Bill, we asked for information relating to &quot;the classes of persons whose liability is proposed to be covered by the policy and the number and classes of vehicles&quot;.  Following further consideration, we now propose to recast this and divide it into two subsections.  The first will require the name of persons covered in the policy and the second will require the class of driver covered.  It is an important distinction because a policy will sometimes name drivers while other times it might cover a class of drivers, for example, heavy goods vehicle, HGV, drivers employed by a firm.  By splitting the named drivers and class of drivers provisions into two subsections, we give ourselves the option to commence them separately.  While I hope not to do that, it would be a useful option if the roll-out of the database was to take place in stages.  We are not talking about the vehicles here.  This is about the classification of the drivers.  Reporting on vehicles held by a fleet is not to the insurer but directly to the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, and therefore to the database under section 56A(2) of the Act.  This amendment is to provide greater flexibility in how companies might provide information on their drivers to the database.</p></speech>

We feel a system of penalties is required.  There needs to be some enforcement mechanism for cases where fleet owners do not provide regular updates on the constituent vehicles.  In this case, a class C fine is to be introduced, which is a fine up to a maximum of &euro;2,500, to ensure compliance.  Fleet owners will have 14 days to give details of changes in the composition of their fleets.  This should be sufficient time.  The fine is there to make sure the authorities have an enforcement mechanism, should they need it.</p></speech>

It is again to provide for a compliance mechanism in the event that someone was not updating the database in that way.  In this case, because we are dealing with private individuals rather than fleet owners, we are setting out a class E fine, which is a potential fine of up to &euro;500.  We set a higher standard for business.</p><p>Most of the other amendments in the grouping are largely technical and make small adjustments to errors in the text.  The other one of some significance is amendment No. 25, which states that an insurer who issues a policy without receiving the proper information from the client first, which an offence under the Bill, will be able to make a defence of having taken reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence.  In other words, if an insurer does not provide an update and there is subsequently a problem, if it can be seen that the insurer took significant steps and did not ignore the requirement, which is a valid defence-----</p></speech>

They are in similar circumstances to fleet operators.  Their insurance covers a variety of vehicles under a flexible arrangement.  Providing this new definition will allow the provisions to apply to them.</p></speech>

The first is to drop the reference to the address.  I referred to that earlier.  We changed that in the context of the information provided to the insurer or agent by the client.  The address of the persons on the policy is not required because, as I stated, we get that from the driving licence.  The second change, which may relate to a question asked by Deputy O'Rourke, is to remove the term &quot;insured&quot; as a way of referring to the policy holder.  As the Deputy stated, a policy holder is not necessarily the insured.  In other words, a person may own a car but not drive it.  He or she could take out a policy on the car so that another person can drive it.  That is not common but it is something for which we need to allow.  That is the nature of the amendment.</p><p>Amendment No. 38 changes the data to be provided by the insurers to the database in respect of fleet policies.  The published text states that the insurer will provide the classes of persons covered by the policy.  This will now be the names of the persons.  We are also adding reference to policies held by a motor trader as these are similar to fleet policies but would not be captured by the present text, as referred to in a previous amendment.  Finally, we are removing references to the vehicles covered.  This is because that information will be provided directly to the database by the policy holder, rather than by the insurer.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 are small additions of a type we are making in a few places to add reference to intermediaries such as managing general agents, MGAs, after insurers.  They, as well as insurers, will have to notify the database if a policy holder notifies them of changes to the information they have supplied.  They, like insurers, will have to notify the database when a policy is cancelled.  </p><p>Amendment No. 41 is more substantial.  It adds an additional reason to the purposes for which the Minister may have access to the data.  This will allow my Department to verify the validity of insurance coverage for vehicles to be authorised on a road transport operator licence.  This is often an issue for the Department.  For example, in the case of supports to the haulage industry recently, certain licensed vehicles were able to access such supports, while others were less able to do so.  The amendment provides a joint capability within the Department in the context of sharing the insurance database details with the road transport operator licensing details.  We currently rely on self-declarations and that would continue to be the case without the amendment.  We do not have evidence that a person is in compliance with his or her insurance obligations.</p><p>Amendment No. 42 adds a reference to intermediaries alongside insurers.  This will allow them to see the data they have uploaded to the database in order to verify or correct it.  Under the amendment, MGAs will now be able to do the same.</p><p>Amendment No. 43 simply adds definitions of two terms, namely, &quot;National Vehicle and Driver File&quot; and &quot;operator&rsquo;s licence&quot;, used in the insurance-related amendments made by the Bill.  It is largely a technical amendment.</p></speech>

I want to speak specifically on the bilingual nature of much of our road signage and the prominence given to the English language.  I engaged on this for years as a member of a local authority.  I have had any amount of challenges with regard to road signage.  Companies in my constituency deliver road signs for the whole country.  There is sloppiness in attention to detail in many cases.  More particularly, I want to discuss the standard that exists in signage.  There is a spectacular opportunity if we make a tiny change in design to put the Irish and English languages on an equal platform.  By doing so, we would raise awareness of the Irish language.  There are multiple examples presented by Irish language activists that have been seen by other public representatives.  It is our intention to table an amendment on Report Stage to reflect this in new road signs.  There should not be an additional cost incurred.  There should be an extra eye on the design.  This has the potential to deliver a significant change and a move away from the disservice being done to the Irish language.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendment we will table on Report Stage in good faith.</p></speech>

The NRA is still referenced in legislation.  Perhaps we should look at changing the term because we think about transport in a much more holistic sense now and primary legislation should reflect this.</p> <p>  On the general grouping of amendments, the thrust is to give the TII power to erect variable speed cameras.  We should probably look to give this power to other road authorities as well as the TII so that we move beyond national roads to other roads.  Local authorities should also have this power in the Bill.  Is the intent of the legislation prescriptive with regard to traffic flow or is it broader than this?  There are all kinds of reasons we might have variable speed limits, including safety, noise reduction and air quality emissions.</p> <p>  This might be the section of the Bill where we could look at a national kilometre reduction target as other countries have introduced.  We have one in the climate action plan that is specific to fossil fuel vehicles.  Other countries are applying such a target to all vehicles.  If we are to be true to the policy approach of avoid, shift and improve, we should try to reduce the number of kilometres driven throughout the State.  This is being done in other jurisdictions.  It would probably fit into this section of the legislation.</p></speech>

There will be a move towards shared mobility in a range of ways.  This is a slightly pedantic point.</p> <p>  It Deputy Leddin were to table an amendment on Report Stage in the interim I would look have to look to the Office of the Attorney General to see whether there is any reason we could not accept an amendment whereby we change the title of the authority.  We would have to be careful that we would not miss anything because the legislative block is unconsolidated.  I am also conscious of time.  I do not know how long such a trawl would take.  I would certainly consider it if the Deputy were to table an amendment on Report Stage.</p><p> On the variable speed limits and the management of it, the primary reason is safety.  Near the port tunnel we have a monitoring service on the M50 and other roads approaching the capital.  I happened to be there last year when a car broke down on the outer lane, the fastest lane, as it were, and was stuck there.  It was an incredibly dangerous situation to look at.  You had passing traffic going at 100 km/h.  Emergency workers, an ambulance, garda&iacute; or a fire truck coming to that incident would have a real challenge with how to manage what is a real safety problem.  Thus, the primary purpose here is for safety management of the road and potentially other roads, as I said, nominated by the Minister of the day.  That could include part of a national road.  We could do it section by section.</p><p> There are other potential benefits, such as alleviating traffic congestion problems.  Often the road is not acting optimally when you have a certain speed limit.  You may see you get greater capacity use out of it by regulating for speed but that is a matter for TII to decide on and we are giving it powers to make those judgment calls.</p><p> On the wider issue of avoiding, reducing, controlling, and management of emissions, there may well be cases, for example with issues of serious air pollution, and there are such issues.  There is a real issue around the M50 and the surrounding suburbs.  The emission of particulate matters, ozone, benzene and all sorts of chemicals is a very significant issue.  If TII is looking, as I said, and it can be shown there is an optimal way of managing that, I do not believe this legislation would restrict it but the primary purpose is safety.</p></speech>

It is important it is not prescriptive because there is the issue of noise as well.  I am aware of a situation - as the Chairman will be as it is near his home - in Castletroy where the motorway is nearby and it is very noisy.  It might make sense that at certain times you could slow the traffic down to reduce the noise, such as at night-time when people are more disturbed by it.  That is why how we use the variable speed cameras should not be restrictive.</p></speech>

It is to do with amendment Nos. 72 to 74, inclusive, and the setting of special speed limits.  The Bill seems to deal mainly with national roads, TII roads, and not roads managed by local authorities directly within their areas.  I see in the proposed section 55(10E) there is scope for ministerial policy direction on certain speed limits.  Is there scope to be stronger on that?  We have had the RSA in here.  We have had many activist groups and cycling groups that are all keen to see a 30 km/h speed limit set in urban areas.  That would of course assist us with active travel and also deal with the issues of noise and pollution that were just spoken about and generally make our roads a little safer and more inviting in the urban centres.  Is there scope within this to be stronger in that the Minister just may, from time to time, issue a policy directive?  I believe it lies with the local authorities to implement 30 km/h speed zones.  We got advice recently, following committee sessions, there is no legal impediment to local authorities implementing those 30 km/h zones but that would seem to conflict with what is in the guidelines for setting speed limits.  We need clarity on that.</p></speech>

I do not believe there was concern in principle around applying such experimental methods to non-national roads, it was more to introduce it in a way that there were certain parameters or controls.  Again, the Deputy may wish to consider if it is possible to put a Report Stage amendment in that regard.  We will use the interim period to consult the Attorney General's office further and see whether it is possible to extend the Minister's powers to designate non-national roads as well as national ones.</p></speech>

It effectively applies similar conditions to those that apply, I think, to taxi drivers and others in the sense of the ability to rescind or remove a licence if someone is in breach of certain basic standards.  It starts with the provision of a shoulder note, as I said earlier, to change part of the text but it also brings in the &quot;fit and proper&quot; person provisions for driving instructors, so people with certain convictions will be barred for a certain period or for life from becoming driving instructors.

It updates the collective citation of the Road Traffic Acts in a number of places in the Road Traffic Act 2010.  This is being done because these specific places involve Garda powers, and the legal advice is that we need to update the citations in these places.  Some of them currently refer to the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2010.  That original Road Traffic Act 1961 has been amended many times in the past five decades and more of its existence, including amendments made post 2010.  In some of those previous updates, therefore, the citation, in the context of the Garda charging people under the legislation, could be to powers under the Road Traffic Act 2016, as amended by the Road Traffic Act 2010, for example.  Some previous updates could refer to the Road Traffic Acts from 1961 to 2016.We have not updated every collective citation.  That would be a significant task.  We are seeking to ensure that we have a proper citation approach for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the implementation of the Road Traffic Acts. </p></speech>

Under section 12(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Road Traffic Act 2010, the Garda may in certain circumstances require a person under arrest to provide two specimens in the context of alcohol and drug testing.  Section 13 of the Act provides for the &quot;procedure following provision of a breath specimen under section 12&quot;.  As is normal in much scientific equipment, a margin of error is applied in the measurements taken by these machines.  This amendment stems from the advice of the Attorney General on foot of a recent court case.  The decision has been taken to amend section 13 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 to enable the margin of error to be set out in regulations.  This is the primary difference.  The amendment will allow for the margin of error to be described, defined and amended as &quot;degrees of variation&quot;.</p></speech>

The original 2014 provision allows for access to the records so that insurers could factor in penalty points when pricing insurance, which is a valuable public benefit. </p><p>The published Bill will allow for access when &quot;processing&quot; rather than &quot;issuing&quot; insurance policies, so that insurers will have access when changes are made mid-term to a policy, such as when a new driver is added.  We are now going to add an amendment here in order that access will be permitted for managing general agents.  As we said earlier, they act on behalf of insurers operating in the State.  One reason for doing this relates to the European Commission competition rules.  These drew our attention to the fact that if insurers but not their agents have access to the data, then there might not be a playing field.  This change is to provide that level playing field and, essentially, to comply with our obligations in the context of the Single Market.</p></speech>

Typically, these are e-scooters or other similar devices.  In the published Bill, certain technical details characterising such vehicles are included in the revised definition for PPTs.  We are amending paragraph (b) of section 16(e) by lowering the maximum unladen weight permitted to 25 kg and paragraph (d) of section 16(e) by increasing the continuous rated power permitted to 0.5 kW.  The maximum speed of 25 km/h set out in paragraph (c) of section 16(e) will remain unchanged.  These specifications are proposed as standard for vehicles falling under this category.  Following expert advice, I am also amending paragraph (d) of section 16(e) by clarifying that for vehicles where there is more than one motor, a combined rated power of 0.5 kW is the maximum limit.  Making these changes to the specifications for this class of vehicle will ensure that PPTs remain outside the scope of the EU motor insurance directive, which applies to mechanically propelled vehicles, and consequently will not require insurance for use on Irish roads.</p><p>Even in the time since work on this Bill commenced, the reality of a maturing e-scooter market has been noted.  The work of the Road Safety Authority informs our thinking.  My solution is therefore to satisfy the recommendations of that organisation and the wider public interest is to insert or such other values &quot;as the Minister prescribes&rdquo; in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of section 16(e) in order that the weight, speed, and power output in the definition may be revised as needed through regulations.</p><p>This will future-proof our road traffic legislation, allowing us to make necessary updates as the sector grows and providng an opportunity for further consultation once the Bill has been enacted.  Those are the key provisions.  It does not apply to e-bikes which are not powered personal devices.  It does provide a standard provision for e-scooters and other powered personal transporters, PPTs, in the market today.</p></speech>

There has been a huge uptake of such bikes in Dublin.  Dublin City Council has led a very positive initiative around last-mile delivery and there are hubs all over the city.  We will probably see that in every city and large town in Ireland in time as it becomes easier to travel in our urban areas by smaller vehicles.  We can expect tradespeople to travel by cargo bike as well as families.  There is evidence that families are getting rid of their second cars and getting a cargo bike in lieu.  I would be concerned that this section is restrictive on cargo bikes and especially the line about reducing down from 55 kg to 25 kg.  We must be careful when we discuss the power outputs of cargo bikes.  I suggest that 0.5 KW is a lot of power for a light bike but may not be for a heavy bike, so we need to be very careful about how we word this.  Maybe the Minister can allay the fears but if there is something to be worked on, I would like to come back on Report Stage with a proposal.</p></speech>

What is the reason he went for giving the Minister flexibility to prescribe the speed limits?  Do regulations follow on from this or do they have to come in by statutory instrument laid before the House? The Minister will appreciate that there is keen interest in this.</p></speech>

First, I give Deputy Leddin an assurance that cargo bikes or any form of e-bikes are not PPTs and will not be affected by the legislation.  That is a separate issue and category.  It is completely different.</p> <p>  The main reason for going down to the 25 kg is that it avoids our tripping ourselves into insured categories under the European legislation where you are into a different class of vehicle.

It is a new, different category.  The vast majority of scooters on the market today would be below the 25 kg weight limit.  There may be a very small number that will not be legal under this legislative system but one of the benefits will be that they are not then classified as mechanically propelled vehicles and can be treated in this way.</p> <p>  As the Chair says, it will be secondary legislation.  We must circulate the regulations to the EU first - I think within 12 weeks - in order to ensure they are not in breach of European competition and other rules.</p></speech>

This measure was made with the intention of clarifying that where the maximum design speed of the vehicle is in excess of the special speed limit, the lower of the two limits should automatically apply.

This measure was made with the intention of reducing the risk of injury to minors from PPT use and, indeed, potential injury caused by minors to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.  However, my Department has identified several significant implementation challenges.  There is no suitable mechanism to record PPT supply as vehicles falling into that category do not require registration.  Furthermore, it can be expected that many purchases will be private second-hand sales or will take place on websites based outside the EU.  In addition, no licence system is proposed for driving an e-scooter and there is no requirement in Ireland to carry proof of age.  In light of those factors, I no longer consider that this provision will be enforceable and, consequently, I suggest it be withdrawn.</p></speech>

Identification cannot be enforced, so the policing of this is the primary reason it would not be enforceable.  Law that is not enforceable is bad law.</p></speech>

By taking out the section, that deterrent is gone.  It essentially sounds like turning a blind eye to it.  I am, therefore, quite concerned that the effect of this is essentially to give licence to people to provide PPTs to people under 16 years of age.</p></speech>

We may end up with cheaper, lower quality, less safe equipment because they are attractive to the under-16 cohort as they have a little less money.  That is why I would be concerned if this section were to be deleted.</p></speech>

There is the option of regulation to amend such speed limits.  This issue is a keen one in the public domain.  I am asking only for points of clarification rather than expressing an opinion as Chair, but the Minister could further elaborate as to how he came to this conclusion with his officials.  Deputy Leddin made a salient point, that is, that when this is taken out of primary legislation, the Minister may say it cannot be enforced, but it is there.  The Minister might just elaborate on that.  It is a key feature.</p></speech>

It is critical at this time of year, and given that we have seen the number of road deaths rise and a terrible fatality list.  Road safety should absolutely come first at every turn.  That is why we are looking, as I have indicated, to heed the advice of the RSA to bring in regulation of lower speed limits such that we can regulate the types of vehicles that are sold.  As for sale of vehicles, however, there is nothing we could introduce that would regulate an adult purchasing one of these vehicles and then it being used by his or her son or daughter.  It is impossible.  We know that.  It is a reality.  Furthermore, as for the policing, in the absence of a mandatory identity card system and a licensing and registration arrangement, which we do not have with this, it is an unenforceable provision.  It would be a false promise and bad policy for us to pursue supposed safety measures that did not actually enhance or improve safety and, therefore, it is better to remove the section, to my mind.</p></speech>

There is a recognition this is happening and that it is to be welcomed, but there are concerns and some relate to the training and how these vehicles will be used.</p> <p>  There are also concerns, which we have clearly heard, about the standard and quality of the vehicles, oversight, quality control, and the maintenance of high standards.  We have heard of extreme cases of fires and issues with batteries.  I wish to flag those issues because I am sure they are ones that will have to be considered in advance of secondary legislation.</p> <p>  I wish to put on the record that there is a general appreciation of the direction of travel here but that there is the potential this might go the wrong way if inappropriately handled, if the regulations are not sound, if there is not proper oversight, and if people are not properly trained.  Nobody wants to end up in that place.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Cannon that there is a significant benefit to be gained in the development of new e-mobility solutions but there are also big risks.</p> <p>  My own sense is I am frequently terrified as I get older and I am overtaken by other vehicles that are often very silent and often driven or used in a way that is far from satisfactory in terms of road safety.  We need to regulate, maintain, police and ensure we have a good road safety system as we switch to new modes like this.  There is a role for the Road Safety Authority, clearly, in its public information campaigns and within others.  There is a role within our school education system and there are a range of different ways in which we can enforce or encourage good road usage and avoid, for example, the use of these vehicles on the paths.  The protection of pedestrians is critical.</p> <p>  I agree with all those desires and the requirement for us to do that, but as I have said, we will not deliver all of that with this section.  I am keen to press my amendment.  I will consider this again between now and Report Stage and look to see if there are further and other options.  I would prefer, if I can, to press our amendment and consider this issue before Report Stage.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 58 and 62 are related and will be discussed together.  I call on the Minister to speak now, please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.526" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022062200002#L01500"><p>I move amendment No. 58:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 51, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:  	<b>&ldquo;43.</b>Section 2 of the Act of 1993 is amended&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) by the insertion of the following definitions after the definition of &ldquo;busway scheme&rdquo;: <blockquote> 	&ldquo; &lsquo;camera&rsquo; includes CCTV and other apparatus used for the purposes of creating and capturing photographic images and video;<br /><br />&lsquo;CCTV&rsquo; means any fixed system employing recording devices for recording or processing, including through the use of automatic number plate recognition, a visual image or moving visual images in a public place;&rdquo;, </blockquote>(b) by the insertion of the following definition after the definition of &ldquo;pedal cycle&rdquo; and &ldquo;pedal cyclist&rdquo;: <blockquote> 	&ldquo; &lsquo;personal data&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016;&rdquo;, </blockquote>and<br /><br />(c) in the definition of &ldquo;road&rdquo;&mdash; <blockquote> 	(i) in paragraph (b), by the substitution of &ldquo;carriageway (whether single or multiple and whether or not designated for a particular class of vehicle),&rdquo; for &ldquo;carriageway (whether single or multiple),&rdquo;,<br /><br />(ii) in paragraph (c), by the insertion of &ldquo;verge,&rdquo; after &ldquo;margin,&rdquo;, and<br /><br />(iii) in paragraph (d)&mdash; <blockquote> 	(I) by the deletion of &ldquo;and&rdquo;, and<br /><br />(II) by the substitution of &ldquo;used, or the use of which is reasonably required, for&rdquo; for &ldquo;necessary for&rdquo;.&rdquo;. </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>Amendments Nos. 58 and 62 are related to the issue of the development of busways and to the use of CCTV.  Under &quot;busway&quot;, section 43 provides for an amendment to the definition of a road in section 2 of the Roads Act 1993.  To provide clarity on what constitutes part of the road, it is proposed to make a change to paragraph (b) by substituting &quot;carriageway (whether single or multiple and whether or not designated for a particular class of vehicle)&quot; with &quot;carriageway (whether single or multiple)&quot; and to paragraph (c) in the definition of &quot;road&quot; by inserting of the word &quot;verge&quot; after &quot;margin&quot;.  These changes are included in the existing Bill, but as further changes are being made to the definition of a road, it is proposed to delete section 43 from the Bill and restate the proposed changes set out above.</p><p>There is also an amendment proposed to allow for a change to paragraph (d) of the definition of a road in the Roads Act 1993.  It is proposed to insert the words &quot;used, or the use of which is reasonably required, for&quot; in place of &quot;necessary for&quot;.  The reference to &quot;necessary&quot; potentially sets too high a threshold and needs to be altered to make it clear that the definition extends to anything used or reasonably capable of being used in connection with the safety, convenience, benefit and amenity of road users, including the provision of information.  This amendment will reflect the reality of the range of facilities and infrastructure that is now provided as a matter of course as part of a public road and are not strictly speaking &quot;necessary for&quot; the safety, convenience or amenity of road users.</p><p>On the second of these amendments, which deals with CCTV, it recently came to the attention of the Department that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is using a network of CCTV for cameras to monitor traffic and to assist with enforcement.  Local authorities use similar systems for traffic management and monitoring.  Cameras are used to monitor and manage the movement of general traffic, public transport and various other different transport modes.  These allow TII and local authorities to identify incidents, accidents, congestion, delays and other appropriate actions.  Enforcement cameras can be located at toll plazas or along road gantries, such as those on the M50.</p><p>At each enforcement location, the system of enforcement cameras monitors vehicles and captures necessary information, such as number plates, to support the management of the road.  These cameras are generally fixed mounted and generate images that are used for post-image capture processing, such as automatic number plate recognition.</p><p> Traffic cameras are also used to monitor and manage other incidents, such as marches, protests and other events, including weather-related events.  TII and road authorities share the data from these cameras with a number of bodies, in particular the emergency services, public transport operators such as Dublin Bus and Luas, and local authorities.  On behalf of TII, several contracted service providers also have access to this information.</p><p> These cameras, and particularly the use of data, are being used without a proper legislative basis.  The enforcement use of cameras, by its nature, requires identifying individual vehicles.  While most of the traffic management information is captured from a distance and does not include individually distinctive information, it is possible for the cameras to zoom in, and some images of registration plates and at times faces may be captured.  This amounts to personally identifying data and can raise concerns about the protection of the data in question and of individual rights in light of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.</p><p> Legal advice obtained is that this matter can be addressed by regulations in the short term.  However, this solution will have effect only until 6 December 2022 due to section 6(2) of the Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019.  It is, therefore, imperative that proper provision be put in place in an Act of the Oireachtas before that date.</p><p> It is proposed to address this situation by an amendment to insert a new section 77A into the Roads Act 1993 to allow for the provision of cameras by both TII and the local authorities, including CCTV cameras, and for the use of data from those cameras.  The proposed additional section 77A will give a basis for the provision of cameras, including setting up and operation of cameras, first, for the safe and efficient management, operation and use of public roads, including traffic management and providing information to the public; second, for charging and collecting tolls and the operation of toll roads; third, for the deterrence, prevention, investigation and detection of criminal offences, including road traffic offences; and, fourth, for any other purpose to be prescribed by the Minister.  The amendment will also address the publishing by TII or each relevant local authority of a schedule of the cameras in question operating on public roads.  Finally, we will provide a legal basis for the sharing and processing or use of data from cameras in operation between a local authority, TII, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the National Transport Authority, the Road Safety Authority and any other person the Minister considers necessary for the purposes outlined above.</p><p> We are making sure that appropriate protections are in place for the sharing of data, for data sharing agreements, for the safeguarding of data and for directions, guidelines, standards and regulations.  This is obviously not a position any of us want to be in.  Traffic cameras are an essential tool for managing traffic.  Come December, it will be necessary to have primary legislation in place to enable them to be used in a way which protects data in an appropriate manner.  I hope the committee will appreciate that we reacted promptly to this matter as soon as it came to our attention and that we have developed the necessary proposals here to address it.  In fact, it might have been a Limerick case that prompted this need for legislation before 6 December.  It is a highly sensitive issue.  It is important that we get the regulations right and that we respect the need for privacy as contained within the GDPR but also that we do not have an unenforceable use of cameras, which would be the case if we did not legislate.</p></speech>

I presume everything that is being proposed here has been run by the Data Protection Commissioner or the Attorney General for compliance with GDPR.  There is always a concern in regard to data gathering.  The Minister might give us a sense of how we have come to this position and if he is satisfied this legislation will stand the test of time and will not fail any pushback in that regard from the Data Protection Commissioner.  In addition, does this apply to Garda speed cameras or not?</p> <p>  I take the point in regard to cameras on the roads collecting data.  I previously raised the issue that road users have cameras in vehicles or when cycling.  With regard to the admissibility of video footage of near-passing incidents, I know it is admissible in a very simple and user-friendly way in other jurisdictions but we do not seem to have been able to put those systems in place here.  I would have thought that if ever there was an opportunity to do it, this is the perfect time to at least make some progress in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022062200002#M00300"><p>With regard to the use of cameras to manage and monitor traffic, I understand the authorities have to be given the clearance to do that.  Does the term &ldquo;fixed system&rdquo; apply to the CCTV cameras that are used in buses in order to keep bus lanes clear?  I completely understand the issue around data protection.  However, as a cyclist, I have experienced close passes and while I do not have a camera on my helmet, many cyclists do.  There is the ability to upload and send those data to the Garda or whoever it might be.  We all frequently witness very poor traffic management and behaviour in our towns and villages, such as illegal parking on footpaths and in disability bays.  Do we have the opportunity here to expand the use of cameras for managing and monitoring traffic to allow citizens who observe traffic offences to upload this to the Garda?  I understand the photograph itself may not be an admissible piece of evidence in order to take a prosecution but it will allow the Garda to build up a pattern, for example, if they are getting 40 photographs a week of illegal parking in a certain area.  While the photograph itself may not be used directly, the accumulation of photographs kept by the Garda would inform it of traffic offences that are happening regularly.  I believe many people would like to be able to report those types of traffic offences.</p></speech>

It is important that we recognise the full power of citizen-led data gathering, notwithstanding the concerns around GDPR, which we have to take seriously.  It seems to me there is an opportunity here to create, as other jurisdictions have done very effectively, a portal where citizens can upload evidence, whether it is admissible or not.  As Deputy Matthews noted, there is value in uploading that kind of evidence to a central system and that value may go as far as taking action against individual motorists and road users.  While it seems to fit in here and is something we should be seriously considering, it is not in the provisions of the Bill.  Also not in the provisions is the possibility of doing what is done in other jurisdictions, namely, having cameras on buses to pick out the bad behaviour of motorists and other road users.  That is something we should also try to get into this important legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1483" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022062200002#M00500"><p>I welcome this work on behalf of the Minister and his colleagues in allowing for the greater use of CCTV in how we manage traffic on our roads and make our roads safer for all road users.  I think we should be very ambitious in how we move forward in this particular area, as others have mentioned, in replicating the good work of other jurisdictions.  One of those jurisdictions quite close to us, just across the Irish Sea, has successfully put in place a portal for the uploading of dashcam evidence and camera evidence from all road users, not alone cyclists but also motorists and others.</p><p>It is also important, as others have mentioned, that cameras are used within buses and bus lanes in general to ensure they are the most efficient way of moving people about, particularly in more heavily trafficked towns and cities.</p><p> I recently asked the Minister for Justice a parliamentary question about the creation of a portal for the uploading of dashcam evidence.  The Minister's response was somewhat neutral but reasonably supportive.  It referred to the Department of Transport, stating, "The Department of Transport has advised that any decision to allow film by members of the public to be used in evidence in road traffic cases would raise questions of reliability of, and possible tampering with, the apparatus used, as well as potential privacy issues."  This will hopefully address some of the privacy issues.  The fact of the matter is the Garda has sought and secured numerous successful prosecutions in our courts over the last four to five years using camera evidence submitted by cyclists.  There is already a provision within legislation, due to good work done by the Minister's predecessor Shane Ross, creating a unique offence of dangerous overtaking of a cyclist.  That legislation, combined with camera evidence submitted by cyclists, has already provided for the successful prosecution of a number of motorists with penalty points issued and fines imposed.  There is no question about the reliability of this evidence.  The courts have already decided it is perfectly acceptable to use that evidence in the prosecution of such cases.  I implore the Minister and his colleagues to engage amongst themselves and with the Department of Justice to provide for such a portal under the very significant road safety plan recently published by the Road Safety Authority and the Department, Towards Vision Zero.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.533" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022062200002#N00200"><p>This is a critical issue for us as policymakers and legislators.  Digital video CCTV cameras are increasingly prevalent and full of potential, as well as risks.  We need to be careful in getting the balance right between the requirement for privacy and the need for good enforcement of road safety and other measures.  There was extensive consultation with the Office of the Attorney General on these provisions regarding CCTV cameras because it had a central role in assessing some of the recent court cases and advising us on the steps we are taking.  We have also referred the matter to the Data Protection Commission and will have to continue to do so very extensively because it has a critical role in making sure whatever regulations are put in place get that balance right between the right to privacy and the protections needed in the sharing of data.  This legislation solely relates to cameras operated by TII and local authorities, for whatever purposes.  It does not relate to personal private cameras and how they might be used in evidence.  That is a matter for the Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There will be evolving legislation in that area and the Minister for Justice is working on that.  This does not relate to Garda cameras or cameras other than the ones operated by TII and local authorities.</p> <p>  This is a step in the right direction.  It gives certainty around the use of these cameras but it does not address the wider fundamental issues raised here.  I understand the potential benefits from the use of personal cameras, and prosecutions on the back of that, but I have some concerns about this in a world where AI capabilities and other mechanisms are being used.  Concerns around the erosion of personal privacy are real and we have to get the balance right in how we use this technology.  What we are doing here primarily relates to traffic management.  While faces or numberplates may occasionally be seen, this legislation does not carry those risks of breaching people's privacy.  The regulations we will create in conjunction with the Data Protection Commissioner will give us assurance in that regard and we will not do it without that reassurance.</p> <p>  With regard to the wider issue of the use of personal and-or Garda cameras, I would be slightly nervous about adopting what the UK or other countries are doing .  There are real concerns about some basic rights and privacy concerns about how cameras may be used in certain other jurisdictions.  We have to be careful that we do not inadvertently bring in other effects that are not in the minds of Deputies here.  We are working with the Department of Justice on this matter and will continue to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.534" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1483" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022062200002#N00300"><p>I agree with the Minister.  With emerging AI technology and deepfake videos, there is potential for abuse.  There is no question about that.  However, the overarching concern here should be the safety of all our road users and particularly the vulnerable ones.  If we already have a justice system and a police force that has successfully used such evidence in prosecutions, we should all share the ambition to open up that opportunity to all road users so they feel equally safe and entitled to a safe space on our public roads.  The issue is very straightforward.  It is a matter of the mechanism whereby people can submit the evidence and how it is assessed and treated by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In some stations around the country there are consistent and successful prosecutions and a very supportive environment for people who submit such evidence, while in other stations there is a dismissive attitude or garda&iacute; who are not even aware of the law on the safe overtaking of cyclists.  It is something we need to be cognisant of and concerned about as we move forward.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting that if I went out and took a picture of the Minister's numberplate or car, or somebody's car parked on the footpath, that in itself would be evidence enough for the Garda to pursue a prosecution.  People get increasingly frustrated by these traffic offences, which they witness daily.  They might be walking to school with children in the morning and find the footpath constantly blocked.  I am talking about the opportunity for people and citizens to take those photographs.  That would provide a very strong indicator to the Garda, the local authority and TII, or whoever it may be, that there is a problem in this location.  It is not about getting that individual offender but highlighting that this is a problematic area and having evidence to back it up, as the various bodies would have received a lot of photographic evidence of potential offences taking place.  Is that something we could include in this legislation?  It is not a justice matter but a traffic management and monitoring matter.</p></speech>

However, I think we all agree that some of the behaviours we see on our roads are quite terrible.  Just last week, I was nearly killed on the quays in Dublin.  We come across these near misses every time we walk, cycle or even drive.  In getting that balance right, we need to understand just how bad behaviour actually is on our roads.  There are so many near misses and people do not get home safely or alive.  We seriously need to look at this.  This is a huge opportunity for this Oireachtas to take a brave step forward.  Of course we need to understand the privacy concerns but we should be true to those people who have been injured or killed on our roads because of endemic bad behaviour over the years.  There is an opportunity to do that in this legislation and we should look at it more closely.  I would be happy for the Minister to come back with proposals on Report Stage.</p></speech>

That is not acceptable.  I was just asking the officials about this.  My understanding is that the regulations introduced by Shane Ross in the previous Administration have been commenced but I do not believe there has been any enforcement of them.</p><p>I would not mind getting some background information so we can come back on Report Stage as to what has happened with that legislation.  We pass legislation and think the problem is solved but it may not have led to convictions or changed behaviours.  I would not mind reviewing the analysis as part of this conversation.  It is difficult for us to solve the entire issue around this.  The way the legislation is drafted relating to cameras for TII and local authorities is a step in the right direction.  We have to introduce the legislation by 6 December.  It will take some time to get the balance right in the criminal justice system as to how we use cameras effectively.  I am nervous about trying to solve all problems in this one piece of law but I would like to see what impact that legislation has had.</p></speech>

Section 46 amends section 44(6)(iii) of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to provide that the NTA cannot be interpreted as stepping into the role of a local authority under section 178 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The section also provides for the insertion of a new subsection 6A into section 44 of the 2008 Act, which relates to the requirement to acquire lands by agreement or by means of a compulsory purchase order for the purpose of mitigating the impact of any public transport infrastructure on the environment generally, any particular site, building or structure, the availability of parking, or trees and landscaping.  Following advice from the Attorney General, it is proposed to amend section 46 of the Bill in order to bring more clarity to the new section 44(6A) of the DTA Act 2008.  I propose to insert the words &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of subsection 6(ii)&rdquo; at the start of the new section 44(6A).</p><p>This amendment is intended to make clear that this power is without prejudice to existing powers in the Act, given that the NTA already has general powers to acquire land under section 44(6)(ii) of the DTA Act.  The current wording of section 46 of the Bill provides that a power exists to relocate or replace the items listed in the section, if necessary with a similar but not identical equivalent, if they need to be demolished or removed in order to provide the necessary public transport infrastructure.  The Attorney General has advised that this provision should be reworded by way of an amendment which provides for a specific reference to a power to compulsorily acquire land for the purpose of any mitigation whatsoever, while removing specific references to relocating or replacing existing buildings.</p><p>The amendment will still permit compulsory purchase for the purpose of relocating or replacing buildings, but it will not highlight that purpose in order to avoid unreasonable demands being placed on the NTA, with the consequential risk of judicial review if those unreasonable demands are refused.  I might go on to the other amendments.</p></speech>

We are inserting a new section 13(7A), which will allow a road authority the power to carry out works to reduce, increase or modify specified items within an existing road or forming part of a road, which may be necessary for the reconfiguration of the road.  This is essential for the BusConnects project, given the need for core bus corridors, which will require the power to reconfigure some roads.</p> <p>  Section 13(8) is being amended to clarify the powers of the road authority in relation to works on, in, under, or over a road and provides clarity regarding the position on changes to pipes or other similar infrastructure that may currently be considered to be under the road, rather than forming part of the road.  This section updates section 13(8) to allow for any structure or infrastructure to be provided on, in, under or over a road, including for the charging of electric vehicles and the provision of information to road users.</p> <p>  The amendments simply reflect the existing practice in relation to maintenance and improvement of public roads and the installation of infrastructure beneath public roads.  The items listed in this amendment to 13(8) are those required to be undertaken in relation to BusConnects and in respect of which there appears to be a current gap in terms of spelling out these powers of a road authority to undertake these works, which exist as a matter of course for other undertakers.</p> <p>  The insertion of a new subsection (11) provides that subsection (10) of section 13 of the Roads Act will not be applicable to the NTA when it is exercising the powers of a road authority in accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  Section 13(10) provides that a road authority can give consent to a person to undertake specific actions in relation to a road, subject to such conditions, restrictions or requirements as the road authority thinks fit.</p> <p>  Given that the authority is exercising the powers of a road authority in accordance with subsection (2)(b) or (5)(a) of section 44 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, but is not a road authority, it was considered that section 13(10) should not apply to the NTA, as to apply that section could lead to the authority having to apply to the road authority for consent.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 64 deletes "mitigating" and substitutes "taking any measure whatsoever that may be reasonably required to mitigate, directly or indirectly,".  It gives the NTA and the BusConnects team responsible for delivery greater flexibility in the measures they take.  I dealt with that at some length in the description I gave.</p></speech>

Are we talking about places within Dublin or does the range go outside Dublin?  That is the first question.  Second, it seems to give compulsory purchase power to the authority to mitigate the impact of public transport infrastructure by purchasing land.  I would argue it should include active travel infrastructure as well.  It applies, for example, if there is an impact on the availability of parking.  I am not sure that power is consistent with what we are trying to achieve.  We cannot say parking is being removed here and we will provide it in some other place and acquire somebody's land to do so.  This could be looked at.</p></speech>

While the legislative provisions on what the NTA can do in Dublin differ from those setting out what it can do in other cities like Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick, I understand that the Bill will provide it the same flexibility in BusConnects projects in those cities as it has in Dublin.  The NTA has a different remit outside the greater Dublin area.  For example, it has a remit over the development and deployment of the greater Dublin area transport strategy, but it does not have quite the same legislative powers in respect of the authorities in Limerick and elsewhere.  My understanding from the officials is that the flexibility we are creating in this Bill to deliver bus corridors will apply in those cities in the same way as it does in Dublin.</p></speech>

I am not sure that this is something that we should be empowering road authorities to do.  Notwithstanding that point, it seems to me that this power should extend to active travel infrastructure as well as public transport infrastructure.</p></speech>

BusConnects is probably misnamed and should be "Sustainable Mobility Connects".  This is not just about providing better services.  It is also about providing safer and quicker cycling and pedestrian environments and better public rail, enhancing local communities and providing commuting services.  This is not just about bus infrastructure.  It is about managing the carriageway for a variety of road users, including pedestrians.</p> <p>  What was the Deputy's first question?</p></speech>

The BusConnects projects that I have seen to date require flexibility in certain instances.  Sometimes, this is to relocate parking.  At other times, it is to restrict parking.  I have yet to see a BusConnects proposal that involves a major increase in on-street parking facilities.  I see this legislative provision as giving the flexibility to adapt as opposed to creating a large increase in parking infrastructure.</p></speech>

This provision goes further, though, and gives the power to acquire private land in order to provide parking.  That is a step too far and is not consistent with reallocating road space in public space.  I would not like it if my front garden was commandeered to replace some parking that was lost as a-----</p></speech>

The first BusConnects projects are going through the planning system in Dublin as we speak.  We are already starting to see some of the benefits even before the core corridor infrastructure changes.  With the introduction of the H-spine to Howth, the C-spine to Lucan and others, for example, we are seeing increased patronage, better services and so on.  We have often seen an inability to deliver infrastructure, particularly in a timely manner.  We are restricted in what can be done and everything is subject to such judicial review that nothing gets done.  This Bill is designed within the proper limits of our planning system and so on to give our local authorities and the NTA the ability to progress what we need to do.</p></speech>

This part of the section looked positive to me.  If an existing building, structure or amenity was removed as part of the development of a public transport project, the local authority would have had the power to replace it.  However, amendment No. 65 is proposing to remove that power.  I would have thought that the paragraph was a positive element of the section.</p></speech>

Section 56 of this new Part concerns functions of the Minister for Transport in respect of zero-to-low-emission vehicles.  This new section, along with the associated amendments in this group, are related to the establishment of an office of low-emission vehicles, as recommended in the electric vehicles policy pathway report that was published last September and mandated under action No. 274 of the Climate Action Plan.  Preparations are under way in my Department to establish this office, to be known as &quot;Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland&quot;, or &quot;ZEVI&quot;, which will play an important role in our transition to zero-emission vehicles.  ZEVI will have a broad remit in support of the Government's goal of achieving almost 1 million electric vehicles, EVs, on Irish roads by 2030 and will play an important role in Ireland's transition to zero-emission vehicles by co-ordinating measures to support the uptake of EVs and the roll-out of charge point infrastructure.  It will work across the government and society to support this transition.  Its operations will include: supports for EV uptake; infrastructure delivery; strategy; and policy lead, including in respect of taxation and regulation, research and innovation, communications and public and stakeholder engagement.  ZEVI will have an objective voice on EVs, providing advice to the public and private sectors and carrying out significant stakeholder engagement.</p><p>Currently, ZEVI's functions are split across four organisations: my Department; the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI; the NTA; and TII.  It is intended that these functions will continue to be delivered by the named organisations but under the umbrella of the new office, which will bring these policy and delivery functions into one hybrid organisation with a single identity and focus to enable delivery of the ambitious EV targets under the Climate Action Plan.</p><p>I anticipate that ZEVI will be established in my Department next month.</p><p>To facilitate the establishment of the office within my Department, the new sections 56(1) and 56(2) give the Minister for Transport new statutory functions in relation to zero- to low-emission vehicles and the related charging and refuelling infrastructure to enable him or her, as the case may be, to establish ZEVI to operate in the EV and infrastructure space.  ZEVI will be mandated to promote and seek to accelerate the uptake of EVs and to promote, increase and develop public awareness of such vehicles and the availability of the related infrastructure to support this uptake.</p><p> In this context, the new section 56(3) sets out a number of actions the Minister for Transport, essentially ZEVI, may take, as required, to achieve these objectives.  The Minister may assist in the provision of recharging and refuelling infrastructure, carry out EV and infrastructure training and research, promote and assist research of new EV technologies, advise on design, standards, accessibility, operation and use of EVs and related infrastructure and, critically, engage with key stakeholders with regard to electricity network development requirements to facilitate EV infrastructure. </p><p> In parallel to the foregoing, amendment No. 61 inserts a new section 45, which in turn amends section 19(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1993 concerning the specific functions of the NRA by inserting a new section 19(1)(cc) to confer a new function on the NRA or, more specifically, TII.  This section will enable TII to prepare schemes for the provision of recharging and refuelling infrastructure for zero to low-emission vehicles in relation to national roads or proposed such roads.  TII will be empowered to provide and maintain this network.  The Minister for Transport may prescribe, by regulation, the vehicles in respect of which one or more refuelling or recharging networks will be delivered by TII.  The purpose of this amendment is to enable TII to deliver EV charging infrastructure on the national roads network in the context of its role as a roads authority</p><p> Government amendment No. 77 provides for the consequent amendment of the Long Title to the Bill arising from the proposed inclusion in the Bill of matters relating to new functions for the Minister for Transport in respect of zero- to low-emission vehicles and related infrastructure.</p></speech>

It is a positive amendment.  I do not need to list the benefits of electric vehicles, especially with regard to emissions.  This refers to carbon emissions but we also have to consider air pollution and noise pollution.  I wonder if there is an opportunity to address within the Bill the issue of internal combustion engines idling.  It is particularly problematic where vehicles are congregating around schools.  Is there an opportunity in the Bill to address the issue of leaving engines idling for periods of time at specific locations?</p> <p>  I have another comment.  In encouraging the uptake of electric vehicles, which rolling out the network will do, we have to ensure that we are not encouraging extra-large electric vehicles onto our roads.  These take up an unnecessary amount of space and the extra weight they carry makes them less efficient.  There seems to be a general move among car purchasers in Ireland to go for those larger vehicles.  This is probably more of a policy issue than something to cover within legislation but there are probably legislative changes that could be made to disincentivise the purchase of unnecessarily large EVs and to encourage the purchase of much more suitable EVs for personal use.</p></speech>

I welcome the amendment.  There might be an opportunity to go a bit further.  Electric bikes and cargo bikes are electric vehicles as well.  We could get into that space.  Deputy Matthews talked about smaller and lighter vehicles.  The main driving force - pardon the pun - with respect to vehicular transport should be the smaller, the lighter and the slower.  There are all kinds of very good reasons to go in that direction and I believe we can go a little bit further here.  If the Minister is agreeable, we might come back with some proposals on Report Stage.</p> <p>  In this section, section 45, there is an interesting part on An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It states that it "shall approve a scheme, or a proposed road development, that contravenes materially any development plan or any local area plan [...] only if it considers that one of the following is the case:" before listing four scenarios, any one of which can apply.  The first is that "the scheme or proposed road development is of strategic, regional or national importance".  The second is that "there are conflicting objectives in the development plan or the objectives are not clearly stated, insofar as the scheme or proposed road development is concerned".  The third relates to the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the regional, spatial and economic strategy for the area and any statutory obligations therein.  The fourth is that "the scheme or proposed road development should be approved having regard to the pattern of development, and planning permissions granted, in the area since the making of the development plan."  It seems that there is very wide scope for this to be misinterpreted or applied in a way that is not intended, especially when one considers the stories around An Bord Plean&aacute;la in recent weeks.  With the way An Bord Plean&aacute;la is set up, a great deal of power is vested in very few people.  It seems that this section might cause some difficulty for Ministers down the line.  It should be tightened up so that its intent, which I believe relates to BusConnects, is clear before the legislation is passed by the Houses.</p></speech>

I have a sense of the intent but, all things considered, I am concerned about the possible interpretation of the text, particularly in the context of current goings-on at An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I suggest that it requires a second reading at the very least.  It is something we will look at before Report Stage and we may bring forward amendments but I ask the Minister to reflect on it at this juncture.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.590" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022062200002#Q02000"><p>Deputies raised a variety of different issues.  I will start with the last one.</p><p>As I read it, amendment No. 61 amends that section with regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In section 45(19)(1)(cc), we are saying that we would also "prepare, or arrange for the preparation of, schemes for the provision of a safe and efficient network of recharging infrastructure and refuelling infrastructure for such zero to low emission vehicles as the Minister may prescribe and provide and maintain, or secure the provision and maintenance of, such a network".  That amends the same section the Deputy is concerned about, if I am correct on this.</p><p> I will go back to the wider point about the BusConnects infrastructure we need to deliver.  People will be aware that the Government will have real difficulty in meeting our climate change targets, particularly in transport, which is probably the most challenging area.  One of the mechanisms the Government is developing is the acceleration of certain key areas, one of which is sustainable mobility.  That will require some of the infrastructure we are looking for to be delivered in a very quick timeframe, especially in towns and cities throughout the country.  For that to work, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will have to have a critical role because if the ordinary timeframes it takes for us to deliver infrastructure apply, for example, the cycleway to Clontarf being built at present has been in the planning system or process for almost ten years, we will have to accelerate those timeframes.</p><p> That has been recognised by the Government through a variety of different factors.  We have increased the staffing within the likes of the NTA and our Department to be able to do that work.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has also recognised that An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs enhanced staffing and other resources, especially in the public planning realm and ecology, including the transport planning and marine planning side, to be able to deliver quick decisions, particularly on projects that will be central to meeting our climate targets.  We have set up a special acceleration team to look at this.  We are looking for projects within local authorities throughout the country that might be what could be called pathfinder projects, which can be delivered very quickly at low cost.  Obviously, these have to be within our planning system and planning structures but it will require An Bord Plean&aacute;la to play its part in making sure such decisions are given very quick attention and that it has the resources in place to be able to turn around decisions.  This cannot come from the top down and it cannot ignore local and public interests.  It has to come from the local authorities.  It has to be from the councillors themselves looking at what the examples might be in their towns, cities or villages.</p><p> That transformative approach to accelerate development will characterise where we are at present.  The historical approach, which was very much based on roads and a sprawled, ever-outwards development model, will not work in a low-carbon environment.  The overriding legislation behind all this is our climate law, as well as European law, which requires us to meet these targets.  If we fail to do so in transport, we will have to introduce policy measures to go quicker and faster.  The historical concern the Deputy has would be the case if the situation continues, but it will not be the defining characteristic.</p><p> I will briefly address the issue of idling vehicles raised by Deputy Matthews.  Many of those measures, and some of the regulations, are sometimes best done at European level where, for example, new cars could have mechanisms whereby they are switched off.  Certain cars already do that.  However, the wider reality is, and I expect it will come up at the European Council meeting next week, Europe is moving towards a stage where there will be no new combustion engine vehicles by 2035.  There has to be recognition that we are going towards better electric vehicles.  It would be terrible for us if we just replaced a fossil fuel vehicle fleet with a heavy vehicle fleet that used up a lot of other resources, be those rare earths, lithium or other batteries.  What the Deputy said about the need to make sure we are very efficient in our transport system is true.  It is not just about replacing all of one type of car with another type of car.  As the Deputy said, the characteristics of our current fleet, where almost half the private cars last year were heavy vehicles by any definition, will not work.</p><p> This Bill cannot solve all those problems.  This specific amendment No. 61 relates to the EV charging infrastructure I mentioned, as well as the creation of an EV office.  Those wider concerns are best addressed elsewhere.</p></speech>

It states: "a proposed road development".  It can be seen how in some future scenario this gives An Bord Plean&aacute;la not just the power but creates a requirement to approve a proposed road development that contravenes a development plan or local area plan, if any one of those conditions is satisfied.  That needs to be looked at.</p></speech>

It is still my read of section 45 that it gives significant power to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  To be honest, I thought this was one of the pieces that was going to be substantially amended between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  I will again raise a concern about the potential for unintended consequences.  I suggest the Minister consider the various perspectives that have been raised at the committee.  I also restate that on Report Stage we may table an amendment following consultation with colleagues.</p></speech>

As it currently stands, where does the planning regulator stand in all this?  Has the Attorney General's advice been sought on section 45, given that it states, "An Bord Plean&aacute;la shall approve a scheme, or a proposed road development, that contravenes materially any development plan or any local area plan ... only if it considers that one of the following is the case"?  I would have thought it highly unlikely a local authority would put a proposal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la that contravenes its own development plan.  This is something that will probably come from TII or the Department of Transport.  The section goes on to set out that these conditions are that: "the scheme or proposed road development is of strategic, regional or national importance; (b) there are conflicting objectives in the development plan or the objectives are not clearly stated, insofar as the scheme or proposed road development is concerned; (c) the scheme or proposed road development should be approved having regard to the transport strategy...; (d) the scheme or proposed road development should be approved having regard to the pattern of development, and planning permissions granted, in the area since the making of the development plan."  What is the purpose behind this section?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-22a.597" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022062200002#R00700"><p>The main purpose is to support the NTA rather than TII.  On the various roles, as was mentioned earlier, TII has a key strategic role in the national roads network and the likes of delivering major rail projects and greenways.  The key purpose of this whole section is around the provision of sustainable mobility measures in our cities.  As I said, that will be a critical role of the NTA and the local authorities, which are key.  We will not force it from the top down.  The funding will be made available to those local authorities that want to be proactive.  There may be specific examples, however, although only in very limited circumstances, where An Bord Plean&aacute;la may decide.  The section could be read in different ways, but the way it is drafted reflects the need to give An Bord Plean&aacute;la such powers where "the scheme or proposed road ... is of strategic, regional or national importance".  The key strategic national objectives we now have to deliver are the reduction in emissions, the increase in the shifting modes-----</p></speech>

Those plans go before the national planning regulator - I may not be calling it by the correct name.  In many cases, the regulator is coming back with, in effect, certain issues with development plans.  That body has a major input.  If there is a particular thing from the NTA, and a plan that has been overseen by the planning regulator nationally, how does that sit with a body such as the NTA making a proposal that contravenes a development plan, when we now have a national regulator that has significant input into all development plans?</p><p>It is really just a question in terms of practical input.  Does Deputy Matthews wish to come in?</p></speech>

The way it reads to me, I understand that one of either options (a), (b), (c) or (d), applies.  The language is quite strong in saying the board "shall approve a scheme".  I think either option (a), (b), (c) or (d) should be covered by a caveat saying this scheme does not contribute to increasing emissions or does not encourage disproportionate private vehicle use.  Something should cover that off.  It can be any one of option (a), (b), (c) or (d) but it also needs to have the cover of saying this scheme will not increase transport emissions excessively or whatever the wording might be.  That might be something that should be looked at.</p></speech>

It is desirable that we address this opportunity to make sure BusConnects projects are not left out.  This is to make sure we can actually deliver those sustainable mobility projects.</p> <p>  In determining any application for approval under section 51 of the Roads Act, boards must have regard to development and local area plans.  If the BusConnects project infrastructure is not contemplated by the relevant development plans and local authority board, it could be seen as being in contravention of such plans.  It is just to make sure.</p> <p>  I want us to be able to deliver the sustainable mobility BusConnects infrastructure in a timely manner and make sure An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not constrained in that regard.  That is the reason.  The Attorney General's office was central in advising, supporting and recommending some of these suggestions to make sure we do not have any gap in the capability.</p></speech>

No. 5 of 2003) (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;Principal Regulations&rdquo;) shall not have statutory effect pursuant to that section and shall be deemed to have been validly made under sections 5, 11, 12 and 13 of the Act of 1961, sections 8, 10 and 11 of the Road Traffic Act 1968 and section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 on the date those Regulations were purported to be made. <blockquote> 	(2) Notwithstanding section 5(1) of the European Communities Act 2007, the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 2004 (S.I. No. 99 of 2004) shall not have statutory effect pursuant to that section and shall be deemed to have been validly made under sections 5 and 11 of the Act of 1961 and section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 on the date those Regulations were purported to be made.<br /><br />(3) Subject to <i>subsections (4)</i>and <i>(5)</i>, all regulations amending the Principal Regulations made before the coming into operation of this section shall be deemed to have been validly made on the date those Regulations were purported to be made.<br /><br />(4) The Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 2015 (S.I. No. 136 of 2015) shall be deemed to have been validly made under sections 11 and 12 of the Act of 1961 and section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 on the date those Regulations were purported to be made.<br /><br />(5) The Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 2018 (S.I. No. 23 of 2018) shall be deemed to have been validly made under sections 5, 11 and 12 of the Act of 1961, sections 8, 10 and 11 of the Road Traffic Act 1968 and section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 on the date those Regulations were purported be made.<br /><br />(6) Every act done, or purporting to have been done, under the Principal Regulations before the date of coming into operation of this section shall be deemed to be, and always to have been, valid and effectual for all purposes.<br /><br />(7) If <i>subsection (6)</i>would, but for this subsection, conflict with a constitutional right of any person, the operation of that subsection shall be subject to such limitation as is necessary to secure that it does not so conflict but shall otherwise be of full force and effect.&rdquo;. </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>Some of the amendments have, on reflection, been substantive.  I think the debate has been very useful and very good.  This amendment is more on the technical nature.  Amendment No. 76 is designed to address an irregularity in the enabling provisions for certain road traffic regulations with regard to the construction and use of vehicles, that is, the maximum weights and dimensions permitted for vehicles driven on our roads.  Based on advice from the Attorney General's office and my Department&rsquo;s legal advisers, I am proposing to insert new text to state that the construction and use of vehicles regulations made between 2003 and 2007, and those made in 2015 and 2018, do not have statutory effect and were validly made under the Road Traffic Acts, including section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 2006.  This change confers the appropriate <i>vires </i>to give effect to European legislation and allows us to make further amendments to those regulations from time to time as needed.</p><p>As I said, it is a purely technical amendment and so does not itself imply any change to broader policy in the area.  Our next steps, once this has come into effect, will be to transpose European regulations to allow an increase in permitted weights for zero-emission vehicles as part of our ongoing efforts to support the switch away from fossil fuels.</p><p>Amendment No. 78 follows this with a consequential change to the Long Title of the Bill.  A gap has been seen in the implementation of EU directives and this is an opportunity to clean it up.</p></speech>

As the Minister is aware, it is an issue that I am very passionate about.  The legislation will make a real difference to the lives of people living in my area.  Is the Minister in a position to give a commitment on the timeframe of the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  Is it the Minister's intention that the Bill will come to us on Report Stage before the summer recess?  Is that possible?</p></speech>

I think we made significant progress today and the debate was very useful.  I commend my officials on their work on the legislation.  I would like to get the Bill through the D&aacute;il and the Seanad before the summer recess, if at all possible.  The scrambler bike situation is unacceptable and needs to be addressed.  The fact that there is illegal use of e-scooters all over the place needs to be addressed.  The database will provide real assistance to the garda&iacute; in reducing road accidents and improving road safety.  The legislation needs to be implemented.  I am very pleased that we got through Committee Stage today.  I would like to get to Report Stage as soon as possible, and to get the Bill into the Seanad straight away.</p></speech>

The issue is of huge concern in the public domain.  I assume that the Minister sought advice from the Attorney General on section 34.  I ask the Minister to work on it prior to Report Stage.  The issue is very much in the public consciousness.  It is all about safety.  We all want to move towards a green agenda, but in as safe a way possible.</p></speech>
