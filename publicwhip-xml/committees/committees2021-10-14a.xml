After lunch, we will consider correspondence and other business of the committee.  The engagement with the witnesses will focus on the appropriation account for Vote 29 and chapter 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's accounts re remediation of landfill sites.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials: Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department; Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in, assistant secretary, communications; Mr. Fergal Mulligan, national broadband plan programme manager; Mr. Robert Deegan, principal officer, energy division; Mr. Philip Nugent, assistant secretary, natural resources and waste; and Ms Catherine McGinty, assistant principal officer, finance unit.  We are also joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Ken Cleary, principal officer in the environment, climate and communications Vote section of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references speakers may make to other persons.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the precincts of Leinster House is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, a number of today's witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside Leinster House's precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as those physically present.  Witnesses have already been advised of this and may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-14a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021101400002#A00900"><p>The appropriation account for Vote 29, Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, indicates gross expenditure of &euro;428 million was incurred in 2020.  This was distributed across five diverse expenditure programmes of varying size.  The largest expenditure programme related to energy, accounting for &euro;204 million, or 48%, of the total spent in 2020.  A total of &euro;127 million was expended on energy efficiency programmes promoted by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, a decrease of 16% when compared with the expenditure outturn in 2019.  The 2020 energy programme also includes expenditure of &euro;50 million for the purchase of statistical transfers from other EU member states as a result of a shortfall in the achievement of Ireland's 2020 obligations under the renewable energy directive.  Provision has been made in the 2021 Estimate for further statistical transfer purchases.</p> <p>  Expenditure on the communications programme in 2020 was just under &euro;89 million, which was significantly less than the amount provided for the year of almost &euro;158 million.  Expenditure on the information and communications technology programme, at &euro;53 million, was only around half the level provided for, due to delayed deployment of the national broadband plan, NBP, network.  Given the scale of the plan, it would be useful for the Department to consider giving it its own subhead in the future.</p> <p>  The Department spent more than &euro;81 million of voted funds on the environment and waste management programme in 2020.  More than half of the voted expenditure went to support the operations of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  In addition to the voted expenditure, the Department spent just under &euro;17 million on environmental projects and initiatives from the separate environment fund in 2020.  The Department spent almost &euro;33 million under the inland fisheries programme and just over &euro;21 million on a range of services covered by the natural resources programme.</p> <p>  Receipts that could be used by the Department to support its voted expenditure amounted to &euro;13 million in 2020.  The surplus remaining unspent at year end was just over &euro;101 million.  With the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department was able to carry over &euro;38 million in unspent capital funding to 2021.  The balance of &euro;63 million was surrendered to the Exchequer.  In addition, the Department transferred directly to the Exchequer &euro;123 million it received in regard to the operations of the EU emissions trading system, as disclosed in note 4.3.</p> <p>  Members may wish to note that the Department was responsible for the oversight of a broad range of public sector bodies, including regulators and a number of major commercial State bodies that do not receive ongoing grant funding.  The bodies are listed in an appendix to the appropriation account.</p> <p>  Chapter 9 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2019 reports on the findings of an examination of the costs associated with landfill remediation.  Landfill is no longer used as a general strategy for waste disposal and, at the end of 2019, just three landfill sites continued in operation.  However, historical sites continue to pose environmental risks and may require monitoring and expensive remediation.  Costs incurred by the Vote associated with landfill remediation amounted to &euro;12 million in 2020.</p> <p>  As at July 2020, a total of 611 landfill sites had been identified in the State.  They comprise 117 sites licensed and regulated by the EPA since March 1997 and 494 unregulated landfill sites recorded on a national register.  More than 70% of the unregulated sites are pre-1997 local authority-operated landfills, approximately 21% are privately operated sites and just over 8% are identified illegal landfill sites.</p> <p>  The EPA monitors environmental risk factors on an ongoing basis at the 117 landfill sites it regulates.  The agency does not monitor environmental risk factors at the unregulated landfills but has a role in authorising proposed plans for their remediation.  At the time the report was being completed, 152 sites operated by local authorities pre-March 1997 had been assessed as being of either moderate or high risk for the environment.  Remediation plans to address the environmental risks identified had been submitted to the EPA in respect of 19% of those sites, and certificates of authorisation to commence remediation had been issued in respect of only 11, or 7% of the total.</p> <p>  By the end of 2019, the Department had provided more than &euro;158 million under a grant scheme for assisting remediation of 122 landfill sites.  This included &euro;52 million contributed from the Vote for the remediation of a site at Haulbowline Island in Cork Harbour.  An additional &euro;25 million was spent on this project under the marine Vote.  The Department had spent &euro;33.5 million on the remediation of two large landfill sites, at Kerdiffstown in Kildare and Kilconnell in Galway, and further significant expenditure was anticipated.  Both of those landfill sites were formerly privately operated under EPA licences but are now being managed by the respective local authorities.</p> <p>  Financial provision arrangements as part of EPA licensing of private operators are intended to ensure there will be sufficient resources available, without recourse to public funds, to pay for restoration and aftercare costs when landfill sites close, or when pollution incidents occur during operation.</p><p>Financial provision arrangements as part of EPA licensing of private operators are intended to ensure that there will be sufficient resources available, without recourse to public funds, to pay for restoration and aftercare costs when landfill sites close or when pollution incidents occur during operation.  Kilconnell landfill is an example of where the financial provision arrangement in place failed to provide the funds required to meet closure and aftercare costs.  Instead, the Department has had to fund substantial costs associated with the closure, remediation and ongoing monitoring of the site.</p><p> The report includes recommendations for the Department to review the governance and oversight arrangements for landfill sites, ensure the completion of outstanding risk assessments for all sites and develop medium-term estimates of the future costs associated with landfill remediation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-14a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021101400002#B00300"><p>Many thanks to the Chairman and the committee for the invitation today.   As the committee will be aware, the Department in its current form was established following the reconfiguration of a number of Departments by Government in June 2020, and a transfer of functions order was made in September 2020 formally assigning the broadcasting and media functions to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. The 2020 income and expenditure relating to those functions are included in the appropriation account for that Department in Vote 33.</p> <p>  Total gross expenditure under the Vote in 2020 amounted to &euro;428 million, some 21% or &euro;113 million below the budgetary allocation of &euro;541 million, which included capital carryover.  The Covid-19 pandemic impacted expenditure across all programme areas of the Department in 2020, and, in particular, the communications and energy programmes, which had savings of &euro;69 million and &euro;14 million, respectively.  The impact of the pandemic is also reflected in reduced output and spend across these programmes in 2021.</p> <p>  The Department and its agencies played an important role throughout the pandemic by ensuring the continuity of critical infrastructure and by putting in place measures to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on businesses and individuals.  Staff in the Department continued to deliver on major business priorities during 2020, some of which are set out in the briefing note provided to the committee, with a more comprehensive list of activity and outputs contained in the Department&rsquo;s annual report for 2020, which has been published.</p> <p>  Our agencies also played a key role in supporting businesses and citizens.  An Post, for example, kept its network of more than 900 post offices open, fulfilling an important commercial and social role to communities.  ComReg worked closely with telecommunications operators to ensure that the necessary measures and plans were put in place by networks to manage and handle the surge in voice and data traffic with offices, schools and third-level institutions shut and those activities taking place in the home.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, put temporary measures in place to strengthen the protections in place for energy consumers.</p> <p>  The Department secured additional funding in 2020 for the trading online voucher scheme as part of the Government&rsquo;s Covid-19 business supports package for small businesses.  This was to meet the increased demand from businesses that found themselves unable to trade physically and had to move their businesses online.  In 2020, &euro;21 million was spent on the scheme, of which &euro;18.5 million can be directly attributed as Covid-19-related spend.  Approximately 13,000 vouchers, which is ten times the number approved in 2019, were awarded and more than 28,000 small businesses benefitted from the training, advice and support provided by local enterprise offices, LEO, as part of the scheme.  Usage of eircode postcodes, which had been trending significantly upwards in recent years, jumped significantly in 2020 to almost 28 million look-ups compared to 19 million in 2019.  A significant part of this increase is a result of the shift to online shopping last year.  We have seen a further significant increase of 24% over the first eight months of 2021.</p> <p>  The year 2020, which was the first year of the national broadband plan, NBP, contract, saw a significant level of mobilisation activity by National Broadband Ireland, NBI, including recruitment of personnel, procurement of materials and contractors, installation of equipment in exchanges, building IT systems to support the network and undertaking surveys and designs, which were progressed right across the country to inform the build programme, resulting in the first homes being connected to the new fibre network in January of this year in County Cork.</p> <p>  The roll-out of the NBP has, however, been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  While telecommunications activity was deemed essential work under Covid-19, activities relating to network build generally involve multiple-person crews.  The onset of significant Covid-19 case numbers and the implications for close contacts severely impacted NBI&rsquo;s ability to have crews operating during certain periods in 2020 and 2021.</p> <p>  The Department has worked closely with NBI to put a remedial plan in place to address delays experienced to the NBP roll-out.  Under this plan, NBI is implementing a number of measures to help lessen the impact, including increasing the level of throughput in the eir make-ready programme and bringing additional resources into NBI and its subcontractors.</p> <p>  As of 1 October this year, more than 257,000 premises have been surveyed and build works involving more than 108,000 premises are ongoing across the country.  There are now more than 250 staff employed directly by NBI, along with more than 850 contractors throughout the country working on the network design and roll-out.  In addition, 379 broadband connection points have been installed by NBI, including 141 primary schools.  By the end of this year, NBI has forecast that almost 60,000 homes will have been passed and will be able to connect to the network.</p> <p>  Works under the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, energy schemes were also impacted by Covid-19 restrictions, particularly between March and June 2020, when activity paused in line with public health and Government guidelines.  Almost &euro;79 million was spent on energy efficiency measures through grants to more than 17,600 homes, 39 community-based projects and 1,615 households at risk of energy poverty.  The first auctions under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, took place in July 2020 and 68 new renewable energy projects, equating to almost 1,100 MW of new electricity generation, received letters of offer.  The Department opened a call for applications to the just transition fund in June 2020 and provisional funding offers were announced in November last year.  While spend in 2020 was low, funding of &euro;30 million has been allocated to more than 60 projects throughout the region in the private sector, local authorities and communities.</p> <p>  Some &euro;48 million was provided to the EPA and &euro;23 million to local authorities for waste management programmes, including &euro;10 million provided through the environment fund.  A Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy was launched in September 2020 as Ireland&rsquo;s new roadmap for waste planning and management.  The plan shifts focus away from waste disposal and looks instead at how we can preserve resources by creating a circular economy.</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;12 million was provided in 2020 for landfill remediation.  As set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s chapter, the landfill remediation programme was set up in 2006 to address the findings of the 2005 European Court of Justice, ECJ, judgment against Ireland.  Fifteen years on from that judgment, we are now in a very different context in terms of our waste management performance.</p> <p>  The ECJ case itself was closed in 2015 as Ireland was considered to have made sufficient progress in implementing a programme of measures agreed with the European Commission.  There are now just three active landfills in Ireland that accept municipal waste, down from 126 at the time the proceedings were first brought by the Commission.  Our recycling rate was less than 5% in 1998 but now stands at approximately 40%, and 92% of municipal waste was sent to landfill  whereas only 14% was landfilled in 2018.  Having been found to be breach of our core obligations under the waste framework directive, we are now meeting or are on course to meet all of our EU objectives in this area.</p> <p>  Since the 2019 Comptroller and Auditor General chapter, important structural and administrative changes have been applied to the management and governance of the landfill remediation programme and these will deliver results in a more streamlined and accountable manner in the coming years.  In 2020, for the first time, expenditure under the scheme exceeded the budget allocated. The Comptroller and Auditor General made three recommendations in his report and implementing measures to address the recommendations are being incorporated into the management of the programme.</p> <p>  I look forward to assisting the committee members with any questions they may have today.</p></speech>

What steps have been taken?  This does not draw too far into policy because it is about protecting the State from vulnerabilities and protecting the risk to the State.  The Senate intelligence committee in US is considering prohibiting ransomware payments generally from private companies, as much as for any other entity.  This would prohibit payment of ransom to ransomware attacks.  Has the Department considered that as a protective response to reduce the potential cost vulnerability to the State, as well as the rest of the vulnerability?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-14a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021101400002#C00200"><p>I will step back a bit.  When one looks at what happened earlier this year with the HSE attack, an important decision was taken straight away that we would not entertain the payment of a ransom to the group that initiated this criminal act against the HSE.  That was recognised as a positive step right across the EU and internationally.  Ireland was complimented in setting that out as a red line in dealing with this particular issue.  What the Deputy has described is the evolution of cyberpolicy.  It is an evolution.  We are moving through phases where we are seeing significant activity in this sector.  We will take whatever measures are required to ensure that the State, the operators of State infrastructure, private citizens and private businesses are protected to the greatest extent possible in dealing with the issues that we have to contend with, not just in light of the HSE attack but in light of broader issues more generally in cyberspace, such as the types of threats that are emerging.</p> <p>  To revert to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous question, in 2020 a particular vulnerability arose during the massive shift from office-based and business-based work to the home.  A significant degree of disruption was caused to how businesses functioned.  We saw a rapid, significant increase in cyber-incidents right across the State.  We estimate that in 2020, the computer security incident response team, CSIRT-IE, in the NCSC handled about 3,000 cybersecurity incidents.</p></speech>

However, based on the figures for the first three quarters of this year, we expect that that figure will be exceeded over the course of 2021.  We are seeing a gradual increase in activity from the types of organisations that want to do damage to states, to state infrastructure and to private sector companies.  We are responding accordingly.  The Deputy will have seen the decisions that the Government took in July of this year to make sure the NCSC has the capacity to respond to incidents as they arise.</p></speech>

Mr. Griffin mentioned in his letter to us dated 11 August, and I have just repeated it in relation to the schools, that the plan is to roll out high-speed broadband to 679 primary schools.  He said in his opening remarks that this has been done in 141 schools at this point.  I have some quick questions.  Are these radio connections or fibre connections?</p></speech>

Subcontractors are providing the internal service.  For example, we have 379 BCPs connected now, as I said in my opening statement.  Subcontractors provide the service internally to the BCP.  That contract is with Vodafone.</p></speech>

I am not sure whether they have been fully awarded.  We have moved to a situation where NBI will do the connections again, but the subcontracts will be carried out by a range of contractors, as I understand it.  They are being appointed by the Department of Education.  At this stage, of the 379 schools, 141 have been connected.  There will be a cumulative figure of 200 by the end of this year.  The full 679 schools will be connected by the end of 2022.  We have brought that forward.</p></speech>

I thought that it was to be involved.  I thought there were broader issues around the primary schools, particularly around security issues, as well as about filters to weed out inappropriate content getting into schools.  What is the role of HEAnet in all of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-14a.39" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Mulligan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021101400002#C02000"><p>I can answer this.  HEAnet, through the Department of Education, manages and monitors all the networks through the schools to ensure that none of that happens.  Regardless of the contract with NBI, that is their role.  With regard to the build-out of schools, NBI is fully responsible for all 679 schools.  Through that contract with us and NBI, NBI then procures different companies across different parts of Ireland to help them to roll that out, whether its Enet, Viatel or Ripplecom.  Many companies offer it.  At the moment, the majority of schools and BCPs are using an 8.5 high-spec wireless link until the fibre network is fully deployed across the relevant areas.  We should not forget that the schools' BCP initiative was an initiative to get as much done as quickly as possible in every part of Ireland, before the full fibre is rolled out over the next seven years.</p></speech>

I have other questions.  I am not trying to be funny, but I am not sure if his broadband connection is the strongest.  At a recent meeting of the communications committee, the NBI said that the taxpayer is insulated from any inflation or price increase on the NBI roll-out and that it is capped at &euro;2.5 billion.  From the Department&rsquo;s perspective, is that 100% correct?  Are there any variables that might shift that?  Is it a fixed price with no additions?</p></speech>

The original figure was &euro;2.977 billion, including VAT.  We had a VAT decision from Revenue which is &euro;2.7 billion.  That brought the figure back down to &euro;2.7 billion.  That includes contingency pots.  That is the capped maximum.  As NBI said at the committee on 15 September, anything over and above that in terms of the cost of the project, if it ever got to that point, would be a matter for NBI to fund.</p></speech>

That is why I am asking questions in relation to the fixed price.  Obviously, Covid-19 will have some impact on that.  However, we are also aware of considerable supply chain difficulties in the global market at the moment.  There are considerable labour market pressures including and specifically for engineers, which is always a challenge.  Our experience on this committee in relation to variations on a project is considerable.  I refer, for example, to the work that we have done on the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  We understand the level of oversight that is necessary, but that is why I am asking the questions about the fixed price.</p> <p>  Can I go to the point on existing infrastructure that Mr. Griffin made in his August letter to the committee?</p><p>Rural Ireland is a huge focus of the NBP.  My colleague from D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Deputy Devlin, will agree with me that we also have problems in the cities.  Substantial existing infrastructure is held by various councils, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Ervia and the ESB.  I am open to correction, but I read somewhere that Dublin City Council even has a telecoms department.  What is the Department's role in pulling all of those assets together and making them more accessible for the enhancement of the city broadband network?  What is the blueprint for bringing all of the existing infrastructure together that is in the road and is held by State assets?</p></speech>

These are existing State assets in the road, but we still have problems with city broadband.  From the Department's perspective, what is the plan to co-ordinate all of those State assets to bring them into being more quickly so that people in cities have access to better broadband?  It is clearly a challenge.</p></speech>

There is a requirement to do so under EU state aid rules.  Could he refer to the information gathering that we have done over the years in terms of identification of the infrastructure?  He might also have a view on the specific point the Deputy raised about the city.</p></speech>

The focus is on getting them to be able to deploy from the right place at the right time.  Rather than it being a question of there being fibre assets that are being underutilised, it is more about actual physical infrastructure that they want to locate their infrastructure on.</p></speech>

I will take up the point made by my colleague, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, on blackspots across the city and county of Dublin and the greater Dublin area.  We need reassurance that the NBP is going to address those blackspots.  Many consumers have contacted all Deputies, in particular in urban areas.  They are being told by providers that their broadband connection is coming and if they sign up, they will be connected in 12 months but that is not happening.  Whether it is a breakdown or an over-promise by certain providers, are these issues going to be addressed in the short term?</p> <p>  It was stated that 257,000 premises had been surveyed.  The Comptroller and Auditor General thinks there should be a separate subhead for this extensive plan and Mr. Griffin might come back on that as well to say if that is going to be incorporated into this year's accounts.  We need reassurance that Dublin is going to be addressed.</p></speech>

He is correct on that.  We need to carve it out given how over-representative it is on spend under the A3 subhead.  We will look at that between the Abridged Estimates volume that was published yesterday and the Revised Estimates Volume which will be published at the end of the year.  We will talk to our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on that.</p> <p>  We receive multiple parliamentary questions on the blue-amber area in cities.  We attempt to look at the specific premises involved to see if there are commercial operators in the area that intend to provide a service as part of their work programme.  There is a facility within the contract to extract premises that are defined as blue in the existing map and to put them into the amber pot so that they will be catered for under the NBP.  That work is ongoing in consultation with commercial operators.  To the extent required, we will engage with the European Commission on that.  What we have seen in the past year and a bit, since the project kicked off, is that a large number of issues have been raised on the matter and we will respond to that.</p></speech>

It would be good if Mr. Mulligan could organise a deputation for Dublin Deputies on those issues, but that can be for another day.</p> <p>  I will turn to the NCSC and staffing.  A total of 20 new posts were announced in July, following the cyberattack on the HSE in March.  That would bring the total number of staff from 25 to 45.  What progress has been made on their recruitment and on the appointment of a director for the centre?</p></speech>

I looked back at the transcript of our meeting on 22 January and, from memory, we indicated at that stage that we expected to be in a position to appoint a director.  An offer was made, but it was not accepted for a number of reasons which I will not get into.  We have gone back out to the market at a higher salary level.  It was approved by the Government that the incoming director would be appointed at deputy secretary level in the Civil Service, which is &euro;184,000.  We have gone back out, using the Public Appointments Service, to conduct that recruitment exercise.  The closing date for applications is today.</p> <p>  The Public Appointments Service has also appointed an executive service company to assist in the recruitment process and to look internationally at using its own contacts to see-----</p></speech>

It was advertised a number of weeks ago, the closing date is 14 October 2021, which is today's date, with short-listing preliminary interviews to be held in November and, we expect, a final interview, which will be conducted by the Top-Level Appointments Committee, in early December, following which an offer can issue.</p></speech>

Is that not too long a timeframe given the sensitivity and urgency of this position?  I accept that is the role of the Public Appointments Service and not Mr. Griffin.  Given the national and international emphasis following the cyberattack on our health system and, potentially, as mentioned by Mr. Griffin, 3,000 attacks last year and, potentially, an increase on that this year, I would have thought the process of filling a position of that importance, as well as the recruitment of the other staff to bulk up this extremely important centre, would have commenced the day after the position was declined by the other person.

In the interim, we have appointed an acting director of the National Cyber Security Centre.  He is a competent and able individual who has worked in this area since 2012 and worked in the Department in this area since its inception and was deputy director of the national security assessment centre in the Department of the Taoiseach.  He is in place in an acting director capacity.  It is important, when running competitions of this nature at a senior level, that the integrity of the process is protected.</p></speech>

I commend the Department on its work in light of the European Court of Justice ruling in years past and the cost it brought to the State.  In regard to the 494 unregulated sites, what is being done to not only clean them up but to monitor them?  Some of them are causing extreme distress to local residents given their unregulated nature.  I note the Department spent &euro;6.1 million on the environmental fund to local authorities.  How is that being monitored?</p></speech>

We have moved from 126 landfills to 43, have remediated 46 sites and have spent &euro;170 million on that activity.  As rightly pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the chapter presented this morning, there is a great deal more work to be done.  Looking at where we were when the Comptroller and Auditor General issued his report, which I think was September 2020, 21 final certificates of authorisation have issued from the Environmental Protection Agency, which is a further eight, four draft certificates of authorisation decisions are due in 2021, 24 certificates of authorisation applications are pending final decision and a further 20 are expected to be submitted in the coming months.  Progress is being made, but there is a great deal of work to do to address that outstanding issue.  The other important bit is the work identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General as needing to be done, including risk assessments to be undertaken and certificates of authorisation to be prepared by the EPA.  We have put in place a procurement framework, valued at &euro;7 million over a three to four-year period.  This will allow local authorities to draw down from the framework and to point to the sites in their areas in respect of which, based on the section 22 register, they have concerns.  They can then do the risk assessment, identify the nature of the risk as being low, medium or high and identify the nature of the works, if any, to remediate so that we can constantly over the next few years move through the process, park the ones that do not represent a risk and focus the resources of the State on remediation of the balance of those that are still causing a problem from an environmental perspective.</p></speech>

The cyberattack was in May.  They had started work on the capacity review pre-Christmas 2020, that is, at the end of 2020.  Having regard to what they see internationally, they would have said this is a core group of staff who are highly skilled and hard-working, with a deep knowledge of the sectors in which they operate, but that there is a need to scale up.  What we have seen since then is the Government response in July of this year, which involves moving from 26 or 27 staff at that stage to 70 within five years.  Money is being provided for this in 2022 and our view is that we need to move more rapidly.  The consultants had said we should go to 41 by the end of next year, and as we have actually said we should add on 20 staff, we will be going about five beyond that.</p> <p>  On foot of the capacity review, and seeing what we are seeing now in the cybersecurity space, we will keep re-looking at this and make calls along the way as to whether what the international consultancies have advised is still fit for purpose in a year&rsquo;s time or two years&rsquo; time.  On the issue of resources for the centre, I know for a fact we will not have a problem in securing additional resources, if that is required.  As of now, we are in a good place in terms of where we need to move to and having clear lines of sight on that.</p></speech>

That is spread across a number of contract milestones and would include payments for procurement of materials, such as fibre, payment of contractors and subcontractors and payments for the survey and design work on the network.  As I mentioned, we have 250,000 premises surveyed on current figures and 220,000 designs.</p><p>Those are the current figures.  Moneys would have been paid for the successful completion of deployment areas.  In addition, as I mentioned, 110,000 premises are under construction, 7,000 premises are ready for service, a further 10,000 are at the pre-order stage and 376 BCPs have been connected.  Effectively, therefore, that is payment for work done and as set out in the contract, which clearly defines what the company gets paid for.</p></speech>

There are 227 deployment areas up and down the country.  NBI gets paid in respect of each individual deployment area for the successful design upfront of that area and then for the successful completion of the build past premises.  The company also gets payments for connecting premises.  Those are the three most substantial payment criteria.  The Department oversees the design of the network.  The design of the network means ensuring all the equipment is in place, as well as the requisite design of the pole and duct network.  That allows the subcontractors and Eircom to have the equivalent of the architect's designs for a house and to be sure that those are fit for purpose.  We oversee that aspect.  When we are satisfied on an independent level that the design is fit for purpose, that situation is then also certified by an independent certifier who is qualified in that business.  When that process is all done and dusted, and we receive the certificate, NBI can get paid.  That process will continue for the next ten years on the build and connections side of things.  It is a quality control system to ensure the work is done and done to the quality required and the work is certified as being payable.</p></speech>

The first is that as a commercial company it is going to lose revenue from customers because it is delayed.  In addition, delay payments are included in the contract and that provision kicks in from 1 February 2022.  If NBI is delayed in meeting its milestones, there will be daily delay payments of X number of euro up to a given amount.  The company will get a penalty for any day it is late in meeting a milestone.  That will start from next year.  Given Covid-19 and its impact, NBI has not been delayed so far in meeting any of the milestones in 2021.  That is because under the contract, it is permissible to seek relief as a contractor.  We provided that relief because NBI demonstrated to us that it was delayed for all the different reasons relevant to Covid.</p></speech>

As of today, NBI is six months behind in its network roll-out.  We are trying to establish now whether the company can catch up on that six-month delay.  The company is not paying delay payments now because the other contract does not start until February 2022.</p></speech>

What are the implications if the company misses further milestones as part of the remediation plan?</p></speech>

A financial penalty must be paid for each day that the company is late from that point onwards.  I reiterate that NBI, as a commercial company, also suffers two other non-contractual financial penalties that are far more severe.  Every month that NBI is delayed in meeting its targets will mean less revenue coming into the business and that will result in its profits being lower.  In addition, the working capital requirements of the company are more severe and they need to reach those requirements.  NBI will therefore face significant business implications if there are delays with this build, as well as the contractual implications.  The other key performance indicator that we have for NBI measures network performance.  It includes any outages, on a BCP, for example.  If one of those went down between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., significant service deductions and performance indicators exist in that regard.  Again, they have been in place since last year and they will be in place for the 25 years.</p></speech>

The feeling on the ground is that it is going to take five or six years before some premises get connected.  The website has been updated to reflect that timeline.  Many Eircode areas are moving out of one deployment area and into another, without notification, and that is causing major anxiety to many people.  I wish to get an understanding of what the Department's input is in ensuring we get the fastest roll-out possible.</p></speech>

It is critical that we look at that aspect.  As Mr. Griffin said, we have nearly 50 people working on this programme in the Department and we are working diligently every week with the NBI team.  The contract is with NBI, which is negotiating with every subcontractor - Eircom, Enet and any other company that it can get its hands on - to help to speed up this roll-out.  The process is ongoing.  NBI has a dedicated team dealing with those negotiations.  A successful outcome has already been achieved in the negotiation with Eircom.  From October this year, Eircom has ramped up the speed of upgrading the pole and duct network.  That will set the platform for all other increases in capacity and speed that we hope to achieve.  The priority now is to make up the ground lost to the impact of Covid-19, and we hope to do that over the next year.  Beyond that, the absolute priority is to hasten the deployment scheduled for 2024 and 2025.  We are working on that now.</p></speech>

I always watch out for language in opening statements and some things jumped out at me.  I have a different description of some terms.  Fiscal transfers, for me, are penalties for not achieving something.  Regarding recalculation, NBI has missed its targets.  Turning to savings, those came from unspent moneys in programmes that were necessary, but I will be fair and say that Covid-19 has been a significant issue.</p><p>Those kind of things jump out at me.  I will start with broadband and will make the point that others have made, which is that the intervention area is one thing but it is far from perfect in other areas, including my area.  There was a concern from the outset about National Broadband Ireland's ability to deliver.  Can the Department provide us with a note on what exactly was recalculated in the targets?  My understanding is it will miss the targets for this year that were originally set out in the contract.  What were those targets and how far short of those targets will it be?</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point and there is no effort on my part to use clever language in an opening statement to duck the fact that we are behind in the project.  Every one of us in the Department who is engaged in this is acutely aware of how important this is in rural Ireland, more so now that we have been through a year and a half when the vast majority of office workers and primary, secondary and third level students have been working from home.  We feel the anxiety to get this project delivered as quickly as we possibly can.  In fairness to the company, I covered a bit of this in the opening statement but it was elaborated on when the company appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on 15 September, it had a situation at one point where 40% of its staff in one of its main subcontractors either had Covid or were close contacts.  That is the reality of the situation it has dealt with on the ground.</p></speech>

All of that is part of the programme to get us back to where we need to be, having regard to the original target at the end of 2021.  The other aim is to see where we will be at the end of 2021 and where we expect to be at the end of 2022.  Final figures have yet to be agreed between ourselves and the Department-----</p></speech>

That is why the Department has a scale of resources internally to do that work.  There are broader discussions on issues.  For example, ComReg is working on the cost of pole and duct rental and decisions are being made on that which we hope will have a positive impact on the overall costs of the programme over the next 25 years.

I have only four minutes left and I have two further areas I want to cover.  We know Moneypoint is back online because of the issue with energy at the moment.  What impact will the continued burning of fossil fuels have on the purchasing of statistical transfers to meet the obligations under the renewable energy directive?  Will there be additional liabilities as a consequence of that?</p></speech>

On the burning of fossil fuels, the greatest impact will be on our CO2 emissions reduction targets for 2030, which is a 51% reduction.  It will not affect the issue of statistical transfers.  Moneypoint and Tarbert have been on the system in recent months as a function of reduced wind levels, the like of which we have not seen since 1961.  We have the lowest level of wind in this part of Europe since then but it will not impact on the statistical transfers.</p></speech>

Mr. Griffin and I have had this conversation before because Kildare is a particular case in point and we have one of the three super dumps or landfills as they are called now and an application was made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a big expansion.  The last time we met or the time before Mr. Griffin told us we were on a knife-edge in where waste is disposed of.  We have convoys of trucks from all over the place arriving to Kildare to the Drehid landfill because there is no landfill nearer to them.  Whereas a rosy picture is presented, it is far from that when one happens to be beside a gigantic landfill.  Where are we in our capacity to assimilate waste?  We are not producing less of it.  Where is it going?  What lifespan is left in the other two landfills?  Is it going to incineration?</p></speech>

The three other plants, including Drehid in the Deputy's constituency, Knockharley and Ballynagran are also taking in significant quantities of residual municipal solid waste.

At their recent appearance before the Oireachtas joint committee on 5 October 202, the CEO of EirGrid said that with the two plants coming back on, the completion of a substantial degree of maintenance works that had been deferred into this year due to Covid-19, and the work that EirGrid has done with the large energy users, he was confident that we would not have blackouts over the course of the coming winter.</p></speech>

I know they have accounted for about 11% of energy use in 2020.  Our overall energy use in 2020 was about 5,300 MW at absolute peak.

We should be looking at what national policy is on data centres.  There is a 2018 policy led out of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We will review that.  There will be a commitment in the climate action plan that will be published in the next few weeks to review the policy.  One of the measures that has been floated has been consulted on by the regulators over the past while,  I expect there will be a decision in the next few years around locational issues in that data centres will be located close to renewable energy where there is less pressure on the grid and where demand can be more easily catered for.</p></speech>

Water supply is not up to capacity.  Mr. Griffin is talking about further down the road, but we have a much higher percentage of data centres than any other state in Europe.  I want to come back to him regarding Eirgrid.  I spoke to one EirGrid employee who described what was occurring internally on data centres being the cause of mass panic, regardless of what the Department has been assured of.  That mass panic related to security of supply and they were placing the blame on issues of reliability regarding wind, the premature closing of peat burning stations, and particularly data centres.  How would the Department respond to those fears?</p></speech>

If the Deputy was to ask me am I concerned, I would say the answer is "Absolutely, yes".  The Department has been extensively and heavily engaged at my level with the regulator and with EirGrid over the past number of months.  We have been looking at this very closely.  There is a range of issues that the Deputy has rightly called out, including increasing demand, closure of older plant, lower availability of existing plants because of either scheduled or-----</p></speech>

If this goes belly-up, we are facing blackouts and water shortages.  Is it not more prudent to say we will have a moratorium until an impact assessment is done?  If Mr. Griffin is saying it is coming from his Department that he does not think there is validity in that, I would be extremely concerned.</p></speech>

I will just repeat what the Minister said in the D&aacute;il recently when he said he did not believe that a moratorium was appropriate.  I think we need to look at this in the round.  I do not want to give the Deputy an idea for a moment that we are kicking the can down the road on this specific issue because we are not.  There will be a decision by the regulator on a revised connection policy on data centres by the end of the year.  We will move really quickly to revise the 2018 policy statement.  We have identified a suite of measures that have been articulated in the public domain by the regulator and by EirGrid, and, like every set of measures, they are constantly reviewed.  We are meeting with the regulator and asking where they are at, what is happening now and what steps need to be taken.  There is very strong governance in place so it is not-----</p></speech>

There is no impact assessment taken regarding how many data centres are in one area and what impact that would have on supply and demand.  That is just crazy stuff.</p></speech>

The final piece of the jigsaw that I will put on the table now is that we are developing a policy, which we will finalise shortly, on security of supply, and it will be one of those policies that An Bord Plean&aacute;la and other consenting authorities will be required to have regard to in any decision-making process.</p></speech>

I had better turn down my monitor.  I had it on because I am due to speak in the D&aacute;il.  In respect of the roll-out of hubs in rural areas, which I know is not necessarily under the Department's remit, we now see a great delay in the roll-out of broadband connections.  We are way off target.  I wonder about ways to deal with that issue.  In one area in my constituency, there are more than 900 children who go to primary school.  Despite this, a large part of the area does not have any broadband.  We are looking for a broadband hub to be put in the immediate area.  The roll-out of hubs is very important to give people access to broadband services.  How can we reconsider this whole area and fast-track it because there are so many people working from home who cannot get access to broadband services?</p></speech>

Yes.  I am sorry.  The technology is not just problematic in Wicklow, but up in Adelaide Road as well.  I should be clear that is Adelaide Road not Adelaide Street.</p> <p>  On the issue of hubs, we had set out with a view to putting in place 284 broadband connection points.  These were public points.  As of 1 October, 238 were connected, 219 of which were connected through the Vodafone methodology.  We expect to have the full 284 connected by the end of the year.  A broader programme is being led out of the Minister, Deputy Humphrey's Department, the Department of Rural and Community Development.  I refer to the connected hubs initiative.  A great amount of work is being done by the Western Development Commission and the Atlantic economic corridor group.  We will have the 284 fully done by the end of this year.  National Broadband Ireland, NBI, delivery for 200 primary schools will be fully completed by the end of this year.</p></speech>

That is my point.</p></speech>

Can we not now prioritise the roll-out of hubs so that more people can get access?  Since this plan was drafted two or three years ago, the whole landscape has changed because of Covid.  We therefore need to review policy in both Mr. Griffin's Department and in the Department of Rural and Community Development.  That is basically what I am saying.</p></speech>

On the 284, now that the connection has been provided, it is key that they are equipped with the necessary internal services to allow people to work from home.  A budget of &euro;5 million was allocated by the Department of Rural and Community Development in recent months.  This will allow many of those broadband connection points to be provided with those internal services to allow people to work from home.  I do not know whether-----</p></speech>

They will not be touched until 2025.  These areas are within an 18-mile radius of Cork city.  That is the reason I am getting concerned about this.  I fully accept that broadband is being rolled out in Carrigaline, Midleton and the areas around them but the areas I am talking about are all within 15 or 18 miles of Cork city.</p></speech>

There are two issues involved.  This is a seven-year programme so it was always going to take time to roll out broadband to different locations in the country.  The nature of the way the roll-out is structured means that a location being within a 20-mile radius of a city is not necessarily the driving factor with regard to the timeline for the roll-out of broadband provision to premises in the area.  Mr. Mulligan may wish to comment on the specific issue of broadband connection points and what the contract allows with regard to putting more in place over the earlier years of the contract.</p></speech>

There is absolutely an openness and a willingness to roll-out more broadband connections points.  I emphasise that, if there is no broadband connection point in close proximity to the areas and premises the Deputy has mentioned, the local community can go to the local broadband officer in Cork.  With the community, that officer can select a particular building, perhaps a community hall or parish hall, which locals feel could be fit for the purposes of remote working or studying and then engage with the Department of Rural and Community Development and our Department.  We will then get that building connected, over and above what we have already done.  That door is wide open if there is a suitable building in particular area.  We can engage directly through National Broadband Ireland but it does not necessarily have to be done through NBI.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is engaged with many companies to address the need the Deputy has mentioned, if a suitable building is available.  I emphasise the need for the local community to come forward with that building to take up that option.</p></speech>

Just as a start, I have identified three buildings.  In one case, funding has already been secured from one of the local development companies, so the funding is available.  We are finding that the response is extremely slow.  This is an area in which, as I said, there are 900 children in the local primary schools.  There are also a lot of people who are now working from home because they have young families and so on but they cannot get broadband.  I am looking for that to be reviewed and for that to be dealt with in a timely manner, rather than having to wait until 2025.</p> <p>  May I raise one other issue?  It relates to areas which are on the borderline between areas zoned as blue and areas zoned as amber.  I know of a number of cases, including one case where broadband is available in an area but Eir will not connect four houses which are within 100 yd of that area.</p><p>Can we not engage with Eir where there is a borderline between blue and amber areas to connect houses that are close together?  </p></speech>

There are always a few houses next door to other houses that have a fantastic fibre connection from Eir, and soon they will also have a fibre connection from National Broadband Ireland, and until 100% of the country is done that will always be the case.</p> <p>  What NBI has done, with a lot of pressure from ourselves, is to engage with Eir and other operators to see if there is something that can be done in the interim to get to those homes faster where they are just on the edges, as we call them.  These are homes that are contiguous with the blue areas or even within the blue areas there are amber homes, little pockets of them, as one can see on the map.  They went to tender to the market because, I suppose again, we asked them to go to the market to get the best offer and get the best solution.  Eir is one of those companies that may be able to address those premises quicker through NBI.  So that is a work in progress.  We expect to make a lot of progress in the next three to six months where NBI will be coming forward to us with a solution to those pockets of premises which, heretofore, could be on the long finger into the next two or three years.</p></speech>

I want to touch on the national broadband plan again.  The &euro;3 billion contract is for the delivery of high-speed broadband to 542,000 rural homes and businesses.

One of the contractors that had intended coming over from the UK to start work on the project postponed establishing its Irish operation; recruitment and the onboarding of key staff was delayed; as was travel and availability of accommodation for contractors across islands, and access to islands in some schools for the installation of BCPs.  So there was a whole swathe of problems, Deputy, that led to a situation.</p></speech>

Kelly did not come in so one-third of the work was going to go to them for the first year or two if they won certain tenders that NBI issued but that did not come to pass.  For the other contractors, they currently have four big contractors on board since then.  So they have ramped up the number of contractors to make up for the lost ground of Kelly not coming into Ireland.</p></speech>

There is a very comprehensive governance arrangement in place overseeing the project.  So when they look for a relief under the contract there is a process that is undertaken with great rigour by staff in the Department and by the external advisers to see, well, first of all, does this qualify for relief under the contract and does it qualify for relief to the extent that NBI have set out.  We would scrutinise and contest every line of argument or every proposition that NBI have put forward which they deem to be an event which, under the contract, allows them to seek relief.</p></speech>

We do all of this work to establish what it was supposed to achieve, which was the 200,000, versus what it can achieve.  The contract is re-baselined based on this.

Back in June, in reply to a parliamentary question, it was stated that 4,000 homes out of the 115,000 originally targeted for this year were competed.  On 15 September there were 23,000, according to the CEO of National Broadband Ireland.  There are now 27,000.  We have clarified this today.  The target is 60,000 so there are 33,000 premises to be connected, or to be passed, between now and the end of the year.  This would seem to be ambitious.  I hope it happens.  Similar to the previous speaker, I desperately want to see the broadband plan rolled out.  Laois and Offaly are crying out for it.  Many commuters go up and down the M7 every day who could be working from home.  They need to be working from home for a number of reasons, such as to get away from long commutes and to decrease their carbon emissions.</p> <p>  At present, 60,000 is the target.  It looks like we will come in at roughly half of what the original target was.  There was a period of time that the company could not work because of Covid.  I contest this because telecommunications was one of the areas that was exempt.  The real reason was that many of the operatives and subcontractors involved were from another country.  They were from overseas and had to travel into the country.  I would like a brief answer.  Is this not the real reason it was held up for so long at the start of the year?</p></speech>

There was some level of operation going on.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the penalties.  This is something that we need to nail down today.  On 1 June, I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, in the D&aacute;il about this.  He said that as he understood it, there were none in the current contract.  The reply to a parliamentary question I put to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, on 17 June was that there are key performance indicators to ensure services are maintained appropriately, including significant penalties to address underperformance.  Several years ago, the former Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, told me on the floor of the D&aacute;il when replying to a question on this that stringent penalties would be imposed.  What I am hearing this morning is that if NBI does not get to the 60,000 it will not get paid.  The point is that it can move at its own pace if there is no other penalty.  I was given to believe, and the greater world out there believes, that there were going to be stringent penalties.  There is huge concern about this not just among Members of the Oireachtas but in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It outlined clearly what its concerns are.  I want to clarify this with a "Yes" or "No" answer.  Apart from not being paid for work not done, in other words if it does not get 60,000 done it will not get paid for the full 60,000, is there another financial penalty?</p></speech>

There are three stages when we look at this.  It will get paid for what it has built.  The impact, as Mr. Mulligan described earlier, is that work continues and it has to fund additional working capital.  It also loses out on revenues to the company.  I do not want to call this a penalty but it is a consequence and it is a significant consequence for the company.  The second point Mr. Mulligan mentioned is that there are delay payments.  These delay payments are applicable from the first day of the third contract year and will be applied where there is a delay in achieving build-related milestones.</p> <p>  Looking back at the transcript, a Deputy used the analogy of a concessionaire running a road and getting hit with penalties for closing down one of the lanes.  These are the types of penalties that arise when connecting and passing.  These are real penalties.  There are 17 key performance indicators.  These include the time required to connect premises, minimum upload and download speeds, the number of faults, the time taken to repair them, price and service availability.  There is a suite of penalties and consequences across the lifetime of the project.</p></speech>

He and I discussed this matter a couple of years ago, along with Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on 3 April 2019, issued observations and memos for the Minister's attention.  I have copies in front of me.  The Department set out its concerns.  The document I have to hand, from Mr. Robert Watt and Mr. Brendan Ellison, is one with which Mr. Mulligan will be familiar.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	We strongly recommend against approval of the appointment of the preferred bidder to the current NBP procurement process on the grounds of: cost and affordability, impact on the National Development Plan and on projects forgone as a result, value for money and specifically uncertain benefits, unprecedented risk for the Exchequer and compatibility with [the spatial strategy] Project Ireland 2040. </blockquote> <p>It also states the Department believed significant progress could be made with an alternative approach.  Basically, it was saying other providers were already in the field in a lot of the relevant localities.  I am familiar with some of them in Laois&ndash;Offaly.  They were out there providing wireless broadband before the Department was.  The two officials mentioned the cost and set out a chart on it.  The document stated, &quot;This is a more prudent approach to a long-term investment of this nature compared with committing to a 25 year contract which, by its nature, does not have the same flexibilities.&quot;  They set out what this entailed.  Basically, it was providing a spine.</p><p>The document states, &quot;In terms of value for money, we have major concerns in relation to the credibility of the [cost-benefit analysis] for the National Broadband Plan&quot;.  At the time, a sum of up to &euro;3 billion was being mentioned.  The document also states, &quot;Furthermore, under this proposal the State will not own the asset, despite investing up to &euro;3 billion in it (as compared with a private sector equity investment risk of only [the wording here is blacked out]&quot;.  It goes on to state, &quot;The lack of a competitive process in arriving at the final bid is also a real concern for the Department&quot;.  It outlines the risks to the Exchequer: &quot;[W]e believe that the State is being asked to take on unprecedented risk associated with this project&quot;.  It claims the State was being asked to commit nearly &euro;3 billion, which was to provide returns to the private operator and owner of the asset, while the latter was risking only a given amount of equity.  This amount is blacked out in the document.  At the time, the amount was reckoned to be around &euro;250 million.  The document states the private operator, for the given amount of equity, &quot;will own the entire asset while accepting the State has mechanism to safeguard&quot;.  The document also sets out what its authors believe was an alternative approach and, towards the end, questions why the likes of the ESB were not already being used more.  Could Mr. Cleary state whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform still stands over that memo of 3 April 2019?</p></speech>

I do not think it is a question of standing over it.  Those were the views that were expressed at the time by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Chairman has articulated them very clearly.  The views are all published on the Department's website as part of the suite of material that the Government published around the time of the national broadband plan.  The Chairman has accurately articulated the views of the Department, and those were views that were presented to the Government at the time, but the Government decided to proceed with the national broadband plan.  I suppose it is a question of implementation now.  The views expressed at the time were those views.</p></speech>

I have responded comprehensively to the comments referred to in a letter I wrote on 24 April 2019, a 16-page letter dealing with every single issue the Chairman raised, including possible alternative solutions.  That letter is also in the public domain.  People need to look at both in forming a view.  The key point, as Mr. Cleary rightly pointed out, is that the Government approved it having regard to every single issue that the Chairman has articulated, which we dealt with in the memorandum for the Government and which are covered in the various sets of correspondence and in the published documents.</p></speech>

The view we were comfortable in recommending to the Government is that governance of the project is crucial to its delivery.  If we do not govern it properly, it will not be delivered properly.

In short, there are no targets that have not been met".</p></speech>

Half the year was not missed because of Covid.</p> <p>  My final question is on the board of National Broadband Ireland.  Right from the beginning, there was an issue with the fact that there are nine members on the board.  Eight of those represent the private entity, despite the private entity putting in roughly 10% to 11% of the money.  The taxpayer, through the State, is ponying up the bulk of it but the taxpayer is represented by just one person on the board.  How is that working out?  Does Mr. Griffin not feel that where there are difficult or contentious decisions, the Department and taxpayer are outnumbered?  Mr. Griffin knows how it works at a board meeting.  The ratio is eight to one at a board meeting where a difficult decision has to be made or where there is a contentious matter.  I presume the person is a Department official.  Mr. Griffin might confirm that.</p></speech>

Anybody who has ever sat at a board meeting or committee meeting will know that the power balance is not just tilted but loaded overwhelmingly in favour of the American company that got this contract, the single bidder.</p><p>How do you square that circle in those situations?</p></speech>

That is the single purpose of NBI.  I expect all members of the board to have a singular focus on that and that board members, whether they are the Minister's nominee, the other two non-executive directors or the others put into that other pool, are absolutely focused on that.  I expect all members to have robust exchanges and to act in the interest of the company's objective, which is to deliver broadband across Ireland.</p> <p>  A separate piece I will say on this is that, as part of the project agreement, we have a requirement that the board of NBI should function in accordance with best-in-class corporate governance standards.  That is something that is part of our governance oversight that we will review on a regular basis.  We already have work under way with Ernst &amp;amp; Young, which is one of our contractors, to look at that particular issue and see how the board is measuring up relative to the sort of standards we expect of boards operating in this sector.</p></speech>

The reality is, however, that when an issue arises in the context of the interests of the taxpayer and the interests of the State, it is the private entity that holds an awful lot of cards.  We cannot just stop in the middle of the contract and move that entity off the pitch, no more than we can get the company that is involved in the children's hospital off the pitch halfway through the contract.  We know that logic and logistics do not allow us to do that.  The point I am making is that in those situations, the State and the taxpayer are in a more precarious situation because the share numbers are eight to one.</p></speech>

When we looked at the 2019 accounts, we found that a number of contracts were non-compliant.  The vast majority of those related to the NBP and the National Digital Research Centre, NDRC, both in number and value.  The reason for that is we could not change horses on the NBP when we were at the point of appointing a contractor.  That was the primary reason there.  On the NDRC, we were at the end of a concession agreement and were in a procurement process to appoint a new concessionaire but that took a little longer than expected.  There was a need to fund, non-competitively, an additional chunk of money to go into the NDRC to deal with that, but looking at 2020-----</p></speech>

I am just asking if Mr. Griffin, as the Secretary General, is happy that he can improve further but, equally, that should accountability be warranted in the cases of non-procurement, it can be provided by means of retraining and so on.  I saw in the note to which I refer that three people have not been retired or dismissed - I am sure what the word was - but have left the Department.  Is that correct?  There is some figure there of &euro;52,000-odd.  Mr Seamus McCarthy might come in, if he can help me.  People have gone from the Department.

Non-competitive procurements are not precluded under procurement rules.  There may be very valid reasons for us engaging in non-competitive procurements.

I will drill down into a few other elements in the time I have. </p> <p>  Mr. Griffin mentioned the trading online voucher.  Some &euro;21 million was spent in 2020 and 13,000 vouchers were awarded.  I highlighted that figure because that scheme, and how quickly it was administered by the Department, was appreciated by so many businesses, as I am sure Mr. Griffin will appreciate.  In addition, the work of the local enterprise offices in my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, the phenomenal roll-out of that programme and how well it was received by businesses, should not go unnoticed here today because it was invaluable to many businesses to get them online.</p> <p>  I will return to the landfill issue.  We spoke about it previously but did not have enough time.  I asked about the &euro;6.1 million allocated to the environmental fund to local authorities to support waste enforcement services anti-dumping initiatives.  How is that being monitored by the Department?  I can only imagine when the Department divested the landfill issue to each local authority it was probably a little weight off the shoulders but, ultimately, that needs to be monitored to ensure the fund is being utilised correctly and we are seeing value for money on that aspect.  How is that being done overall by the Department?</p></speech>

They have a shared service approach to enforcement action.  On responsibility for monitoring and ongoing remediation of the sites, responsibility for the remediation of the specific sites rests with individual local authorities.</p><p>The overall strategic approach is taken through the regional waste management plans, which are due to be replaced in 2022 by a national waste management plan.  That is the primary mechanism.  There is also a steering group that meets on a quarterly basis to ensure we are on track, to monitor trends and to ensure we are moving through the risk sites on a prioritised basis.</p></speech>

I understand the national waste collection permit office is run by Offaly County Council.

I presume that also links in with the environmental fund to the local authorities.</p></speech>

The digital skills for citizens scheme had a saving of &euro;2.5 million.  That was the amount left unspent by that programme.  Given where we are at with the pandemic, I presume that programme will resume shortly.  I hope that &euro;2.5 million, along with the new allocation, will be spent quite soon.  In the same vein, &euro;6 million was provided from the just transition fund and there was a significant underspend in that regard.  There is a note in the report that finalisation of agreements in respect of individual projects faced delay.  Has that issue also been resolved, because just transition is going to be more important as the years pass and we get closer to 2030.

In fact, the 2018 report acknowledges the credibility of the underground option, which is, as Mr. Griffin knows, favoured by local communities.  The difficulty does not relate to that report, <i>per se</i>.  The committee will be interested as to why the Department is investing any money at all into a project for which nobody asked.  What was sought was an independent analysis into an underground option so we could determine, once and for all, the full implications in terms of cost, feasibility and technical aspects of the project.  Will the Department consider that type of assessment?</p></speech>

The difficulty is that nobody has properly analysed what an underground option would cost or whether unforeseen technical issues would emerge.  We are, therefore, continuing along a vein whereby EirGrid, with the support of the Department, is proceeding to a direct confrontation with landowners and local communities.  On top of that, the Department is now spending money on a review for which nobody asked.</p></speech>

What I said to the Deputy was we would look at whatever comes out of this process and form a view then.  The bottom line is that we have looked at this issue.  When I say "we", I mean the system has looked at this issue on a number of occasions, going back probably a decade, on the options of overgrounding or undergrounding.  We have commissioned a number of international expert opinions on this.  The outcome, up to and including the 2018 review, is that the most cost-effective and appropriate way of delivering this infrastructure is by an overhead solution.</p></speech>

This is a huge project and we all know it is badly needed.  Everybody wants to see it, no one more than I, as a representative of a rural constituency with many commuters.  There are a lot of people involved in small businesses around the midlands and across Laois-Offaly.  Mr. Mulligan, as the programme manager, might clarify a matter for me.  As I understand it, the investor or sole bidder has the contract.  It rents infrastructure off another company, Eir, which was privatised in 1999 and is owned by a French consortium.  Is the preferred bidder or contractor, NBI, paying an annual fee to the French consortium that owns Eir for the hire of poles and ducting?</p></speech>

As I said, ComReg - we referred to this earlier - has, over the past two years, been involved in a very comprehensive review of the costs associated with Eircom providing that service and the rate of return that it should get.  I understand that ComReg will be publishing a very comprehensive decision on the review of those prices towards the end of this year.</p></speech>

Somebody gave an answer to this question previously and I am just seeking clarity.  Is that figure correct?</p></speech>

If there is only a fibre cable on the poles, it is &euro;20 or &euro;19.  If there is a copper cable which is owned by Eircom remaining on the pole network, then the charge to NBI is half the &euro;20 charge - it is &euro;10.</p></speech>

Presumably, there is a corresponding charge where the ducting used is owned by the private consortium that owns Eir.  We owned Eir; it was a semi-State company.  I do not expect Mr. Mulligan to answer that because it will depend on the size of the ducting, the number of cables going through it and the amount of infrastructure in it.  A lot of this infrastructure was put in place before 2000 and prior to the privatisation of Eir.  The subsidy from the taxpayer, which is roughly 90% of the overall cost of the project - what has been put upfront for it - comes from the taxpayer.  The taxpayer and State are essentially paying the subsidy for the renting of these poles and ducting, which the public company once owned by the taxpayer provided in the first place.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

A lot of poles could even be 50 years old.  The network that is being rent is being upgraded by Eir, as a private company.  When the State is choosing that pole network rental over 25 years, Eir is currently spending tens of millions of euro upgrading that pole and duct network, with the view of getting rental over 25 years.  It is the same as renting a house.  The landlord is required to upgrade that house and make it fit for purpose for the tenant, which is NBI, and then it is only allowed to get a regulated rate of return.  The regulator is the key player to make sure that Eir only receives what is a reasonable rate of return on the capital cost it outlays over the next five or six years replacing any poles or upgrading all the ducts.</p></speech>

We can see that some of the poles that had fallen down, were broken or whatever are being replaced.  In some cases, the cables were just lying along bushes and trees where poles had been damaged or had fallen over the years.  I accept that and I thank Mr. Mulligan for his reply.</p> <p>  I do not expect Mr. Griffin to have detailed answers on the next matter I raise.  In relation to SEAI grants, as I understand it, the main three schemes are the warmer homes scheme, the better energy warmer homes scheme and the national retrofit scheme.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There is a forthcoming new national retrofit scheme that will also aim at achieving those objectives but will streamline the process.

The warmer homes scheme, which is free for people in receipt of fuel allowance, provides for a lagging jacket for a boiler, attic insulation and maybe some other minor works such as energy-efficient lightbulbs.  The better energy warmer homes scheme is part grant-aided and the householder puts up the balance.  The national retrofit scheme is the more substantial scheme.</p> <p>  According to Mr. Griffin's opening statement, &euro;97 million was spent on the schemes in 2020.  In relation to this year, is the funding spread over the year?  I am never sure of this when constituents ask me about it.  Is it the case that there is a pot of money across the three schemes at the start of the year and when it is gone, it is gone.  Those are the three main schemes Mr. Griffin identified for householders - I should have clarified that.  Is it spread over the year or is it the case that the pot of money is there at the start of the year, be it &euro;80 million, &euro;100 million or whatever, and if it is gone by April, it is gone for the year?  For our own information, what way does that work?</p></speech>

The average value of a retrofit in the first six months of this year under that scheme was about &euro;17,000.</p><p>It is far more extensive than was the case a couple of years ago when it was focused on lagging jackets and attic insulation.</p><p> On the point regarding budgets, the warmer homes scheme budget runs all year around, as does the budget for the better energy homes scheme, which is available at any point during the year.  The Chairman may be alluding to two of the schemes in particular, namely, the community energy grants scheme and the one-stop-shop development scheme.  They issued calls for projects and those projects were to be completed by the middle of October.  As Covid intervened in that regard, we have encouraged participants to have as much activity as possible to be completed by the deadline of 15 October but we have also pushed out some of the deadlines for some of the projects to allow them a little more time to work.  However, the budget runs all year around.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Deegan to send committee members a short synopsis of the three schemes, including the amount of money it is projected will be spent on them this year.  That would be to the benefit of members.  There is confusion in respect of the schemes, although they are good schemes and people have benefited from them.  Obviously, given the situation we are in with regard to energy, climate and everything like that, we want to try to keep promoting these schemes to the public.  If Mr. Deegan could do that, it would be appreciated.  The amount of money-----</p></speech>

You knew what you had for a particular year and then you got back into the Estimates process to figure out what would be available in the following year.  The national development plan has set out clear allocations for the Department between now and 2025.  A significant chunk of that will go towards energy efficiency.  We know what the overall capital envelope is out to 2030.  Activity out to 2025 will be ramped up significantly between 2025 and 2030.  That has given certainty to the sector and the contractors in the sector that they need to scale up to deliver so that when people are seeking to have their homes retrofitted, whether through one of the grant-aided schemes or the warmer homes scheme, that contract or panel will be in place.</p></speech>

I refer to the categories that apply.  The warmer homes scheme and the better energy homes scheme are quite clear-cut.  I would like more information on the national retrofit scheme.  I thank Mr. Deegan and Mr. Griffin for their replies on that issue.  I did not expect them to have the details of the scheme with them because it was not specified on the invitation they received.  I do not wish to put them on the spot but, as they are here and time allows, I ask them to get that information for the committee.</p> <p>  Many people are very concerned about the broadband plan.  It is to be hoped that it can be rolled out quickly and we can get most of rural Ireland connected to broadband as quickly as possible in order to get people working from home and help those who are self-employed and small businesses.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Griffin and his staff, as well as Mr. Cleary of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, for joining us and for preparing the information.  I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for assisting the committee in the context of the meeting.  Is it agreed to request the clerk to seek any follow-up information and carry out any agreed actions?  Agreed.  Is it agreed to note and publish the opening statements and the briefings provided for the meeting?  Agreed.  We will suspend the meeting until 1.30 p.m. when we will resume in public session to consider correspondence and other business of the committee.</p></speech>

There were a couple of typos in the version that was presented originally, and these have now been corrected by the HSE.  They affect note 8, non-pay expenditure, specifically the figures given for transport.  The HSE has now indicated a different split to what was presented previously.  In note 16, inventories, there was an incorrect figure on the write-down on PPE, on the disposal of protective suits.  I dealt with that matter in my opening comments when the HSE appeared before the committee.</p></speech>

Agreed.  They will be published as part of our minutes.</p> <p>  No. 3 is correspondence.  There are two items to be addressed this week.  The first category of correspondence is from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  No. 817 B is from Dr. Alan Wall, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, dated 6 October 2021.  It is information requested by the committee in relation to third level courses that were provided by UCD, and supported by Tullow Oil, for the professional development of academics or technical professionals employed by the State or regulatory bodies in the oil and gas industry.</p> <p>  We also wrote to UCD in relation to this and considered its response, R0717B, at our meeting of 21 September.  At that point we agreed to write to the HEA to inquire as to whether it maintains a register of third level courses funded, or part funded, by the private sector.  We also agreed to request that the HEA provide an information note outlining what it requires in terms of disclosures in the financial statements in respect of this matter.  We will consider the HEA's reply to that request in due course.</p> <p>  It is proposed to await the HEA's response to our query as to whether it maintains a register of third level courses funded, or part funded, by the private sector, and information as to what the HEA requires in terms of disclosures in financial statements of higher education institutes in respect of this matter.</p> <p>  I will open the floor to Deputy Hourigan, who has flagged this item.  Any other Members who wish to speak should raise their hands.</p></speech>

I am none the wiser.  Serious concerns have been raised by many Members in recent times about the oversight of universities and other educational institutions.  It ranges from academic attendance to partnerships with private companies that act against the public interest.  These institutions have a huge influence on society, and they are publicly funded.  We must ensure there is no negative influence in State-funded education.  Educational institutions also receive huge amounts of money from the Exchequer.  The sum of &euro;3.3 billion was received last year.</p> <p>  The partnership between UCD and Tullow Oil is particularly concerning.  Tullow Oil paid UCD &euro;2 million to put on short courses for regulators in some African and South American countries.  These courses have the stated focus of professional development of academics and technical professionals.  We are effectively using the brand of UCD to do that work for Tullow Oil and it is a State-funded brand.  The course, as it is described, has all sorts of intersections with regulatory bodies and State-related entities.  I have serious concerns over a potential conflict of interest.  How much influence did Tullow Oil have on the course content?  What is the curriculum and who wrote it?  I do not think it is appropriate for companies to use the good name of a public State-funded university to influence regulators.  That is different from particular companies having interaction with universities.  This is a completely funded course.  I suggest that we need to have a meeting with UCD and perhaps the HEA.  There are similar courses in TCD for example.  This is simply not acceptable.  There is no extra information given.  There is not full disclosure of what kind of standards the HEA is asking of UCD on the Tullow Oil issue.  I do not accept this as an answer.</p></speech>

It refers to the courses being "for the professional development of academics or technical professionals employed by the state, state related entities or regulatory bodies".  That is the part that caught my eye.  What we are talking about is the professional development of academics or technical professionals employed in a professional capacity by the State on courses funded by Tullow Oil.</p></speech>

Presumably the courses in the sector are provided in the area of energy.</p><p>The letter goes on to state:</p> <blockquote> 	As per our correspondence of 17 June, and with reference to the correspondence from the Committee, the HEA wrote to the higher education institutions, seeking assurances that any partnerships, grants, funding or similar arrangements between publicly funded higher education institutions and third parties do not proceed counter to the public interest,&quot;. </blockquote><p>Further down, it reads: "Responses from the institutions have been submitted to the HEA and assurances have been provided that higher education institutions are not acting counter to the public interest or the interests of institutions' students and staff by contributing to the climate and biodiversity crises, and that governance requirements are being satisfied."  We do not want to make allegations, but the whole thing does not seem to sit right.  I have always been concerned about commercial entities funding and shaping the education system and having too much of an influence thereon.  Without making allegations against Tullow Oil, this seems to put a company in a position whereby it is funding a course.  What input has it into the course's design and content?  We need to invite the HEA to a meeting because, although we are discussing an individual institution, this could be happening at a number of institutions around the State.</p></speech>

Energy is a contested sector at the moment and using an institution and a brand that have been built up by the State and whose good name is important to the State - in terms of our national infrastructure, having good universities that are respected is important - bears greater scrutiny.</p></speech>

Perhaps we will wait to see what the response is and we can then take it from there.  This is a matter that we need to examine more closely.  As the Committee on Public Accounts, it is public funding that we must examine, but if a company is funding a course that is directly involved in an area that the company has an interest in and that is its main line of business, which is energy or oil in this case, we should examine it in detail.  Is the Deputy satisfied to wait for the response?</p></speech>

No. 813C is dated 30 September and is a request to the committee from mise as our Chair to consider making inquiries with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners regarding the recent tax settlement with a company called Perrigo, which concerned the tax treatment of income arising from the sale of intellectual property.  It has been reported that the settlement was agreed at &euro;297 million.  Revenue's original tax bill for Perrigo was &euro;1.64 billion, which I understand was the largest tax bill ever issued by Revenue.  The settlement represents a reduction of over &euro;1.3 billion.  To assist the committee in understanding the settlement, I propose that we write to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to request a detailed note setting out the rationale for the settlement, how it was arrived at and how Revenue was satisfied to settle for &euro;1.3 billion less than its initial assessment.  While we understand that, for various reasons, Revenue might not be able to get 100% of a tax bill, this was a major write-off.  Why did it settle for that?  I also suggest that we write to the Tax Appeals Commission for its take on the matter, as it may have had a role in this.</p> <p>  To go from &euro;1.64 billion to &euro;297 million represents an 84% write-off for Perrigo.  How did that come about?  It was originally the largest tax bill in the State's history.  The State is under the spotlight in terms of our corporation tax rates and collection rate.  While progress is being made in that regard and, regardless of the fact that many of us do not like it, we will now be tied to a rate of 15% under the OECD's proposal, the question over what we are collecting is the greater issue.  To go from &euro;1.64 billion to less than &euro;300 million is a major reduction by any standard.  Many PAYE workers would love to have such a reduction.  Does any member wish to comment on this matter or propose an action?  I suggest that we write to Revenue and the Tax Appeals Commission.</p></speech>

Next week, on 21 October, we are scheduled to engage with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, on its 2020 financial statements.  The D&aacute;il is not scheduled to sit the following week, 25 to 29 October, which brings us to 4 November, when we are planning to engage with RT&Eacute; regarding its receipt of Exchequer funding, which is now the responsibility of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  Is it agreed that we invite a representative from the Department to participate also?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Last week, we agreed our work programme to the end of the year and updated work programme documents have been circulated to members and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Having discussed the sequencing of the engagements with the clerk so as to ensure that we have related correspondence and relevant reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General available to us, it is proposed to proceed in the following order: Tusla next week; RT&Eacute; on 4 November; the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on 11 November; the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 18 November; the Department of Transport on 25 November; the Office of the Revenue Commissioners on 2 December; the Department of Social Protection on 9 December; and the Department of Health on 16 December.

We must be careful to ensure that the invitations reflect what we will discuss with bodies.  This has implications for the committee, but it is also beneficial for members, in that it allows them to get more information.</p> <p>  As we are in a position to give the Accounting Officers a significant amount of notice, we would not expect the schedule to change substantially, but the clerk will advise of any necessary change.  There may need to be movement in the schedule to suit the witnesses.  Some may want a different date for a particular reason.

We will put the Department on the list.</p> <p>  Under the heading of any other business, I wish to raise a matter.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications appeared before us at today's meeting.  During that, there was a discussion with the programme manager of the national broadband plan.  His broadband actually dropped; his connection collapsed in the middle of the meeting.  Apart from being unsatisfactory for committee members and anyone who was watching, it underlines the need for the national broadband plan to be accelerated and brought on stream quickly.</p> <p>  The committee should be insistent with senior officials at the very least.</p><p>The main item today, which was flagged, was the national broadband plan and the principal person dealing with that was not on site, be that in Leinster House or the Department in Adelaide Road.  While other Deputies may wish to comment on this, as a member of this committee that is not okay to me.  The senior official should have been in Adelaide Road or on the grounds of the Houses of the Oireachtas if he were joining remotely, or preferably sitting in one of the seats in the committee room.  I propose to ask the clerk to the committee that every effort should be made to have witnesses attend on site.  If they are not on site, they should be at their headquarters, be that a Government Department or an agency.  They should at least be in their organisation's headquarters with a good connection to the Internet.  The senior official was upstairs in the dormer room of his house.</p></speech>

The secretariat will circulate a document setting out the current status in advance of the next meeting.  I propose we consider it in private session at the end of that meeting.  Some reports are at various stages of completion and members need to be aware of that.  We should also be in a position to consider the draft report on our engagement with the Department of Social Protection at that time.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The second matter involves considering the format and content of the appropriation accounts.  It is proposed to circulate a briefing document on this and to consider the matter in private session at the next meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any other matters which Deputies wish to raise?</p></speech>

We have apologies from Senators Craughwell and Warfield.</p> <p>  The Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il, Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Mark Daly, have appealed to everybody in the parliamentary community to continue to follow public health advice, wear a mask and maintain social distancing.  I request that members, witnesses and staff use the wipes and hand sanitiser provided to clean shared seats and desks so as to supplement regular sanitation.  This will help ameliorate the risk of Covid-19, including the Delta variant, spreading among the parliamentary community.</p> <p>  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practice good hand hygiene and will note every second seat in the committee room has been removed from use in order to facilitate social distancing.  I urge those attending not to move any chair from its current position and they should always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should always be worn during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for members' full co-operation in this regard.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the approval of minutes from the previous meeting.  I propose we approve the minutes of the private and public meetings of 30 September 2021, as already approved in private session.  This must be done for procedural reasons.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p></speech>

We have nine petitions for consideration this afternoon.  Summary notes and replies from Departments and other bodies were circulated to members.  The question is that the petitions considered by the committee at this meeting and the previous meeting may be published and that the replies from the Departments and other bodies may also be published.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The first petition for consideration is No. 11/21, regarding a homeless persons unit maladministration and misapplication of the British-Irish common travel area agreement policy from section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 from Ms Paula Douglas.  The recommendation from the private session is that the correspondence from Dublin City Council be forwarded to the petitioner and that in light of the response from Dublin City Council, the petition be closed.  Do members have any views on this?  Is it agreed to close the petition?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Our second petition is No. 14/21, family liaison officer among prisons human rights investigation and rapid response in medical emergency cases.  This is from Ms Nicole Coleman.  The recommendation from the earlier private session is that the correspondence from the Department of Justice be sent to the petitioner for comment.  Do the members have any views on this?  We agreed to look for more information and the petitioner is aware that the chaplain is being used as a liaison officer in the prison currently.</p><p>We want to know if the petitioner has a problem with the chaplain continuing in that role or is there a reason she is looking for an individual liaison officer.  The secretariat has agreed to get more information for us and we will follow it up at the next meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Our third petition is No. 18/21 and it concerns the need to prioritise urgent environmental issues and enforce actions against non-adherence to environmental laws and regulations, and comes from Ms Alexandra Koster.  The recommendation is that the correspondence from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications be sent to the petitioner for comment.  Do members have any views?</p></speech>

I was tied up with other issues.  Can we deal with the specifics of that, for my information?

My questions are not based on what is in front of me.  I was wondering how the matter was discussed at the committee meeting this morning in terms of the comments the petitioner was making.  I presume she is referring to the matter from a general perspective.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The recommendation is that the correspondence from the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland, ASAI, be forwarded to the petitioner for comment.  Do members have any views?  Is it agreed that we will send that information to the petitioner, ask for a comment and revisit the issue once the petitioner has the correspondence from the ASAI?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Our fifth petition is No. 21/21, relating to taking in charge, from Mr. Terence Coskeran.  The recommendation is that the correspondence from Tipperary County Council be forwarded to the petitioner and that a copy of the correspondence from Tipperary County Council be sent to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, requesting an update on the discussion and negotiations at a national level.</p> <p>  Do members have any views?  I know the situation.  An agreement was done between Mr. Coskeran and the council in 2004 but subsequent events relating to Irish Water and all that have left the people in the area in limbo.  It is distressing and has had an awful effect on Mr. Coskeran.  At this stage, the people concerned have been pushed from pillar to post.  Irish Water is saying it is a matter for the local authority while the local authority is saying it is a matter for Irish Water.  I do not know if we are able to bring in someone from Irish Water, the county council or both to try to resolve the situation.  In 2004, Mr. Coskeran and the council came to an agreement that once all the servicing was done, the council would take the estate in question in charge.  A similar situation is happening across the country but this is the petition we have in front of us.  I suggest we either look for another up-to-date response from Irish Water and the council or ask the county manager or someone from Irish Water to come in and explain the situation to us, and see can we move this on.  Are there any other views?</p></speech>

We should follow up with Irish Water, first and foremost, and see what response comes from that.  Perhaps we could then go to the council and take it from there.  Unless the secretariat has something to offer contrary to that, I think that is the best way to approach the matter.</p></speech>

I suspect this is not a one-off case.  One-house and two-house builds in east Cork are finding a bit of resistance when it comes to supplying services.  It is affecting how people can build their family homes.  I certainly agree that we should bring in somebody from any council and any part of the water service to try to iron out this issue and help everybody.</p></speech>

I had an hour-long meeting with a representative of Irish Water yesterday relating to some issues in Limerick.  It was a follow-on from a meeting of the housing committee.  I met representatives of Irish Water and many other people involved with the issue, and questions that we have been looking to have answered for the past three or four years were answered.  A programme is now in place.  What is happening in other areas?  The only way we will know is from Irish Water.  We need to get its representatives in here and go through different projects.  If they are to come in, it would be nice for us to give them the areas we are looking at so they might have some statistics for those areas when they come in.</p></speech>

Mr. Coskeran and the estate concerned had an agreement with the county council in 2004, before Irish Water came into being.  Do we need to get something from the council to explain what happened in 2004 and what was agreed between the two parties at the time or are committee members happy for us to bring in the representatives of Irish Water and try to move the situation on from there?</p></speech>

The same situation applied in Limerick.  There were agreements for services to be put in place prior to planning permission but the service agreements did not have to be honoured by Irish Water.</p></speech>

Do we need to invite Mr. Coskeran in as well or should we just deal with the county council and Irish Water first, give their replies to Mr. Coskeran and let him make a submission to the committee thereafter?  Would committee members be happy with that approach?  We will do that.  I will ask the secretariat to write to both the county council and Irish Water.  We will try to fix up a meeting with them.</p> <p>  Our sixth petition is No. P00024/21, which calls for an end to the Department of Foreign Affairs' boycott of international election observation missions run by the EU and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and comes from Mr. Michael Grange.  The recommendation is that the correspondence from the Department of Foreign Affairs be forwarded to the petitioner and in light of the response from the Department, that the petition be closed.  Do members have any views on this?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Our seventh petition is No. 34/21 regarding an exemption for foreign-trained doctors from the pre-registration examination system, PRES, 3 exam from a doctor.  I will not even try to pronounce the name - members will see it on the submission.  The recommendation is that correspondence from the Irish Medical Council be forwarded to the petitioner by way of an update on this petition.  Do members have views on this?  I raised this matter previously and asked the secretariat to write to the council.  Our lack of doctors in the country has been highlighted.  If there was some way of proceeding with PRES 3 exams at a quicker rate, it might help.  I suggest that we write to the council for an update and a response to the question of whether the exams can move faster.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Our eighth petition is No. 37/21, discrimination against non-EU doctors on the basis of the PRES 3 exam from a doctor.  Again, I will not try to pronounce the name.  The recommendation is that the correspondence from the Irish Medical Council be forwarded to the petitioner by way of an update and that a reminder be sent to the council to advise it that the Joint Committee on Public Petitions is awaiting a comprehensive reply.  Do members have views on this matter?  It is the same as the previous petition.  Once we get an update from the Irish Medical Council, we can get the petitioner's view.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Our ninth petition is No. 39/21, issues relating to the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces and the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) 2004 Act from Mr. Niall Donohoe.  The recommendation is that the correspondence from the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces be forwarded to Mr. Donohoe for information.  Do members have views of this matter?  Is that recommendation agreed?</p></speech>

It would be important to examine how many petitions we have taken compared with previously.  This year has been a difficult one to use in a comparison, but speaking as a newer member of the committee, it would be interesting to see what level of engagement we have had over the years month on month or whatever the case may be.  Perhaps we could put that on the agenda for our next meeting or the meeting after that.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  I endorse what Deputy Devlin said.  I see my old sparring partner, Senator Buttimer, is present.  He will recall from being on the previous committee that we were anxious to spread the message of what could be a fantastic committee.  It is one of the newest committees around Leinster House.  Senator Buttimer will recall something that might be of help, namely, that we had more or less agreed to take our message to the four provinces.  Of course, Covid has changed much of that.  I believe Deputy Buckley was on the committee as well, so he would know about this, too.  We were also contemplating contacting local authorities and seeing whether we could make presentations to them.  Deputy Devlin's point was well made.  This committee could do a great deal of good in representing the views of people on the ground on a range of issues.  Where everything else has failed for people, we can be a voice for their petitions that need more discussion.</p></speech>

I am on the housing committee, which also started at 1.30 p.m.  Could we try to do something with the time so that we are not starting at the same time as other committees?  If possible, even half an hour earlier would do.</p></speech>

Ours is an important committee that can give frustrated citizens an avenue for having their voices heard.  They may not like the answers to their petitions, but it gives them a process by which they can engage and be listened to and interacted with.  Those of us who have been on this committee this term and during the previous term recognise that there is a job of work to be done in educating and creating awareness.  Notwithstanding that Covid has placed restrictions on our ability to go out and engage people in person, might we give consideration to a virtual promulgation in parallel with an in-person approach?  This is an important committee that gives our citizens a right of access, and rightly so.  I support the remarks of Senator Murphy and Deputy Devlin in that regard, as well as those of Deputy O'Donoghue.</p></speech>

We all agree to those sentiments.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy O'Donoghue, the secretariat has tried.  We have even moved the days we meet because of clashes with other committees.  If it suits people, we might ask the secretariat to move a half hour either way.  I know that this meeting time clashes with other committees, but no matter what day the secretariat looked at, we would have been clashing.</p></speech>

The Houses of the Oireachtas Service will make a video with me as Chair to promote the Committee on Public Petitions.  It is talking about doing it at the end of the month.  It will be put up on the website.  I do not know how widely the Oireachtas will spread the video.  I will encourage it to spread it is widely as it possibly can through, for example, local authorities, to get feedback from the public and to inform the public.  As Senator Buttimer said, we need to educate the public on how to submit petitions and what can happen at committees.  The video is in the pipeline for the end of the month.</p></speech>

The figures increasing again will probably hold us back a bit until we are able to get out on the road.  If we are to sell this we need to get out to the four provinces where we will invite the regional and local media and do a presentation.  This would be very worthwhile.  We all know as representatives of the people that there are times when we get frustrated.  We think something should be changed for the benefit of people and it makes sense but we cannot get it through any other committee.  In this regard, we could be a saviour in many respects depending, of course, on the petitions we can accept.</p></speech>

Now that Covid is lifting, the press office in the Oireachtas should get the message out to the public so they can see how this committee works.  As everybody has said, it is a very important committee.  It can be very important to people at a local level with what may be considered minor issues.  For those who go to the trouble of submitting a petition, it is the big worry in their everyday lives, no matter what anybody else thinks about how big or small it is.  For the person who goes to the trouble of sending in a petition to our committee it needs to be recognised.</p> <p>  Deputy Devlin is still smiling.
