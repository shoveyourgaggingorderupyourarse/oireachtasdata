The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  I ask that members and all those in attendance to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19, particularly during the current surge.  They are strongly advised to leave at least one vacant seat between them and others attending and to use the sanitisers provided.  They should always maintain appropriate social distance before, during and after the meeting and wear masks at all times, except when speaking.  Members participating remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.</p> <p>  This morning, we will engage with officials from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to examine the 2020 appropriation account, Vote 33 - Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media; and, from the 2020 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts of the public services, chapter 7 - oversight of funding for the European Capital of Culture 2020 or Galway 2020, as it is referred to.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by a number of officials from the Department, which reflects the scope of the its responsibility.  In attendance are Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General; Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in, assistant secretary, tourism and sport division; Mr. Conor Falvey, assistant secretary, culture division; Ms. Patricia Murphy, assistant secretary, corporate affairs; Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill, assistant secretary, broadcasting and media division; Mr. Aodh&aacute;n Mac Cormaic, Sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir na Gaeilge; Ms Tania Banotti, director of Creative Ireland; and Mr. Joe Healy, principal officer, head of finance and IT.  We are also joined by remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Brian O'Malley, principal officer in the relevant Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p> <p>  I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so that we do not pick up background noise or feedback.  I remind all those attending to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references speakers may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precinct is protected pursuant to the constitutional statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the precincts and as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is present.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions under Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  To assist the broadcasting unit and the Debates Office, I ask members to direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not being directed to a specific witness, I ask that each witness to state his or her name the first time he or she contributes.</p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#A00500"><p>Vote 33 is effectively a new Vote developed in 2020 to reflect significant changes in the allocation of functions between Departments.  As a result, comparisons with 2019 are of limited value.  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 33 discloses total gross expenditure of &euro;972 million.  This was distributed across five expenditure programmes and included funding for a wide range of "downstream" agencies tasked with distributing grant assistance for activities and development in their respective areas.</p> <p>  Spending on the broadcasting programme amounted to &euro;271 million in 2020.  The majority of this, or &euro;237 million, was expended on grants to RT&Eacute; and TG4 to carry out their public service broadcasting commitments.  The Department spent more than &euro;242 million on the arts and culture programme in 2020.  This included &euro;105 million to support the operations of the Arts Council, contributions towards the expenses of a wide range of national and regional cultural bodies and &euro;7.1 million in funding for the European Capital of Culture 2020.  Expenditure on the sports and recreation services programme in 2020 was &euro;203 million.  This included &euro;163 million in funding for Sport Ireland.  The Department spent almost &euro;190 million under the tourism services programme.  Expenditure on the Gaeltacht programme was &euro;66 million in 2020.  </p> <p>  On the receipts side, appropriations-in-aid amounted to &euro;234 million in 2020, comprised mainly of &euro;223 million in broadcasting licence fee receipts.  The surplus on the Vote remaining at the year-end was just under &euro;50 million.  The Department carried over &euro;17 million to 2021 and the balance of &euro;33 million was due for surrender to the central fund of the Exchequer.  My audit report draws attention to a disclosure by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control that the Department incurred significant expenditure relating to goods and services where the procurement arrangements did not comply with procurement guidelines.  </p> <p>  Turning to chapter 7 of my report on the accounts of the public services for 2020, in July 2016, Galway was designated under an EU-supported scheme as the European Capital of Culture for 2020.  In support of the application for designation, the Department committed in principle to provide funding of &euro;15 million to the project.  The examination found that the programme delivery model was different from that previously used for similar events for other Irish cities.  An independent company trading under the name Galway 2020 was established to deliver the capital of culture programme of activities.  There was significant turnover in the membership of the company's board of directors together with significant changes early on in the executive leadership of the company.  The examination found that while initial financial reporting by the company was limited to what was required under the Companies Act, this was largely addressed in 2019 when the company registered as a charity.  This required significantly more detailed financial reporting, which is also appropriate for a body substantially funded by State grants.  It was originally envisaged that Exchequer funding for the capital of culture programme would not exceed 50% of the overall financial cost.  However, in the end, the programme relied on public sources for the majority of its funding.  Covid-19 restrictions significantly affected the delivery of the programme and impacted box office receipts but sponsorship support was also much less than envisaged even before the pandemic became an issue.  At the time of completing this report, independent evaluators were in the process of formally assessing the effectiveness of the Galway 2020 capital of culture programme.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas freisin le hOifig an Ard-Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste as an mbealach proifisi&uacute;nta a rinne a cuid oifigeach an obair a bh&iacute; riachtanach i nd&aacute;il leis an gcuntas sin.</p> <p>  I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address the committee at what I believe is a very critical period in time for the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  As I address the committee, I am extremely cognisant of all of the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic across society.  This is particularly pertinent in respect of the sectors served by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  These sectors are fundamentally about people, audiences and participation.  They include the arts sector, live entertainment and cultural events, which includes artists, entertainers and audiences; sporting participants and spectators; hotels, restaurants, bars or tourism attractions and services and the tourists and patrons who enjoy these facilities; and students attending col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh, the col&aacute;ist&iacute;, mn&aacute; t&iacute; and halla&iacute; pobal that support this experience and businesses in Gaeltacht regions.</p><p>Our national and local media have also been critical stakeholders right throughout the pandemic.  They have provided important public information and debate throughout the crisis, while also experiencing their own challenges. </p><p> The impact of the pandemic on all these sectors is well documented.  Employing many hundreds of thousands of people, right across the country, these are the sectors that thrive when people congregate to enjoy their leisure time together.  They were the first to close as a result of the pandemic, and they are among the last to return to full operations as restrictions ease.  In response to the impact of Covid-19 across these sectors, the Department introduced several new schemes and initiatives over the past 18 months.  These include the Covid-19 business continuity scheme, business adaptation schemes and restart grants for the tourism and hospitality sectors; a significant suite of supports for live performance across the events and entertainment industries; a support package for the sports sector, encompassing the IRFU, GAA, FAI, the national governing bodies of sport and clubs and communities; measures to support the Irish summer colleges sector; and measures to support media, and the independent and local radio sector in particular.  These measures are all in addition to the significant suite of cross-sectoral supports that the Government has introduced.</p><p> The staff of the Department and its agencies have worked tirelessly to design and implement a wide range of initiatives and programmes in the optimal manner to focus the supports where most needed, while simultaneously pivoting to a new way of working that did not involve physical attendance at the office.  The supports put in place needed to be flexible and dynamic in response to an ever-changing environment, and that still remains the position as we continue to monitor and assess the impact of both the pandemic and the mitigating interventions.</p><p> Regarding my appearance here, the briefing note provided to the committee outlines the background to the establishment of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in 2020 and some of the key outputs of the Department in that year, by programme area, and it also provides details regarding the Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture project, which is the subject of chapter 7 of the report of the Controller and Auditor General for 2020.  </p><p> The European Capital of Culture is the longest running and one of the most high-profile European Union actions in the cultural space.  It has been a great honour for Galway to hold the designation from February 2020 to April 2021, despite the complications that Covid-19 presented.  During its designated year, Galway 2020 supported more than 600 artists and other cultural workers, such as producers, technicians and crew, to deliver more than 500 events through a combination of physical and online events in what was an unprecedented global pandemic.  In delivering this programme, Galway 2020 employed a dynamic volunteer programme, consisting of more than 800 volunteers from 50 countries, and a strong community engagement programme, as well as vibrant international and partnership programmes. </p><p> As Accounting Officer for the Department, I welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General's examination of the oversight of funding for the European Capital of Culture 2020 project.  I accept the recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General on foot of the detailed examination, as outlined in chapter 7 of the 2020 report, and I will continue to work to ensure that all relevant grant management provisions are fully incorporated and implemented as part of future oversight of and reporting on grants.</p><p> I reiterate my commitment as Accounting Officer to ensuring that all projects under the remit of the Department are managed in accordance with the provisions of the public spending code and all relevant circulars.  We will continue to take lessons from the past to ensure that we have the most appropriate and effective structures and processes in place to deliver effectively for all our stakeholders, many of whom have been and continue to be adversely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  I am happy to expand on any of these areas.  I have brought my full management board team with me today because of the breadth, range and depth of our programmes.  Therefore, we are very happy to expand on any of the programme areas.    </p></speech>

Her Department covers a wide range of issues and areas.  I have some questions.  Focusing on RT&Eacute;, and looking at its accounts, that organisation has run a deficit for six consecutive years.  RT&Eacute;'s income has reduced by &euro;100 million in the same period, while costs have increased by &euro;30 million.  Land was sold in the last year as well.  In addition, in 2019, RT&Eacute; recorded borrowings of &euro;95 million.  The director general of RT&Eacute;, Dee Forbes, described the situation as "unsustainable".</p> <p>  The overall picture with this commercial semi-State, which comes under the remit of the Department, looks to be far from secure.  We have concerns about this aspect, and Ms Licken might like to comment in this regard.  Does she see RT&Eacute; perhaps requiring some kind of a State bailout?  Are we facing into a crisis with the organisation?  I would like Ms Licken to outline, briefly, her Department's take on the current situation.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Katherine Licken" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#B00300"><p>RT&Eacute; demonstrated how important public service broadcasting really is during the pandemic.  It provided critical information.  The evidence is there to show that people rely on RT&Eacute; as a trusted source of information.  Good and transparent public service media, and good media overall, are important for a well-functioning democracy.  It was precisely for this reason that the Future of Media Commission was established.  It is in the programme for Government.  The commission has completed its deliberations, and those are being considered by the Minister and the Taoiseach.  Part of those deliberations concerned looking at public service broadcasting and the wider media landscape.</p> <p>  To address the Chair's question, we do monitor RT&Eacute;'s financial position closely.  It was in surplus in 2020.  As I said, the Future of Media Commission is a policy matter for Ministers, but we are working closely with RT&Eacute;, with NewERA, which has a role in the governance of RT&Eacute;, and with the BAI to monitor the situation closely.  We are conscious of the importance of RT&Eacute;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#B00400"><p>Ms Licken is the Accounting Officer for the Department, and we understand that RT&Eacute; is an independent commercial semi-State organisation, but a large part of its funding comes through the Department.  Ms Licken outlined those figures in the documents she sent to us for today's meeting.  Is she concerned now, however, at the financial state of RT&Eacute;?  I ask that because the situation looks to be far from healthy.  Costs have increased and income has reduced dramatically.  Land can be sold, but that can only be done once.  There has also been substantial borrowing.  The most recent figure I could find in that regard was for 2019, when it was &euro;95 million.  Is the situation at RT&Eacute; sustainable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Katherine Licken" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#B00500"><p>RT&Eacute; has exercised great judgement and management in this regard.  It has cost-cutting measures in place, and it is working to contain its costs as best as is possible.  We are working closely with the organisation in that regard.  I should stress that RT&Eacute;'s funding comes from the television licence fee, as set out in statute.  The money that comes into our Vote is, to all intents and purposes, a pass-through.  It comes in from the television licence fee and then it goes out to RT&Eacute;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#B00600"><p>I understand that.  An internal memo in Ms Licken's Department earlier in the year, however, referred to the finances of RT&Eacute; as not being "sustainable" and that they "were undermining its capacity" to perform its role.  Can Ms Licken confirm if that is accurate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Katherine Licken" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#B00700"><p>We are of course concerned, and we will always be concerned, about funding for public service broadcasting.  We will always be concerned, generally, about RT&Eacute;'s funding position.  It is for that reason, and in that policy context, that the Future of Media Commission was put in place to examine the future not just of public service broadcasting, as encompassed by RT&Eacute;, but also of the media generally.  It is right, therefore, to say that there are concerns.  It is also right to say that the Government is acting on those concerns and that the Department is working closely with RT&Eacute; regarding its financial position.  The organisation's surplus in 2020 was &euro;7.9 million.  Therefore, some of the predicted shortfalls did not emerge as anticipated, and that was good news.</p></speech>

It does not get funding directly from the Department, other than through the licence fee.</p><p>That is the mechanism by which it is funded so it does not seek funding directly from the Department.  It got additional funding last year in respect of the free licences from the Department of Social Protection for pensioners.  That is a long-established mechanism, but the Department does not fund RT&Eacute; directly through any line item in its Vote, other than passing through the TV licence.</p></speech>

I wish to focus in the first instance on cultural institutions, programme B, specifically subheads B1 through to B15, of the tourism, culture, arts, Gaeltacht, sport and media Vote.  The entire budget of the Department is rapidly nudging up to &euro;1 billion.  As a result, I assume that will give rise to many new challenges.  Under the Project 2040 national development plan, NDP, there is &euro;460 million allocated to the national cultural institutions investment programme.  The projects incorporated into that programme include the conversion of the Bishop Street warehouse into a secure, environmentally controlled archival repository for the National Archives, the National Library of Ireland redevelopment, the development of the Crawford Art Gallery in my native Cork and the proposal to renovate the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Museum of Ireland, the National Concert Hall, the Abbey Theatre and the Chester Beatty Library.  The National Museum of Ireland is preparing a design procurement of the history of Ireland galleries.</p> <p>  All are laudable projects and are to be supported.  However, they will all bring challenges for the Department.  The big shift in the spending capacity of the Department in respect of these cultural institutions under the NDP gives rise to a number of specific questions.  First, what expertise and systems have increased at Department level to ensure the efficient disbursement of funding for approved capital development projects?</p></speech>

This is a very welcome injection of funds.  As the Deputy will know from the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork, many of these institutions have not seen major redevelopment for many years and, in some cases, centuries, for example, the Natural History Museum.  This is welcome funding.  The first phase of the refurbishment of the National Gallery of Ireland led the way in terms of showing what can be done in the cultural institutions when investment is provided.  On foot of us receiving that money, we moved immediately to establish a dedicated team, composed principally of economists, that oversees our investment programme and particularly the investment in the cultural institutions.  That is the Project Ireland 2040 team that we established a number of years ago.  The purpose of the team is to ensure the institutions walk carefully through the public spending code and the capital works framework when undertaking their investments.  Many of the institutions are now in progress with regard to those investments.  Obviously, we work closely with the Office of Public Works, OPW, too.  It delivers the projects for us.  We are also working closely with RT&Eacute;.  I might ask Mr. Conor Falvey to speak in a little more detail on the individual programmes.</p></speech>

First, who will be responsible for procurement and project management for the capital development projects in the cultural institutions?  What is the precise role of the Department, the cultural institution and, where applicable, the OPW in this?  Who ultimately manages those relationships?  Who undertakes the procurement and daily project oversight?  Who signs off on procurement and spending, the Department or the cultural institution?  If overspends occur and if the Legislature, through this committee, needs to interrogate certain issues, who will appear before this committee?  Looking at the projects I referred to, it is statistically possible there might be issues that may arise in respect of overspends and public procurement that may give rise to questions that have to be answered.  If overspends occur, who would appear before this committee?  Would it be the Secretary General and her Department or the cultural institution?  Furthermore, what additional resources and expertise have been made available to the cultural institutions to deal with this increased oversight and workload?  That is just one parcel of questions.  There are further questions on this issue.</p></speech>

The Department is the approving authority, the relevant national cultural institution is the sponsoring agency and the OPW is the contracting authority.  If something goes wrong, the committee will have us back before it and, perhaps, the OPW as the contracting authority.  We are very conscious of that.  It has to be borne in mind that some of these projects are old buildings so there is always the risk of finding something that was not anticipated.  For that reason the public spending code and the capital works framework allows to us to have a phase of investigation work.  That is ongoing at the National Library at present.  It is a detailed investigation.  Once we have cleared the books out of the site we have contractors to go in and carry out a detailed investigation of what is there, the conditions there and what difficulties are likely to arise.  That is before one goes to detailed planning and contracting, so one can get a better estimate of the cost.</p></speech>

The context in which I ask these questions is that I worry that the voluntary boards of the institutions that are earmarked for capital development projects, notwithstanding their expertise on cultural and governance matters, might not have expertise on procurement matters.  With this money coming down the track to these laudable projects, I worry that there might not be the capacity within the institutions to be able to have that expertise.  I am trying to tease out whether it is the intention of the Department to buttress those institutions with additional skill sets as befit the specific project as it arises.  The Secretary General said a dedicated team has been established comprising economists.  I would like to be assured whether there are teams of procurement specialists and governance specialists being readied for the delivery of these projects.  There is a gap there and it is giving rise to concern.  I do not feel assured by the answers so far, if I may say that.</p></speech>

All of the projects have oversight groups in place.  In earlier stages, we call them interim working groups.  They comprise officials from the Department, the government unit within the Department that oversees the individual institutions, the Project Ireland 2040 office, the OPW and the cultural institutions.  We provide resources to the cultural institutions to procure the design, expertise and project-management expertise and to manage the current project phase.  Separate from that, the Department and the OPW have a programme-level oversight group that overviews all the projects.  It includes the commissioner, the State architect, me, my colleague, Ms Murphy, from our government side, and various representatives from the OPW and the Department.  We work very closely with the institutions.  We are moving them all very carefully through the various phases under the public expenditure code.</p> <p>  On the code, there are a number of decision gates, covering strategic assessment, the business case, pre-tender approval, approval to proceed and the final business case.  All of those are subject to the approval of the Minister.  The groups typically meet every two months, or eight weeks, depending on the phase of the project.  The models we have had have been based on the lessons from the National Gallery, whose transformation was very successful.  As the Secretary General alluded to, we have completed phase 1 of the works at the National Library.  This has seen a significant risk to a national collection in the west wing of the National Library completely mitigated, which is a very significant outcome.  As we move to the next phase, investigative works are being done by the OPW to establish the physical fabric of the building, as the Secretary General referred to in order that we can have a good evidence basis for estimating the cost of the next phase of the works, which in turn will inform the design before we go to procurement, etc.  That is an overview.  If there is anything the Deputy would like me to elaborate on, I will be happy to do so.</p></speech>

We will examine the matter further as time goes on.  I thank the witnesses for that.</p> <p>  I want to move on to a quite bespoke issue, namely, that of storage within the cultural institutions.  My understanding is that there is a storage facility for the National Museum which is housed in Swords.  The National Museum of Ireland's collections resource centre in Swords houses 4 million objects.  This is an extraordinary figure.  What does the future hold for the storage of the key objects in our national collections, regardless of the institution?  I understand that, in the case of the National Museum of Ireland, there are only eight years remaining on the existing lease and that a rent review that was due in September 2020 has still not been concluded.  If we are seeking to animate any of the projects I outlined, we will have to decant many of the artefacts or pieces, be they artistic or otherwise, to other sites.  How are the witnesses dealing with the issue of the storage of these precious items within our national collections, specifically in the National Museum of Ireland?  What are the witnesses doing to ensure there is a sustainable storage facility for the National Museum of Ireland and other cultural institutions?</p></speech>

The storage issue is very important to us.  We have worked very closely with the National Museum of Ireland on storage.  The museum uses the storage facility not only for storage but also for researchers coming to access the collections to work on them.  I might ask Mr. Falvey to go into more detail.  We have a lot of engagement.  The facility is under contract with the OPW.  We have had an awful lot of engagement with the National Museum of Ireland and the OPW in respect of this particular site.</p></speech>

I asked a specific question about rent reviews.  What was the outcome of the rent review?

I wish to pick up on one of the points made by Deputy Sherlock regarding the cultural institutions.  I visited the National Library about ten years ago and was horrified by the conditions in which the collection were then being held.  I am very pleased that a significant risk to the collection has been mitigated.  Work is absolutely necessary.  The same applies to the National Archives and the problems with storage.  I am completely on board regarding the need for these projects.</p> <p>  Let me pick up on the point on controlling costs.  With regard to the National Gallery, I understand the original Estimate was around &euro;25 million.  Is it the case that it came in at &euro;52 million and that there is conciliation at the moment?  What is the story with that?</p></speech>

At that point, the Government will need to take a decision as to whether to proceed with the bid.  The Ryder Cup-----</p></speech>

I want to turn quickly to Galway 2020 and the amount of sponsorship.  It was anticipated that there would have been more sponsorship than there was.  At what point did the Department realise that it would go beyond the 50% expenditure that was committed?  Indeed, when one starts adding in the contributions of the local authorities, it was not far off an 80% spend.  At what point did the Department realise that there would not be the anticipated sponsorship and that there was not the local commercial commitment?</p></speech>

This was to be one of its finest moments.  Obviously, the pandemic had a huge impact on Galway 2020, like it has done on so many other sectors.  The combined public sector funding - not just the Exchequer funding, but the combined funding of the Exchequer, the local authorities and other sources of funding for that project - was to be 85%.  That was the combination.  The programme was launched in February 2019 and the pandemic hit in March.  It became clear to us quickly that some elements of the funding would not materialise.  On the local authority funding, local authorities were hit hard by loss of income from sources such as parking, rates, etc.  We then had a decision to make whether we would continue with Galway 2020.  The 50% Exchequer funding was a guide, which we put out when we first asked the cities of Ireland to put in bids.  We said that there would be a guide of either &euro;15 million, which was even at that stage only a guide, and 50% of the cost funded by the Exchequer.</p></speech>

We need to see a report on this from the Department.  Are assets owned as a legacy of this?  Who owns them?  Did the model that was ultimately decided on work?  Has the Department reviewed it?

The 356 percussion instruments, which were part of an element of the project, have been donated to the Galway-Roscommon Education and Training Board, ETB, for use in music generation.  Following the expiry of its lease on 31 March 2021, Galway 2020 officially moved from 16 Merchants Road to its new office in the Wave Maker hub at the Cornstore in Middle Street, Galway.  Prior to that, the assets identified for disposal included furniture, fixtures, fittings, ICT and technology equipment.  Approval was obtained from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the disposal of assets.

I want to touch on RT&Eacute;.  Ms Licken said the funding for RT&Eacute; comes through her Department, but we know that RT&Eacute; is funded through the television licence.  RT&Eacute; accounts for nearly 25% of the total expenditure.  The funding comes through the Department and it is tasked with handing the funding over.  I want to touch on the fact that RT&Eacute; recently made a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners for &euro;1.2 million, which arose from the misclassification of workers or, effectively, bogus self-employment.  In June, in correspondence with the committee, Ms Licken had indicated that she could not engage on the subject as it was part of an ongoing process with the Revenue Commissioners.  Now that the settlement has been made, what actions have the Department taken in response?  Has it done anything in response to that settlement being made?</p></speech>

These are operational matters for RT&Eacute;.  Obviously, we are conscious of them.  However, they are operational matters for RT&Eacute;.  RT&Eacute; has appeared before the committee and has undertaken has appear again before the committee on the matter.  The matter is apparently still under consideration by the Department of Social Protection.  There is a process ongoing.  Ms Murphy might like to comment further on that.</p></speech>

The outcome of that report is awaited.  RT&Eacute; has put in place an employment-first policy, which we are aware of, to address future issues arising.  The Department is happy with progress in that regard.</p></speech>

We have quarterly governance meetings on issues that arise.  The terms and conditions of staff are a matter for RT&Eacute;.  It is independent in that regard under the Broadcasting Act.  As I mentioned, these are complex employment law issues.  Revenue and the Department of Social Protection are best advised on contract and service issues.

I recently engaged with RT&Eacute; regarding pay disparity that has been ongoing between cl&aacute;r reachtair&iacute; and their English-language counterparts.  It seems that workers are essentially being paid less if they work through the medium of Irish.  I understand that has been going on for approximately 20 years.  RT&Eacute; at the time claimed to be unaware of it, which surprised me.  It said it would follow up with a note, but it did not do that.  It reneged on that.  It said it was carrying out a review, which could take months or years, or might never see the light of day.  Ms Murphy spoke about transparency earlier.  A hell of a lot of public money is involved and one would be concerned.  The Department is responsible for the media and the Gaeltacht.  Would our guests have any particular interest in an organisation that gets its funding through the Department implementing, if you like, a sliding scale of wages, based on the language that people work through?  Surely our guests would have some concerns about that.</p></speech>

As the Department with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, we are always concerned about funding for the Irish language and actions to promote it.  We increased the funding to TG4 last year and this year.  We understand that RT&Eacute; is conducting a comparative review of the remuneration of Irish-speaking workers.  It has run a public tender to engage an expert partner with specific experience in the media sector to carry out a full evaluation of all staff roles and grades in RT&Eacute;.  Irish-language roles will be part of the review, which will commence on completion of the tender process.  It is important.</p> <p>  On the question of the oversight of RT&Eacute;, we have the BAI, ourselves and NewERA.  There is extensive oversight of RT&Eacute;.  Issues will obviously always arise from time to time with any entity and it is important that issues are addressed promptly.</p></speech>

This has been going on for 20 years.  It was only when it was flagged and people persistently chased it that RT&Eacute; did what it is doing.  We have, as yet, nothing concrete from RT&Eacute;.  There has been a lack of oversight and, for 20 years, there has been a sliding scale of wages.</p></speech>

All I can say is I welcome the fact it is doing a review now and looking at the issue.  It is complex.  Perhaps Ms Murphy would like to add to that.  It is a complex area.  RT&Eacute; is a large organisation with a wider variety of different grade structures.</p></speech>

No action was taken by the Department.  That is worrying.</p></speech>

I have questions about sports capital grants and the underspend in 2020.  I think there was a &euro;14 million underspend from a budget of &euro;28 million.  I am concerned about that because the grants provided to sporting bodies are essential to continue to upgrade facilities.  Why was no provision made for that money to be carried over to allow sports bodies the time to complete those projects?</p><p>Was there a particular reason that was not extended?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Katherine Licken" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#G00200"><p>I will ask my colleague, Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in, to come in more detail on this.  What I would say is there is provision for the Department to carry over funding under the public spending code.  A percentage of its capital funding can be carried over from one year to the next.  We carried over &euro;7.6 million from 2020 into 2021.  Just because the year ends, it does not mean projects lose their funding.  The commitment to funding them remains.  Covid played havoc with the ability of some of the sports clubs to draw down their money to get matched funding and construction contracts in place.  I will ask Mr. &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in to give more detail, but when a grant is in place, it continues.  Whether it is this year or next year, the commitment to the grant continues and if there is a question of a project not being able to draw it down, we engage very extensively.  Ultimately, we would take the grant back, eventually, but only as a last resort.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#G00300"><p>The Secretary General has emphasised the most important point in all of this, which is that due to the cyclical nature of how sports capital grants are awarded, drawn down and paid, there can often be underspend, but no individual club will ever miss out.  Due process is given to them.  It can take them a number of years to draw down grants.  We currently have more than 2,000 older grants on the system dating back a number of years and there is potentially more than &euro;60 million payable there, but those individual grants might not be drawn down for a number of years.  Individual clubs might have legal issues they need to clarify in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor.  There might be questions of matched funding, etc.  However, we take a very sympathetic approach to them.  If a club has been validly awarded a grant, we will do everything to try to work with it to make sure it can be drawn down.  In terms of the underspend, we carried over as much of the underspend as allowed under public accounting rules.  The bottom line is that no club will miss out and we are constantly working with them to encourage them to draw down and manage budgets over successive years.</p></speech>

The first is that they have submitted the applications before the rise in building costs and the second challenge they have is that they are not able to do the same level of fundraising.  Will the Department make provision for, and be more aware of, the challenges organisations now have and take that into account when dealing with these applications and the carryover?</p></speech>

The closing date for the sports capital current round was 1 March.  We have been pushing to try to have those grants awardable this side of Christmas.  It is now possible it might be in the early weeks of January before that happens.  What the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, is trying to do is to ensure there is as much funding as possible there to recognise the increased costs and ensure valid applicants get a sufficient amount that will enable them to proceed with their project.  One of our key jobs over the coming weeks will be to maximise that pot.  I am sure the Minister of State may be having bilateral conversations with Ministers with deeper pockets - anything to ensure we can maximise the round that will be announced in January.</p></speech>

Some &euro;40 million is available and &euro;16 million has been allocated for equipment.  Is it possible these applications will be dealt with together with the budget for 2022?  I know the witnesses cannot say that will happen.  However, rather than people having to do the whole process all over again in 2022, is it feasible to do it as a two-year project rather than a one-year project, in view of the restrictions on voluntary organisations over the past 18 months?</p></speech>

That was a subset of what was the largest ever round and ask we have received under the sports capital programme.  We are finalising the process of review of those applications.  There is nothing further for those who have applied under that process to do.  There has been significant interaction with them since 1 March because, as the Deputy probably knows, there is now an opportunity for clubs to mend their hand if they have made an administrative or other error in their application.  The critical issue for us is to maximise the available pot of funding for what will probably be an early January announcement.  That is our number one ask of others and task for ourselves in order that we can ensure we can give every valid club as much as possible to allow their projects to proceed.</p></speech>

Our business is to try to get the money out to the clubs for the betterment of communities.  That is what we do.  Every time there is a round of the sports capital programme, Mr. &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in and the team review to see how it worked and what did or did not go well.  All of this is done with a view to finding what works for communities and clubs in order to get good infrastructure out to them.  We will continue that.</p></speech>

The Department made a grant of &euro;130,000 available to that project, which is a huge contribution.  The project cost more than &euro;460,000, so the &euro;130,000 grant from the Department was very welcome.</p> <p>  Do we learn from previous experiences with the capital of culture?  I was Lord Mayor of Cork in 2003-04.  In 2005-06, Cork was the European Capital of Culture.  The same mistakes seem to have been made in Galway as were made in Cork back in 2005-06.  Surely the Department should have a protocol in place in order that there is a clear plan in place for projects such as this, rather than trying to make it up as we go along, as seems to have happened with Galway.  The same thing happened in Cork.  I am being up-front about that.  We could get far better delivery on these projects if we had a clear plan, rather than making them up as go along.  Has the Department looked at that, especially the issue of securing European funding?  There is European funding for culture and so on and I am not sure we are making every effort to get it.  Will Ms Licken outline what engagement we have at European level and address the issue of having appropriate structures in place when we secure funding and ensuring we get good value for money?</p></speech>

Of course we learn from previous capitals of culture.  We had a national capital of culture in Limerick in 2014.  There was a review of that which fed into Galway 2020.  We had very robust governance arrangements and significant consultation in the run-up to Galway 2020.</p> <p>  The European Commission runs a compendium of all of the findings of the various European cities of culture in order to inform whichever country is doing it at a given time.  The title comes around maybe once every 15 years so it is important that is done.  This time, for the first year ever, the Commission has looked for member states to do a review immediately afterwards.  We have a review of Galway city of culture, which is nearing completion.  That will be very important to input, not just for us, but for other member states.</p> <p>  What really went wrong with Galway city of culture was Covid and, notwithstanding that, it produced an astounding array of events.  Many artists and artistic workers pivoted online and reached huge audiences worldwide that they might not have otherwise reached.</p><p>They were some benefits to it.  I will ask Mr. Falvey to come in with more detail.  What proceeded, proceeded really well.  People will be familiar with some of the larger events such as DruidGregory, the Galway International Arts Festival and Macnas.</p></speech>

There are reviews of all European cities of culture.  There was a national city of culture.

Is the Department happy with the process that is in place?  Is Ms Licken satisfied that an adequate process with regard to salary structures, employment status, etc., was not in place for quite a number of years?  At any point during that time, did the Department have any direct contact with RT&Eacute; on the questions with regard to the salary structure within RT&Eacute; and the employment structures, particularly in regard to self-employment status?  Would that issue have been raised with RT&Eacute; at any point?</p></speech>

These issues predate RT&Eacute; coming under the remit of the Department.  It is key that where issues arise, they are identified, that the systems are in place to identify them and that they are dealt with swiftly once identified.  The issue in regard to the contracts, as I understand and through our engagement with RT&Eacute; and the Committee of Public Accounts engagement with RTE, the matter has been dealt with with Revenue and is continuing to be dealt with by the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

Ms Licken said that at the governance meetings issues that have been identified are raised, but that she is not sure of the structure that ensures that issues can be caught early.  In other words, she is not sure that they can be addressed before they are raised, specifically in terms of contracts.  I note Ms Licken's point that an Accounting Officer cannot ever be satisfied that something would not be possible.  Is she satisfied that the governance structures in place would quickly and swiftly identify issues and address them?</p></speech>

It is good to see many of them at the Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p>  At the outset, I want to refer to the breadth of her organisation.  Ms Licken referred to it in her own opening remarks.  I note some members have focused in on RT&Eacute; and others on the European Capital of Culture 2020.  I will touch on a number of other elements within both the accounts and other areas.</p> <p>  The first I wanted to touch on was something I raised on the previous occasion we engaged, and that was around the television licence.  Obviously, things have changed in terms of the pandemic and the need for inspectors to do other work.  For how long were the television inspectors suspended from their ordinary work during the course of the pandemic?  What impact did that suspension of television licence inspections have on the collection rate of 2020 and 2021?  That will be my first question.</p></speech>

In terms of 2020, in the period from 13 March to the end of 2020, inspectors could only operate as normal for two months.  They were off the road completely for four months and they operated on a non-contact basis for three and a half months.  The latter involved putting cards in letter-boxes but not knocking on doors.  In 2021, there was no physical activity at the doors by the licence inspectors for four months, non-contact only resumed on 10 May and full inspections resumed from 14 June.</p> <p>  Obviously, this had an impact on the licence fee receipts, with a sharp decline in sales for the first half of the year and marginal recovery in the middle of the year - this was in 2020 when restrictions eased.  The second lockdown was put in place then, in autumn 2020, which meant that sales did not recover to the levels it expected.  The fact that licence fee revenue remained static at &euro;222 million in 2020 is largely due to the increased Exchequer contribution from the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

I do not know if the people who pay them would exactly classify them as sales.</p> <p>  In terms of the money that has not been collected, is there a plan to try to collect that at some point?</p></speech>

Obviously, the Decade of Centenaries is a really important programme that we lead on in this Department.  We had a comprehensive programme of events and initiatives in 2020 across 31 local authorities.  We increased the funding to the local authorities in 2021 to &euro;50,000 per local authority - &euro;2 million in funding for the local authorities in general.  To date, we have had key exhibitions, outreach programmes and digitisation programmes in our national cultural institutions, including a recent partnership with the National Archives of Ireland and the embassy in London on the Anglo-Irish Treaty.  We have a new artist in residence programme in a number of the cultural institutions, the Military Archives and, of course, there is the Beyond 2022 project, which is the records that were burned 100 years ago.  We have a new national poetry project, which has been launched in partnership with UCD and Poetry Ireland.  We have the well-established Mn&aacute; 100 new online platform and we have a range of partnerships with rich online content, which has been really important over the past two years, in partnership with both Boston College and RT&Eacute;.</p> <p>  Given the importance of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, a range of activities will be rolled out in the coming weeks, including the current production of "The Treaty", at the National Concert Hall, a ground-breaking production, with ANU and Theo Dorgan, on the Treaty debates, which will go live at the end of this year and into 2023, a new concert at the concert hall featuring contemporary-----</p></speech>

They are hampered too.  I accept that.</p> <p>  I see Ms Banotti there.  We spoke previously about Creative Ireland.  Since we last spoke, I want to commend the work, particularly in the 24 DEIS schools on Fighting Words, that programme that was very well received, as well as the creative youth projects and others.  It is important to acknowledge that work.  Mr. Falvey mentioned the local authorities.  It is important that there is good collaboration between the Department and Creative Ireland, and I thank them for that.</p> <p>  Turning to the appropriation account, there is a note here about six contracts to the value of &euro;578,000 for non-compliance.  The majority of that was cleaning and other utility contracts.  However, the sixth one relates to genealogy services in the National Archives of Ireland and it has now been re-tendered.  Could Ms Licken outline what happened in that regard?  There are nine other contracts as well but I will get on to that in a second.</p></speech>

I have it here.  We will come back to the committee, probably later today, with a note on these projects, because a note has been requested on them.  A lot of them were contracts which we picked up.  When we talk about governance, it was our own governance system that picked up the fact that these contracts had expired and had not been retendered.</p> <p>  A procurement manager has now been appointed for the genealogy service in the National Archives of Ireland.  A new genealogical service contract was put in place in June 2021.  Mr. Falvey might have more details on the contract.</p></speech>

I await the note on that.  I apologise, as I have limited time.</p> <p>  There is a note as well on the procedures and control changes within the Department as a result of Covid-19.  Ms Licken specifically mentioned risk register details, and controls and actions needed to mitigate risks and assign responsibilities for co-operation and controls to staff.  Has that process been concluded now?  Is it correct that those new roles have been assigned within the Department?</p></speech>

I ask the Deputy to bear with me for a moment.  Obviously, we had to update the risk register in respect of Covid-19, because it did not just affect this Department in terms of everybody having to work online, it affected us deeply in terms of how we had to pivot our focus on our work to support the sectors.  As I said in my opening remarks, we are very much an audience-facing Department, one that is about people, that is, people congregating, socialising and playing sport.  We had to re-evaluate all our work programmes and we have taken on board some areas, for example, in the live entertainment sector, dealing with stakeholders that we never dealt with before because they were out in the commercial market making money and they did not need recourse to the State.  We updated all our risk registers to take account of Covid-19.  We set up a specific Covid unit in the Department.  Those positions are in place a long time and the team is still working flat out, engaging with the stakeholders, and designing programmes.</p></speech>

There was an underspend of &euro;6 million in 2020.  The Department attributed that to a number of large-scale projects that did not progress due to the time frame relating to various issues, including Covid-19 delays.  Ms Licken stated that the full underspend was to be carried forward into 2021.  Could she provide some detail on that?  What large-scale cultural infrastructure and development projects were not progressed in 2020 due to Covid-19 reasons?</p></speech>

I was having difficulty turning off the mute button on the mic.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Falvey, to come in on this in a moment.  We have a large cultural infrastructure programme of &euro;460 million for the development of cultural institutions.  Thankfully, none of those projects were in construction phase during Covid.  The National Library of Ireland is in the investigative works stage.  It decanted all of the books out of the dangerous area to which the Vice Chair referred that was a risk to the books.  They were decanted to another part of the library.  The investigative works are ongoing but those works were delayed because of the restrictions on construction, but there was not a construction contract, as such, in place there.</p> <p>  Is Deputy Carroll MacNeill thinking about capital projects?  A lot of the initiatives and performances abroad that we were to fund under Culture Ireland did not happen because of the restrictions.</p></speech>

What I want to try to get a handle on first is what has been put off on the capital side of things and also if there were increased costs associated with Covid delays, especially during 2020.  We know that 2021 has been slightly different.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Katherine Licken" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#L00800"><p>Increased costs have not necessarily materialised as yet, but we do know that we will be going to contract on a number of the projects.</p><p>For example, the Crawford Art Gallery project is at design phase now with a view to going to planning.  We know the cost of material has increased considerably in the past number of years and we are anticipating cost increases as a result when we go to tender.  Everything will go to tender in the normal fashion and investigative works are part of the process of finding the actual cost.</p><p> Many projects relevant to members of the committee have proceeded.  For example, there is the Butler Gallery, Kilkenny, the Tullamore arts centre, the Mary Robinson Centre, Ballina and Townhall Cavan.  These are projects that have been ongoing and have not been necessarily impacted.  There is also the Wexford Opera House development as well, which has &euro;1 million for capital works.  Mr. Falvey might speak further to this.  We were kind of fortunate we were not at the construction phase in the big projects.  At the same time there is an obvious impact.  For example, personnel could not get into the National Library to do the on-site investigation works.</p></speech>

For example, there is 10% to 15% for planning and design, etc., and that is not in the construction phase.  With the construction projects that were under way or due to be under way, there was a hiatus with the library at the investigative works stage.  In respect of the National Archives, there were two issues.  The asbestos matter held us up for a period and, in addition, we had the withdrawal of a contractor.  That will lead to an increase in overall costs for the project of approximately &euro;500,000 for a &euro;24 million project.  That is not related to Covid-19 <i>per se</i>but rather contractors having put in bids that they may now struggle to hold to.  This is a matter we are monitoring carefully.  The design of the programme carries with it contingency permissions at different phases to ensure all these measures are planned for and managed.  If there are any pressures on cost, they are identified at an appropriate stage and subject to appropriate approvals as part of the management of the programme.</p></speech>

An exhibition by Ms Jane Fogarty in the new Orleans gallery in Ottawa, Canada, was postponed.  A presentation by Poetry Ireland in The Writing Center at Harvard in Boston was cancelled.  There are more as well.  The purpose of Culture Ireland is to fund artists going abroad and make presentations.  The 20th Annual Irish Film Festival in Boston, screening contemporary Irish film in Somerville, Massachusetts, was postponed.  The Fidget Feet presentation with Arcadia Spectacular at the Glastonbury music festival was postponed.  A presentation of the Pan Pan Theatre's <i>Eliza's Adventures in the Uncanny Valley</i>at the Forum Freies Theater in D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany, was withdrawn.

I also get the flavour of how much opportunity was missed both in the execution of the work and, more important, for the artists who would have had an opportunity and platform from that.  It sounds like a long list.</p> <p>  From the much more prosaic perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts, what is the cost of losing those opportunities?  Was there a significant cost to all of those not going ahead?  Were we already tied into contracts or anything of that nature?  I am nearly sorry to have to ask this, given what was lost, but this is the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

It is of interest to us because of its historical significance but it belongs to that Department.  Its Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, brought a report to the Government in March 2021 on the monument and developments there.  That was the Moore Street advisory group's final report to the Minister, which was presented to the Cabinet on 11 May.  The buildings are in the ownership of the State and plans are under way for the sensitive and respectful restoration of the monument, along with the visitor centre to the rear.

It is somewhat disappointing that the announcement timeline is being extended because only last week I called all those I am advocating for to say it would be the end of November.  It is very important from a community and social perspective as if there is anything the Committee of Public Accounts can say is worthwhile and value for money, it is the sports capital grant.  It brings cohesion to communities and social development, particularly to our youth in a time like this Covid-19 pandemic, when there is so little else going on.  It is very important.  I am happy the witnesses are doing their best to maximise the effect of the grant.  I do not want anybody to be disappointed and I hope there will not be any disappointment.</p> <p>  I have a question on subhead D3, on page 23, whereby only a portion of what was left over in 2020 is being carried forward to 2021.  Will that have an impact on projects?</p></speech>

That is really important to us.  The Deputy is correct in that sport is part of the fabric of communities right across Ireland, as is culture.  There is quite a synergy between the two areas.  For some people sport is for them and for others it is culture, while some find both important.  Both are important to the social fabric of society.</p></speech>

We were really hoping to get that out before Christmas but we want to do it right and maximise the moneys.  When we make the announcement in January, it will only have been ten months since the round was opened, and this is two and half months or three months quicker than the previous occasion.  Although we are at an historic high when it comes to applications, it will still be a relatively efficient process and it is certainly quicker than previous years.</p> <p>  On the underspend, I echo the Secretary General's point.  It will have no impact whatever on grants.</p><p>There are public account rules as to how much capital can be brought forward any year.  Within the sport division, we have maximised how much we can bring forward.  It will not affect the outcomes for any of the applicants.</p></speech>

Within that, applicants were given a second chance.  Approximately 50% of them availed of that chance.  It was a significant additional piece of work that we had to do, but we have still managed to keep the timelines shorter than they were previously.</p></speech>

I am mindful that, given the times we are in, there will be a significant increase in the cost of projects that were the subject of applications that were sent in last March.  That is just the building industry in general.  The sooner the better, as they say, and it will all be good in the end.</p> <p>  Turning to section 7.7 on page 87, I am fascinated and would like an answer as to why a company that was limited by guarantee was set up for Galway 2020.  It was a diversion from the original structure.  Why was it set up in that way, why was the older model not followed and who made the decision to divert?  What research was undertaken to determine that it was a better model and will the company be wound up at the end of this year?  Who wishes to take these questions?</p></speech>

The idea of a company structure was the recommendation of the European Commission as regards European cities of culture.  I believe it was in 2014 that it recommended that host cities should set up independent structures to manage the cities of culture.  All 13 European cities of culture in the 2016-2022 period have been set up as independent not-for-profit or charitable organisations governed by boards of directors.  This was done on the advice of the European Commission.  The three sisters, which was unfortunately one of the unsuccessful proposals for a city of culture, had proposed setting up a separate structure as well.  We are only aware of one European city of culture - Ume&aring; in Sweden - that did not set up a separate entity.  In Galway's case, it was set up in this way to give it flexibility.  I am sorry, as I meant that Ume&aring; in Sweden in 2014 was the last city that we are aware of that did not set up a separate company.  The future role of the Galway company will be considered as part of the legacy planning, which is aimed to be completed by the end of this year.</p></speech>

I am conscious that Covid has intervened in all of this, so I am really just asking how everything is going.  The Department was to establish a revised set of operational and governance arrangements in respect of its national cultural institutions, NCI, capital investment programme.  That was to include detailed arrangements for project oversight groups to meet regularly, ensure effective oversight and have communication channels in place so that the Department was fully informed of any issue that arose.  The steering groups were to include officials from the Department, the Office of Public Works, OPW, the relevant NCI and project management teams and, as the projects developed, relevant experts.  What has happened in this regard?  Did the groups meet to ensure oversight of the projects and did Covid hamper that?</p></speech>

We have established oversight groups for each of the cultural institutions in respect of their projects.  Those groups comprise us, the OPW and the cultural institutions.  They walk through the steps of the process and ensure there is good governance.  Does Mr. Falvey wish to elaborate?</p></speech>

In any application for capital funding for a large-scale investment project, the Department now requires it to be demonstrated that appropriate project management structures are in place.  Has any application been turned down for not meeting this criterion?</p></speech>

We can provide the committee with a schedule of meetings that have taken place, if that would be of any assistance to it.</p> <p>  I do not believe that anyone would get to the point of making an application without having the necessary resources in place.  The level of engagement that we have with the cultural institutions is such that they are fully aware.  We see issues in draft and discuss them.  We like to have everything ready by the time an application is formally made.  I spend a great deal of time at those meetings, as do colleagues.  We would be happy to provide the committee with a schedule of the meetings that have taken place.  We went online as a result of Covid.</p></speech>

Ms Banotti, who is present, also put advertising in relation to Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, the national day of creativity for children in the local print media.

Sound and vision is a vehicle for funding broadcast media and that is set out in statute by the BAI so it cannot fund print under the current legal structure.

The pandemic has been a huge pressure point for all media outlets but has also displayed the huge role good quality public and private media organisations play and the way they helped communicate the messages during the pandemic.  Deputy Dillon spoke about local newspapers and radio stations but, unfortunately, in Dublin there is almost a complete absence of local media.  It is a challenge because it deprives the Dublin area of spaces in which to debate important topics of relevance to the city.  My area has two local free sheet papers which are under huge financial pressure and no local radio stations.  All the local radio stations operating on a Dublin-wide basis are essentially competing with national radio stations.  It is a problem because I am often envious of my Oireachtas colleagues who have better channels to communicate and engage with voters.  The decision for Newstalk to receive a national rather than a Dublin-focused licence tempted us with what was possible but  absent.  The closure of Dublin-specific phone-in shows like "Dublin Talks" on 98FM has made the problem even worse.  Within the spend of the Department, is work being undertaken to try to address the need in the capital?</p></speech>

Usually funding is provided via the sound and vision fund for commercial and community radio stations.  That is funded by a proportion, I think 7%, of the licence fee.  Where we have found savings in the Department, we have put money into the sound and vision fund to allow for increased funding and different programmes.  In sound and vision round 36 in December last year, &euro;670,000 was allocated to 22 community radio projects.</p> <p>  My background is in radio so I am conscious of that ecosystem out there and where it is not out there.  These are policy matters and Government has taken a decision to get into a broader policy space in relation to media, not just public service broadcasting but the future of media itself.  We got funding in the budget next year for the establishment of the media commission.  That commission attracts a lot of attention as being around the regulation of online platforms but it is also about subsuming the BAI and creating a new vision for the sector.</p><p>It is the BAI that has the strong regulatory role there.  We would be very happy to engage with the BAI on the structure and what stations are out there serving what different areas.  I agree that the structure in Dublin is entirely different from the structure in rural areas, where the local radio station dominates and can be really strong in an area.  We are very cognisant of that.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, Facebook forums have become the predominant forum for local community news.  The difficulty with that is that it carries with it all the threats that social media bring while at the same time giving local communities really good forums.  Those forums are massively open to both political and malignant manipulation, so the lack of a strong Dublin media, both in local print and on local radio, is a major policy gap.  While I accept that it is the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's role, I believe that within the broader work being done by the Future of Media Commission, we need to look specifically at the capital.  I see that Ms Licken wants to respond to that.</p></speech>

As the Deputy probably knows, the Minister hopes to publish the legislation soon.  The Oireachtas joint committee made 33 recommendations, which we are working through in the pre-legislative scrutiny.  We are anxious to proceed with this as fast as possible because we understand the pressures out there and all the issues to which the Deputy has alluded.  The whole purpose of the media commission is to address those issues.</p></speech>

Sometimes in Dublin we are a little shy about shouting for the capital.  On this issue, however, we need to work very closely together with the Department and the Government.</p> <p>  The pandemic had a significant impact on sports capital grants, and I know there was an underspend in two years.  Has the Department considered how that will be addressed, given that the ability to fundraise has also been limited and may impact future years?  I apologise if the question has been asked already; I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p></speech>

The quick answer is that the way in which sports grants are applied for, awarded and then drawn down is a cyclical process.  No clubs will suffer because of underspend.  We hope to announce the current round of sports capital grants in early January.  It should be borne in mind that about half of all applicants have already received an equipment grant.  That was announced in August.  We are trying to maximise the available pot for January by getting as many old grant applicants that are on the system to draw down this year, thereby maximising the pot for next year.  That is the quick snapshot of where things are.  No applicants will suffer.  We are well used to this process.</p></speech>

I have dealt with many clubs this year, as in previous years, and one of the difficulties is that their planning or their fundraising targets might not be reached within the window of the application process or thereafter.  I have often considered that a rolling application process might be far more agile.</p></speech>

From our experience of engaging with clubs, that pattern seems to work pretty well for them.  Obviously, we would never say "No" if there were an increased fund that would allow for such a model, but at the moment the model seems to suit the needs of clubs on the ground as long as there are not long gaps between rounds of sports capital funding.  It is a priority for us to make sure we can award grants at a relatively regular frequency.</p></speech>

While funding was provided to national bodies, as Ms Licken outlined to Deputy Dillon, clubs on the ground, particularly those that had large borrowing requirements, really struggled, and financial institutions were not always amenable to working with those clubs.  I know this does not fall entirely into the period we are discussing, but what audits has the Department done on how much money got out onto the ground and made an impact in individual clubs as well as in the sporting bodies, which, obviously, have a need too?</p></speech>

First, at the corporate governance level there is a rolling programme of audits of the national governing bodies, NGBs, which are done by Sport Ireland.  The impact of sports capital on the ground is something we keep under review.  For instance, looking at our large-scale sports infrastructure fund, which targets much bigger projects, we are just now coming to the end of a review process of the initial round.  One of the emerging lessons is that there is a gap there in that the past 20 months have been really hard on those NGBs and local authorities that applied.  Sports revenue has dried up.  Costs of construction have gone up.  Without prejudging the outcomes of the review, I think we will definitely have to learn from and look at this as we review the large-scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF.  A lot of the same lessons will probably also apply on the sports capital side, which applies to smaller events.</p></speech>

As part of the corporate governance of RT&Eacute;, the broadcasting function generally came over and the corporate governance function came over but not all the staff transferred with it.

Until my time for asking questions was up, Ms Licken was more or less saying the Department had no knowledge of it but what about the staff in the broadcasting section and in corporate governance?  It all comes back to the point I am making about oversight.  I cannot believe Ms Licken said that the Department had no knowledge of it when broadcasting and governance staff in the Department did so.  Were questions asked?  The misclassification of workers and bogus employment were splattered all over the media.  At what stage did the oversight or the questions start?  RT&Eacute; misclassified workers for years.  It exploited workers for decades.  Having listened this morning, it seems that what happens when RT&Eacute; is found out is that it lets the Department know, it tells the Department it will fix it and that is the extent of the Department's oversight.  That is just not good enough.  This is public money we are talking about.</p></speech>

I will get that for the Deputy.  Having said that, there are governance frameworks in place within RT&Eacute; as well as our oversight.  The purpose of these frameworks is to surface these types of issues and deal with them.  When issues come to our attention we absolutely speak to RT&Eacute; all the time about what it will do about them and what measures it will put in place.  We monitor how it rectifies them.  We know it has made a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners.  We know it is engages with the Department of Social Protection.  These are very complex individual contracts that have to be worked through.  We absolutely keep a very close eye on it.</p></speech>

She said she was aware that RT&Eacute; has made a settlement.  I do not think anyone in the country is not aware because it was splattered all over the papers.  I am astounded at what Ms Licken said when she knew full well that broadcasting staff and corporate governance staff in the Department knew all that was going on.  The unions have been speaking about this pay disparity for 20 years and no one in the Department, even Ms Licken coming before the Committee of Public Accounts, has something to say other than that it predated the Department-----</p></speech>

I remind people to indicate if they wish to contribute.  There may be time for people to come back in if nobody else indicates.  I want to discuss Sport Ireland.  It has not published its accounts as yet.  It is very difficult to make sense of this very mixed Department.  We would nearly need to look at each set of accounts for the individual entities and there are almost 20 entities.  It is quite difficult to make sense of it.  Included in the package for Sport Ireland will be part of the rescue package for the FAI.  How much was provided to Sport Ireland to channel to the FAI in 2020?</p></speech>

There is a memorandum of understanding and a governance review group has been established to monitor this process.  There is an annual payment to the FAI.  I am afraid I am looking at 2021 figures at present.  In 2021, &euro;5.8 million was paid and there is a separate payment of just over &euro;2 million that goes towards its costs for the Aviva Stadium.  There is a very strong governance oversight process on this, which is managed by Sport Ireland's governance oversight group.  It is a joint partnership between Sport Ireland in the FAI.  It is critically measuring the FAI and comparing how it performs in more than 160 different indicators arising out of the various reviews of recent years and how it is delivering on them.  In October, we were told it had satisfactorily completed more than 120 of these.</p></speech>

In the previous D&aacute;il I was on the committee that dealt with transport, tourism and sport where I continuously raised governance.  It was clear there were problems and those problems followed on problems experienced in the Olympic Council of Ireland.  I have concerns about a couple of sporting organisations.  The Secretary General spoke about the layers of governance.  I know the amount of money provided to the FAI was a very small proportion of its overall budget in the years up to 2019 and 2020 when a rescue package had to be put in place.  What lessons has the Department learned on governance?  What additional oversight is there in Sport Ireland?  What additional measures and powers have been put in place?</p><p>This was an open secret that some of us were working on for the last few years, namely, the role of the Department where there might continue to be problems in other sports organisations.</p></speech>

Sport Ireland has a very rigorous programme whereby, at any one time, one of the three large field sports, or an aspect of it, is under review and there is a selection every year of the smaller bodies.  That kind of forensic review by robust external audit-----</p></speech>

It is not just the money; it is about how the organisations themselves operate for the long term.</p></speech>

However, the damage to the Olympic Council and the damage to the FAI because people were asleep at the wheel, or because there was not the right kind of oversight, is immeasurable.  It is not only about financial cost; it is also about reputational cost and opportunity cost in terms of volunteers and all the rest of it.</p> <p>  I want to move on to another area, which is the National Archives.  I am not sure how the National Archives is funded, and it appears to be slightly different from the National Museum and the National Gallery.  Can we get a note on the National Archives?  I know that a big building programme is under way, which is welcome.  A huge number of records were not even catalogued and there should be a big digitisation programme.  We have underspent on these institutions for decades and there is a lot of catch-up to do.  However, it is not very obvious how it is funded.  Is some of the activity directly funded by the Department?  It is not easy to figure that out.</p></speech>

Although it is a cultural institution, and rightly so, it comes directly within the Vote of the Department.  We will get the committee a note on it.  The Vice Chairman is correct that we are investing not just in capital, but also in the archives staff, and we are recruiting archivists at the moment in recognition of the valuable work they do.  They have some very specific projects ongoing at the moment and I will ask Mr. Falvey to come in on that.</p> <p>  To circle back on the sport issue, under the national sports policy published in 2018, there is a new governance code that the governing bodies have committed to subscribing to by the end of 2021.  As of 8 November, 47 bodies have formally adopted the code and the rest are on the journey, with more of them to be compliant by the end of the year.  That is another layer of the governance, so it is not just the rolling audits.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputies Paul McAuliffe, Alan Dillon and Colm Burke on the issues around large-scale infrastructure and other grants.  If I heard the witnesses correctly, it was said that with regard to the grants for sporting bodies and provision of sports and recreational facilities, that underspend was as a result of challenges faced by the clubs in trying to spend that money but it is still earmarked for them and they are not going to lose the funding.  Is that right?</p></speech>

Although the conditions in question were not in the PDA, they were rigorously enforced in terms of drawdown of funding, and we do that for all our other management programmes.  The grantees have to make a declaration that the material they presented to us was not used to draw down grants elsewhere.  We already rigorously apply that.  The issue here was that we did not put it into the PDA as a specific condition.  Obviously, if we were doing it again, we would.  We totally accept the recommendation.</p></speech>

I will not labour the point; it is just a reminder.</p> <p>  In the absence of other members indicating, I might come in with a few points myself.  A total of &euro;1.5 million was paid directly to Galway 2020, in accordance with the EU regulations.  Why was the additional &euro;1.5 million of EU funding not sought?  It appears it was not applied for.  Did Galway not meet the criteria?</p></speech>

It did not directly apply for other EU funding as, legally, the organisation had to have been in existence for more than two years to comply with EU funding application criteria more generally, and the organisation was not<i>in situ</i>for two years at that stage-----</p></speech>

It would have been known that was a criterion.  Why would that not have been insisted on?  It is quite a sizeable sum in the overall scheme of a capital of culture.</p></speech>

The European Commission emphasises that the delivery team should focus on the overall programme delivery and support our artists to build their capacity and networks at European level.  Galway 2020 was successful at getting some of the partners and projects to get money themselves directly from the EU.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that Galway has a particular offering and that it was unlucky with the timing   We had had problems with this previously, as Deputy Burke pointed out.  Limerick was another capital of culture where, if I recall correctly, there were problems.  We appeared to repeat the mistakes as opposed to learn from them.  Has there been an overall analysis, with issues identified, in order that we will not run into those difficulties again?  It is very worthwhile but it is often diminished by some of the controversy around it.</p></speech>

The Audience Agency has been recruited by Galway 2020 to do a review of the programme and lessons will learned from that, as well as from the rolling series of lessons learned kept by the Commission.</p> <p>  I might ask Mr. Falvey to come in on this in a moment.  An awful lot of good things happened in the past year and we need to give credit to the artists, Galway 2020 and all the partners and volunteers.  A lot of good things happened but they just were not as visible.  We would be having a very different conversation if Covid had not happened because those things would have been more visible.  Mr. Falvey might talk to some of the projects and how truly spectacular they were, even if some of them went under the radar.</p></speech>

The loss of status much bemoaned by residents, to the point that Limerick sought to host the European Capital of Culture for 2020.  With things such as the John Gerrard Mirror Pavilion on Claddagh Quay last summer or DruidGregory, the opportunities for public engagement with the arts were very significant in Galway 2020, although not to the extent everybody would have hoped for, given the constraints because of Covid.  Had there been further opportunities, it would have been of great benefit to everybody.  It is a great shame that did not happen but there were many very good things.  If someone was on Claddagh Quay last summer and saw the public gathered there, or at the Gerrard pavilion, it was very striking and it was a fantastic opportunity for public engagement with the arts, very much in line with the objectives of the city of culture designation.</p></speech>

We in the Committee of Public Accounts examine governance, funding and value for money, and I do not ask these questions to diminish the designation.  Some of these issues cannot be measured monetarily in respect of the benefit gained.</p></speech>

I would like to hear the Secretary General's feedback on how they were administered.  We all understand F&aacute;ilte Ireland's primary remit relates to tourism, but it was asked to administer a number of grants, one of which was the adaptation grant designed to enable tourism businesses in the hospitality and tourism sector to make improvements through the different levels of restrictions.  A great deal of importance was put on these grants but there was difficulty for businesses in gaining access to them.  How does the Department feel about the way these grants were administered and what feedback has there been from F&aacute;ilte Ireland regarding their administration?</p></speech>

Its business, which it continues, was in developing the tourism product.  It continued that throughout Covid and, at the same time, reorientated itself to deliver a range of grant programmes.  It has engaged extensively with us, the tourism sector and the wider hospitality sector, which is covered by us and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been very flexible in moving quickly to provide schemes and engage with the sector and with us.  For example, it provided a &euro;10 million inbound agents business continuity scheme, a &euro;10 million coach tour operators business continuity scheme, a &euro;26 million adaptation fund from August to December 2020 and an &euro;8 million restart scheme.</p><p>Budget 2021 allocated more money and the tourism business continuity scheme was launched on 1 February.  That was in addition to all of the horizontal supports and to the guidance.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been a key player in providing guidance in the sector.  There were the regulations when the restrictions were in place and there is a series of guidance measures.  A phenomenal amount of work went on behind the scenes to produce that guidance, in consultation with the sectors and with ourselves.  If the committee would like, we can ask F&aacute;ilte Ireland to provide the committee with a detailed note and if it has some specific issue or difficulty we can certainly address that.  To reiterate, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has played a critical role and has not been found wanting from our perspective in responding quickly.</p></speech>

One item of correspondence has been flagged today under category B, that is, correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow up to committee meetings.</p> <p>  No. 872B, held over from our meeting last week, is from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman, Revenue Commissioners, dated 5 November 2021.  It provides information requested by the committee arising from the fact Revenue did not accept certain recommendations in the committee in our last report.  The committee asked Revenue to clarify to what extent it can investigate the financial and sectoral implications of a voluntary PAYE system agreed by Revenue and courier firms in 1997, as well as a copy of the 2019 European Commission inspection report on the control strategy for customs value and repayments.  I have flagged this item for discussion as have Deputies Carthy and Catherine Murphy.  Before opening the floor, is it agreed to note and publish this item?  Agreed.  I call Deputy Carthy.</p></speech>

It is good to see him back.  I have a couple of points.  It is incredibly interesting.  This relates to the 1997 decision by Revenue to allow couriers be designated as self-employed.  I am not sure it was the couriers themselves who benefitted from that arrangement and would argue it was not.  The letter states:</p> <blockquote> 	A review of the 1997 letters from Revenue bears out the fact that the individuals in question were required to be self-employed and that the conditions to participate in the &ldquo;voluntary PAYE scheme&rdquo; were that the individuals were in fact bona fide self-employed. </blockquote> <p>It goes on to state:</p> <blockquote> 	Bearing in mind the significant lapse of time, the information available to Revenue in relation to matters which occurred over 20 years ago is severely limited, particularly in light of Revenue only having access to information returned in statutory reporting. </blockquote> <p>There are a number of follow-on questions we need to ask.  The first is why only information from statutory reporting is available.  Is it the case Revenue does not have access to all documents that were created and gave rise to the agreement?  I imagine that would have been standard practice.  We need to get an explanation as to why that is not the case.  It then sets our criteria for where this self-employed status can be used.  It talks about the form of payment being based on milage rather than being a standard pay rate.  However, I would have expected the first test of self-employment is whether a person is a free agent and able to operate as a self-employed company - in other words, that they are not intrinsically linked to a single company which is the cause of concern for us.  It would be useful if we could get clarification from Revenue in the first instance on this form of documentation.  Is it the case it simply does not exist - that it was disappeared - or is it the case it is just hard to find?  They are two very different things and that clarification would be useful.  I would like to get a further note from Revenue on whether it sees this type of approach as being appropriate in the future, where these types of contracts are concerned.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Department of Social Protection is the one that, in my understanding, has pretty much determined the type of employment it has always designated as self-employment.  In 1997 there would have been way fewer people in this particular sector and it may well be that we try to get some data from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the number of people now employed in the sector in question.  There is a particular concern about precarious employment and that Department has responsibility there.  This is probably, in the first instance, a policy issue.  Revenue is working to rules set out for it.  We should be making contact with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to seek the number and how that fits in with the approach to deal with the issue of precarious employment.</p></speech>

The issue with self-employment or misclassification as self-employment is that it may now be operating across other sectors on foot of that judgment back in 1997.</p></speech>

We will go through them.  Appendix 1 states: </p><blockquote>	By way of background, it is important to note that PAYE is not a tax, but a collection mechanism for Income Tax...  The operation of PAYE on bona fide self-employed couriers involved the application of a withholding tax on an administrative basis, which facilitated collection of tax on account from a cohort of self-employed individuals and made it easier for these individuals to meet their payment compliance obligations. </blockquote><p>The code of practice for determining self-employed status, published in July 2021, states that an individual would normally be an employee if he or she has his or her tax deducted from his or her wages through the PAYE system.  There seems to be a number of contradictions running through that.  We will first seek to clarify, from the documentation provided by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the number of people who are classified as self-employed and the breakdown of the sectors.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Representatives from Revenue will be before the committee again and I am sure we will revisit this matter.<br/><br/>The next correspondence is No. 888B from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education, dated 12 November 2021.  It is an update in relation to a recommendation in the committee's report on our examination of the Department's 2018 and 2019 appropriation accounts.  The matter was flagged for discussion by Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

When representatives of the shared services unit appeared before the committee, they made a point of saying it would not be appropriate for every part of the public service to have its payroll go through the shared services unit.  The HSE and the Department of Education have large staff complements.  The Department of Education has 130,000 payees.  I am intrigued as to what is the problem.  In the last paragraph, there is mention of a "viable technical solution".  What is the solution?  We need to revert to the Department with some questions.  What is the solution it is seeking?  Does the solution involve outsourcing to a contractor?  Was it included in the original tender?  If a company issues a contract for a payroll system, I would expect that payroll system to work and if there are glitches or problems with it, that the obligation would be on the contractor to resolve them.  A number of issues arise.  If a lot of money is spent on a system, that system should be fit for purpose.</p></speech>

It does not have a full electronic payroll system.  Is that correct?  In the correspondence, it is mentioned that a technical solution has been identified and is being assessed.  I am trying to remember that meeting.  I know Deputy Devlin raised the issue with the officials.</p></speech>

For example, if, in August, an employee wants to look back and access information in relation to a pay period in March or April, that is probably the kind of functionality that the Department would need to build into the system, as opposed to sending out the payslip each fortnight, it arriving and it being up to the recipient to keep a record.  I think that is the area in which the Department is talking about building a viable technical solution.</p></speech>

From the information we were given by the Department when its representatives appeared before us previously and the timelines outlined in this letter, it appears that there is some improvement in respect of the software upgrades.  I think the officials indicated that they would have the issue resolved by the end of this year.  It now seems the upgrades were scheduled and completed in July 2021.  That is a positive.</p> <p>  My concern relates to the last sentence of the correspondence, which states that the Department will be engaging with stakeholders on the proposed solution thereafter, and the plan is to phase in the option to use this service for all payees by the third quarter of next year.  How will that option work?  Is it the case that a substantial number of payees could continue to opt to receive paper copies and mitigate against any savings anticipated as a result of the upgrade?  I would like some clarification on what precisely is meant by that and whether it is the Department's view that over a period - we could ask for that period to be defined - all employees will be receiving their payslips electronically, and they will have access to the information that the Comptroller and Auditor General has talked about.  I think most people would take it as standard that they have access to previous payslips, etc.</p></speech>

It could be interpreted a number of ways.  We can ask why there will be an option and not a uniform electronic system within the Department.  We can also ask when the Department hopes to have the system finalised.  Deputy Carthy referred to the spend on the postage of paper payslips.  The spend on that was &euro;10 million.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 889B, from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 12 November 2021, providing information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the Department on 14 October 2021.  Before opening the floor for discussion, it is proposed to note and publish the correspondence except for page 1, which is provided to the committee on a confidential basis.  The members will note the sensitivity around that because of the cyberattack.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I ask that members honour that confidentiality because there are issues of public interest at stake.

I have a few additional questions that I would like to ask the Department.  On page 3, in relation to the use of existing poles and overhead lines, the Department states: </p> <blockquote> 	Existing overhead poles and lines will be used where possible to lay/hang the new fibre cables.  It is forecast that only 12% of the project will be new build as designs will utilise existing infrastructure to a very significant degree; this approach is consistent with State Aid requirements. </blockquote> <p>Has it been determined what upgrade or repair costs there will be if the existing infrastructure requires maintenance?  There may well be a need for replacement poles or other locations to hang the cables.  Has the cost of that been determined?  It is not uncommon to see a whole row of poles where one has fallen over.  There will have to be an upgrade of that.</p><p>Those poles will not be the obligation of Eir; they may well be the responsibility of National Broadband Ireland, NBI.  I am trying to establish if it has done any assessment of the cost of maintenance regarding the use of existing infrastructure.</p></speech>

That was a bit of an eye-catcher.  The other question that arises out of it is the annual cost for rent of existing infrastructure each year over the next 25 years.  Is it being done as a cumulative cost over that period?  If only 12% is going on new build, what is the &euro;2.7 billion going on?  How much of that is going on the rent of infrastructure from a private company, Eir?  The Deputy asked if NBI is responsible for paying for the upgrade of existing infrastructure.</p> <p>  As Deputy Munster is not here, I call Deputy Carthy.</p></speech>

It seems the ground is being prepared for a further revision downwards of the targets by the end of 2022.  I am anxious that we get full clarification of the portion of the correspondence suggesting that certain legacy issues resulting from Covid-19 will continue to impact the contracted targets for 2022.  An Cathaoirleach will recall that at the hearing we asked several questions about precisely what the Covid-19 complications were considering that this was considered to be essential work throughout the pandemic.  The sector itself was never closed down in the way the construction sector was, for example.</p> <p>  The answers we got were very broad, with reference to clusters of Covid cases, but when we asked for the numbers of those, they could not be provided.  There was also reference to a British company whose personnel were not able to travel over as a result of Covid-19 but when we sought elaboration on that it transpired that the company in question is no longer contracted.  Clearly, that is not the reason.  It is important to get clarification as to the precise complications that have arisen as a result of Covid in order that we can assess whether there are provisions to ensure that this does not happen if we face further waves in the future.</p> <p>  The correspondence states that the Department expects NBI to submit this plan very shortly.  My concern over the entire broadband plan is that NBI is essentially dictating what it considers to be the appropriate targets and then the Department is setting those as new milestones.  As a result, it is important for us to get clear definitions of what the targets now are and what justification the company needs to provide in order for milestones to be amended.</p> <p>  The correspondence also outlines that it has spent &euro;24.5 million on procurement advisory services.  It would be useful to get a breakdown of the specific expenditure on those services.</p></speech>

I echo Deputy Carthy's concerns about the roll-out of this.  We discussed this before the contract was awarded and had concerns about the ability of the particular entity to deliver the broadband plan in the intervention area.  As there was only one bidder, it was not as if there was a choice.  We understand that Covid has been an issue but we are now starting to see serious slippages and it is important for us to keep on top of this.  The Department is permitted to apply penalties if the plan does not roll out in the way that it should.  That paragraph in the correspondence refers to certain legacy issues resulting from Covid-19.  It states that NBI expects to submit a plan very shortly.  We should look for a copy of that plan because it will give us some indication.  If the Department does not have it yet, we should look for it to provide it to us when it is provided to the Department.</p> <p>  Can we get a schedule of works to be provided for the 679 primary schools along with their locations?  We need to keep a close eye on this matter.  That was an area where one would have expected-----</p></speech>

We should ask it what the legacy issues are.  Hopefully, we are not going back into a lockdown.  If we are not going back into a lockdown, there should not be legacy issues.  There may be issues with the supply chain or something.  I know that in construction there have been some issues with getting materials.  We need to ask it that question and the rationale for that.</p> <p>  Is it carrying the cost of replacing and updating the existing infrastructure that it is using, which belongs to other companies?  What is the annual rental cost of that infrastructure?  We are looking for those clarifications, and we will come back to it.</p></speech>

The first relates to the use of landfill in the disposal of waste.  We were told there are three landfill sites in the country, one in Kildare, one in Meath and one in Wicklow.  In addition, we have the incinerator.  That is it.  The principle is that waste is supposed to be dealt with as close as possible to where it is created.  However, the east coast is receiving most of the national waste.  The waste is collected in Kerry, Mayo, Donegal or wherever, baled and shipped east, which seems like an incredible way of dealing with waste.  Capacity at the landfill site in Wicklow will be exhausted by 2026.  There was an extension because we were on a knife edge and use of the site has been extended to 2026.  The one in Meath has eight years left.  The one in Kildare has three and a half years left, based on the current planning permission.</p><p>However, a planning application has been made for the next 35 years.  There is no compensation for road damage, for example, resulting from the very heavy loads that are being transported.  Apart from anything else, that is far from ideal.  We need to go back to the Department and ask is what is the plan.  Is that it in the context of traffic congestion into Ringsend?  I know there was a previous planning application.  I refer to the site in Kildare.  It is down to individuals who live nearby to mount challenges in respect of the impact on the quality of their lives by virtue of the fact that these are essentially the central repository for waste nationally.  I know this is not an issue for the Committee of Public Accounts but it is a departmental issue.  We need to go back and ask the Department what exactly is the plan into the future.  Is what is being described here the plan for the future or how does it expect waste will be dealt with?</p></speech>

I remember a consultant's report that was circulated among the county councils back in 2004 and 2005 and set out the reasons for that.  I am sure the Deputy saw that report as well.  We are in a situation where the game will be up in respect of those three sites in eight years.  There are three and a half years left for the site in Kildare, as the Deputy stated, there are four years on the Wicklow one and then eight years for the site in Meath, although it is stated that there is additional land available that would allow it to continue operating beyond that, subject to permission being granted.  We can write back to the Department and ask for clarification on that issue and whether there are other options.  There is the very important issue of not just road damage, but environmental damage as a result of all the waste being transported to the east coast.  Obviously, waste is being carted long distances and we need to find out why that is and what plans there are to develop landfill sites or waste centres in other parts of the country.</p> <p>  Is there another issue the Deputy wishes to raise?</p></speech>

One relates to the sustainable energy programmes.  It may be something the committee will consider at some point.  I am not sure whether the Department's costings are right.  I was on an annual call with a local authority last week.  It made the point that the money that is provided to fully fund retrofitting of local authority houses is &euro;10,000 short of the actual cost of doing the job and the local authority is picking up that cost.  If that is the case, then I am not sure the calculations we are seeing in respect of the cost of it are accurate.  That was the experience of the local authority.  In the national development plan there was a signal that one sixth of the amount set aside for retrofitting was going to be from public funding.  That means the remaining amount is coming from elsewhere.  It is not entirely clear what the situation is in the context of the other schemes.  Maybe I will follow this issue up separately because I am not sure it is a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts.  Many of the numbers just do not make sense.  It is very difficult to see how we will avoid incurring penalties if a significant amount of money has to be made up by individual householders in the context of the retrofit programmes.  If the calculations of the Department in respect of the cost of doing that are wrong, then the amount of money that is provided by way of grant aid will be wrong as well.  I will follow that up with the Department.</p></speech>

The example highlighted by the local authority is a case in point but other people are saying that as well.  I have been contacted by people who have told me the amount of money they have to put to it is unattainable.  We will end up not being able to deliver on a very important national programme.</p> <p>  I refer to appendix 1 in the context of the national broadband plan advisory services.  It gives a breakdown of the total expenditure in respect of some of the providers.  Analysys Mason is described there as technical in terms of the advisory.  The Analysys Mason report related to the costings.  I did not think it was technical.  It was about the charging mechanism.  I am not sure whether the nature of the advisory services is immediately obvious there.  It would be quite useful to get a further breakdown in respect of some of them, such as Analysys Mason and KPMG.  I continuously question whether there is capacity to do in-house some of the things that go out to tender to consultancy firms or we should be building the capacity to do that in-house as opposed to the expensive outsourcing.  I know the national broadband plan was a one-off so it may not be a great example, but I would like to see a breakdown on both of those providers to ascertain exactly what the work they did was.</p></speech>

We will ask for clarification on that.  Do any other members wish to come in?</p> <p>  As regards the cover letter, in the final paragraph the Secretary General refers to comments I made during the afternoon session on 14 October after we had completed our engagement with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and specifically relating to the attendance of the programme director.  The Secretary General goes on to say he can assure the committee that the taking of the evidence of the programme director by way of remote connection from his home accorded fully with the parameters of the committee's invitation.  That is fair enough; it is allowed for within the parameters of the invitation.  However, the problem is that we were not able to communicate with the person with overall responsibility for the project on a secure or reasonably good quality broadband connection.  That is the point we are making.  I raised it in the afternoon session that day.  Reference is made to a specific reason the director could not attend the meeting in person or attend the Department on that day.  That is fair enough.  We do not want to know everyone's business and sometimes people are is tied down for a specific reason.  There are several reasons a person could be tied down.  However, If witnesses are going to give evidence remotely to the committee, we need to hold to the point that they do so from their headquarters or, at the very least, have a good broadband connection where they are.  That day was a long way from satisfactory in terms of trying to organise and run a meeting and allow members to ask questions and get answers.  I note that.  We need to be firm in respect of witnesses ensuring they have a good broadband connection on the day.  I understand that things can go wrong at the last minute, technology being technology.</p><p>That the Department charged with responsibility for rolling out the broadband plan was not able to communicate with us, or us with it, on the day of the committee hearing is just not acceptable.</p></speech>

It was deplorable and very obvious.  I am surprised that he included this in the letter.  It should just have been a case of hands up.  If we are to learn anything from this it may be that we will have to include on any invitation a requirement, as far as possible, that there should be a viable broadband connection available just so this kind of thing cannot be said: "fully within the parameters of the committee's invitation dated 30 September 2021".</p></speech>

It is mentioned in the correspondence that the Department was aware of the reinstatement of the 2018 figures in An Taisce's 2019 financial statements and reference is made to a follow-up engagement with An Taisce.  The letter goes on to state that considering that the amounts did not constitute "a significant portion of overall income", the Department did not consider there was any need for further inquiries to be made.  I would like to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General if it would be considered best practice that where questions arise but the amounts involved are considered relatively small, there would not be a follow-up.  I am not sure if Mr. McCarthy has had an opportunity to look into this yet.  Is it something he will examine further?</p></speech>

There obviously has to be a proportionality in the amount of oversight activity that one undertakes in respect of a small grant.  Perhaps in this situation, where each of the funders would know that there is a big funder out there, which is the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, there may be an extent to which they are placing reliance on the bigger funder to do more checking.  Formalising that or obtaining some kind of letter of assurance might be an appropriate thing to do.  I want to see the further explanations that we get and how the whole thing meshes together and then I will consider whether I will inquire into it further and maybe even report on it.</p></speech>

That is one of the big complaints from Nursing Homes Ireland.  When it comes to private nursing homes, that mechanism is not there and that is one of they issues that they want addressed.  A person can be admitted to a nursing home who is mobile and moving around.  A number of months or years later, he or she no longer has the same level of mobility and therefore, a greater degree of care is required.  That is the one big complaint that nursing homes have and we need to take it up with the Department.</p></speech>

I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off.  If they are not switched off, there will be the usual consequences, whatever they are.  The contributions of members who speak from positions in the room that do not have microphones cannot be included in the Official Report.  Members also need to have a microphone in front of them if they are outside of the Chamber.  For the purposes of the Official Report, I have been requested to identify members when they are called to speak.  Members are requested to remove their face coverings when speaking to ensure their contributions can be adequately and clearly recorded.  I welcome members and viewers who may be watching our proceedings on Oireachtas TV to the public session of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  For this purpose, the parliamentary precincts are considered to be the accommodation assigned to the member in the Leinster House complex or its vicinity, or another location in Leinster House or Leinster House 2000.  I ask the members to note that they may participate remotely in proceedings held in public only from the locations listed earlier as privilege to their utterances only applies when participating from these locations.</p> <p>  On behalf of the select committee, I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and his officials.  To provide for the smooth running of the meeting, any member acting in substitution for a member of the committee should formally notify the clerk now if they have not already done so.  Divisions will be taken as they arise.  Members must attend in person in the committee meeting room for divisions, although they may attend the meeting remotely.  Members attending this meeting in accordance with Standing Order 106(3) should be aware that, pursuant to the Standing Order, they may move amendments but cannot participate in voting on that amendment.  If you are not a member, you can move an amendment but you cannot participate in the voting.  I now invite the Minister to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

This section and the other sections just approve that agreement in Irish law.  I will just go through a couple of points on this section, which will probably deal with the issues with the overall Bill.  I have outlined Sinn F&eacute;in's view on the changes to be made to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, under this agreement.  Some of these are positive and some are not.  Some could cause serious issues in accessing different credit lines.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in, and the Irish people more broadly, have a view on this.  We are all too familiar with the conditions and austerity that were placed on the Irish people as part of the financial assistance programme following the crash of 2008 and 2009.</p> <p>  In this legislation, we see reforms regarding the memorandum of understanding on the precautionary credit line.  This is replaced by a letter of intent to be submitted by a member state.  In submitting that letter of intent, the member state would outline its main policy positions, which would then be assessed by the Commission.  Despite symbolically abolishing the memorandum of understanding and replacing it with this letter of intent, the eligibility criteria are hardened so much that they effectively kill the instrument and put it out of reach for most European countries.  That is the core concern we have in respect of this agreement.</p> <p>  Under Annex III, an ESM member qualifies for the precautionary condition credit line provided it meets the following criteria.  It must not be under the excessive deficit procedure, it must have a general government deficit not exceeding 3% of GDP and it must have "a debt benchmark consisting of a general government debt to GDP ratio below 60% or a reduction in the differential with respect to 60% over the previous two years at an average rate of one twentieth per year".  We have made the point that some of these criteria are outdated.  Indeed, the ESM itself has suggested that the criteria need to be changed and yet we are enshrining an agreement subject to these criteria in Irish law.  As we argued at the time, these were never the criteria we should have been using.</p> <p>  Let us consider these criteria.  The credit line would obviously be called on during downturns.  During the financial crisis, all eurozone members, with the exception of Luxembourg and Estonia, were under the excessive debt procedure.  Is it then a credible criterion that a state cannot be under the deficit procedure?  As I have said, during the financial crisis, every single member of the eurozone, bar Luxembourg and Estonia, would have been excluded.  What are the Minister's views on that criterion?  I also have a number of other questions.</p></speech>

I will outline a number of reasons that is the case.</p><p>The first is it is important to be clear about what are the circumstances in which the PCCL could be accessed.  They could, for example, apply due to a natural event due to an earthquake.  It is all about focusing the availability of this credit line for circumstances that are completely beyond the control of a member state and a government.  Therefore, it is possible that you could have a country that is fulfilling the current Stability and Growth Pact conditions and still, for reasons beyond its control, finds itself in need of assistance to meet funding needs in an emergency.  That being said, the Deputy is aware now of the review that has recommenced by the European Commission in relation to the future of economic governance within the European Union which is focused on the debate about the fiscal rules.  When that debate concludes, and if there were to be a change in the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP, that was to change some of the targets and conditions within the SGP, I entirely expect that the operation and access to this PCCL will have to be in line then with a revised SGP if there were to be a revision in the SGP.  In one way, I take the Deputy's point that at present there are very few countries that would meet the criteria of the SGP, but there is a review under way in relation to that.  Even while there are few countries that meet the criteria of the SGP, it is possible that you could have a country that meets the criteria, as they are currently defined, and still, for reasons beyond control, finds itself in need of this financial instrument.</p></speech>

That is a failure, in terms of the negotiations that have happened and the agreement that has been reached, to reach an agreement that was fit for purpose in today's age.</p> <p>  It is interesting the example the Minister cited in terms of an earthquake.  That may be the case and we will tease that out a little further.  For those who are looking for this type of credit line, it is likely in the main that they will have used their own resources.  In accessing it, we would, more than likely, be in a downturn.</p> <p>  Let us go on to the second criterion, because there is not only one criterion in terms of the excessive deficit procedure that they must reach.  As I said, during a financial crash, only two countries would be eligible for this credit line if that were to happen.  Let us look at the second criterion of not exceeding the 3% deficit of GDP.  The general government deficit is exceeded by 3% in 25 member states.  That means that, currently, if there was an earthquake, to take the Minister's example, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, The Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and we in Ireland, regardless of the size of the earthquake, would all be locked out of this line of credit.</p></speech>

I anticipate that by the time we move into next year, the number of countries that would be in excess of the 3% deficit requirement will begin to change and one will see more countries - due to economic growth and due, I hope, to the retreat of the economic consequences of Covid-19 - fall at or below 3%.  In any event, if there is change in the SGP to reflect a new economic reality, the operation of this treaty will have to reflect it.</p> <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty is correct to say this treaty is being brought in before that debate has concluded.  I would anticipate that it will take at least a year for that debate to conclude and for agreement to be reached on the future of the SGP but in that year, I still believe, there is value in this treaty being implemented because it brings forward by two years overall the kinds of support that may be available to countries if they find themselves facing a natural risk or a banking difficulty.  The enhanced conditions credit line, ECCL, which I suspect is the other credit line Deputy Pearse Doherty will come on to in a moment, is applicable in a broader range of circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.459" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#B00400"><p>The Minister is saying that the other rules may change and if they change then they will be subject to this.  This is legislation that we are enshrining in Irish law today.  Committee Stage has to be decided now.  These are the rules that we are saying should apply to this credit line, whatever about what the Minister and the rest of the finance ministers may decide down the line.  The point I make is these are not fit for purpose.  These do not meet the needs of access to these credit lines because the criteria are too stringent.</p> <p>  While the Minister may make the point that some of those countries I mentioned may achieve a deficit of less than 3% in the upcoming period as the pandemic recedes, let us look at the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is another criterion that has to be met here.  It is that the general government gross debt does not exceed 60% of GDP.  For example, at the end of last year, that means Belgium is out.  Germany is out.  Greece is out.  Spain is out.  France is out.  Croatia is out.  Italy is out.  Cyprus, Hungary, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland are out because they have all exceeded that criteria.  Whatever about reducing your deficit to that level, reducing your debt to below 60% of GDP is not likely to happen in the short term, but then you have the option of reducing it one twentieth per year.  If we look at that, for those whose debts exceed 60% of GDP, they must reduce that ratio in two consecutive years and this would in the main be during a downturn.  If it was to happen, next year or the year after, that a country needed to access this, it would be during a time when it would be spending a lot on the pandemic and so on.  It would be during a time of financial pressure that, to be able to ensure that one can avail of this precautionary credit line, one would have to be reducing one's debt which is the opposite of what one should be doing.  We have learnt the lessons from the policy that was followed here after the financial crash and in some other EU member states that this was the wrong thing to do and we are dealing with the pandemic and the impacts of the pandemic in a different way.  Requiring countries to reduce their debt over two consecutive years, which, as I said, is likely to be in a downturn, for access to this credit would be a bad and harmful economic policy.  Therefore, again, it is not fit for purpose.</p> <p>  Let us take a live example.  Let us consider Italy, for the sake of argument.  Its debt-to-GDP ratio is currently 156%.  What balance would it have to run for two years, most likely during a downturn, in order to access this credit line?</p></speech>

In evaluating the point that the Deputy is making, it is worth emphasising that the Government of the same country, Italy, is committed to the ratification of this treaty too.</p> <p>  All the countries that the Deputy has named that are currently in excess of the SGP have all signed up to ratify this treaty and their Ministers are currently doing what I am doing.  Why is that?  Why would a Finance Minister, who understands the debt dynamics of his or her own country in a way that is superior to how the Deputy and I would, sign up to ratify this treaty?  The reason they will sign up to ratify this treaty is because of the answer I have given the Deputy, which is an expectation that when the debate on the future of the SGP concludes, it will have a parallel effect on the operation of this treaty.  That is the expectation that all governments which are committed to the ratification of it have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.461" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#C00100"><p>That is fine.  The Minister is sitting down and saying that we will get it right the next time around and we will look at these ratios - that were not fit for purpose - and they will be changed.  There is no doubt about it.  The European Stability Mechanism, ESM, is already calling for that ratio of debt to GDP to be increased to 100%.</p> <p>  On the answer to the question I put to the Minister, I am sure he could do this on the back of an envelope.  If the debt-to-GDP ratio in Italy is currently running just shy of 160%, that is 100% above the target in these rules to be able to access the credit line.  The criterion for Italy to access the credit line is that it would have to reduce its portion of debt that is above the 60% by one twentieth.  This means that in each of two years, Italy would have to reduce its debt by 5% in one year and 5% in the next year.  Over a 24 month period Italy would have to reduce its debt by 10%.  I have used Italy as an example, but it could be Ireland, France or Spain.  It does not matter.  If a downturn came and a country needed to access the credit line, that is the type of criterion.  It is likely, as was said, that a country would be in a downturn at that point in time, although there are unique circumstances such as the Minister has pointed out, like natural disasters.  It is likely that a country would be in a downturn at that time.  The idea of having to forcibly reduce debt at that scale of 10% over two years, to be able to access the precautionary credit line, basically makes it inaccessible to countries other than the promise that it may change in the future.</p> <p>  In my time in the Oireachtas I have never seen a situation where we are passing legislation with very clear rules and strict conditions while actually saying "Well do not mind that because we are going to change all of that or we may change that in the future, and if we change that in the future then this will change also."  We must look at what is in front of us now and how it applies now to EU member states.</p></speech>

They see the debt dynamics to which the Deputy refers, and they understand what could be the implications of having to put in place excessive deficit reduction, but they are committed to implementing this treaty. Why are they?  Because, when one brings forward a treaty or a law in front of the House it can only make reference to other laws and other treaties as they stand at this point in time.  That is the reason.</p> <p>  I understand why the Deputy is concerned.  He is pointing to risks within the eurozone and he is pointing to his own political views around the need to reduce debt and deficits, but as concerned as the Deputy is, there is also a relevant question to the points the Deputy put to me.  If the Deputy is so focused on the debt situation of the majority of countries within the EU that could be impacted by this treaty, why have all those governments signed up to implement this treaty?  They signed up because they are aware, as am I, that if and when change were to happen in economic governance, it would impact on the operation of this treaty.  Why is the Italian Government committed to implementing this treaty?  Why has the Belgian Government, and all of the governments listed by the Deputy, committed to doing this?  The reason is exactly as I have just said to the committee.  We are looking at an extraordinarily unique situation this year in deficits, maybe less so in debt, for the reason the Deputy has said, which is that it will come down at a far slower pace for a while - if at all.  Despite all of that, all of the European Union is committed to doing this.  The reason is as I have said to the Deputy on a number of occasions now.</p> <p>  The Deputy is judging all of this by the implementation of deficit reduction paths that are predicated on the exact reapplication of previous deficit reduction strategies.  That is what the Deputy is basing his analysis on.  The fact that every member of the European Union is committed to implementing this treaty would indicate that those countries that could be affected by the scenario as the Deputy has outlined do not accept the Deputy's analysis. </p></speech>

There are different views across Europe in relation to this.  There is a large view out there that this is a very big missed opportunity.  That view has been expressed by those in parliament in Italy with regard to the reforms that could have gone there.  The point here is that we are dealing with outdated rules.  The Minister has acknowledged that the rules that currently exist, the rules that we are enshrining into this legislation, are outdated and are not fit for purpose.</p> <p>  I will now move on to issue of the letter of intent-----</p></speech>

The Deputy has said there is a view by many that this is seen as a missed opportunity.  Those views may well be expressed but in my other role as president of the Eurogroup, I played a role in brokering this agreement.  All of the governments that are in the Eurogroup have signed up to this.  All of them have.  If a view is expressed that this is a missed opportunity, it is not a view that is being expressed by the finance ministers who are representing the countries referred to by the Deputy.</p></speech>

The members of the board of governors of the ESM are, in many cases, the finance ministers of ECOFIN anyway, so the finance ministers themselves or their representatives will be involved in making this decision.  The latter makes it exceptionally unlikely that they would deviate in any way from the rules they themselves are involved in setting.

The IMF will play a role in these negotiations.

There is nothing in this agreement which suggests the conditions would not undermine public services or threaten economic recovery.  What we saw with the MOU to which we in Ireland were subject was that public services were undermined.  We are still dealing with the consequences of that.  Gross economic recovery was impacted as a result of the period of recession.  It was lengthened and deepened, and the impact of that was felt by communities and regions.  The point I am making is that there is nothing in this treaty which states that an MOU must ensure that it does not undermine public services or threaten economic recovery.</p></speech>

We are talking about a member state government and a finance minister negotiating to secure additional funding in a time of crisis.  In such a case the negotiation to which I referred earlier would look to strike the best possible balance between getting the member state out of the acute difficulty it could be in and preserving public services and living standards as they stand.</p><p>However, in the absence of a credit line such as this, the hit and damage that could be caused to public services and economic recovery would be far bigger.  This could be pointing to a difference in approach between us in the operation of this line.  I think it is appropriate that conditionality is in place regarding the access of a credit facility such as this, given this uses the pooled and credit funding of the European Union as a whole, to which countries contribute.  The conditionality would also have to be agreed and get the balance right between maintaining public services as they stand and avoiding even worse difficulty if this credit line were not to be available to a country.</p></speech>

They may genuinely think they have the interests of the member state, but they will be coming at it from their own position and views.  We have experienced this.  Was the Minister's predecessor not walking down the steps into the D&aacute;il when he got the call saying he could not burn the bondholders because a bomb would go off in Dublin if he did?  A Cabinet decision taken democratically by elected Members of the Oireachtas elected to the office of Minister was halted by a phone call after a decision in Europe.  That has been our reality and as a result of deciding to fold at that point, unguaranteed bondholders were paid billions.</p> <p>  What is worth noting and welcome in this part of the legislation is that this would not happen today.  Bondholders would be burned.  It is now the accepted principle throughout Europe, through the Single Resolution Fund, that there would be a bail-in and bondholders would be burned, in the first instance, through a tiered structure.  Unfortunately, this comes ten years too late for Ireland and we did not have a Cabinet at the time willing to implement the decisions it took.  I do not know if there was ever a time in history that a Cabinet decision was overturned by a phone call.</p> <p>  It is a bit naive to suggest that just because the Minister's colleagues are in ECOFIN, they will always have Ireland's interests at heart.  We have seen many of the challenges, twists and turns in relation to other objectives Ireland wanted to meet and how they were frustrated along the way, whether by Germany or another entity.  Others have their own ideas, which are valid, but they have their own priorities as regards how the system should work.</p></speech>

I said this was a negotiated outcome and other countries would be involved and I pointed to the acknowledgement that there is conditionality.  I never, in any of my statements, said this would be guided by altruism alone and purely the interests of one country.  This is a negotiated outcome, as I have said repeatedly in my presentation.  The reason is that multiple national interests are at stake, as are the interests of institutions charged with protecting the health and future of the eurozone.  For this reason, I have referred throughout my presentation to other countries being involved in this and the existence of conditionality.</p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's point about what happened to us a decade ago, the abiding lesson I take from that is that if a country loses its economic sovereignty and is not in a position to fund itself and give confidence to others that it will be able to fund itself in the future, it is vulnerable and more open to pressures that can develop.  It is one of the reasons this treaty is now being ratified throughout the European Union.  Through the development of the credit lines the Deputy and I discussed a few moments ago, and especially through the strengthening of the role of the European Stability Mechanism with regard to the SRF, the EU is trying to prevent acute financial crises from developing in the future and mitigate the harm they cause.  Nowhere in my presentation have I sought to infer that this is anything but the outcome of negotiations.</p></speech>

In each of those credit lines conditionality is negotiated with the ESM and, in some cases, the IMF.  Some of the conditionality will be corrective and some will relate to meeting the criteria.</p> <p>  Let me just go back to the Single Resolution Fund because the ESM will also lend to the SRF in order to bail out banks after the bondholders have been burned.  What conditionality do we place on the financial institutions as a result of making that lending available to the Single Resolution Fund which will then make it available to the financial institutions?</p></speech>

I ask the committee to bear with me.  The conditionality involved, at a bare minimum, is the obvious point that the SRF, including the share of the ESM funding the SRF, is funded by contributions banks make.  That is a profound difference from where we were a decade ago.   However, if the Deputy takes me through his other questions, I will see-----</p></speech>

There will be strict conditionality if a member state looks for it.  That could be profound, especially in the context of a memorandum of understanding, MOU.  What conditions will be placed on financial institutions in terms of restructuring or doing whatever is in the public good?  I do not see them anywhere in this comprehensive legislation.</p></speech>

However, the key feature of how we would deal with banks is that all of this would happen after bondholders had been bailed in and in fairness to the Deputy, he made that point earlier.  I ask him to bear with me for a moment.</p></speech>

Did it ever cross his mind that we should impose conditionality on the banks, as we do on member states?  He had a key and prominent role in negotiating this agreement.</p></speech>

The progress we made in ensuring the SRF and ESM are funded by banks rather than the taxpayer was a massive step forward.  The key piece of conditionality in this is, as I explained, that the money that goes into ESM - the share of the ESM that is relevant to this - and to the SRF is a contribution from the banking sector.  There is no further conditionality there.</p></speech>

However, member states, using taxpayers' money, will step in if that is not sufficient at a point in time, but will be paid back.  There are no structural or other conditions that could be applied to member states if they run into financial difficulties.  If a bank is running into financial difficulty, there is bail-in and burning of bondholders, which should have happened ten years ago, but in any event is happening now.  In addition to the bail-in of bondholders, we will have the tiered process and the Single Resolution Fund.  However, if the Single Resolution Fund, which is made up of bank contributions, runs out, taxpayers' money, through the ESM, will be made available to banks.  It has to be paid back but there is no other conditionality on top of that.</p><p>Yet member states that run into financial difficulty have to pay back the money to the ESM in an agreed period and there is a raft of conditionality.  The IMF is drawn in as the ESM.  There are negotiations around structural changes that may happen around possibly selling off assets and changes with laws that might be implemented and so on.  As the lead negotiator in this, did the Minister ever consider that would not be fair or balanced and that maybe banks should have conditionality imposed on them if they run into difficulty?</p></speech>

I will explain why.  It is there because the bondholders at this point will be bearing a cost that they have not borne before.  That is the difference.  The Deputy is wrong in what he says about the taxpayer funding the operation of the ESM.  In these situations it will also be banks through lending to the ESM that will be contributing to the operation of the ESM in backing up the SRF, to be very clear.  In this particular set of circumstances it is banks that are funding the operation of the SRF if it is dealing with a banking difficulty.  The parity of treatment arises in this situation.  It is banks funding the consequences of banking difficulty, not the taxpayer.  That is the key difference.  It is a massive and much-needed improvement on where we have been.  It is a big step forward in how the costs of banking difficulty are borne by banks.  I am not quite sure what other conditionality the Deputy would want apart from the key fact that it is banks which are now in the front line of paying for banking difficulty and not the taxpayer.  That is why this is a step forward and that is why I am recommending this to the D&aacute;il.  That is the huge change in where we are.  That is the contribution they are making.</p></speech>

The actual tiered structure of how to deal with banking failure is appropriate.  We are getting to the point where we should have been, which is what Sinn F&eacute;in had articulated.  The Minister and his colleagues lambasted us and now they cheerlead the fact that bondholders should be burned in a scenario where a financial institution fails, that that should be the first line of defence and that there should be other tiered structures.  The key point is that as we go down the waterfall of bail-in, there is a point where the ESM funds can be made available to the SRF.  They have to be paid back within three years but they are being made available to the SRF for the purpose of providing that support for the banking sector.  That is taxpayers' money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.518" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#F01300"><p>To be completely clear, in that situation loans from the backstop itself are repaid by contributions from the European banking sector.  In addition to repayments that are funded by banking sector contributions, the single resolution mechanism regulation sets out a series of conditions which limit the risk to which the fund, and thereby the backstop, could be exposed.  A contribution from the fund or the backstop itself to recapitalisation could only be made following the bail-in of at least 8% of the total liabilities, including funds, meaning that shareholders and creditors suffer losses before the SRF or the backstop itself is accessed.  My point is that before we get anywhere near the development of those kinds of circumstances, taxpayers will be protected by bondholders being brought in to pay for the cost of banking difficulty and we will have the operation of the SRF.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#F01400"><p>Yes, but let me say in a friendly way that the Minister misled the committee earlier on because the point is that there are tiered-down, waterfall systems where bondholders will be burned in the first instance and then the fund that is made up of banking contributions - the SRF - would be used.  However, after that it is taxpayers' money: it is contributions from the ESM to the SRF that will flow into the financial institutions.  The Minister gives the impression, maybe by accident, that no taxpayers' money would be used and that the difference between the banks is that it would be all banking money.  That is not the case.  It will be paid back to us by the SRF within a three-year period but before that initial three years there will be a flow of money from the ESM which is capitalised through contributions from member states.  As the Minister mentioned, it will be in excess of &euro;800 million from Ireland, with larger contributions from other states depending on the size of their economies.  It is an important point around the accuracy of what we are dealing with.  It is a tiered structure.  The legislation allows for the ESM to lend to the SRF and sets out the conditionality in relation to that in terms of when the SRF would have to pay back those funds to the ESM.  However, it is a case where taxpayers' money, albeit at the very end of the line, can flow in to financial institutions.  Therefore, returning to the point that I was making earlier, if that is not triggered I do not see an issue in terms of conditionality but if it were to be triggered there is no conditionality on the banks.</p></speech>

Sure, I know the legislation.  However, the Minister is making the point that taxpayers' money would not be used in terms of a contribution to the financial institutions.  That is factually inaccurate.  It will only happen after all of the other safeguards are used but that is exactly what the legislation is.  The legislation is about that last safeguard to ensure a bank would not fail.  When the SRF resources are depleted, there is an ability for the ESM to lend to the SRF which will make money available to the banks, and that has to be paid back.  It is important for accuracy that this is not a difference between us on this issue.  I am not arguing that it should not happen.  I am saying, for the purposes of accuracy, that there is a point where taxpayers' money via the ESM would be made available to the SRF at the end of the line where all other options - the bail-in and the SRF - have been exhausted.  That is when it kicks in.  Therefore, as a result of the fact that there is taxpayers' money on the line - yes, with strong provisions in regard to safeguarding that money and getting it back from the SRF - there should be an ability to look at conditionality on the financial institutions just as you are imposing conditionality on member states for their credit lines.</p></speech>

Where I differ from the Deputy is that the issue of conditionality has less relevance here.  In the circumstances in which the lending between the ESM and SRF happens, by that point so much action would have taken place that would have had a profound impact on the bank.  In those circumstances, we would be talking about a situation in which bondholders have already made a contribution, having huge effect on the value of the bank.  We would be talking about where the Single Resolution Fund has already played a role that will also have an impact on the value of the bank.  Many different steps would need to be gone through, which the Deputy acknowledged and we agree on, before we get to the operation of the ESM.  In those situations, because the ESM is lending money to the SRF, the ESM will also get its money back - which is the taxpayer - albeit at a point in the future.  That is where the contribution of the banks comes in; in all the steps that would happen before we get to the role that the SRF is lending to the ESM.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.530" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#G00700"><p>I am sorry.  I just want to mention something.  I want to bring the debate on this section to a conclusion.  We have discussed it at length.  There were no amendments.  We are now discussing the section and I believe we have exhausted it, so we need to move on.  I need a final response from Deputy Pearse Doherty and from the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#G00800"><p>As I said, some of the Minister's logic in relation to this is very left field.  He has made the argument that this is a loan to the banks.  But sure, what does he think the other credit lines are to member states?  They are not grants.  They are not cheques that do not have to be paid back.  They are loans as well.  They have to be paid back.  The Minister has argued that it is a loan, therefore, we will get the money back.  That does not make any sense.  The other two credit lines are loans as well to member states with the expectation that member states pay those loans back in the future.  We will disagree on this.  Obviously, as the chair of the Eurogroup the Minister had a key role in this.  I am disappointed.  Yes, the bondholders will be bailed in.  That is good.  We have been calling for that for years.  It is the logical thing to do.  Yes, there is a fund established by the banks and taxpayers' money will not be utilised in the settlements.  That is the right thing to do, but there is scope for conditionality.  For example, we have had it in our own experience here.  Should the board of a bank continue to exist, or should the option be available to the ESM to remove the board of a bank and the CEO of a bank if he or she was involved in reckless lending that forced bondholders to take the hit and the Single Resolution Fund to be exhausted?</p> <p>  The Single Resolution Fund is made up of contributions from financial institutions across member states.  Some of these financial institutions may not have put a foot wrong but will be paying for what could possibly be a rogue financial institution.  That type of conditionality does not exist because you have not put it in place.  Yes, there will be plenty of conditionality and an open book in relation to member states, including that the Minister cannot give the commitment that even those conditions would not affect public services or economic recovery.  Yet, there is no scope for the ESM to introduce that type of conditionality even though the same taxpayers' money that would be made available to the credit line to member states would be utilised by banks through the vehicle of the Single Resolution Fund.  On that point, I will leave my comments on the Bill.</p></speech>

This is a piece of legislation that seeks to protect the taxpayer and support and help countries when they are in situations of financial and economic difficulty.  In the absence of the credit lines proposed here, countries could find themselves in even tougher and more difficult economic circumstances.  Yes, there is conditionality there because this is other countries that are in effect making money available to countries that are in difficulty.  If they are doing that, it is understandable that on behalf of their own taxpayers they would look to ensure that money is used in a way they think is fit and appropriate.  That is why I believe there is a role of conditionality here.  If Ireland found itself in a situation that our funding was used to support or help a country in the context of an economic crisis, Irish taxpayers would expect a role of conditionality in it.</p> <p>  I refer to the point raised by the Deputy regarding banks.  I agree with much of what he said in that this is about how we ensure banks pay for their own difficulty and pay for cleaning up their own cost.  I expect that in any situation where a bank is involved in finally receiving support from the SRF, those who have been involved in running a bank that needs support from the SRF would find themselves facing some pretty tough questions too.</p></speech>
