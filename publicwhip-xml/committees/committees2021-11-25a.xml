The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  I ask that members and all those in attendance to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19, particularly during the current surge.  They are strongly advised to leave at least one vacant seat between them and others attending and to use the sanitisers provided.  They should always maintain appropriate social distance before, during and after the meeting and wear masks at all times, except when speaking.  Members participating remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.</p> <p>  This morning, we will engage with officials from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to examine the 2020 appropriation account, Vote 33 - Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media; and, from the 2020 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts of the public services, chapter 7 - oversight of funding for the European Capital of Culture 2020 or Galway 2020, as it is referred to.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by a number of officials from the Department, which reflects the scope of the its responsibility.  In attendance are Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General; Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in, assistant secretary, tourism and sport division; Mr. Conor Falvey, assistant secretary, culture division; Ms. Patricia Murphy, assistant secretary, corporate affairs; Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill, assistant secretary, broadcasting and media division; Mr. Aodh&aacute;n Mac Cormaic, Sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir na Gaeilge; Ms Tania Banotti, director of Creative Ireland; and Mr. Joe Healy, principal officer, head of finance and IT.  We are also joined by remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Brian O'Malley, principal officer in the relevant Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p> <p>  I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so that we do not pick up background noise or feedback.  I remind all those attending to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references speakers may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precinct is protected pursuant to the constitutional statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the precincts and as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is present.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions under Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  To assist the broadcasting unit and the Debates Office, I ask members to direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not being directed to a specific witness, I ask that each witness to state his or her name the first time he or she contributes.</p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#A00500"><p>Vote 33 is effectively a new Vote developed in 2020 to reflect significant changes in the allocation of functions between Departments.  As a result, comparisons with 2019 are of limited value.  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 33 discloses total gross expenditure of &euro;972 million.  This was distributed across five expenditure programmes and included funding for a wide range of "downstream" agencies tasked with distributing grant assistance for activities and development in their respective areas.</p> <p>  Spending on the broadcasting programme amounted to &euro;271 million in 2020.  The majority of this, or &euro;237 million, was expended on grants to RT&Eacute; and TG4 to carry out their public service broadcasting commitments.  The Department spent more than &euro;242 million on the arts and culture programme in 2020.  This included &euro;105 million to support the operations of the Arts Council, contributions towards the expenses of a wide range of national and regional cultural bodies and &euro;7.1 million in funding for the European Capital of Culture 2020.  Expenditure on the sports and recreation services programme in 2020 was &euro;203 million.  This included &euro;163 million in funding for Sport Ireland.  The Department spent almost &euro;190 million under the tourism services programme.  Expenditure on the Gaeltacht programme was &euro;66 million in 2020.  </p> <p>  On the receipts side, appropriations-in-aid amounted to &euro;234 million in 2020, comprised mainly of &euro;223 million in broadcasting licence fee receipts.  The surplus on the Vote remaining at the year-end was just under &euro;50 million.  The Department carried over &euro;17 million to 2021 and the balance of &euro;33 million was due for surrender to the central fund of the Exchequer.  My audit report draws attention to a disclosure by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control that the Department incurred significant expenditure relating to goods and services where the procurement arrangements did not comply with procurement guidelines.  </p> <p>  Turning to chapter 7 of my report on the accounts of the public services for 2020, in July 2016, Galway was designated under an EU-supported scheme as the European Capital of Culture for 2020.  In support of the application for designation, the Department committed in principle to provide funding of &euro;15 million to the project.  The examination found that the programme delivery model was different from that previously used for similar events for other Irish cities.  An independent company trading under the name Galway 2020 was established to deliver the capital of culture programme of activities.  There was significant turnover in the membership of the company's board of directors together with significant changes early on in the executive leadership of the company.  The examination found that while initial financial reporting by the company was limited to what was required under the Companies Act, this was largely addressed in 2019 when the company registered as a charity.  This required significantly more detailed financial reporting, which is also appropriate for a body substantially funded by State grants.  It was originally envisaged that Exchequer funding for the capital of culture programme would not exceed 50% of the overall financial cost.  However, in the end, the programme relied on public sources for the majority of its funding.  Covid-19 restrictions significantly affected the delivery of the programme and impacted box office receipts but sponsorship support was also much less than envisaged even before the pandemic became an issue.  At the time of completing this report, independent evaluators were in the process of formally assessing the effectiveness of the Galway 2020 capital of culture programme.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas freisin le hOifig an Ard-Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste as an mbealach proifisi&uacute;nta a rinne a cuid oifigeach an obair a bh&iacute; riachtanach i nd&aacute;il leis an gcuntas sin.</p> <p>  I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address the committee at what I believe is a very critical period in time for the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  As I address the committee, I am extremely cognisant of all of the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic across society.  This is particularly pertinent in respect of the sectors served by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  These sectors are fundamentally about people, audiences and participation.  They include the arts sector, live entertainment and cultural events, which includes artists, entertainers and audiences; sporting participants and spectators; hotels, restaurants, bars or tourism attractions and services and the tourists and patrons who enjoy these facilities; and students attending col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh, the col&aacute;ist&iacute;, mn&aacute; t&iacute; and halla&iacute; pobal that support this experience and businesses in Gaeltacht regions.</p><p>Our national and local media have also been critical stakeholders right throughout the pandemic.  They have provided important public information and debate throughout the crisis, while also experiencing their own challenges. </p><p> The impact of the pandemic on all these sectors is well documented.  Employing many hundreds of thousands of people, right across the country, these are the sectors that thrive when people congregate to enjoy their leisure time together.  They were the first to close as a result of the pandemic, and they are among the last to return to full operations as restrictions ease.  In response to the impact of Covid-19 across these sectors, the Department introduced several new schemes and initiatives over the past 18 months.  These include the Covid-19 business continuity scheme, business adaptation schemes and restart grants for the tourism and hospitality sectors; a significant suite of supports for live performance across the events and entertainment industries; a support package for the sports sector, encompassing the IRFU, GAA, FAI, the national governing bodies of sport and clubs and communities; measures to support the Irish summer colleges sector; and measures to support media, and the independent and local radio sector in particular.  These measures are all in addition to the significant suite of cross-sectoral supports that the Government has introduced.</p><p> The staff of the Department and its agencies have worked tirelessly to design and implement a wide range of initiatives and programmes in the optimal manner to focus the supports where most needed, while simultaneously pivoting to a new way of working that did not involve physical attendance at the office.  The supports put in place needed to be flexible and dynamic in response to an ever-changing environment, and that still remains the position as we continue to monitor and assess the impact of both the pandemic and the mitigating interventions.</p><p> Regarding my appearance here, the briefing note provided to the committee outlines the background to the establishment of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in 2020 and some of the key outputs of the Department in that year, by programme area, and it also provides details regarding the Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture project, which is the subject of chapter 7 of the report of the Controller and Auditor General for 2020.  </p><p> The European Capital of Culture is the longest running and one of the most high-profile European Union actions in the cultural space.  It has been a great honour for Galway to hold the designation from February 2020 to April 2021, despite the complications that Covid-19 presented.  During its designated year, Galway 2020 supported more than 600 artists and other cultural workers, such as producers, technicians and crew, to deliver more than 500 events through a combination of physical and online events in what was an unprecedented global pandemic.  In delivering this programme, Galway 2020 employed a dynamic volunteer programme, consisting of more than 800 volunteers from 50 countries, and a strong community engagement programme, as well as vibrant international and partnership programmes. </p><p> As Accounting Officer for the Department, I welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General's examination of the oversight of funding for the European Capital of Culture 2020 project.  I accept the recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General on foot of the detailed examination, as outlined in chapter 7 of the 2020 report, and I will continue to work to ensure that all relevant grant management provisions are fully incorporated and implemented as part of future oversight of and reporting on grants.</p><p> I reiterate my commitment as Accounting Officer to ensuring that all projects under the remit of the Department are managed in accordance with the provisions of the public spending code and all relevant circulars.  We will continue to take lessons from the past to ensure that we have the most appropriate and effective structures and processes in place to deliver effectively for all our stakeholders, many of whom have been and continue to be adversely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  I am happy to expand on any of these areas.  I have brought my full management board team with me today because of the breadth, range and depth of our programmes.  Therefore, we are very happy to expand on any of the programme areas.    </p></speech>

Her Department covers a wide range of issues and areas.  I have some questions.  Focusing on RT&Eacute;, and looking at its accounts, that organisation has run a deficit for six consecutive years.  RT&Eacute;'s income has reduced by &euro;100 million in the same period, while costs have increased by &euro;30 million.  Land was sold in the last year as well.  In addition, in 2019, RT&Eacute; recorded borrowings of &euro;95 million.  The director general of RT&Eacute;, Dee Forbes, described the situation as "unsustainable".</p> <p>  The overall picture with this commercial semi-State, which comes under the remit of the Department, looks to be far from secure.  We have concerns about this aspect, and Ms Licken might like to comment in this regard.  Does she see RT&Eacute; perhaps requiring some kind of a State bailout?  Are we facing into a crisis with the organisation?  I would like Ms Licken to outline, briefly, her Department's take on the current situation.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Katherine Licken" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#B00300"><p>RT&Eacute; demonstrated how important public service broadcasting really is during the pandemic.  It provided critical information.  The evidence is there to show that people rely on RT&Eacute; as a trusted source of information.  Good and transparent public service media, and good media overall, are important for a well-functioning democracy.  It was precisely for this reason that the Future of Media Commission was established.  It is in the programme for Government.  The commission has completed its deliberations, and those are being considered by the Minister and the Taoiseach.  Part of those deliberations concerned looking at public service broadcasting and the wider media landscape.</p> <p>  To address the Chair's question, we do monitor RT&Eacute;'s financial position closely.  It was in surplus in 2020.  As I said, the Future of Media Commission is a policy matter for Ministers, but we are working closely with RT&Eacute;, with NewERA, which has a role in the governance of RT&Eacute;, and with the BAI to monitor the situation closely.  We are conscious of the importance of RT&Eacute;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#B00400"><p>Ms Licken is the Accounting Officer for the Department, and we understand that RT&Eacute; is an independent commercial semi-State organisation, but a large part of its funding comes through the Department.  Ms Licken outlined those figures in the documents she sent to us for today's meeting.  Is she concerned now, however, at the financial state of RT&Eacute;?  I ask that because the situation looks to be far from healthy.  Costs have increased and income has reduced dramatically.  Land can be sold, but that can only be done once.  There has also been substantial borrowing.  The most recent figure I could find in that regard was for 2019, when it was &euro;95 million.  Is the situation at RT&Eacute; sustainable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Katherine Licken" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#B00500"><p>RT&Eacute; has exercised great judgement and management in this regard.  It has cost-cutting measures in place, and it is working to contain its costs as best as is possible.  We are working closely with the organisation in that regard.  I should stress that RT&Eacute;'s funding comes from the television licence fee, as set out in statute.  The money that comes into our Vote is, to all intents and purposes, a pass-through.  It comes in from the television licence fee and then it goes out to RT&Eacute;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#B00600"><p>I understand that.  An internal memo in Ms Licken's Department earlier in the year, however, referred to the finances of RT&Eacute; as not being "sustainable" and that they "were undermining its capacity" to perform its role.  Can Ms Licken confirm if that is accurate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Katherine Licken" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#B00700"><p>We are of course concerned, and we will always be concerned, about funding for public service broadcasting.  We will always be concerned, generally, about RT&Eacute;'s funding position.  It is for that reason, and in that policy context, that the Future of Media Commission was put in place to examine the future not just of public service broadcasting, as encompassed by RT&Eacute;, but also of the media generally.  It is right, therefore, to say that there are concerns.  It is also right to say that the Government is acting on those concerns and that the Department is working closely with RT&Eacute; regarding its financial position.  The organisation's surplus in 2020 was &euro;7.9 million.  Therefore, some of the predicted shortfalls did not emerge as anticipated, and that was good news.</p></speech>

It does not get funding directly from the Department, other than through the licence fee.</p><p>That is the mechanism by which it is funded so it does not seek funding directly from the Department.  It got additional funding last year in respect of the free licences from the Department of Social Protection for pensioners.  That is a long-established mechanism, but the Department does not fund RT&Eacute; directly through any line item in its Vote, other than passing through the TV licence.</p></speech>

I wish to focus in the first instance on cultural institutions, programme B, specifically subheads B1 through to B15, of the tourism, culture, arts, Gaeltacht, sport and media Vote.  The entire budget of the Department is rapidly nudging up to &euro;1 billion.  As a result, I assume that will give rise to many new challenges.  Under the Project 2040 national development plan, NDP, there is &euro;460 million allocated to the national cultural institutions investment programme.  The projects incorporated into that programme include the conversion of the Bishop Street warehouse into a secure, environmentally controlled archival repository for the National Archives, the National Library of Ireland redevelopment, the development of the Crawford Art Gallery in my native Cork and the proposal to renovate the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Museum of Ireland, the National Concert Hall, the Abbey Theatre and the Chester Beatty Library.  The National Museum of Ireland is preparing a design procurement of the history of Ireland galleries.</p> <p>  All are laudable projects and are to be supported.  However, they will all bring challenges for the Department.  The big shift in the spending capacity of the Department in respect of these cultural institutions under the NDP gives rise to a number of specific questions.  First, what expertise and systems have increased at Department level to ensure the efficient disbursement of funding for approved capital development projects?</p></speech>

This is a very welcome injection of funds.  As the Deputy will know from the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork, many of these institutions have not seen major redevelopment for many years and, in some cases, centuries, for example, the Natural History Museum.  This is welcome funding.  The first phase of the refurbishment of the National Gallery of Ireland led the way in terms of showing what can be done in the cultural institutions when investment is provided.  On foot of us receiving that money, we moved immediately to establish a dedicated team, composed principally of economists, that oversees our investment programme and particularly the investment in the cultural institutions.  That is the Project Ireland 2040 team that we established a number of years ago.  The purpose of the team is to ensure the institutions walk carefully through the public spending code and the capital works framework when undertaking their investments.  Many of the institutions are now in progress with regard to those investments.  Obviously, we work closely with the Office of Public Works, OPW, too.  It delivers the projects for us.  We are also working closely with RT&Eacute;.  I might ask Mr. Conor Falvey to speak in a little more detail on the individual programmes.</p></speech>

First, who will be responsible for procurement and project management for the capital development projects in the cultural institutions?  What is the precise role of the Department, the cultural institution and, where applicable, the OPW in this?  Who ultimately manages those relationships?  Who undertakes the procurement and daily project oversight?  Who signs off on procurement and spending, the Department or the cultural institution?  If overspends occur and if the Legislature, through this committee, needs to interrogate certain issues, who will appear before this committee?  Looking at the projects I referred to, it is statistically possible there might be issues that may arise in respect of overspends and public procurement that may give rise to questions that have to be answered.  If overspends occur, who would appear before this committee?  Would it be the Secretary General and her Department or the cultural institution?  Furthermore, what additional resources and expertise have been made available to the cultural institutions to deal with this increased oversight and workload?  That is just one parcel of questions.  There are further questions on this issue.</p></speech>

The Department is the approving authority, the relevant national cultural institution is the sponsoring agency and the OPW is the contracting authority.  If something goes wrong, the committee will have us back before it and, perhaps, the OPW as the contracting authority.  We are very conscious of that.  It has to be borne in mind that some of these projects are old buildings so there is always the risk of finding something that was not anticipated.  For that reason the public spending code and the capital works framework allows to us to have a phase of investigation work.  That is ongoing at the National Library at present.  It is a detailed investigation.  Once we have cleared the books out of the site we have contractors to go in and carry out a detailed investigation of what is there, the conditions there and what difficulties are likely to arise.  That is before one goes to detailed planning and contracting, so one can get a better estimate of the cost.</p></speech>

The context in which I ask these questions is that I worry that the voluntary boards of the institutions that are earmarked for capital development projects, notwithstanding their expertise on cultural and governance matters, might not have expertise on procurement matters.  With this money coming down the track to these laudable projects, I worry that there might not be the capacity within the institutions to be able to have that expertise.  I am trying to tease out whether it is the intention of the Department to buttress those institutions with additional skill sets as befit the specific project as it arises.  The Secretary General said a dedicated team has been established comprising economists.  I would like to be assured whether there are teams of procurement specialists and governance specialists being readied for the delivery of these projects.  There is a gap there and it is giving rise to concern.  I do not feel assured by the answers so far, if I may say that.</p></speech>

All of the projects have oversight groups in place.  In earlier stages, we call them interim working groups.  They comprise officials from the Department, the government unit within the Department that oversees the individual institutions, the Project Ireland 2040 office, the OPW and the cultural institutions.  We provide resources to the cultural institutions to procure the design, expertise and project-management expertise and to manage the current project phase.  Separate from that, the Department and the OPW have a programme-level oversight group that overviews all the projects.  It includes the commissioner, the State architect, me, my colleague, Ms Murphy, from our government side, and various representatives from the OPW and the Department.  We work very closely with the institutions.  We are moving them all very carefully through the various phases under the public expenditure code.</p> <p>  On the code, there are a number of decision gates, covering strategic assessment, the business case, pre-tender approval, approval to proceed and the final business case.  All of those are subject to the approval of the Minister.  The groups typically meet every two months, or eight weeks, depending on the phase of the project.  The models we have had have been based on the lessons from the National Gallery, whose transformation was very successful.  As the Secretary General alluded to, we have completed phase 1 of the works at the National Library.  This has seen a significant risk to a national collection in the west wing of the National Library completely mitigated, which is a very significant outcome.  As we move to the next phase, investigative works are being done by the OPW to establish the physical fabric of the building, as the Secretary General referred to in order that we can have a good evidence basis for estimating the cost of the next phase of the works, which in turn will inform the design before we go to procurement, etc.  That is an overview.  If there is anything the Deputy would like me to elaborate on, I will be happy to do so.</p></speech>

We will examine the matter further as time goes on.  I thank the witnesses for that.</p> <p>  I want to move on to a quite bespoke issue, namely, that of storage within the cultural institutions.  My understanding is that there is a storage facility for the National Museum which is housed in Swords.  The National Museum of Ireland's collections resource centre in Swords houses 4 million objects.  This is an extraordinary figure.  What does the future hold for the storage of the key objects in our national collections, regardless of the institution?  I understand that, in the case of the National Museum of Ireland, there are only eight years remaining on the existing lease and that a rent review that was due in September 2020 has still not been concluded.  If we are seeking to animate any of the projects I outlined, we will have to decant many of the artefacts or pieces, be they artistic or otherwise, to other sites.  How are the witnesses dealing with the issue of the storage of these precious items within our national collections, specifically in the National Museum of Ireland?  What are the witnesses doing to ensure there is a sustainable storage facility for the National Museum of Ireland and other cultural institutions?</p></speech>

The storage issue is very important to us.  We have worked very closely with the National Museum of Ireland on storage.  The museum uses the storage facility not only for storage but also for researchers coming to access the collections to work on them.  I might ask Mr. Falvey to go into more detail.  We have a lot of engagement.  The facility is under contract with the OPW.  We have had an awful lot of engagement with the National Museum of Ireland and the OPW in respect of this particular site.</p></speech>

I asked a specific question about rent reviews.  What was the outcome of the rent review?

I wish to pick up on one of the points made by Deputy Sherlock regarding the cultural institutions.  I visited the National Library about ten years ago and was horrified by the conditions in which the collection were then being held.  I am very pleased that a significant risk to the collection has been mitigated.  Work is absolutely necessary.  The same applies to the National Archives and the problems with storage.  I am completely on board regarding the need for these projects.</p> <p>  Let me pick up on the point on controlling costs.  With regard to the National Gallery, I understand the original Estimate was around &euro;25 million.  Is it the case that it came in at &euro;52 million and that there is conciliation at the moment?  What is the story with that?</p></speech>

At that point, the Government will need to take a decision as to whether to proceed with the bid.  The Ryder Cup-----</p></speech>

I want to turn quickly to Galway 2020 and the amount of sponsorship.  It was anticipated that there would have been more sponsorship than there was.  At what point did the Department realise that it would go beyond the 50% expenditure that was committed?  Indeed, when one starts adding in the contributions of the local authorities, it was not far off an 80% spend.  At what point did the Department realise that there would not be the anticipated sponsorship and that there was not the local commercial commitment?</p></speech>

This was to be one of its finest moments.  Obviously, the pandemic had a huge impact on Galway 2020, like it has done on so many other sectors.  The combined public sector funding - not just the Exchequer funding, but the combined funding of the Exchequer, the local authorities and other sources of funding for that project - was to be 85%.  That was the combination.  The programme was launched in February 2019 and the pandemic hit in March.  It became clear to us quickly that some elements of the funding would not materialise.  On the local authority funding, local authorities were hit hard by loss of income from sources such as parking, rates, etc.  We then had a decision to make whether we would continue with Galway 2020.  The 50% Exchequer funding was a guide, which we put out when we first asked the cities of Ireland to put in bids.  We said that there would be a guide of either &euro;15 million, which was even at that stage only a guide, and 50% of the cost funded by the Exchequer.</p></speech>

We need to see a report on this from the Department.  Are assets owned as a legacy of this?  Who owns them?  Did the model that was ultimately decided on work?  Has the Department reviewed it?

The 356 percussion instruments, which were part of an element of the project, have been donated to the Galway-Roscommon Education and Training Board, ETB, for use in music generation.  Following the expiry of its lease on 31 March 2021, Galway 2020 officially moved from 16 Merchants Road to its new office in the Wave Maker hub at the Cornstore in Middle Street, Galway.  Prior to that, the assets identified for disposal included furniture, fixtures, fittings, ICT and technology equipment.  Approval was obtained from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the disposal of assets.

I want to touch on RT&Eacute;.  Ms Licken said the funding for RT&Eacute; comes through her Department, but we know that RT&Eacute; is funded through the television licence.  RT&Eacute; accounts for nearly 25% of the total expenditure.  The funding comes through the Department and it is tasked with handing the funding over.  I want to touch on the fact that RT&Eacute; recently made a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners for &euro;1.2 million, which arose from the misclassification of workers or, effectively, bogus self-employment.  In June, in correspondence with the committee, Ms Licken had indicated that she could not engage on the subject as it was part of an ongoing process with the Revenue Commissioners.  Now that the settlement has been made, what actions have the Department taken in response?  Has it done anything in response to that settlement being made?</p></speech>

These are operational matters for RT&Eacute;.  Obviously, we are conscious of them.  However, they are operational matters for RT&Eacute;.  RT&Eacute; has appeared before the committee and has undertaken has appear again before the committee on the matter.  The matter is apparently still under consideration by the Department of Social Protection.  There is a process ongoing.  Ms Murphy might like to comment further on that.</p></speech>

The outcome of that report is awaited.  RT&Eacute; has put in place an employment-first policy, which we are aware of, to address future issues arising.  The Department is happy with progress in that regard.</p></speech>

We have quarterly governance meetings on issues that arise.  The terms and conditions of staff are a matter for RT&Eacute;.  It is independent in that regard under the Broadcasting Act.  As I mentioned, these are complex employment law issues.  Revenue and the Department of Social Protection are best advised on contract and service issues.

I recently engaged with RT&Eacute; regarding pay disparity that has been ongoing between cl&aacute;r reachtair&iacute; and their English-language counterparts.  It seems that workers are essentially being paid less if they work through the medium of Irish.  I understand that has been going on for approximately 20 years.  RT&Eacute; at the time claimed to be unaware of it, which surprised me.  It said it would follow up with a note, but it did not do that.  It reneged on that.  It said it was carrying out a review, which could take months or years, or might never see the light of day.  Ms Murphy spoke about transparency earlier.  A hell of a lot of public money is involved and one would be concerned.  The Department is responsible for the media and the Gaeltacht.  Would our guests have any particular interest in an organisation that gets its funding through the Department implementing, if you like, a sliding scale of wages, based on the language that people work through?  Surely our guests would have some concerns about that.</p></speech>

As the Department with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, we are always concerned about funding for the Irish language and actions to promote it.  We increased the funding to TG4 last year and this year.  We understand that RT&Eacute; is conducting a comparative review of the remuneration of Irish-speaking workers.  It has run a public tender to engage an expert partner with specific experience in the media sector to carry out a full evaluation of all staff roles and grades in RT&Eacute;.  Irish-language roles will be part of the review, which will commence on completion of the tender process.  It is important.</p> <p>  On the question of the oversight of RT&Eacute;, we have the BAI, ourselves and NewERA.  There is extensive oversight of RT&Eacute;.  Issues will obviously always arise from time to time with any entity and it is important that issues are addressed promptly.</p></speech>

This has been going on for 20 years.  It was only when it was flagged and people persistently chased it that RT&Eacute; did what it is doing.  We have, as yet, nothing concrete from RT&Eacute;.  There has been a lack of oversight and, for 20 years, there has been a sliding scale of wages.</p></speech>

All I can say is I welcome the fact it is doing a review now and looking at the issue.  It is complex.  Perhaps Ms Murphy would like to add to that.  It is a complex area.  RT&Eacute; is a large organisation with a wider variety of different grade structures.</p></speech>

No action was taken by the Department.  That is worrying.</p></speech>

I have questions about sports capital grants and the underspend in 2020.  I think there was a &euro;14 million underspend from a budget of &euro;28 million.  I am concerned about that because the grants provided to sporting bodies are essential to continue to upgrade facilities.  Why was no provision made for that money to be carried over to allow sports bodies the time to complete those projects?</p><p>Was there a particular reason that was not extended?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Katherine Licken" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#G00200"><p>I will ask my colleague, Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in, to come in more detail on this.  What I would say is there is provision for the Department to carry over funding under the public spending code.  A percentage of its capital funding can be carried over from one year to the next.  We carried over &euro;7.6 million from 2020 into 2021.  Just because the year ends, it does not mean projects lose their funding.  The commitment to funding them remains.  Covid played havoc with the ability of some of the sports clubs to draw down their money to get matched funding and construction contracts in place.  I will ask Mr. &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in to give more detail, but when a grant is in place, it continues.  Whether it is this year or next year, the commitment to the grant continues and if there is a question of a project not being able to draw it down, we engage very extensively.  Ultimately, we would take the grant back, eventually, but only as a last resort.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#G00300"><p>The Secretary General has emphasised the most important point in all of this, which is that due to the cyclical nature of how sports capital grants are awarded, drawn down and paid, there can often be underspend, but no individual club will ever miss out.  Due process is given to them.  It can take them a number of years to draw down grants.  We currently have more than 2,000 older grants on the system dating back a number of years and there is potentially more than &euro;60 million payable there, but those individual grants might not be drawn down for a number of years.  Individual clubs might have legal issues they need to clarify in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor.  There might be questions of matched funding, etc.  However, we take a very sympathetic approach to them.  If a club has been validly awarded a grant, we will do everything to try to work with it to make sure it can be drawn down.  In terms of the underspend, we carried over as much of the underspend as allowed under public accounting rules.  The bottom line is that no club will miss out and we are constantly working with them to encourage them to draw down and manage budgets over successive years.</p></speech>

The first is that they have submitted the applications before the rise in building costs and the second challenge they have is that they are not able to do the same level of fundraising.  Will the Department make provision for, and be more aware of, the challenges organisations now have and take that into account when dealing with these applications and the carryover?</p></speech>

The closing date for the sports capital current round was 1 March.  We have been pushing to try to have those grants awardable this side of Christmas.  It is now possible it might be in the early weeks of January before that happens.  What the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, is trying to do is to ensure there is as much funding as possible there to recognise the increased costs and ensure valid applicants get a sufficient amount that will enable them to proceed with their project.  One of our key jobs over the coming weeks will be to maximise that pot.  I am sure the Minister of State may be having bilateral conversations with Ministers with deeper pockets - anything to ensure we can maximise the round that will be announced in January.</p></speech>

Some &euro;40 million is available and &euro;16 million has been allocated for equipment.  Is it possible these applications will be dealt with together with the budget for 2022?  I know the witnesses cannot say that will happen.  However, rather than people having to do the whole process all over again in 2022, is it feasible to do it as a two-year project rather than a one-year project, in view of the restrictions on voluntary organisations over the past 18 months?</p></speech>

That was a subset of what was the largest ever round and ask we have received under the sports capital programme.  We are finalising the process of review of those applications.  There is nothing further for those who have applied under that process to do.  There has been significant interaction with them since 1 March because, as the Deputy probably knows, there is now an opportunity for clubs to mend their hand if they have made an administrative or other error in their application.  The critical issue for us is to maximise the available pot of funding for what will probably be an early January announcement.  That is our number one ask of others and task for ourselves in order that we can ensure we can give every valid club as much as possible to allow their projects to proceed.</p></speech>

Our business is to try to get the money out to the clubs for the betterment of communities.  That is what we do.  Every time there is a round of the sports capital programme, Mr. &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in and the team review to see how it worked and what did or did not go well.  All of this is done with a view to finding what works for communities and clubs in order to get good infrastructure out to them.  We will continue that.</p></speech>

The Department made a grant of &euro;130,000 available to that project, which is a huge contribution.  The project cost more than &euro;460,000, so the &euro;130,000 grant from the Department was very welcome.</p> <p>  Do we learn from previous experiences with the capital of culture?  I was Lord Mayor of Cork in 2003-04.  In 2005-06, Cork was the European Capital of Culture.  The same mistakes seem to have been made in Galway as were made in Cork back in 2005-06.  Surely the Department should have a protocol in place in order that there is a clear plan in place for projects such as this, rather than trying to make it up as we go along, as seems to have happened with Galway.  The same thing happened in Cork.  I am being up-front about that.  We could get far better delivery on these projects if we had a clear plan, rather than making them up as go along.  Has the Department looked at that, especially the issue of securing European funding?  There is European funding for culture and so on and I am not sure we are making every effort to get it.  Will Ms Licken outline what engagement we have at European level and address the issue of having appropriate structures in place when we secure funding and ensuring we get good value for money?</p></speech>

Of course we learn from previous capitals of culture.  We had a national capital of culture in Limerick in 2014.  There was a review of that which fed into Galway 2020.  We had very robust governance arrangements and significant consultation in the run-up to Galway 2020.</p> <p>  The European Commission runs a compendium of all of the findings of the various European cities of culture in order to inform whichever country is doing it at a given time.  The title comes around maybe once every 15 years so it is important that is done.  This time, for the first year ever, the Commission has looked for member states to do a review immediately afterwards.  We have a review of Galway city of culture, which is nearing completion.  That will be very important to input, not just for us, but for other member states.</p> <p>  What really went wrong with Galway city of culture was Covid and, notwithstanding that, it produced an astounding array of events.  Many artists and artistic workers pivoted online and reached huge audiences worldwide that they might not have otherwise reached.</p><p>They were some benefits to it.  I will ask Mr. Falvey to come in with more detail.  What proceeded, proceeded really well.  People will be familiar with some of the larger events such as DruidGregory, the Galway International Arts Festival and Macnas.</p></speech>

There are reviews of all European cities of culture.  There was a national city of culture.

Is the Department happy with the process that is in place?  Is Ms Licken satisfied that an adequate process with regard to salary structures, employment status, etc., was not in place for quite a number of years?  At any point during that time, did the Department have any direct contact with RT&Eacute; on the questions with regard to the salary structure within RT&Eacute; and the employment structures, particularly in regard to self-employment status?  Would that issue have been raised with RT&Eacute; at any point?</p></speech>

These issues predate RT&Eacute; coming under the remit of the Department.  It is key that where issues arise, they are identified, that the systems are in place to identify them and that they are dealt with swiftly once identified.  The issue in regard to the contracts, as I understand and through our engagement with RT&Eacute; and the Committee of Public Accounts engagement with RTE, the matter has been dealt with with Revenue and is continuing to be dealt with by the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

Ms Licken said that at the governance meetings issues that have been identified are raised, but that she is not sure of the structure that ensures that issues can be caught early.  In other words, she is not sure that they can be addressed before they are raised, specifically in terms of contracts.  I note Ms Licken's point that an Accounting Officer cannot ever be satisfied that something would not be possible.  Is she satisfied that the governance structures in place would quickly and swiftly identify issues and address them?</p></speech>

It is good to see many of them at the Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p>  At the outset, I want to refer to the breadth of her organisation.  Ms Licken referred to it in her own opening remarks.  I note some members have focused in on RT&Eacute; and others on the European Capital of Culture 2020.  I will touch on a number of other elements within both the accounts and other areas.</p> <p>  The first I wanted to touch on was something I raised on the previous occasion we engaged, and that was around the television licence.  Obviously, things have changed in terms of the pandemic and the need for inspectors to do other work.  For how long were the television inspectors suspended from their ordinary work during the course of the pandemic?  What impact did that suspension of television licence inspections have on the collection rate of 2020 and 2021?  That will be my first question.</p></speech>

In terms of 2020, in the period from 13 March to the end of 2020, inspectors could only operate as normal for two months.  They were off the road completely for four months and they operated on a non-contact basis for three and a half months.  The latter involved putting cards in letter-boxes but not knocking on doors.  In 2021, there was no physical activity at the doors by the licence inspectors for four months, non-contact only resumed on 10 May and full inspections resumed from 14 June.</p> <p>  Obviously, this had an impact on the licence fee receipts, with a sharp decline in sales for the first half of the year and marginal recovery in the middle of the year - this was in 2020 when restrictions eased.  The second lockdown was put in place then, in autumn 2020, which meant that sales did not recover to the levels it expected.  The fact that licence fee revenue remained static at &euro;222 million in 2020 is largely due to the increased Exchequer contribution from the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

I do not know if the people who pay them would exactly classify them as sales.</p> <p>  In terms of the money that has not been collected, is there a plan to try to collect that at some point?</p></speech>

Obviously, the Decade of Centenaries is a really important programme that we lead on in this Department.  We had a comprehensive programme of events and initiatives in 2020 across 31 local authorities.  We increased the funding to the local authorities in 2021 to &euro;50,000 per local authority - &euro;2 million in funding for the local authorities in general.  To date, we have had key exhibitions, outreach programmes and digitisation programmes in our national cultural institutions, including a recent partnership with the National Archives of Ireland and the embassy in London on the Anglo-Irish Treaty.  We have a new artist in residence programme in a number of the cultural institutions, the Military Archives and, of course, there is the Beyond 2022 project, which is the records that were burned 100 years ago.  We have a new national poetry project, which has been launched in partnership with UCD and Poetry Ireland.  We have the well-established Mn&aacute; 100 new online platform and we have a range of partnerships with rich online content, which has been really important over the past two years, in partnership with both Boston College and RT&Eacute;.</p> <p>  Given the importance of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, a range of activities will be rolled out in the coming weeks, including the current production of "The Treaty", at the National Concert Hall, a ground-breaking production, with ANU and Theo Dorgan, on the Treaty debates, which will go live at the end of this year and into 2023, a new concert at the concert hall featuring contemporary-----</p></speech>

They are hampered too.  I accept that.</p> <p>  I see Ms Banotti there.  We spoke previously about Creative Ireland.  Since we last spoke, I want to commend the work, particularly in the 24 DEIS schools on Fighting Words, that programme that was very well received, as well as the creative youth projects and others.  It is important to acknowledge that work.  Mr. Falvey mentioned the local authorities.  It is important that there is good collaboration between the Department and Creative Ireland, and I thank them for that.</p> <p>  Turning to the appropriation account, there is a note here about six contracts to the value of &euro;578,000 for non-compliance.  The majority of that was cleaning and other utility contracts.  However, the sixth one relates to genealogy services in the National Archives of Ireland and it has now been re-tendered.  Could Ms Licken outline what happened in that regard?  There are nine other contracts as well but I will get on to that in a second.</p></speech>

I have it here.  We will come back to the committee, probably later today, with a note on these projects, because a note has been requested on them.  A lot of them were contracts which we picked up.  When we talk about governance, it was our own governance system that picked up the fact that these contracts had expired and had not been retendered.</p> <p>  A procurement manager has now been appointed for the genealogy service in the National Archives of Ireland.  A new genealogical service contract was put in place in June 2021.  Mr. Falvey might have more details on the contract.</p></speech>

I await the note on that.  I apologise, as I have limited time.</p> <p>  There is a note as well on the procedures and control changes within the Department as a result of Covid-19.  Ms Licken specifically mentioned risk register details, and controls and actions needed to mitigate risks and assign responsibilities for co-operation and controls to staff.  Has that process been concluded now?  Is it correct that those new roles have been assigned within the Department?</p></speech>

I ask the Deputy to bear with me for a moment.  Obviously, we had to update the risk register in respect of Covid-19, because it did not just affect this Department in terms of everybody having to work online, it affected us deeply in terms of how we had to pivot our focus on our work to support the sectors.  As I said in my opening remarks, we are very much an audience-facing Department, one that is about people, that is, people congregating, socialising and playing sport.  We had to re-evaluate all our work programmes and we have taken on board some areas, for example, in the live entertainment sector, dealing with stakeholders that we never dealt with before because they were out in the commercial market making money and they did not need recourse to the State.  We updated all our risk registers to take account of Covid-19.  We set up a specific Covid unit in the Department.  Those positions are in place a long time and the team is still working flat out, engaging with the stakeholders, and designing programmes.</p></speech>

There was an underspend of &euro;6 million in 2020.  The Department attributed that to a number of large-scale projects that did not progress due to the time frame relating to various issues, including Covid-19 delays.  Ms Licken stated that the full underspend was to be carried forward into 2021.  Could she provide some detail on that?  What large-scale cultural infrastructure and development projects were not progressed in 2020 due to Covid-19 reasons?</p></speech>

I was having difficulty turning off the mute button on the mic.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Falvey, to come in on this in a moment.  We have a large cultural infrastructure programme of &euro;460 million for the development of cultural institutions.  Thankfully, none of those projects were in construction phase during Covid.  The National Library of Ireland is in the investigative works stage.  It decanted all of the books out of the dangerous area to which the Vice Chair referred that was a risk to the books.  They were decanted to another part of the library.  The investigative works are ongoing but those works were delayed because of the restrictions on construction, but there was not a construction contract, as such, in place there.</p> <p>  Is Deputy Carroll MacNeill thinking about capital projects?  A lot of the initiatives and performances abroad that we were to fund under Culture Ireland did not happen because of the restrictions.</p></speech>

What I want to try to get a handle on first is what has been put off on the capital side of things and also if there were increased costs associated with Covid delays, especially during 2020.  We know that 2021 has been slightly different.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Katherine Licken" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021112500002#L00800"><p>Increased costs have not necessarily materialised as yet, but we do know that we will be going to contract on a number of the projects.</p><p>For example, the Crawford Art Gallery project is at design phase now with a view to going to planning.  We know the cost of material has increased considerably in the past number of years and we are anticipating cost increases as a result when we go to tender.  Everything will go to tender in the normal fashion and investigative works are part of the process of finding the actual cost.</p><p> Many projects relevant to members of the committee have proceeded.  For example, there is the Butler Gallery, Kilkenny, the Tullamore arts centre, the Mary Robinson Centre, Ballina and Townhall Cavan.  These are projects that have been ongoing and have not been necessarily impacted.  There is also the Wexford Opera House development as well, which has &euro;1 million for capital works.  Mr. Falvey might speak further to this.  We were kind of fortunate we were not at the construction phase in the big projects.  At the same time there is an obvious impact.  For example, personnel could not get into the National Library to do the on-site investigation works.</p></speech>

For example, there is 10% to 15% for planning and design, etc., and that is not in the construction phase.  With the construction projects that were under way or due to be under way, there was a hiatus with the library at the investigative works stage.  In respect of the National Archives, there were two issues.  The asbestos matter held us up for a period and, in addition, we had the withdrawal of a contractor.  That will lead to an increase in overall costs for the project of approximately &euro;500,000 for a &euro;24 million project.  That is not related to Covid-19 <i>per se</i>but rather contractors having put in bids that they may now struggle to hold to.  This is a matter we are monitoring carefully.  The design of the programme carries with it contingency permissions at different phases to ensure all these measures are planned for and managed.  If there are any pressures on cost, they are identified at an appropriate stage and subject to appropriate approvals as part of the management of the programme.</p></speech>

An exhibition by Ms Jane Fogarty in the new Orleans gallery in Ottawa, Canada, was postponed.  A presentation by Poetry Ireland in The Writing Center at Harvard in Boston was cancelled.  There are more as well.  The purpose of Culture Ireland is to fund artists going abroad and make presentations.  The 20th Annual Irish Film Festival in Boston, screening contemporary Irish film in Somerville, Massachusetts, was postponed.  The Fidget Feet presentation with Arcadia Spectacular at the Glastonbury music festival was postponed.  A presentation of the Pan Pan Theatre's <i>Eliza's Adventures in the Uncanny Valley</i>at the Forum Freies Theater in D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany, was withdrawn.

I also get the flavour of how much opportunity was missed both in the execution of the work and, more important, for the artists who would have had an opportunity and platform from that.  It sounds like a long list.</p> <p>  From the much more prosaic perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts, what is the cost of losing those opportunities?  Was there a significant cost to all of those not going ahead?  Were we already tied into contracts or anything of that nature?  I am nearly sorry to have to ask this, given what was lost, but this is the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

It is of interest to us because of its historical significance but it belongs to that Department.  Its Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, brought a report to the Government in March 2021 on the monument and developments there.  That was the Moore Street advisory group's final report to the Minister, which was presented to the Cabinet on 11 May.  The buildings are in the ownership of the State and plans are under way for the sensitive and respectful restoration of the monument, along with the visitor centre to the rear.

It is somewhat disappointing that the announcement timeline is being extended because only last week I called all those I am advocating for to say it would be the end of November.  It is very important from a community and social perspective as if there is anything the Committee of Public Accounts can say is worthwhile and value for money, it is the sports capital grant.  It brings cohesion to communities and social development, particularly to our youth in a time like this Covid-19 pandemic, when there is so little else going on.  It is very important.  I am happy the witnesses are doing their best to maximise the effect of the grant.  I do not want anybody to be disappointed and I hope there will not be any disappointment.</p> <p>  I have a question on subhead D3, on page 23, whereby only a portion of what was left over in 2020 is being carried forward to 2021.  Will that have an impact on projects?</p></speech>

That is really important to us.  The Deputy is correct in that sport is part of the fabric of communities right across Ireland, as is culture.  There is quite a synergy between the two areas.  For some people sport is for them and for others it is culture, while some find both important.  Both are important to the social fabric of society.</p></speech>

We were really hoping to get that out before Christmas but we want to do it right and maximise the moneys.  When we make the announcement in January, it will only have been ten months since the round was opened, and this is two and half months or three months quicker than the previous occasion.  Although we are at an historic high when it comes to applications, it will still be a relatively efficient process and it is certainly quicker than previous years.</p> <p>  On the underspend, I echo the Secretary General's point.  It will have no impact whatever on grants.</p><p>There are public account rules as to how much capital can be brought forward any year.  Within the sport division, we have maximised how much we can bring forward.  It will not affect the outcomes for any of the applicants.</p></speech>

Within that, applicants were given a second chance.  Approximately 50% of them availed of that chance.  It was a significant additional piece of work that we had to do, but we have still managed to keep the timelines shorter than they were previously.</p></speech>

I am mindful that, given the times we are in, there will be a significant increase in the cost of projects that were the subject of applications that were sent in last March.  That is just the building industry in general.  The sooner the better, as they say, and it will all be good in the end.</p> <p>  Turning to section 7.7 on page 87, I am fascinated and would like an answer as to why a company that was limited by guarantee was set up for Galway 2020.  It was a diversion from the original structure.  Why was it set up in that way, why was the older model not followed and who made the decision to divert?  What research was undertaken to determine that it was a better model and will the company be wound up at the end of this year?  Who wishes to take these questions?</p></speech>

The idea of a company structure was the recommendation of the European Commission as regards European cities of culture.  I believe it was in 2014 that it recommended that host cities should set up independent structures to manage the cities of culture.  All 13 European cities of culture in the 2016-2022 period have been set up as independent not-for-profit or charitable organisations governed by boards of directors.  This was done on the advice of the European Commission.  The three sisters, which was unfortunately one of the unsuccessful proposals for a city of culture, had proposed setting up a separate structure as well.  We are only aware of one European city of culture - Ume&aring; in Sweden - that did not set up a separate entity.  In Galway's case, it was set up in this way to give it flexibility.  I am sorry, as I meant that Ume&aring; in Sweden in 2014 was the last city that we are aware of that did not set up a separate company.  The future role of the Galway company will be considered as part of the legacy planning, which is aimed to be completed by the end of this year.</p></speech>

I am conscious that Covid has intervened in all of this, so I am really just asking how everything is going.  The Department was to establish a revised set of operational and governance arrangements in respect of its national cultural institutions, NCI, capital investment programme.  That was to include detailed arrangements for project oversight groups to meet regularly, ensure effective oversight and have communication channels in place so that the Department was fully informed of any issue that arose.  The steering groups were to include officials from the Department, the Office of Public Works, OPW, the relevant NCI and project management teams and, as the projects developed, relevant experts.  What has happened in this regard?  Did the groups meet to ensure oversight of the projects and did Covid hamper that?</p></speech>

We have established oversight groups for each of the cultural institutions in respect of their projects.  Those groups comprise us, the OPW and the cultural institutions.  They walk through the steps of the process and ensure there is good governance.  Does Mr. Falvey wish to elaborate?</p></speech>

In any application for capital funding for a large-scale investment project, the Department now requires it to be demonstrated that appropriate project management structures are in place.  Has any application been turned down for not meeting this criterion?</p></speech>

We can provide the committee with a schedule of meetings that have taken place, if that would be of any assistance to it.</p> <p>  I do not believe that anyone would get to the point of making an application without having the necessary resources in place.  The level of engagement that we have with the cultural institutions is such that they are fully aware.  We see issues in draft and discuss them.  We like to have everything ready by the time an application is formally made.  I spend a great deal of time at those meetings, as do colleagues.  We would be happy to provide the committee with a schedule of the meetings that have taken place.  We went online as a result of Covid.</p></speech>

Ms Banotti, who is present, also put advertising in relation to Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, the national day of creativity for children in the local print media.

Sound and vision is a vehicle for funding broadcast media and that is set out in statute by the BAI so it cannot fund print under the current legal structure.

The pandemic has been a huge pressure point for all media outlets but has also displayed the huge role good quality public and private media organisations play and the way they helped communicate the messages during the pandemic.  Deputy Dillon spoke about local newspapers and radio stations but, unfortunately, in Dublin there is almost a complete absence of local media.  It is a challenge because it deprives the Dublin area of spaces in which to debate important topics of relevance to the city.  My area has two local free sheet papers which are under huge financial pressure and no local radio stations.  All the local radio stations operating on a Dublin-wide basis are essentially competing with national radio stations.  It is a problem because I am often envious of my Oireachtas colleagues who have better channels to communicate and engage with voters.  The decision for Newstalk to receive a national rather than a Dublin-focused licence tempted us with what was possible but  absent.  The closure of Dublin-specific phone-in shows like "Dublin Talks" on 98FM has made the problem even worse.  Within the spend of the Department, is work being undertaken to try to address the need in the capital?</p></speech>

Usually funding is provided via the sound and vision fund for commercial and community radio stations.  That is funded by a proportion, I think 7%, of the licence fee.  Where we have found savings in the Department, we have put money into the sound and vision fund to allow for increased funding and different programmes.  In sound and vision round 36 in December last year, &euro;670,000 was allocated to 22 community radio projects.</p> <p>  My background is in radio so I am conscious of that ecosystem out there and where it is not out there.  These are policy matters and Government has taken a decision to get into a broader policy space in relation to media, not just public service broadcasting but the future of media itself.  We got funding in the budget next year for the establishment of the media commission.  That commission attracts a lot of attention as being around the regulation of online platforms but it is also about subsuming the BAI and creating a new vision for the sector.</p><p>It is the BAI that has the strong regulatory role there.  We would be very happy to engage with the BAI on the structure and what stations are out there serving what different areas.  I agree that the structure in Dublin is entirely different from the structure in rural areas, where the local radio station dominates and can be really strong in an area.  We are very cognisant of that.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, Facebook forums have become the predominant forum for local community news.  The difficulty with that is that it carries with it all the threats that social media bring while at the same time giving local communities really good forums.  Those forums are massively open to both political and malignant manipulation, so the lack of a strong Dublin media, both in local print and on local radio, is a major policy gap.  While I accept that it is the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's role, I believe that within the broader work being done by the Future of Media Commission, we need to look specifically at the capital.  I see that Ms Licken wants to respond to that.</p></speech>

As the Deputy probably knows, the Minister hopes to publish the legislation soon.  The Oireachtas joint committee made 33 recommendations, which we are working through in the pre-legislative scrutiny.  We are anxious to proceed with this as fast as possible because we understand the pressures out there and all the issues to which the Deputy has alluded.  The whole purpose of the media commission is to address those issues.</p></speech>

Sometimes in Dublin we are a little shy about shouting for the capital.  On this issue, however, we need to work very closely together with the Department and the Government.</p> <p>  The pandemic had a significant impact on sports capital grants, and I know there was an underspend in two years.  Has the Department considered how that will be addressed, given that the ability to fundraise has also been limited and may impact future years?  I apologise if the question has been asked already; I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p></speech>

The quick answer is that the way in which sports grants are applied for, awarded and then drawn down is a cyclical process.  No clubs will suffer because of underspend.  We hope to announce the current round of sports capital grants in early January.  It should be borne in mind that about half of all applicants have already received an equipment grant.  That was announced in August.  We are trying to maximise the available pot for January by getting as many old grant applicants that are on the system to draw down this year, thereby maximising the pot for next year.  That is the quick snapshot of where things are.  No applicants will suffer.  We are well used to this process.</p></speech>

I have dealt with many clubs this year, as in previous years, and one of the difficulties is that their planning or their fundraising targets might not be reached within the window of the application process or thereafter.  I have often considered that a rolling application process might be far more agile.</p></speech>

From our experience of engaging with clubs, that pattern seems to work pretty well for them.  Obviously, we would never say "No" if there were an increased fund that would allow for such a model, but at the moment the model seems to suit the needs of clubs on the ground as long as there are not long gaps between rounds of sports capital funding.  It is a priority for us to make sure we can award grants at a relatively regular frequency.</p></speech>

While funding was provided to national bodies, as Ms Licken outlined to Deputy Dillon, clubs on the ground, particularly those that had large borrowing requirements, really struggled, and financial institutions were not always amenable to working with those clubs.  I know this does not fall entirely into the period we are discussing, but what audits has the Department done on how much money got out onto the ground and made an impact in individual clubs as well as in the sporting bodies, which, obviously, have a need too?</p></speech>

First, at the corporate governance level there is a rolling programme of audits of the national governing bodies, NGBs, which are done by Sport Ireland.  The impact of sports capital on the ground is something we keep under review.  For instance, looking at our large-scale sports infrastructure fund, which targets much bigger projects, we are just now coming to the end of a review process of the initial round.  One of the emerging lessons is that there is a gap there in that the past 20 months have been really hard on those NGBs and local authorities that applied.  Sports revenue has dried up.  Costs of construction have gone up.  Without prejudging the outcomes of the review, I think we will definitely have to learn from and look at this as we review the large-scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF.  A lot of the same lessons will probably also apply on the sports capital side, which applies to smaller events.</p></speech>

As part of the corporate governance of RT&Eacute;, the broadcasting function generally came over and the corporate governance function came over but not all the staff transferred with it.

Until my time for asking questions was up, Ms Licken was more or less saying the Department had no knowledge of it but what about the staff in the broadcasting section and in corporate governance?  It all comes back to the point I am making about oversight.  I cannot believe Ms Licken said that the Department had no knowledge of it when broadcasting and governance staff in the Department did so.  Were questions asked?  The misclassification of workers and bogus employment were splattered all over the media.  At what stage did the oversight or the questions start?  RT&Eacute; misclassified workers for years.  It exploited workers for decades.  Having listened this morning, it seems that what happens when RT&Eacute; is found out is that it lets the Department know, it tells the Department it will fix it and that is the extent of the Department's oversight.  That is just not good enough.  This is public money we are talking about.</p></speech>

I will get that for the Deputy.  Having said that, there are governance frameworks in place within RT&Eacute; as well as our oversight.  The purpose of these frameworks is to surface these types of issues and deal with them.  When issues come to our attention we absolutely speak to RT&Eacute; all the time about what it will do about them and what measures it will put in place.  We monitor how it rectifies them.  We know it has made a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners.  We know it is engages with the Department of Social Protection.  These are very complex individual contracts that have to be worked through.  We absolutely keep a very close eye on it.</p></speech>

She said she was aware that RT&Eacute; has made a settlement.  I do not think anyone in the country is not aware because it was splattered all over the papers.  I am astounded at what Ms Licken said when she knew full well that broadcasting staff and corporate governance staff in the Department knew all that was going on.  The unions have been speaking about this pay disparity for 20 years and no one in the Department, even Ms Licken coming before the Committee of Public Accounts, has something to say other than that it predated the Department-----</p></speech>

I remind people to indicate if they wish to contribute.  There may be time for people to come back in if nobody else indicates.  I want to discuss Sport Ireland.  It has not published its accounts as yet.  It is very difficult to make sense of this very mixed Department.  We would nearly need to look at each set of accounts for the individual entities and there are almost 20 entities.  It is quite difficult to make sense of it.  Included in the package for Sport Ireland will be part of the rescue package for the FAI.  How much was provided to Sport Ireland to channel to the FAI in 2020?</p></speech>

There is a memorandum of understanding and a governance review group has been established to monitor this process.  There is an annual payment to the FAI.  I am afraid I am looking at 2021 figures at present.  In 2021, &euro;5.8 million was paid and there is a separate payment of just over &euro;2 million that goes towards its costs for the Aviva Stadium.  There is a very strong governance oversight process on this, which is managed by Sport Ireland's governance oversight group.  It is a joint partnership between Sport Ireland in the FAI.  It is critically measuring the FAI and comparing how it performs in more than 160 different indicators arising out of the various reviews of recent years and how it is delivering on them.  In October, we were told it had satisfactorily completed more than 120 of these.</p></speech>

In the previous D&aacute;il I was on the committee that dealt with transport, tourism and sport where I continuously raised governance.  It was clear there were problems and those problems followed on problems experienced in the Olympic Council of Ireland.  I have concerns about a couple of sporting organisations.  The Secretary General spoke about the layers of governance.  I know the amount of money provided to the FAI was a very small proportion of its overall budget in the years up to 2019 and 2020 when a rescue package had to be put in place.  What lessons has the Department learned on governance?  What additional oversight is there in Sport Ireland?  What additional measures and powers have been put in place?</p><p>This was an open secret that some of us were working on for the last few years, namely, the role of the Department where there might continue to be problems in other sports organisations.</p></speech>

Sport Ireland has a very rigorous programme whereby, at any one time, one of the three large field sports, or an aspect of it, is under review and there is a selection every year of the smaller bodies.  That kind of forensic review by robust external audit-----</p></speech>

It is not just the money; it is about how the organisations themselves operate for the long term.</p></speech>

However, the damage to the Olympic Council and the damage to the FAI because people were asleep at the wheel, or because there was not the right kind of oversight, is immeasurable.  It is not only about financial cost; it is also about reputational cost and opportunity cost in terms of volunteers and all the rest of it.</p> <p>  I want to move on to another area, which is the National Archives.  I am not sure how the National Archives is funded, and it appears to be slightly different from the National Museum and the National Gallery.  Can we get a note on the National Archives?  I know that a big building programme is under way, which is welcome.  A huge number of records were not even catalogued and there should be a big digitisation programme.  We have underspent on these institutions for decades and there is a lot of catch-up to do.  However, it is not very obvious how it is funded.  Is some of the activity directly funded by the Department?  It is not easy to figure that out.</p></speech>

Although it is a cultural institution, and rightly so, it comes directly within the Vote of the Department.  We will get the committee a note on it.  The Vice Chairman is correct that we are investing not just in capital, but also in the archives staff, and we are recruiting archivists at the moment in recognition of the valuable work they do.  They have some very specific projects ongoing at the moment and I will ask Mr. Falvey to come in on that.</p> <p>  To circle back on the sport issue, under the national sports policy published in 2018, there is a new governance code that the governing bodies have committed to subscribing to by the end of 2021.  As of 8 November, 47 bodies have formally adopted the code and the rest are on the journey, with more of them to be compliant by the end of the year.  That is another layer of the governance, so it is not just the rolling audits.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputies Paul McAuliffe, Alan Dillon and Colm Burke on the issues around large-scale infrastructure and other grants.  If I heard the witnesses correctly, it was said that with regard to the grants for sporting bodies and provision of sports and recreational facilities, that underspend was as a result of challenges faced by the clubs in trying to spend that money but it is still earmarked for them and they are not going to lose the funding.  Is that right?</p></speech>

Although the conditions in question were not in the PDA, they were rigorously enforced in terms of drawdown of funding, and we do that for all our other management programmes.  The grantees have to make a declaration that the material they presented to us was not used to draw down grants elsewhere.  We already rigorously apply that.  The issue here was that we did not put it into the PDA as a specific condition.  Obviously, if we were doing it again, we would.  We totally accept the recommendation.</p></speech>

I will not labour the point; it is just a reminder.</p> <p>  In the absence of other members indicating, I might come in with a few points myself.  A total of &euro;1.5 million was paid directly to Galway 2020, in accordance with the EU regulations.  Why was the additional &euro;1.5 million of EU funding not sought?  It appears it was not applied for.  Did Galway not meet the criteria?</p></speech>

It did not directly apply for other EU funding as, legally, the organisation had to have been in existence for more than two years to comply with EU funding application criteria more generally, and the organisation was not<i>in situ</i>for two years at that stage-----</p></speech>

It would have been known that was a criterion.  Why would that not have been insisted on?  It is quite a sizeable sum in the overall scheme of a capital of culture.</p></speech>

The European Commission emphasises that the delivery team should focus on the overall programme delivery and support our artists to build their capacity and networks at European level.  Galway 2020 was successful at getting some of the partners and projects to get money themselves directly from the EU.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that Galway has a particular offering and that it was unlucky with the timing   We had had problems with this previously, as Deputy Burke pointed out.  Limerick was another capital of culture where, if I recall correctly, there were problems.  We appeared to repeat the mistakes as opposed to learn from them.  Has there been an overall analysis, with issues identified, in order that we will not run into those difficulties again?  It is very worthwhile but it is often diminished by some of the controversy around it.</p></speech>

The Audience Agency has been recruited by Galway 2020 to do a review of the programme and lessons will learned from that, as well as from the rolling series of lessons learned kept by the Commission.</p> <p>  I might ask Mr. Falvey to come in on this in a moment.  An awful lot of good things happened in the past year and we need to give credit to the artists, Galway 2020 and all the partners and volunteers.  A lot of good things happened but they just were not as visible.  We would be having a very different conversation if Covid had not happened because those things would have been more visible.  Mr. Falvey might talk to some of the projects and how truly spectacular they were, even if some of them went under the radar.</p></speech>

The loss of status much bemoaned by residents, to the point that Limerick sought to host the European Capital of Culture for 2020.  With things such as the John Gerrard Mirror Pavilion on Claddagh Quay last summer or DruidGregory, the opportunities for public engagement with the arts were very significant in Galway 2020, although not to the extent everybody would have hoped for, given the constraints because of Covid.  Had there been further opportunities, it would have been of great benefit to everybody.  It is a great shame that did not happen but there were many very good things.  If someone was on Claddagh Quay last summer and saw the public gathered there, or at the Gerrard pavilion, it was very striking and it was a fantastic opportunity for public engagement with the arts, very much in line with the objectives of the city of culture designation.</p></speech>

We in the Committee of Public Accounts examine governance, funding and value for money, and I do not ask these questions to diminish the designation.  Some of these issues cannot be measured monetarily in respect of the benefit gained.</p></speech>

I would like to hear the Secretary General's feedback on how they were administered.  We all understand F&aacute;ilte Ireland's primary remit relates to tourism, but it was asked to administer a number of grants, one of which was the adaptation grant designed to enable tourism businesses in the hospitality and tourism sector to make improvements through the different levels of restrictions.  A great deal of importance was put on these grants but there was difficulty for businesses in gaining access to them.  How does the Department feel about the way these grants were administered and what feedback has there been from F&aacute;ilte Ireland regarding their administration?</p></speech>

Its business, which it continues, was in developing the tourism product.  It continued that throughout Covid and, at the same time, reorientated itself to deliver a range of grant programmes.  It has engaged extensively with us, the tourism sector and the wider hospitality sector, which is covered by us and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been very flexible in moving quickly to provide schemes and engage with the sector and with us.  For example, it provided a &euro;10 million inbound agents business continuity scheme, a &euro;10 million coach tour operators business continuity scheme, a &euro;26 million adaptation fund from August to December 2020 and an &euro;8 million restart scheme.</p><p>Budget 2021 allocated more money and the tourism business continuity scheme was launched on 1 February.  That was in addition to all of the horizontal supports and to the guidance.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been a key player in providing guidance in the sector.  There were the regulations when the restrictions were in place and there is a series of guidance measures.  A phenomenal amount of work went on behind the scenes to produce that guidance, in consultation with the sectors and with ourselves.  If the committee would like, we can ask F&aacute;ilte Ireland to provide the committee with a detailed note and if it has some specific issue or difficulty we can certainly address that.  To reiterate, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has played a critical role and has not been found wanting from our perspective in responding quickly.</p></speech>

One item of correspondence has been flagged today under category B, that is, correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow up to committee meetings.</p> <p>  No. 872B, held over from our meeting last week, is from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman, Revenue Commissioners, dated 5 November 2021.  It provides information requested by the committee arising from the fact Revenue did not accept certain recommendations in the committee in our last report.  The committee asked Revenue to clarify to what extent it can investigate the financial and sectoral implications of a voluntary PAYE system agreed by Revenue and courier firms in 1997, as well as a copy of the 2019 European Commission inspection report on the control strategy for customs value and repayments.  I have flagged this item for discussion as have Deputies Carthy and Catherine Murphy.  Before opening the floor, is it agreed to note and publish this item?  Agreed.  I call Deputy Carthy.</p></speech>

It is good to see him back.  I have a couple of points.  It is incredibly interesting.  This relates to the 1997 decision by Revenue to allow couriers be designated as self-employed.  I am not sure it was the couriers themselves who benefitted from that arrangement and would argue it was not.  The letter states:</p> <blockquote> 	A review of the 1997 letters from Revenue bears out the fact that the individuals in question were required to be self-employed and that the conditions to participate in the &ldquo;voluntary PAYE scheme&rdquo; were that the individuals were in fact bona fide self-employed. </blockquote> <p>It goes on to state:</p> <blockquote> 	Bearing in mind the significant lapse of time, the information available to Revenue in relation to matters which occurred over 20 years ago is severely limited, particularly in light of Revenue only having access to information returned in statutory reporting. </blockquote> <p>There are a number of follow-on questions we need to ask.  The first is why only information from statutory reporting is available.  Is it the case Revenue does not have access to all documents that were created and gave rise to the agreement?  I imagine that would have been standard practice.  We need to get an explanation as to why that is not the case.  It then sets our criteria for where this self-employed status can be used.  It talks about the form of payment being based on milage rather than being a standard pay rate.  However, I would have expected the first test of self-employment is whether a person is a free agent and able to operate as a self-employed company - in other words, that they are not intrinsically linked to a single company which is the cause of concern for us.  It would be useful if we could get clarification from Revenue in the first instance on this form of documentation.  Is it the case it simply does not exist - that it was disappeared - or is it the case it is just hard to find?  They are two very different things and that clarification would be useful.  I would like to get a further note from Revenue on whether it sees this type of approach as being appropriate in the future, where these types of contracts are concerned.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Department of Social Protection is the one that, in my understanding, has pretty much determined the type of employment it has always designated as self-employment.  In 1997 there would have been way fewer people in this particular sector and it may well be that we try to get some data from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the number of people now employed in the sector in question.  There is a particular concern about precarious employment and that Department has responsibility there.  This is probably, in the first instance, a policy issue.  Revenue is working to rules set out for it.  We should be making contact with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to seek the number and how that fits in with the approach to deal with the issue of precarious employment.</p></speech>

The issue with self-employment or misclassification as self-employment is that it may now be operating across other sectors on foot of that judgment back in 1997.</p></speech>

We will go through them.  Appendix 1 states: </p><blockquote>	By way of background, it is important to note that PAYE is not a tax, but a collection mechanism for Income Tax...  The operation of PAYE on bona fide self-employed couriers involved the application of a withholding tax on an administrative basis, which facilitated collection of tax on account from a cohort of self-employed individuals and made it easier for these individuals to meet their payment compliance obligations. </blockquote><p>The code of practice for determining self-employed status, published in July 2021, states that an individual would normally be an employee if he or she has his or her tax deducted from his or her wages through the PAYE system.  There seems to be a number of contradictions running through that.  We will first seek to clarify, from the documentation provided by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the number of people who are classified as self-employed and the breakdown of the sectors.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Representatives from Revenue will be before the committee again and I am sure we will revisit this matter.<br/><br/>The next correspondence is No. 888B from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education, dated 12 November 2021.  It is an update in relation to a recommendation in the committee's report on our examination of the Department's 2018 and 2019 appropriation accounts.  The matter was flagged for discussion by Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

When representatives of the shared services unit appeared before the committee, they made a point of saying it would not be appropriate for every part of the public service to have its payroll go through the shared services unit.  The HSE and the Department of Education have large staff complements.  The Department of Education has 130,000 payees.  I am intrigued as to what is the problem.  In the last paragraph, there is mention of a "viable technical solution".  What is the solution?  We need to revert to the Department with some questions.  What is the solution it is seeking?  Does the solution involve outsourcing to a contractor?  Was it included in the original tender?  If a company issues a contract for a payroll system, I would expect that payroll system to work and if there are glitches or problems with it, that the obligation would be on the contractor to resolve them.  A number of issues arise.  If a lot of money is spent on a system, that system should be fit for purpose.</p></speech>

It does not have a full electronic payroll system.  Is that correct?  In the correspondence, it is mentioned that a technical solution has been identified and is being assessed.  I am trying to remember that meeting.  I know Deputy Devlin raised the issue with the officials.</p></speech>

For example, if, in August, an employee wants to look back and access information in relation to a pay period in March or April, that is probably the kind of functionality that the Department would need to build into the system, as opposed to sending out the payslip each fortnight, it arriving and it being up to the recipient to keep a record.  I think that is the area in which the Department is talking about building a viable technical solution.</p></speech>

From the information we were given by the Department when its representatives appeared before us previously and the timelines outlined in this letter, it appears that there is some improvement in respect of the software upgrades.  I think the officials indicated that they would have the issue resolved by the end of this year.  It now seems the upgrades were scheduled and completed in July 2021.  That is a positive.</p> <p>  My concern relates to the last sentence of the correspondence, which states that the Department will be engaging with stakeholders on the proposed solution thereafter, and the plan is to phase in the option to use this service for all payees by the third quarter of next year.  How will that option work?  Is it the case that a substantial number of payees could continue to opt to receive paper copies and mitigate against any savings anticipated as a result of the upgrade?  I would like some clarification on what precisely is meant by that and whether it is the Department's view that over a period - we could ask for that period to be defined - all employees will be receiving their payslips electronically, and they will have access to the information that the Comptroller and Auditor General has talked about.  I think most people would take it as standard that they have access to previous payslips, etc.</p></speech>

It could be interpreted a number of ways.  We can ask why there will be an option and not a uniform electronic system within the Department.  We can also ask when the Department hopes to have the system finalised.  Deputy Carthy referred to the spend on the postage of paper payslips.  The spend on that was &euro;10 million.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 889B, from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 12 November 2021, providing information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the Department on 14 October 2021.  Before opening the floor for discussion, it is proposed to note and publish the correspondence except for page 1, which is provided to the committee on a confidential basis.  The members will note the sensitivity around that because of the cyberattack.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I ask that members honour that confidentiality because there are issues of public interest at stake.

I have a few additional questions that I would like to ask the Department.  On page 3, in relation to the use of existing poles and overhead lines, the Department states: </p> <blockquote> 	Existing overhead poles and lines will be used where possible to lay/hang the new fibre cables.  It is forecast that only 12% of the project will be new build as designs will utilise existing infrastructure to a very significant degree; this approach is consistent with State Aid requirements. </blockquote> <p>Has it been determined what upgrade or repair costs there will be if the existing infrastructure requires maintenance?  There may well be a need for replacement poles or other locations to hang the cables.  Has the cost of that been determined?  It is not uncommon to see a whole row of poles where one has fallen over.  There will have to be an upgrade of that.</p><p>Those poles will not be the obligation of Eir; they may well be the responsibility of National Broadband Ireland, NBI.  I am trying to establish if it has done any assessment of the cost of maintenance regarding the use of existing infrastructure.</p></speech>

That was a bit of an eye-catcher.  The other question that arises out of it is the annual cost for rent of existing infrastructure each year over the next 25 years.  Is it being done as a cumulative cost over that period?  If only 12% is going on new build, what is the &euro;2.7 billion going on?  How much of that is going on the rent of infrastructure from a private company, Eir?  The Deputy asked if NBI is responsible for paying for the upgrade of existing infrastructure.</p> <p>  As Deputy Munster is not here, I call Deputy Carthy.</p></speech>

It seems the ground is being prepared for a further revision downwards of the targets by the end of 2022.  I am anxious that we get full clarification of the portion of the correspondence suggesting that certain legacy issues resulting from Covid-19 will continue to impact the contracted targets for 2022.  An Cathaoirleach will recall that at the hearing we asked several questions about precisely what the Covid-19 complications were considering that this was considered to be essential work throughout the pandemic.  The sector itself was never closed down in the way the construction sector was, for example.</p> <p>  The answers we got were very broad, with reference to clusters of Covid cases, but when we asked for the numbers of those, they could not be provided.  There was also reference to a British company whose personnel were not able to travel over as a result of Covid-19 but when we sought elaboration on that it transpired that the company in question is no longer contracted.  Clearly, that is not the reason.  It is important to get clarification as to the precise complications that have arisen as a result of Covid in order that we can assess whether there are provisions to ensure that this does not happen if we face further waves in the future.</p> <p>  The correspondence states that the Department expects NBI to submit this plan very shortly.  My concern over the entire broadband plan is that NBI is essentially dictating what it considers to be the appropriate targets and then the Department is setting those as new milestones.  As a result, it is important for us to get clear definitions of what the targets now are and what justification the company needs to provide in order for milestones to be amended.</p> <p>  The correspondence also outlines that it has spent &euro;24.5 million on procurement advisory services.  It would be useful to get a breakdown of the specific expenditure on those services.</p></speech>

I echo Deputy Carthy's concerns about the roll-out of this.  We discussed this before the contract was awarded and had concerns about the ability of the particular entity to deliver the broadband plan in the intervention area.  As there was only one bidder, it was not as if there was a choice.  We understand that Covid has been an issue but we are now starting to see serious slippages and it is important for us to keep on top of this.  The Department is permitted to apply penalties if the plan does not roll out in the way that it should.  That paragraph in the correspondence refers to certain legacy issues resulting from Covid-19.  It states that NBI expects to submit a plan very shortly.  We should look for a copy of that plan because it will give us some indication.  If the Department does not have it yet, we should look for it to provide it to us when it is provided to the Department.</p> <p>  Can we get a schedule of works to be provided for the 679 primary schools along with their locations?  We need to keep a close eye on this matter.  That was an area where one would have expected-----</p></speech>

We should ask it what the legacy issues are.  Hopefully, we are not going back into a lockdown.  If we are not going back into a lockdown, there should not be legacy issues.  There may be issues with the supply chain or something.  I know that in construction there have been some issues with getting materials.  We need to ask it that question and the rationale for that.</p> <p>  Is it carrying the cost of replacing and updating the existing infrastructure that it is using, which belongs to other companies?  What is the annual rental cost of that infrastructure?  We are looking for those clarifications, and we will come back to it.</p></speech>

The first relates to the use of landfill in the disposal of waste.  We were told there are three landfill sites in the country, one in Kildare, one in Meath and one in Wicklow.  In addition, we have the incinerator.  That is it.  The principle is that waste is supposed to be dealt with as close as possible to where it is created.  However, the east coast is receiving most of the national waste.  The waste is collected in Kerry, Mayo, Donegal or wherever, baled and shipped east, which seems like an incredible way of dealing with waste.  Capacity at the landfill site in Wicklow will be exhausted by 2026.  There was an extension because we were on a knife edge and use of the site has been extended to 2026.  The one in Meath has eight years left.  The one in Kildare has three and a half years left, based on the current planning permission.</p><p>However, a planning application has been made for the next 35 years.  There is no compensation for road damage, for example, resulting from the very heavy loads that are being transported.  Apart from anything else, that is far from ideal.  We need to go back to the Department and ask is what is the plan.  Is that it in the context of traffic congestion into Ringsend?  I know there was a previous planning application.  I refer to the site in Kildare.  It is down to individuals who live nearby to mount challenges in respect of the impact on the quality of their lives by virtue of the fact that these are essentially the central repository for waste nationally.  I know this is not an issue for the Committee of Public Accounts but it is a departmental issue.  We need to go back and ask the Department what exactly is the plan into the future.  Is what is being described here the plan for the future or how does it expect waste will be dealt with?</p></speech>

I remember a consultant's report that was circulated among the county councils back in 2004 and 2005 and set out the reasons for that.  I am sure the Deputy saw that report as well.  We are in a situation where the game will be up in respect of those three sites in eight years.  There are three and a half years left for the site in Kildare, as the Deputy stated, there are four years on the Wicklow one and then eight years for the site in Meath, although it is stated that there is additional land available that would allow it to continue operating beyond that, subject to permission being granted.  We can write back to the Department and ask for clarification on that issue and whether there are other options.  There is the very important issue of not just road damage, but environmental damage as a result of all the waste being transported to the east coast.  Obviously, waste is being carted long distances and we need to find out why that is and what plans there are to develop landfill sites or waste centres in other parts of the country.</p> <p>  Is there another issue the Deputy wishes to raise?</p></speech>

One relates to the sustainable energy programmes.  It may be something the committee will consider at some point.  I am not sure whether the Department's costings are right.  I was on an annual call with a local authority last week.  It made the point that the money that is provided to fully fund retrofitting of local authority houses is &euro;10,000 short of the actual cost of doing the job and the local authority is picking up that cost.  If that is the case, then I am not sure the calculations we are seeing in respect of the cost of it are accurate.  That was the experience of the local authority.  In the national development plan there was a signal that one sixth of the amount set aside for retrofitting was going to be from public funding.  That means the remaining amount is coming from elsewhere.  It is not entirely clear what the situation is in the context of the other schemes.  Maybe I will follow this issue up separately because I am not sure it is a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts.  Many of the numbers just do not make sense.  It is very difficult to see how we will avoid incurring penalties if a significant amount of money has to be made up by individual householders in the context of the retrofit programmes.  If the calculations of the Department in respect of the cost of doing that are wrong, then the amount of money that is provided by way of grant aid will be wrong as well.  I will follow that up with the Department.</p></speech>

The example highlighted by the local authority is a case in point but other people are saying that as well.  I have been contacted by people who have told me the amount of money they have to put to it is unattainable.  We will end up not being able to deliver on a very important national programme.</p> <p>  I refer to appendix 1 in the context of the national broadband plan advisory services.  It gives a breakdown of the total expenditure in respect of some of the providers.  Analysys Mason is described there as technical in terms of the advisory.  The Analysys Mason report related to the costings.  I did not think it was technical.  It was about the charging mechanism.  I am not sure whether the nature of the advisory services is immediately obvious there.  It would be quite useful to get a further breakdown in respect of some of them, such as Analysys Mason and KPMG.  I continuously question whether there is capacity to do in-house some of the things that go out to tender to consultancy firms or we should be building the capacity to do that in-house as opposed to the expensive outsourcing.  I know the national broadband plan was a one-off so it may not be a great example, but I would like to see a breakdown on both of those providers to ascertain exactly what the work they did was.</p></speech>

We will ask for clarification on that.  Do any other members wish to come in?</p> <p>  As regards the cover letter, in the final paragraph the Secretary General refers to comments I made during the afternoon session on 14 October after we had completed our engagement with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and specifically relating to the attendance of the programme director.  The Secretary General goes on to say he can assure the committee that the taking of the evidence of the programme director by way of remote connection from his home accorded fully with the parameters of the committee's invitation.  That is fair enough; it is allowed for within the parameters of the invitation.  However, the problem is that we were not able to communicate with the person with overall responsibility for the project on a secure or reasonably good quality broadband connection.  That is the point we are making.  I raised it in the afternoon session that day.  Reference is made to a specific reason the director could not attend the meeting in person or attend the Department on that day.  That is fair enough.  We do not want to know everyone's business and sometimes people are is tied down for a specific reason.  There are several reasons a person could be tied down.  However, If witnesses are going to give evidence remotely to the committee, we need to hold to the point that they do so from their headquarters or, at the very least, have a good broadband connection where they are.  That day was a long way from satisfactory in terms of trying to organise and run a meeting and allow members to ask questions and get answers.  I note that.  We need to be firm in respect of witnesses ensuring they have a good broadband connection on the day.  I understand that things can go wrong at the last minute, technology being technology.</p><p>That the Department charged with responsibility for rolling out the broadband plan was not able to communicate with us, or us with it, on the day of the committee hearing is just not acceptable.</p></speech>

It was deplorable and very obvious.  I am surprised that he included this in the letter.  It should just have been a case of hands up.  If we are to learn anything from this it may be that we will have to include on any invitation a requirement, as far as possible, that there should be a viable broadband connection available just so this kind of thing cannot be said: "fully within the parameters of the committee's invitation dated 30 September 2021".</p></speech>

It is mentioned in the correspondence that the Department was aware of the reinstatement of the 2018 figures in An Taisce's 2019 financial statements and reference is made to a follow-up engagement with An Taisce.  The letter goes on to state that considering that the amounts did not constitute "a significant portion of overall income", the Department did not consider there was any need for further inquiries to be made.  I would like to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General if it would be considered best practice that where questions arise but the amounts involved are considered relatively small, there would not be a follow-up.  I am not sure if Mr. McCarthy has had an opportunity to look into this yet.  Is it something he will examine further?</p></speech>

There obviously has to be a proportionality in the amount of oversight activity that one undertakes in respect of a small grant.  Perhaps in this situation, where each of the funders would know that there is a big funder out there, which is the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, there may be an extent to which they are placing reliance on the bigger funder to do more checking.  Formalising that or obtaining some kind of letter of assurance might be an appropriate thing to do.  I want to see the further explanations that we get and how the whole thing meshes together and then I will consider whether I will inquire into it further and maybe even report on it.</p></speech>

That is one of the big complaints from Nursing Homes Ireland.  When it comes to private nursing homes, that mechanism is not there and that is one of they issues that they want addressed.  A person can be admitted to a nursing home who is mobile and moving around.  A number of months or years later, he or she no longer has the same level of mobility and therefore, a greater degree of care is required.  That is the one big complaint that nursing homes have and we need to take it up with the Department.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan.  The Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il, Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Mark Daly, have appealed to everybody in the parliamentary community to continue to follow public health advice, wear a mask and maintain social distancing.  On behalf of the committee, I send our best regards to the Ceann Comhairle, who is currently isolating because of the pandemic.</p> <p>  I request that members, witnesses and staff use wipes and hand sanitiser provided to clean seats and desks which are shared so as to supplement regular sanitation.  This will help to mitigate the risk of Covid-19, including the Delta variant, spreading among the parliamentary community.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  You are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and will notice that every second seat has been removed in order to facilitate social distancing.  I urge you not to move any chair from its current position.  You should always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of a medical grade, should always be worn during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for your full co-operation in this.</p> <p>  I propose we approve the minutes of the private and public meetings on 11 November 2021.  These have already been approved at a virtual private meeting, but we must do so in public session for procedural reasons.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I will read some formal notices.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p></speech>

This ensures that those who are found to be in need of our protection can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security.  We are also fully committed to implementing the key recommendations in the expert advisory group report to reduce average processing times of both first instance decisions and appeals to six months, respectively, as outlined in the White Paper to end direct provision and establish a new international protection support service.</p> <p>  The White Paper proposes that the new system should be phased in and operational by 2024 and that the intervening period should provide an opportunity to progress improvements in the overall processing times for international protection.  That work is well under way and I would like to give the committee a brief overview today of how we intend to reach that target.</p> <p>  In the first instance, the Department is prioritising the processing of all cases using improved processes and involving ICT investment in the system.  A number of initiatives have already been introduced, including the relocation of the ministerial decisions unit to the International Protection Office, IPO, premises to improve work processes, the designation of the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, IPAT, as a body authorised to hold remote hearings and the holding of virtual interviews with some applicants living outside of Dublin.  An end-to-end review of processes in both the IPAT and the IPO, as recommended by the expert advisory group, has been completed by a multidisciplinary team from within the Department.  The review included engagement with past and present applicants and with staff working in the IPO and in the tribunal.</p> <p>  The Minister published the results of the review last month and its findings and recommendations for reform are now helping us to improve efficiencies within those processes and support our goal of reducing average processing times for international protection.  The development of paperless processes will be an important part of this reform as well.</p> <p>  It is also important to acknowledge that the dedication and professionalism of staff in the IPO and in the tribunal, who participated wholeheartedly with the review and very much on board for these changes, is specifically called out in the report.  In case members have not seen it, there was some very interesting work done with applicants and there are some very telling conclusions from that report, which are very much guiding how we are approaching the process of reform within the IPO and the IPAT.</p> <p>  I am joined today by the chief international protection officer, Mr. David Delaney, who was recently appointed to this role but is going at it with great enthusiasm.  The IPO is examining and implementing measures with a view to speeding up average processing times and reducing the overall number of applicants in the protection process.  These measures include training more staff to conduct interviews and complete reports, while also streamlining processes to assist in expediting applications in the medium to long term.</p> <p>  The Department works closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, of Ireland,  and there is an ongoing quality assessment process in place with that organisation.  This provides valuable feedback to staff on the quality of decision-making and ensures that any lessons learned are reflected in amended procedures, if required.  The approach to the prioritisation of cases is also agreed with UNHCR and was most recently updated in June.  A shorter and more user-friendly questionnaire for applicants was also introduced in June and has recently been made available online for the first time.</p> <p>  Following the successful piloting of a virtual chatbot for citizenship applications on our new Irish immigration website, plans are also under way to expand this service to international protection applicants.  I know that when the committee met with our colleagues from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth recently, it was interested in how the programme boards were operating.  I chair the programme board in our Department, which meets every month and has done so since the advisory group&rsquo;s report was published in September 2020.  We effectively started straight away, in terms of implementation.  A senior representative from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth participates on that board, which oversees the work of an implementation working group established within the Department to take forward those recommendations under our remit.  My colleague, Mr. Delaney, is our Department&rsquo;s representative on the programme board more recently established by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman&rsquo;s Department in relation to accommodation and other elements related to direct provision.  Therefore, there is a strong overlap and strong co-ordination between the two programme boards.</p> <p>  It must be acknowledged that efforts to improve processing times have been severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  A decision was also made to stop issuing negative decisions by the ministerial decisions unit during this time.  As a result, the output of decisions was reduced considerably in the last year and a half.  Attendance in the office has been strictly limited in line with public health guidance and substantive protection interviews were suspended for the periods under level 5 restrictions.</p><p>Despite this, the International Protection Office remained open throughout this period to offer applicants a service in line with our international obligations to allow those who wish to claim international protection the opportunity to do so.  The provision of the facility to allow people to claim international protection is considered an essential service at all times, including during the Covid-19 crisis.  IPO staff have worked both on-site and remotely throughout the pandemic to ensure the protection process continues to operate.  We are very grateful to them for that and it has allowed us to continue to provide this very critical service at this time.</p><p> Applications for protection have continued to be made at all times in the pandemic, albeit in lower numbers.  With the opening up of international travel again, those numbers are starting to rise quite steeply.  This makes the implementation of the recommendations of the Catherine Day report all the more important. </p><p> The measures we are taking and will take will have a demonstrably positive impact on waiting times for applications, both in the short to medium term and over the longer term as we move towards the 2024 timeframe.  Early results from this work can already be seen.  However, if this does not allow us to fully realise our ambitions, by next October at the latest, the Department will commence a review of progress made in reducing and improving processing times.  Based on the outcome of that review, we will decide by the end of 2022 whether additional measures are required to ensure the new system can come into operation without the overhang of any significant number of legacy cases.</p><p> I thank the committee for its attention.  My colleague and I will be happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

It indicates the level of desperation that too many people in this world are experiencing due to conflict, human rights abuses and, of course, the impacts of climate change in their countries.  We also have to be aware that the tragedy we saw yesterday is a reminder that, despite the onset of winter and cold weather, desperate attempts such as yesterday's are continuing all the time.  There are people who need protection.  This makes it even more fitting that today we will discuss improvements to the way in which we, as a country, play our part in doing this.  I thought it was important to mention that and I am sure other members may also refer to it as we discuss the establishment of the new international protection service.</p> <p>  I will start with some questions before inviting other members to contribute.  On average, how many applications are processed in a year?  At present, how long must an applicant wait for a decision?  In her opening statement, Ms Buckley stated the Department was fully committed to its objective of having decisions on international protection applications "as soon as possible".  How long is "as soon as possible"?  How will the new process be resourced?  Are there plans to take on new staff to speed up the process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.455" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021112500002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chair for his good questions.  As I mentioned, there has been significant impact on processing because of the pandemic in the past two years.  The Catherine Day report was predicated on us processing approximately 3,500 applications a year.  We were getting quite close to that level of output towards the end of 2019.  I have the figures in front of me and for this year, up to the end of October 2021, we have processed roughly 1,900 applications and granted permission in just over 1,000 applications.  In 2020, we processed 2,141 applications, meaning those applicants got a ministerial decision, either a grant or a refusal.  As I said, at a point in 2019 we were starting to manage the caseload in a very effective way, but that unfortunately came to a significant halt in 2020 and 2021.</p> <p>  The average case processing times for all cases at the moment is 23 months and for prioritised applications it is 14 months.  A prioritised application would be an application from a country where we would be reasonably sure that persons will be granted international protection.  An example at present would be persons applying from Afghanistan who, as one could imagine, would be very much in that space.  </p> <p>  I mentioned that following the Catherine Day report and the White Paper, we will be seeking to move towards this new system and have it in place by 2024.  </p> <p>  With regard to resources, we have been given sanction and the Estimate for next year involves funding for additional resources for the IPO, which is extremely helpful.  As always, we could probably have asked for more.  However, we certainly got something, which was very useful.  We have also been resourced, most critically, for the ICT investment that will be needed to drive this change.  The most important initial part of that will be to move to a paperless system.  A business case will be made to move to that in the International Protection Appeals Tribunal first and then move backwards through the IPO. </p> <p>  Mr. Delaney may have something to add if I have not covered all the matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.456" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Delaney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021112500002#B00400"><p>Ms Buckley covered everything very well.  Just to give a bit of context, in 2018 the median processing time was hitting about 19 months.  In 2019, that came down to about 17 months.  In quarter 1 of 2020, we were hitting 14 months.  There was real progress over those two and a half years, and it has been sort of a steady creep since then due to Covid and the restrictions and the ability to get applications processed effectively.  The current median processing time of 23 months was actually at 26 months earlier in 2021, so we have already made some progress there.  That is underpinned by going through some older cases due to Covid and restrictions in the office.  This has involved a partial clear-out of older cases as well, which is giving a slightly misleading negative impression of the median processing times at the moment.  However, we are starting to see a turn of the corner.</p> <p>  Another variable is that at the end of 2019, there were about 6,000 cases on hand in the International Protection Office.  That figure reduced to close to 5,000 during the pandemic.  An awful lot of work was done in the office to reduce the numbers on hand, notwithstanding restrictions and complexities that existed at the time.  We have seen progress in that area.  It would not be unusual to have a reduction in backlogs and also have an increase in the median processing time.  As I said, the reason for that is many older cases were dealt with during the pandemic.  We have had success in reducing the backlog by almost 1,000 cases over the past 12 to 18 months.  That has been a success, notwithstanding the pressures.  Other than that, Ms Buckley covered all the questions.</p></speech>

I echo the Chair's comments on the horrible tragedy over the weekend.  It is ironic that we are discussing such terrible events.</p> <p>  Ms Buckley indicated that the Department "will commence a review of progress made in reducing and improving process times."  She noted that, based on the outcome of the review, the Department will decide whether additional measures are required "to ensure the new system can come into operation without the overhang of any significant number of legacy cases."  For people outside the meeting, will Ms Buckley give a brief overview or example of a legacy case and why such cases take so long?</p> <p>  I understand we have to be realistic about waiting times.  There was a backlog and I can definitely see the improvements.  It is great that there is collaboration with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Obviously, collaboration is necessary but sometimes it does not happen.  In some activities, we do not see joined-up thinking for a long time, which means things get lost and everything becomes more complicated.  I congratulate the Departments on that collaboration.  </p> <p>  Ms Buckley mentioned Afghanistan, extreme cases and so on.  Is there harmony in respect of many of these troubled countries at the moment?  How much harmony exists between the Department here and equivalent departments in other countries?  I am using Afghanistan as an example; we could easily use Syria as an example as well.</p><p>While we are talking about this subject, it is important to say that it is not all bad news.  Where I come from in east Cork, we have been fortunate, except during the recent impact of Covid-19, to have a food festival.  We bring in all the people who have been helped by these processes to come over to Ireland.  It is a wonderful way for them to showcase their food and different facets of their cultures and that helps us to understand where they come from, how proud they are and how they have integrated into society.  There are great stories like that.  I have had the opportunity at that festival to taste many different treats from many different countries around the world.  I meet lovely people there over the two days of the festival.</p><p> Regarding the review in 2022, are the witnesses hopeful about getting additional resources?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.459" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021112500002#C00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I am sorry; I should have said in my previous contribution that the tragedy yesterday affected all of us deeply.  The desperation of people who wish to move and apply for asylum cannot be underestimated.  It was a tragic incident.  In some respects, Ireland is relatively lucky in that we are just that bit further away and so we do not have people trying to cross to us using difficult means and approaches.  In fact, most people who apply for asylum in Ireland either do so directly at Dublin Airport or present themselves at our offices in Dublin city centre.  That is generally how people apply for asylum in Ireland.</p> <p>  On the legacy cases, the International Protection Office was established under the 2015 legislation.  It was up and running in 2015-16, and replaced its predecessor office.  Based on legal advice given at the time, any cases in the system in 2015 had to be redone by the IPO.  Effectively, therefore, the IPO started out already dealing with thousands of cases that it had to redo.  The people concerned were in the system for a long time.  In fact, on foot of a recommendation made by Mr. Justice McMahon, who led a group to make recommendations concerning improvements in the direct provision system, a number of the people who had been waiting were effectively given permission to remain, based on the length of time they had already spent in the system.</p> <p>  We do not want that situation to arise again.  From our perspective, we do not want to go into 2024 with a large backlog of legacy cases that we will still have to clear.  We would have to do that in sequential order because that is the way the prioritisation we have agreed with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, works.  Mr. Delaney and his colleagues are working hard on changing the way in which we make decisions.  As members will appreciate, it is difficult to change the direction of a large bureaucracy, but we are trying to do that as we move along.  Some substantial changes have already been agreed with the staff and those are being implemented as we speak.</p> <p>  In the event that the effect of these changes is not as we might hope and people are not getting their decisions in reasonably smart order, we have committed to reviewing the situation by October of next year.  The likely outcome is that we will give consideration to persons who have been in the system and, based on the assumption that they have passed security checks and so forth, they will be given permission to remain in those circumstances.  The Minister intends to bring proposals to government shortly concerning undocumented persons in Ireland.  These are a different group of people.  They are not in the international protection system, but people who have come to Ireland and are here on an undocumented basis.  Those proposals will also be dealt with by the Department and the immigration services system next year.  Similarly, we will seek to give some structure, comfort and immigration consent to that group of people in our society who otherwise would be vulnerable.</p> <p>  Co-operation with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth was mentioned.  We have the advantage that the people we are dealing with in that Department were officials of the Department of Justice until the summer of last year.  We have worked closely with them.  Having been responsible for the direct provision system for 20 years, we understand how difficult that task is and we are committed to assisting them.  It is useful that we are able now to focus on those recommendations which arise under our remit, namely, those related to processing.  As somebody who was responsible for the direct provision system until the summer of last year, that that is an all-consuming policy area and a difficult one to manage.  Consequently, it was not possible for us to give our attention to improving our processing times in the way we might have wished.  The full focus of our intention is now on improving the processing of applications and that will obviously be of assistance to our colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well because once we have given people permission to remain, they will be able to move on with their lives in Ireland.</p> <p>  I should point out that a substantial number of people with permission to remain are always in the direct provision system.  Due to the difficulties encountered in securing housing, I understand that well over 1,000 people with permission to remain are residing in the direct provision system.  That has been a persistent problem for the last few years because of the broader issue involved in getting housing.</p> <p>  Regarding what happens in other countries, I understand the Deputy's query as whether we keep abreast of developments in other countries.  Certainly, we do so.  Decisions are taken on the cases of people in the international protection process based on the circumstances in their countries of origin.  Obviously, decisions are also taken in light of whether it would be feasible to return people to those countries of origin.  Good examples of that include Syria and Afghanistan, given the situation there in recent times.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the Deputy's point that Ireland is now a multicultural society.  Those people coming through the international protection system and who have been given permission to remain in Ireland, or refugee status, are certainly contributing significantly to modern Ireland.  It is great that they are now a part of our society.  We are strongly supportive of the efforts of our colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to promote their integration more generally.</p> <p>  I mentioned in the context of the review next year that by October 2022, we will have a firm idea as to whether our efforts to deal with the backlog of legacy cases have been sufficient or whether we need to take further steps.</p></speech>

I have no doubt about their personal sincerity in dealing with this challenging issue.  I have no doubt about the Government in this regard either.  I also pay tribute to the former Minister of State with special responsibility in this area, Deputy Stanton.  I may be from a different political party, but we had to deal with big issues in Roscommon for a long time.  It was an even more challenging situation then because there was, shall we say, a lack of understanding in some quarters for the plight of some of the poor people involved.  The then Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, was remarkably cool in handling the issue and dealt well with what was a difficult situation.  I just want to put that on the record.</p> <p>  We are all saddened by the terrible loss of life yesterday.  We sometimes watch documentaries and world news and see what many of these people are going through and what they will do to escape their countries.  In general, the vast majority of Irish people want to help these people.  An element will challenge us as politicians.</p><p>It is important that as politicians we stand up for those people and we make sure that in coming out of those many tragic situations they are supported by this nation.  Ireland has always had a good record of helping people in very difficult situations.</p><p> As I had to leave the meeting for a few minutes, I do not know whether the witnesses have already answered the following question.  How many applications are processed annually and what is the waiting time for a decision?  As I said, if that question has been already answered, that is fine; I will get the answer from the transcript of the meeting.  In light of Covid, can the new system be fully operational by 2024?  There is no doubt that is going to be a huge challenge.  I am interested in hearing more about the chatbot system.  The title tells one a certain amount, but how exactly does it work?  The witnesses appear to be very positive about the results coming from it.  </p><p> If the witnesses are not in a position to answer any of my questions today, they can come back to me directly.</p></speech>

I have previously answered that question, but I will give the figures again.  There is no doubt they have been very sorely affected by Covid.  The Catherine Day report suggests that per annum, on average, 3,500 people will apply for asylum or international protection.  That is the target in respect of which we need to ensure the system is washing its face to keep abreast of applications.  Last year, unfortunately because of Covid, we were not able to do that many decisions.  Up to 31 October 2021, just over 1,800 applications had been processed and, I am sorry, I have lost my figures.</p></speech>

I can get the information from my colleague, Deputy Devlin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.465" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021112500002#D00400"><p>The Senator is correct that Covid is not making our lives any easier.  That is largely due to the fact that the system is almost entirely paper based.  If Members were to go into the IPO they would be shocked by how old-fashioned it looks.  There are literally files everywhere.  One of our priorities is to move to a paperless system, without which the social distancing and other measures we are required to implement because of Covid make our lives very difficult.  There is a second aspect to the way in which the pandemic has impacted upon our work.  We have to arrange to interview the applicants and they are commonly represented by a solicitor and often need interpretation services.  It can be very challenging to organise for all of those people to be present.  We have started to move to remote interviewing.  That is challenging the staff to organise, but we are starting to get there and we are starting to schedule more remote hearings.</p> <p>  Mr. Delaney is more familiar with the chatbot than I am.  It is certainly working for citizenship.  I will hand over to Mr. Delaney to go through how we are using robots to help our client base.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.466" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Delaney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021112500002#D00500"><p>First, on the Senator's question with regard to the system being fully operational by 2024, I will give some assurances in that regard.  The Catherine Day recommendation of the 3,500 applications per annum in and, therefore, a similar number reaching decisions breaks down into approximately 290 cases per month.  We cleared 390 cases last month.  Significant work has been put in place to make that happen.  To give an indication of some the innovation and work that is being done by the staff in the office and prior to my arrival, we are now up to 80 interviews per week, all conducted via videoconference facilities.  Many of them have to facilitate an interviewer, the applicant, an interpreter and, quite often, a legal representative.  There are a number of moving parts to all of those 80 individual interviews that are scheduled per week.  From that perspective, I would not say we are already at our fully operational 2024 level because we have a lot of work to do to clear aspects of the backlog, but in terms of the Catherine Day recommendation on what we should be able to take in and reach a decision on we are currently at that level, even with the Covid restrictions.  That is a credit to an awful of people in the office to be able to make that happen, throughout the past few months especially.</p> <p> The chatbot system, which we hope to roll out very soon, is a little icon on our webpage which is programmed to identify key words that are typed into it as questions.  When those key words are identified, they will generate an appropriate answer.  Rather than people having to trawl through five, ten or 15 different links on webpages or having to send an email for fairly basic responses on aspects of the asylum process or their claim, the chatbot can given an instantaneous response.  That is the chatbot function that we hope to roll out very soon.  It is the same service that is being provided currently by our citizenship chatbot.  We are confident it will be able to do this.  We also hope to programme it with multiple language facilities such that it will be able to deal with multiple clients.  We are familiar with the languages that, in the main, our clients present with so we will be prioritising those languages.  We hope to then scale up the chatbot function to interact with our more modern systems.  When someone asks the status a claim we will be able to respond that the claim is at X position and they should be hearing from us in a day, a week or a month.  That is further down the road; it is a 2024-type measure.  Getting in place the chatbot which I have just described is a high priority for us because it will give that sense of comfort to our clients on a daily basis that they can get information much more easily than is the case currently.  I hope that covers the Senator's questions.</p></speech>

I, too, join colleagues in paying tribute to those who have lost their lives in the tragedy in the English Channel.  If ever we needed a reminder of the need for a robust and efficient asylum system that is it.  We know of other European countries that have been dealing with this on a daily basis, unfortunately, and of the loss of life at sea of those who are trying to cross waters.  I join with the comments of the Chairman and others in that regard.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Buckley for her opening remarks in respect of which I have a number of questions.  There has been a significant improvement in the engagement of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, with Members of the Oireachtas from the appointments system to updates on queries.  I have experienced this myself.  It is important to put that on the record.  Like me, new Members of the House since 2020 have been grappling with the pandemic since then.  The engagement from the INIS has, as I said, improved over the past number of months.  </p> <p>  Ms Buckley mentioned that the new system should be operational by 2024.  Given everything that we have experienced, that people are remote working and that the INIS system is in the main paper based, is that still on track?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.470" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021112500002#D00900"><p>As I mentioned in the opening statement, we have been working since September 2020 on implementation of the new system.  A number of the recommendations have been already put into place.  For example, the 12-month access to the labour market has been put in place such that the a permit is now valid for 12 months rather than six and it can be secured after six months and so forth.  We have done the things that were low-hanging fruit, if I can use that phrase.  We also had a lengthy but ultimately quite successful engagement with the banking industry to make sure that asylum seekers could open bank accounts.  We are working hard with our colleagues in the Department of Transport to make sure that asylum seekers can lawfully access driver's licences, which would be great.</p> <p>  I cannot understate the fact that the pandemic has made our lives very difficult, largely because it overlaid a system that was more or less paper based and very poorly computerised.  Our challenge is to make sure that over the course of next year in particular, we put in place the building blocks to move the system on to a less paper-based, or paperless, system.  We will start with the tribunal and work that backwards into the IPO.</p><p>Then there is the second piece, which Mr. Delaney is working hard to implement.  We have restructured the way decisions are taken by the staff.  There was quite a complex procedure whereby we would hire a lawyer.  The lawyer went in to do the interview.  That would come back in and land on the desk of a civil servant for final recommendation.  Those files would move between various levels of civil servant.  We have removed several of those layers.  That should significantly improve things.  We are now asking our staff to do the job directly that we had farmed out to lawyers.  They are working on some of our less challenging files although these are cases that are very challenging for the individuals involved.  These would be cases where we would likely grant permission because of the country that the person comes from.  Once they have gained confidence in that system, we will be able to use them on a broader range of decisions.  That change alone has expanded our capacity and will do significantly over the next year.  </p><p> Sometimes it can be hard to effect change in a Department among civil servants but the staff have embraced this change and it is really great that they are doing so. </p></speech>

My experience showed they were very much engaged and were able to correspond with us and our queries.  That was also true for members of the public who engaged with them.  I know that there were pressures there.  Given what Ms Buckley has said about the volume of paper they deal with ordinarily, it is only right that we acknowledge the way in which they worked.  I want to put that on the record today.</p> <p>  ICT was one of the main recommendations in the review.  Ms Buckley mentioned cases that were backlogged or had been hanging around for some time.  Were any cases lost due to paper-based files?  Is there an idea of the cost of the introduction of an ICT system?  From what Ms Buckley said about the existing capabilities or lack thereof, it will have to be built from scratch.</p></speech>

I am glad to say that even though it is paper based, we do track them and try to manage that system.  The asylum list is one of the busiest in the High Court in an average year.</p> <p>  On ICT investment, the Department has been resourced in its estimate for this year and next to the tune of several millions, which is excellent.  Because of the size of the demands by immigration services, it is likely that a large part of that will be spent on that area and into the International Protection Office.  I cannot give a figure at the moment.  A business case for bringing in those services will be considered shortly by the committee that does that.  </p> <p>  It might be slightly unusual but we were part of the whole-of-government effort to introduce the mandatory hotel quarantine system.  In the space of about ten days, we introduced an appeals system that was entirely electronically based.  We will take some of the things that we learned from that for the work on the IPO and the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, IPAT.</p></speech>

It is also looked to the Catherine Day report for guidance on the big picture.  Very wisely, it set out key targeted recommendations.  Ms Buckley referred to one, that was in respect of getting civil servants to do specific targeted work to instantly give us an opportunity to increase productivity.  There are other recommendations may not have received the same headlines which we have moved to implementing.  I mentioned the ability to upscale the videoconferencing facilities to a much greater degree.  It also involved bringing in efficiencies in how applications were dealt with, to reduce the contact time for the customer and to process claims quicker in those early stages.  There has been some feedback on putting the questionnaire online and how we could accept it back by email.  All those little recommendations have been implemented along the way.  Indeed, sometimes when an idea would come forth during discussions by the end-to-end team with staff, they would nearly implement it and then three months later the end-to-end review team would have it as part of the recommendation.  There was that type of positive interaction and engagement.</p> <p>  On the broader IT question, it would be hard to put a number on the cost for a while.  Probably because of Covid, we have already moved to trying to get as many documents and interactions digitally without having a wonderful new expensive computer system.  The questionnaire being emailed in is a very simple recommendation, which stopped people filling it in by hand and posting it and then scanning it and putting it onto a file.  That will form part of a digital file.  We are now moving towards having as many things on a digital file as possible.  Those are the types of practical recommendations from the end-to-end review at work.  Does that answer the Deputy's questions? </p></speech>

I am sorry that I was a little late and missed their presentation.  There was an interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i>yesterday relating to immigrants coming into this country, but not specifically relating to direct provision.  The article's gist was that Ireland is a very welcome country for those arriving as either refugees or migrants - I have a difficulty with the word &quot;refugee&quot; always being used to describe migrants - but that after the initial welcome, we cease to be supportive.  Slightly outside direct provision, but aligned to it, we tend to place migrants in geographical areas all together rather than trying to integrate them.  Given the long periods that people spend in direct provision, is there more that we should do in the centres <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>integration in order that people become more involved in local communities, rather than being forced to live within their own community?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.481" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021112500002#E01100"><p>The role of integrating migrants etc. is now under the auspices of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  As part of the Government restructuring, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, took over those functions.  I strongly agree that we need to do as much as possible to integrate newly arrived migrants.  The Senator is correct.  The numbers of people who come and apply for international protection in Ireland is a tiny fraction of the thousands of people who arrive every year, many to study and to work here.  A very large proportion of the work done by immigration services is about managing visas etc. for those persons who want to come to Ireland.</p><p>The other issue that is probably worth thinking about is that people arrive with children.  Their children are first and second-generation migrants.  We need to make sure that the next generation is fully integrated into Irish society.  The children of the first generation of migrants to Ireland are now reaching adulthood.  It is really important that the necessary supports and activities are there for them.</p><p> We are very lucky in one respect, in that all children in this country attend school, regardless of whether they have the right papers.  The children of undocumented migrants can go to school and there is no issue about that.  There is a strong level of integration at classroom level, which certainly helps.</p><p> It can be very important for people to become citizens.  Ireland has a very generous approach to citizenship.  People can apply after they have been in the country for four years.  There are relatively few restrictions on the persons we will give citizenship to, on the assumption that they pass the security clearance.  For example, we do not require people to pass exams, language tests and so on.  That is inclusionary in its own right because it would be difficult for certain groups, such as women, for example, to do the necessary classes and pass tests.  It is a way of making sure that we give a stable structure around all sorts of people.</p><p> With regard to integrating people who are living in direct provision centres, the thrust of the White Paper is about moving from congregated settings based slightly to one side in a town or whatever to a more integrated space.  When the Department of Justice was responsible for direct provision we were already starting to try to move to procure own door accommodation as best we could to try to improve standards.  We very much struggled with that in the context of the pandemic.  Senator Murphy mentioned some issues that we had in terms of trying to open various centres over the course of 2019.  That has to be part of the process.  </p><p> I do not want to cut across the work of my colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, but we found that there was always trouble before a centre opened.  However, once it opened communities were incredibly welcoming.  There are were always friends of the centre and people worked very hard to make sure that people within centres, who are often quite traumatised and come from very traumatic situations, were given as much support as they could from the community.  We hope that would continue.</p><p> A new system of community sponsorship has been established.  A community comes together and provides a house.  A family from Syria or, in recent times, Afghanistan, is, in effect, taken from a plane and brought directly into a community.  That comes from a Canadian model and is very much the strongest way to integrate any individual family into a community.</p></speech>

That is a comprehensive answer.  I would like to raise a couple of points.  Many who arrive on these shores come from authoritarian-type countries, where women, in particular, have an extremely difficult upbringing and survival within the communities in which they live.  I wonder about their willingness to look at the structures, supports and rights-based facilities available in Ireland.</p><p>An article in <i>The Irish Times</i>suggested that although all of these are place, many of these people come from societies where people did not have rights.  Therefore, they did not have a way to look for rights and the assistance of the authorities.  For such people, authorities, rather than being people to engage with, are people to avoid like the plague.  The officials have done an amazing amount of work with the thousands of migrants that have come to this country over the past ten or more years, and they are to be complimented on that.  Do we need to put in place more structures to assist them in the re-education of migrants who arrive in this country, in particular from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and other such almost dictatorial countries?  </p><p>I am concerned about young people and women.  I went to see migrants land in Sicily and to engage with them.  Some of the stories we heard, in particular from young women, were horrific.  The price they paid to get this country, not in financial terms but with their bodies, for want of a better description, was horrific.  Young men had equally horrific experiences.  The major fear I had in Sicily was that we were told by one young woman that they were pushed out to sea in Tripoli and arrived in Sicily where they were brought into a migrant centre.  They presented whatever they were asked for, but pimps and those who would exploit them were waiting for them outside the gates.  While direct provision has many negative aspects, the one positive aspect is that it is, I hope, a safe place for young people to live while there being processed through the system.</p><p>Does the Department need more help?  Should this committee make recommendations for more assistance for officials?  I can see Ms Buckley is smiling.  I assume if ask her a question like that she would fill a bucket with the number of requests.  I will kick over to her now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.484" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021112500002#F00300"><p>I thank the Senator.  It might be worth saying, in particular in light of the incident yesterday in the English Channel, that Ireland has been relatively unusual in that we have consistently accepted people from search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean Sea.  We can only take small numbers because we are limited by the accommodation we can provide in the direct provision system.  We consistently take small numbers.  As the Senator pointed out, we are consistently one of the countries that seeks to help to relieve some of the burden from the front facing countries, including Italy, Spain, Malta, Cyprus and Greece, all of which take in large numbers of refugees.  We try to help, although Ireland has consistently argued for the adoption of an EU-wide migration policy so that we can deal with these issues collectively as a European Union.  We would be involved in the delicate negotiations around such an EU package of measures.</p> <p>  My colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth largely have responsibility for the direct provision system and its welcome reform.  They also have responsibility for integration matters.  I am smiling because while I am sure they could do with more money, I am not sure I would earn any credits in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for asking for that.  </p> <p>  Substantial funding is available from the EU, and that is regularly tapped by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  That support assists us very greatly in integration efforts.  Through that, a substantial number of NGOs and other groups are funded to help with the integration efforts.  It is important for Ireland's future because Ireland's future is one of a multicultural society.  Its present is a multicultural society and we have to make sure that people of all cultures are included as securely as possible.  </p> <p>  Often the first interaction with an Irish Government agency that somebody coming from abroad will have will be with our services.  We need to make them as good, decent and responsive as possible.  In doing that, it is to be hoped that people's first experience with the Irish government system is a good one and will help them to start building trust.</p> <p>  One of the impacts of distrust in government in the context of the Covid pandemic has been people from migrant communities being more reluctant to get vaccinated.  That has an impact.</p><p>We have worked closely with our colleagues in the HSE to try to use our systems so the HSE can access those migrants who might not otherwise be reached through the standard processes used by Irish nationals who listen to the media and so forth.  We have worked closely with it to try to help improve the take-up of vaccines among migrant communities.  We have done so by consistently stating that undocumented migrants need have no fear that by coming forward to be vaccinated they will in any way expose themselves to action by the immigration authorities.  We have consistently stated that we want people to come forward for their vaccinations and they do not need to worry that their details will be reported onto us.</p></speech>

I have been critical of some of it and the way in which it is done.  My colleague, Senator Murphy, referred to the purchase of centres or hotels to house migrants.  I remember the situation in Oughterard in Galway well.  Although I am from Galway I do not live there now and I remember other situations in Roscommon and Wicklow.  Those communities felt that some cute so-and-so arrived down from Dublin and did a deal behind their backs and that the Department was going to land in 550,000 migrants on them.  Have lessons been learned from that?  Ms Buckley made the point that once a community comes together we are extremely welcoming and helpful.  If one goes back to rural housing I remember people moving from Dublin to Leitrim, Clare and all sorts of places.  They were not migrants but Dubs, although I suppose that Dubs going west of the Shannon were migrants.  Communities are welcoming and they like to see people coming in.  Have we learned the lessons so that we will not do that again?  Will we engage with the communities before we buy the hotel, guesthouse or whatever?</p></speech>

We would argue that we tried to communicate and consult with people as best we could and even where there was controversy in places like Roscommon, as was mentioned, ultimately those centres opened.  There are people in those centres and they are becoming part of the local communities.  The advantage to doing that is that one has migrants living all over Ireland and one does not have them gathering in cities.  I was about to mention ghettoes but I have been controversial enough in the last while so I do not want to go there.</p></speech>

That allows for the impact of migrants arriving in Ireland to be absorbed by the entire country.  A classic example would be if we were to try to find accommodation for all of the children of migrants in Cork or Dublin alone, for example, but when it is spread out widely across the community the arrival of three or four migrant or asylum seeker children can be welcome in a school because it can mean keeping an extra teacher there, as the Senator will appreciate.  The Minister&rsquo;s White Paper on international protection is about changing that entire model and moving away from the congregated settings we used to date towards a system where people are given their own doors to go in behind so that they will have that comfort.</p></speech>

Would Ms Buckley see any benefit in educating the indigenous Irish, for the want of a better description, on the ethos and standards that some of our migrant communities have?  I am particularly mindful of the Nigerians and the work ethic and standards they demanded of their children to aspire to be the best they could.  That was something to see.  The common cry one hears from some of the lunatic brigade is that these people are coming to take our social welfare and housing and that we should house the Irish before we house anybody else but we forget that so many of us were migrants.  I was one myself back in the 1960s and we forget what it was like to arrive in London and see signs stating, &ldquo;No Irish, no dogs&rdquo; and things like that.  Could we do an advertising campaign or something like that to show the human side of the people the Department is dealing with every day.  The Department works at the coal face, its staff meets these people in the most horrendous circumstances and they bring them in and give them everything the State can offer.  The one thing we cannot give them in an official setting is the love and attention they probably require.  I am particularly mindful of the young people who have arrived on their own and who have been trafficked all over the world.  I think of that horrendous case in the UK with 39 people in the back of a truck and I think of the drowning migrants, including that little boy lying on the beach in Turkey.  People have to realise the desperation these people come to our shores in.  The way the world is going there will an awful lot more of it over the coming years as people move away from famine, drought and whatever else.  I will not take any more of the Department&rsquo;s time.  It does a fantastic job and I could not criticise anything it does.  The staff in the Department have worked in the most extremely difficult circumstances so I congratulate them and thank them for their efforts.</p></speech>

These people are fleeing horrendous circumstances in their countries and people should open their eyes and look at where they are coming from and the situation in those countries.  As Senator Craughwell said, the narrative is being put out there that they are coming over for our social welfare and all of that.  As public representatives we need to challenge that and knock it on the head.  I have a family and we all have families and it does not bear thinking of that I would put my family in a rubber dinghy, shove them out into an ocean and think there is &euro;204 per week going in that small country over there when there is less than a 50% chance that the family would even reach these shores.  I know the trend is small but it is getting traction in different places.  As public representatives and members of committees like this we need to knock that kind of rubbish on the head and support these refugees.</p></speech>

In the first instance we try to deal with claims in normal date order and then there are common sense prioritisations that rarely change, which would be vulnerable individuals, elderly individuals and unaccompanied minors.  That standard remains normal.  Then there would be a categorisation of about seven countries.  We are talking about the likes of Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia, Yemen and that category of countries.  That will change a little bit on an ongoing basis.  In some countries the situation on the ground will have improved to a certain extent such that one country will come off that list and another country will go onto it.  There are other small prioritisations in the mix depending on whether someone raises personal medical concerns that may give rise to a need to have the case heard a little bit quicker; we always give priority to matters like that.  There are the strategic prioritisations that I have just outlined and then there are humanitarian situations that may arise at a given point in time.  That gives a high level overview of how that operates in a practical sense.</p></speech>

The new immigration website is online and it looks wonderful but there is still the question of the old website.</p><p>My suggestion is that we would be greeted by a portal combining the old information and a current application, because while the banner runs along all the pages saying that there is a new website, as of July of this year, I suggest that just in case that was missed, perhaps the Department would look at a front portal that would give the old and new websites, or some way of doing that.  However, that is neither here nor there.</p><p> In terms of the new application and the chatbots to which Senator Murphy referred, how many languages are available on the new website for people to engage with?</p></speech>

We are about to go live on the Irish immigration website.  We do not know if it will be a couple of weeks or months but we have much of the hard work done to go with the five most common languages across the immigration service.  That has been an interesting exercise in its own right because of the different areas of immigration.  There is citizenship at one end versus asylum at the other end and they have five different types of priority languages, as the Deputy can imagine.</p></speech>

I will put it this way: it is not something that is in its infancy right now or something that is being scoped out; it is something that has very much evolved at this point.  It has gone through a few business processes and now it is a case of implementing it.</p></speech>

He might correspond with the committee when that is done as it is a matter of interest to us.  We have raised it before in one of our engagements with the Ombudsman.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Buckley for raising the programme boards.  She was obviously aware that we were asking questions about it.  I had a few questions to raise about the two programme boards.  I was worried about duplication, but Ms Buckley has clarified that in her opening statement.</p> <p>  In her opening statement, she also referred to the ministerial decisions unit and that negative decisions were suspended for a period.  I presume the unit is up and running again.  How many cases were impacted during the suspension?</p></speech>

I will explain why.  We are issuing positive decisions that give permission to remain or refugee status.  Negative decisions however, trigger an automatic process under the 2015 Act.  A letter must issue inviting a person to declare whether he or she will remove himself or herself from the State within five days.  There was a recommendation by Catherine Day that the process would be moved out to 30 days and take account of children being in school and issues such as school terms.  That work is in hand in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is currently before the Joint Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The other thing that is automatically triggered is that a person with a negative decision would be served with a deportation order if he or she does not remove himself or herself from the State within five days.  Given the restrictions on international travel that were such a feature, in particular at the beginning of this year, the Minister took a decision that the issuance of deportation orders would cease, save in certain very limited circumstances where, for example, there was a case of significant criminality.  As a consequence, we have not resumed the issuance of negative letters yet because of those trigger points.  People need to be able to consult with their lawyers and do other such things and that became so difficult during the pandemic that it was not fair on people to get such letters.  We have some hundreds of those decisions made but we have not started to issue them yet.</p></speech>

We have been relatively unusual in that.  Other European countries have continued to issue deportation orders and to deport people throughout the pandemic but Ireland just pulled back from that.</p></speech>

If I were an applicant who was being refused, no news normally means good news.  Ms Buckley can see where I am going with this.  She also mentioned timing in respect of schooling.  We sometimes get cases where a student is in a local school and people want the individual to remain in the State.  If all of these letters are to go out, presumably at once-----</p></speech>

I do not think that is fair.  We will not press a button and have hundreds of people suddenly get such news.  Relatively speaking, in recent times, a higher proportion of people in the decision-making process than would be the norm have secured permission to remain.  That is partly because we have given priority to certain countries, in particular Afghanistan, as the idea of issuing a deportation order for somebody to go back to Afghanistan at this point is not viable.</p> <p>  Without going into it, for the system to have integrity, if a person does not meet the standard of international protection in this country, even after all the various iterations, a decision can be taken to the IPO and appealed to IPAT and then it goes back to the ministerial decision unit.  For a system to have some integrity, there will always be some people who do not fall on the right side of the line.</p></speech>

It came up in the Catherine Day report that there is a point when even though we say a person cannot have international protection, we do not deport him or her and we never have any intention of doing so because it is not a country to which we can deport somebody or for whatever other reason, and in those circumstances we commonly take a pragmatic approach to the situation.  There are opportunities under the Act for people to come back in and say their circumstances have changed, their children are in school, they are integrating-----</p></speech>

I will ask one more question and make a comment.  Ms Buckley mentioned the undocumented.  My understanding is that a process was due to begin in mid to late December but she referred to 2022.  Which is it?  Is it starting at the end of this year?</p></speech>

The next meeting I am going to after this committee meeting is a Cabinet sub-committee meeting on the undocumented scheme.  We are at the point now of bringing our proposals to the Government.  Once the Government approves them it will have to go as a memorandum to the Government but we have a draft memorandum ready.  We hope that will be in a few days, assuming the discussions with the Cabinet sub-committee go well.  We will then announce the terms of the scheme, but once the terms of the scheme are settled, which will only be once the Government has decided them, we need approximately one month to have the IT system ready to start accepting applications.  All going well, the Minister will be in a position to announce the terms of the scheme in the next two weeks, with a view to the scheme opening for applications approximately a month later.  Realistically, that is January.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Buckley for that.  In her opening remarks, she mentioned the outcome of the review.</p><p>There will be another review of all the changes that have been made and a decision will be made around the end of 2022 on that, on whether additional resources and measures are needed, and on any significant issues around legacy cases.  I hope we will engage before then, but if not, I suggest that, once the review has concluded and there is a report, we have an engagement on the review process.  I am interested in the iteration of the website, the improvement and the functionality of it and the internal information and communications technology, ICT, processes the witnesses spoke about, as well as other improvements and measures taken in the witnesses' office, which I commend.  It would be good for the committee to keep on this issue and engage with the witnesses on it in late 2022 or just after that.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance.</p></speech>

I will not hold the witnesses long.  This engagement has been helpful and I thank the witnesses for their straight answers.  I have been doing some other work here and might have missed something.  They may have answered this, and if they have, that is fine.  They can just say they have answered it already.  First, how many staff have the witnesses working with them?  Second, the world is a troubled place at the moment and I often think that, despite our drawbacks, we are lucky in this country.  Are there a growing number of countries whose residents are seeking help and support in coming to Ireland?  Going back a few years, it was a small list.  Has that list grown significantly?</p></speech>

That is the extent of the resources that go into the decision-making process.</p> <p>  With regard to the countries Ireland's migrants come from, it is an interesting question.  They come from all over the world.  We very occasionally get applications for international protection from places like the United States and Canada.  As countries develop crises, there are spikes in numbers.  We saw a spike in numbers from Afghanistan this year.  We consistently have a number of people applying from Syria.  There are countries like Venezuela, for example, where there have been difficulties.</p> <p>  All countries develop patterns of where their applications come from.  Ireland more regularly has applications from English-speaking sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa, while a country like Spain might get a lot of people from Venezuela.  It is to do with language, family connections and things like that.  We had a period in 2018 and 2019 in which we received substantial numbers of applications from Albania and Georgia, but those have trailed off in recent times.  It varies widely.  Any day, you could end up with somebody applying from any one of 190 countries, pretty much.  Though the numbers are relatively small in comparison with some of our fellow EU member states, they are incredibly varied, and the circumstances people come from are similarly varied.</p></speech>

The Department's aims are to reduce the processing times of first instance decisions and appeals related to direct provision to six months each, as outlined in the White Paper, and to establish a new international protection support service.  How exactly will those aims be achieved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.530" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021112500002#J01300"><p>As we explained, the work Mr. Delaney and his team are doing is intended consistently to shave time off all aspects of the process.  The end-to-end process review we did, which included the International Protection Office and the appeals tribunal, looked at all aspects of the decision-making chain and identified places where delays could be reduced.  For example, one delay is often between people arriving and claiming international protection but not returning their questionnaire for some months.  We need to try to reduce that timeframe.  The work Mr. Delaney and his team have done concerns putting the questionnaire online and making it easier for people to do that.</p> <p>  We will also look at the legal aid side of things in due course to see whether additional supports are needed to give people help on that.  Mr. Delaney is talking to a non-governmental organisation, NGO, about giving more supports around that which are not strictly speaking legal but are about people addressing that process.  People can be reluctant to complete that form and nothing can happen until the questionnaire is returned.  That is part of the process.</p> <p>  A second bad pinch point was identified by Mr. Delaney, namely, that we were getting lawyers to do the interviews and write up a report and that was coming back in and landing on the desk of a civil servant to make a recommendation and moving around various levels of the Civil Service.  We have taken out one of those layers and reapplied one of the layers in the Civil Service to do the interviews directly.  That expanded our capacity enormously in that pinch point in the system.</p> <p>  We can only do this by being quite radical about how we go about it.  A third point will be when we move from a paper-based system to a fully online system.  We need to be quite radical in some decisions we are taking and we are.  Second, we need to shave a week off here and there.  Ultimately that will bring the time back to that six months and six months.</p></speech>

If so, how are those issues addressed?</p></speech>

In circumstances where somebody genuinely cannot do the interview remotely or does not want to and it would be unfair to make him or her, we can provide an in-person service but it is more challenging.  We co-operate closely with our colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth who run the International Protection Accommodation Services.  They can put in facilities on site to assist people living in their accommodation, though not all international protection applicants do.  That helps them to engage with the system.  There tends to be Wi-Fi and all that sort of stuff in international protection services.</p> <p>  Migrants to Ireland tend to be quite young and tech savvy.  No more than Irish people going abroad, they have a lot of get-up-and-go, are tech savvy and of a certain age.  Generally, people are more than capable of engaging with the system in terms of remote hearings and so on.  Can Mr. Delaney add anything to that?  He would be familiar with it.</p></speech>

It is the case that no customer is expected or asked to provide their own device or be able to engage with technology.  It is all supported for them.  That is a significant overhead for us but it means that we have built the system to cater for the most vulnerable and the most in need in terms of that.  Also, any enhancement that we have brought in, like the questionnaire and a few other digital improvements, are there in tandem with the paper application or the paper questionnaire.  From our perspective, when we see banking go online then it is online or pretty much nothing.  We always think when a service goes digital that that will be the case and people will have to be able to interface with that digital service.  I was going to say unfortunately but, quite frankly, positively we do not do that.  We will always push digital and modernisation but we maintain paper-based systems and supports around any digital solutions.</p> <p>  As Ms Buckley mentioned, we have identified, and this goes back to a comment that one of the members made much earlier, the discomfort and concern some people have when they arrive in the State, especially if they came from an authoritarian society.  We have identified the need for that sort of non-legalistic wraparound support when people apply to explain to them what the system is and that the system is here to help them, that it is here to help reach fair and balanced decisions and that the State can provide these services for them.  We are very much in that head space in supporting people and using technology to help that; it is not a case of technology or nothing else.  I hope that I have assuaged some fears. </p></speech>

The number would not be that extreme.</p> <p>  We are not finding any difficulties in terms of interviews being cancelled or being unable to schedule an interview due to the lack of a legal representative.  It is not a barrier that we have seen.  I will not say that there has not been the odd occasion that a solicitor has had to rush down to The Four Courts for something and it makes an interview a bit more difficult or challenging.  That may occur but it occurs in any walk of life.  I would not say that we have a systemic problem around legal representation for clients in the business.  I think that it is okay at the moment.</p></speech>

Does Ms Buckley know how many undocumented people are in the country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.537" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021112500002#K00500"><p>It is the big unknown, Chair.  By their very nature these people are undocumented so it is very hard to given an estimate.  The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, is an NGO that led the charge in putting in place a structure for the undocumented.  The MRCI has estimated that the number is about 17,000.  Similarly, we have looked at studies done in other European countries so one can do a crude estimate of those studies.  Let us say there are 450,000 undocumented people living in the UK, which has a population 13 times our size so one could divide 450,000 by 13.  However, all of these figures are estimates and the exact number is a big unknown for us.</p> <p>  In terms of the discussion that we are having with other Departments, we have drawn up cost-based estimates that are based on 10,000, 20,000 and 30,000 people because we genuinely do not know in that space where the ultimate number will land.  We are trying to design a system that can accommodate tens of thousand of people but, unfortunately, the number is a big unknown for us. </p> <p>  The one thing that we consistently say to people is that the undocumented are already in this country.  It is not that 10,000 will come into the country.  These people are already here, they are living in houses and their children are already going to school.  So this is not a huge additional burden that the State will have to take on.  That is not the case because these people are already here.</p></speech>

The team in the Department is working very hard to improve our customer service rating, which I think we would all acknowledge is at a low enough base.  It is great to hear that the supports we are putting in for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are working.  Let us know if there is anything further we can do to help them answer questions and when they make representations on behalf of people and so forth.  We are always willing to listen to what we can do to improve on that.</p> <p>  This is an incredibly important part of the job of the Department of Justice.  The immigration services are our most public facing activity and obviously it is a public that is from all over the world.  As I have said, often times the interaction with the Irish immigration service is the first interaction somebody coming to this country will have with the Irish State so it is important and incumbent upon us to make that as smooth, easy and responsive as possible.  We are working very hard to deliver on that.  I thank the committee for allowing us to come here today and explain the work that we do. </p></speech>

I think that I can speak for us all when I say that this has been one of the most beneficial and informative discussions that we have had with Departments.  On behalf of the committee, I thank the delegation for coming here today.  As Deputy Devlin said earlier, we will keep communication channels open and when the review is done we will come back together again at whatever stage to continue this discussion.  In the meantime and on behalf of the committee, I wish the deputy Secretary General and Mr. Delaney a happy Christmas and a safe journey.</p></speech>

Our first and second petitions are Nos.  9/21 and 23/21 and they will be taken together.  This refers to unauthorised development on the River Shannon and it is in the names of Mr. Michael Barrett and Mr. Jamie Forde Kelly.  The recommendation are as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	1.That correspondence from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government be forwarded to the petitioners for information; 2.That correspondence from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government be forwarded to Westmeath County Council; or , 3.That Mr. Barrett and Mr. Forde Kelly be invited to appear before the Joint Committee on Public Petitions at its meeting of 9 December 2021. </blockquote> <p>Do Members have any views on this matter?</p></speech>

At the very start of this meeting we spoke about this committee being very strong and having the ability to punch about its weight, therefore I propose that we select the third recommendation.  We should bring in these witnesses and hear what is really going on.</p></speech>

To the best of my knowledge, I believe that we received a letter and video from the Department, which tried to wash its hands of the whole issue.  I think we need to chase up this matter and I personally think that the Department has a responsibility.  Let us take things step by step and ask Mr. Barrett and Mr. Forde Kelly in to explain the situation.  We must also keep after the Westmeath County Council, Waterways Ireland and the Department and see where that takes us.  Does any other member wish to comment?</p></speech>

Does anybody else wish to come in?  No.</p> <p>  Our third petition is P000015/21, submitted by Mr. Des Lafferty, on respectful dialogue.  The recommendations are that, first, the correspondence from the Department of Foreign Affairs be forwarded to Mr. Lafferty for comment and second, that the committee writes to Mr. Joe Hackett, Secretary General at the Department of Foreign Affairs, acknowledging the considerable amount of time and effort that is required to retrieve files that have been archived.

The recommendations are that, first, the correspondence from the Department of Foreign Affairs be forwarded to Ms Gopinath and second, that this petition be closed because at present, all restrictions have been lifted.  Do members have any views?  Is that agreed.  Agreed.</p> <p>  That concludes the consideration of public petitions this afternoon.  I would like to invite members of the public to submit petitions via our online portal.  A petition may be addressed to the Houses of the Oireachtas on a matter of general public concern or interest or on an issue of public policy.</p> <p>  Next on our agenda is any other business.  Would members like to make any final comments?</p></speech>

Many more members of the public could be aware of this committee.  With Covid-19, we cannot get out and get our message across but this is a good committee for people who have legitimate questions and concerns that may not have been answered.  They will get a fair crack of the whip here.  Again, I agree with what the Chairman said about asking people to submit their letter or queries or whatever.  I would encourage the public to do that because there is quite a lot of benefit to be gathered from contacting this committee.</p></speech>

Do any other members wish to speak?  No.</p> <p>  On my own behalf, we had a meeting of the Chairs yesterday evening and brought up the issue of extra sittings and the amount of work the secretariats do.  We all appreciate the mountain of work they do.  We share the secretariat with another committee and we have looked for another date.  The agreement from yesterday evening was that it would be looked at after Christmas.  It was suggested that there could be slots on a Monday and Friday for committees if people are interested or there was a slot on a Wednesday evening.  It has been decided because of the pandemic and the situation in the Houses, however, that it will be looked at after Christmas.  That is just to fill people in on what happened in that regard.</p> <p>  If there is no other business, this committee will adjourn until Wednesday, 8 December 2021 at 11.30 a.m. for a virtual private meeting to be followed by a public meeting at 1.30 p.m. on Thursday, 9 December.

The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss aligning disability services with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, in particular an update on progressing disability services.  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disabilities, Deputy Anne Rabbitte; Ms Patsy Carr, principal officer, and Ms Audrey Hagerty, principal officer, Department of Health; Mr. Bernard O'Regan, head of operations, disability services, Ms Breda Crehan Roche, chief officer of community health organisation, CHO, west, and Professor Malcolm MacLachlan, clinical lead for people with disabilities, HSE; and Mr. Niall Brunell, principal officer, Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p> <p>  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  If members are joining the meeting remotely, I ask them to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to contributing to the meeting.  For anyone watching this meeting online, witnesses are accessing this meeting primarily from this committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances, I ask that everyone bear with us should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  Before we commence formal proceedings, I must begin with some formalities and advise our witnesses on the matter of privilege.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I wish to advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.561" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#A00200"><p>I thank members for the invitation to appear before them once again.  The work of the committee is an important vehicle for making sure that the whole of Government looks at disability issues as a priority.  I am thankful for the work it has done, not least the work that was carried out in producing the report on aligning funding to the UNCRPD which we spoke to in the D&aacute;il last week.</p> <p>  To help ensure that our health-funded disability services are progressing to meet our obligations under the convention, this Government has acted to bring the different branches of disability together.  Early next year the disability policy functions currently in the Department of Health will transfer to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This means I will have all strands of disability policy under my remit in one Department.  This will facilitate easier collaboration and innovation in the delivery of services to persons with a disability.</p> <p>  More than 90% of people with disabilities are supported through mainstream health and social care services.  However, the 60,000 people who require specialist disability services will continue to be my responsibility in the new Department.  Transforming Lives currently is the major policy programme for services for people with disabilities.  This is a national collaborative effort to build better services.  My objective is to build a more responsive service model for people with a disability where greater flexibility, choice and control from the service user's perspective is central, progressively improving in line with the social model of disability and the UNCRPD.  Under Transforming Lives the focus is on developing individualised person-centred supports to enable people with disabilities participate to their full potential in economic and social life in the community and be enabled to live ordinary lives in ordinary places.</p><p> My opening speech is limited to five minutes and members have asked specifically about services, so let me give them a whistle-stop tour of where we are with the health-funded disability services.  I can provide additional details later if members wish.  Members will be aware that we recently published the disability capacity review which outlines capacity needs to 2032.  This report quantifies and costs future need for health-funded disability support services.  It is important to note the report quantifies this from a 2018 baseline and not a 2021 baseline, that is, the funding requirements as set out in the report are relative to 2018 expenditure, and not to 2021 expenditure.  An interdepartmental working group is now preparing the action plan for consideration of the Cabinet social policy subcommittee as soon as possible.  I understand our obligations under Article 4 of the UNCRPD and the development of the action plan that is currently under way was enhanced by a wide ranging consultative process undertaken by my officials in September this year.  I fully support the term "nothing about us, without us".</p><p> Budget 2021 provided more than &euro;100 million new development funds for health-funded disability services, and in budget 2022 a further &euro;115 million was allocated to these services.  This unprecedented level of funding serves to demonstrate Government&rsquo;s commitment to persons with a disability.  The main policy areas being developed with this record funding are: progressing children&rsquo;s disability services, which will see 91 children&rsquo;s disability network teams in place by the year&rsquo;s end.  This represents the most significant reorganisation of health and social care services ever undertaken in the State.  Under New Directions, day services assist and support adults with disabilities to engage in and be part of their community.  New Directions states that service locations should be decided with a view to enabling people with disabilities to be an integral part of the community rather than segregated or removed from the community.  New developments take the form of hubs from which people with disabilities are supported to access local services and take part in local activities.  The school leaver programme has seen 1,700 people profiled for offers of day service places this year, and preparations are under way for the 2022 class.</p><p> I am committed to allowing people to live at home with their families and loved ones as much as possible.  To support this eight respite centres have opened this year, with another one to open in early 2022.  This will add an additional 10,400 respite nights in a full year.  The HSE also provided 214 intensive respite support packages to children and young adults as well as alternative respite in the form of innovative in-home supports, sports or summer camps, holidays, or hotel breaks.  For 2022, the breakdown of service provision will be finalised as part of the national service planning process.  However, respite is a priority as the pressure it eases for families cannot be underestimated.</p><p> An additional 40,000 personal assistant hours are provided in 2021.  The HSE will deliver more than 3 million home support hours to 2,550 people for delivery of more than 1.7 million personal assistant hours to 2,590 people this year.  I have also ensured that the single biggest increase in funding will be made available for personal assistant hours in 2022, after allocating &euro;3 million extra for personal assistant hours next year.</p><p> This year 144 people were supported to move from congregated settings to smaller homes within local communities.  A similar number of people will be supported to move in 2022.  An additional 102 new residential places were provided in 2021 based on priority need, including 58 emergency places.</p><p> I am aware that colleagues are interested in the movement of under 65s away from nursing homes, as I am too.  Some &euro;3 million was allocated to the HSE-led pilot project in 2021 to assist 18 people inappropriately placed in nursing homes to move to more appropriate housing options in the community.  Budget 2022 provides an additional allocation of &euro;5.5 million to address the situation of such young persons.  The HSE is progressing work in this regard, including a survey and mapping of the records and wishes of existing under 65s in nursing homes.  It is envisaged that the mapping exercise will be completed by mid-2022.</p><p> I will pause here and hand over to the HSE but before I do, I would like to say that I am delighted to see my colleague and the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Michael Moynihan, join us this morning on the call.  I thank the Chairman for all the work he and the committee have done since it was set up.  It has been a huge asset and a benefit in creating not just awareness but in feeding into how policy is decided and delivered on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.564" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard O'Regan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to meet it today to address matters relating to aligning disability services with UNCRPD and, in particular, an update on progress regarding disability services.  I have recently taken up the role of head of operations replacing Dr. Cathal Morgan who previously attended meetings with the committee.  I am joined today by Ms Breda Crehan Roche, chief officer, community health organisation west, and Professor Malcolm MacLachlan, clinical lead for the national clinical programme for people with disabilities.</p> <p>  The UNCRPD requires that the rights and needs of people with disabilities are considered across all aspects of Government and its agencies.  It reflects the shift from a medical, paternalistic model of service delivery, to a model where citizenship, rights, will and preference of the individual are at the core of policy and service provision.  It puts the needs of people with disabilities at the core of public policy and the relevant service provision.  It has at its core that people with disabilities are citizens with the same entitlements as all other citizens and it challenges states to make the necessary legislative, policy and funding decisions so that people with disabilities realise that citizenship, that right to an ordinary life.</p> <p>  The HSE welcomes the transfer of functions from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as being an important enabler in ensuring cross-departmental and whole-of-government approaches to ensure that people with disabilities have equity of access.  HSE disability services are primarily focused on the specialist service needs of the 60,000 people with disabilities with complex needs requiring specialist services based on individual needs.  Some 600,000 other people with disabilities do not generally need access to specialist services, but require access to mainstream services such as primary and acute care, older person&rsquo;s services and so on.</p> <p>  The HSE corporate plan 2021&ndash;2024 commits to a vision of reimagined disability services to be the most responsive, person-centred model achievable with greater flexibility and choice for the service user.  It will support people with disabilities to live a full life in the community with access to a range of person-centred community services and supports across their lifespan.  Specialist services are provided within the context of Transforming Lives.  This is the broad policy banner for a wide range of other policies, including, but not limited to New Directions, Time to Move On from Congregated Settings, neuro-rehabilitation strategy and implementation framework, personalised budgets, progressing children&rsquo;s disability services and autism policy.  It is important to note that even though Ireland did not ratify the UNCRPD until 2018, many of these policies were developed in the context of, and aligned with, the UNCRPD which has set the strategic and operational direction for the services provided by the HSE and by providers funded by the HSE.</p> <p>   In operationalising these policies, the primary activities of the HSE include more than 1,000 people who transitioned from congregated settings to community based living arrangements in line with promoting inclusion and participation in community life, as well as 19,000 people who avail of day services in line with the 2013 New Directions policy that outlines that all supports available in communities be mobilised so that people have the widest possible options for how they live their lives and spend their time.  It places a premium on making sure that being part of one&rsquo;s local community is a real option and recognises that people with severe and profound disabilities may need specialised support throughout their lives.</p><p> Progressing children's disability, PDS, is a significant programme of reform that changes the way we deliver services and supports for children and young people with complex needs through 91 children's disability network teams.  The reform of services in line with the PDS programme is an integral part of Sl&aacute;intecare health reforms and is a key policy commitment in the programme for Government.  It provides a clear pathway and fairer access to services for all children and young people with disabilities based on their needs, ensuring that effective clinical teams work in partnership with families and education staff to support children and young people in reaching their full potential.</p><p> The personalised budgets demonstration project is an important initiative piloting a range of options for personalised budgets to inform Government decisions on the viability of various approaches in the future for those who wish to avail of them.</p><p> The national service plan sets out the HSE investment and reform programme year on year.  The HSE welcomes the significant additional investment in disability services of in excess of &euro;200 million over the past two years, which has been utilised to advance alignment with UNCRPD by increasing personal assistant hours to 1.7 million hours and home supports to 3.12 million hours; providing more than 8,000 residential places for those who need them and responding to urgent and emergency need but also developing planned options that prevent people from going into crisis; developing respite services and balancing increased centre-based respite with more innovative respite options, including intensive support packages, Saturday clubs, home sharing and contract families; establishing the digital and assistive technology committee to lead on the use of these technologies in promoting independence for people with disabilities; developing a neuro-rehabilitation service with ten additional beds in Peamount and two community network teams being established initially; increasing the number of staff in the children's network teams by 285 with a commitment to significant further development in 2022; and establishing the integrated steering group to oversee implementation of the recommendations of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report on under-65s inappropriately placed in nursing homes.</p><p> The HSE has embraced the "nothing about us, without us" concept of participation through a number of committees that have lived experience representatives and the establishment of a project to ensure that people with disabilities are fully included in decision-making and policy-setting within the HSE.</p><p> The national clinical programme for people with disabilities was established in 2020 with a specific remit to ensure the UNCRPD was implemented in disability and cognate clinical programme services.  Its governance structures explicitly reflect this.  There is also a focus on assisted decision-making implementation.  The HSE recognises that the 2022-24 disability action plan that is being developed will be instrumental in shaping disability services and aligning them further with the convention.</p><p> I acknowledge the commitment and dedication of staff, non-statutory service providers and partners in the work they do each day in providing supports and services.  The response shown in the face of Covid-19 and in pursuing a wide range of reforms gives us optimism for the future.  I also note the increasing challenge of staff availability at the same time as the increasing need for well-trained staff to meet the emerging needs in the most appropriate settings.  The HSE and its funded agencies have made significant progress while also acknowledging the areas for continued focus.</p><p> We are happy to address whatever questions the committee wishes to ask.</p></speech>

Before I go to members, I am aware that a large number of issues will be raised.  If necessary, could more detailed information be forwarded to the clerk for circulation to members?  We will know as the meeting goes on whether that is necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.567" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1671" speakername="Erin McGreehan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#C00300"><p>I wish everyone a good morning and thank the Minister of State and Mr. O&rsquo;Regan for their statements.  The Minister of State is welcome and I congratulate her on her work and advocacy in her role so far.  I also congratulate her on the Government&rsquo;s approval this week of the assisted decision-making (capacity) (amendment) Bill.  It is an important issue that this committee has been keeping an eye on and for which we have been pushing.</p> <p>  Although there are many issues to discuss, I will start by focusing on just one, that being the transfer of functions from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration, and Youth.  What is the reason for the delay?  Has the delay helped or hindered the Minister of State in her role over disabilities?  What about the budgetary handover as well as the transfer of accountability?  When can we expect to see the Bill being published?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.568" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#C00400"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  Members and everyone watching this meeting would like to know when the transfer will take place.  The Cabinet has approved the draft heads of the Bill handling the transfer.  When I was asked to become Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, I was asked to move the area out of the Department of Health and into the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  There is a &euro;2.2 billion budget, so it is not as simple as walking out one door and in another.  It is complex, not only in terms of staffing, but also in terms of the people whom we support, our arrangements with the HSE and our memorandums of understanding.  I thank everyone for being patient and allowing us to get to the point of the Cabinet approving the draft heads of the Bill.  The legislation will be drafted based on those heads and be laid before the Houses.</p> <p>  There are two important points to make about the transfer.  First and foremost, it has not impacted whatsoever on the delivery of services.  The reason we are transferring is to focus on the equality, inclusion, integration and rights pieces.  We all have health issues regardless of whether we have disabilities.  The area of disability is being transferred into the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to ensure we are looking at it through the lens of the UNCRPD.  Our vision is to have the transfer of functions done by the end of next March and for all budgetary positions to transfer with me so that by the time I arrive in the Department, the money and staff will have transitioned across.  The element that used to be in the Department of Justice has already transitioned.</p> <p>  Mr. Niall Brunell, who is joining me on the call remotely, is from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  In terms of the State draft report, decision support services and the legislation's drafting, I am operating as a Minister of State within two Departments.  I have functions within the Department of Health but I am operating within the other Department through the lens of inclusion and integration and with a view to people with disabilities.  March is the deadline and funding is coming but services have not been impacted.  We and the HSE have a good working relationship and the memorandum of understanding is being prepared.  The complexity of this will see two Ministers liaising with the HSE on the delivery of services in future.  It is a smooth transition and I can see it all happening.  To date, everyone has worked well together.</p> <p>  If I had transitioned on the first day, I would have missed the opportunity to understand the integrated role and value of primary care as well as the role of aids and appliances and the complexities in that respect.  That is what I have learned.  Once my memorandum of understanding is approved, I will be transitioning in the full knowledge of what we cannot leave out.</p></speech>

This is an important issue.  She mentioned the level of budget that was being handed over.</p><p>What will that bring to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as regards its budget?  I imagine there is a huge oversight change in the Department relating to that huge budget.  How do the two budgets compare?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.571" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#D00200"><p>Currently my budget is &euro;2.2 billion to &euro;2.3 billion and the whole purse in relation to disability is coming with me to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  It is a huge budget that is coming into that Department.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will be the senior Minister with oversight.  We will double the budget within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The full funding and staffing will transfer across to meet the needs of the expansive role of having the lens of working with the HSE and having inclusion, equality and participation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#D00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State and the HSE for being with us today.  I note that in the Minister of State's speech she referred to doing ordinary things and living ordinary lives.  That was a theme from one of our participants a number of weeks ago.  I have used it in speeches with the Minister of State since and it demonstrates that she is listening to the witnesses of our committee and to us.  I appreciate that and it is really good.</p> <p>  Senator McGreehan has talked about the transfer of functions.  Another passion of the committee, and one we are united on, is the ratification of the optional protocol.  I appreciate there is probably a disparity between the desire to get it in place and the Government's cautious approach of making sure everything else is in place before ratifying it, so we have a chicken-and-egg debate going on.  I ask the Minister of State's position on it, though I think we already know that.  What is going on with regard to the implementation of the UNCRPD?  What is happening on the ground?  Who is driving that?  Is it the Minister of State, who is our dedicated Minister for disabilities?</p> <p>  If I have time, I have questions for the HSE on autism and the letters that go out to families about their child moving under PDS and children's disability network teams.  Those letters tell people they have up to 40 or 48 months of a waiting list.  Are the people drafting those letters engaging with the seriousness of what is in them?  Do they consider the impact on a family receiving such a letter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.573" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#D00400"><p>I thank the Senator.  I am repeatedly asked about the UNCRPD and the optional protocol.  It is a programme for Government commitment.  However, when we did the programme for Government we were in a space where we had sight of a timeline for going before the UN, which was mid-2022.  That does not seem to be the timeline at the moment.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and I are still committed to ratifying the optional protocol, even before it has been seen by committee, for a simple reason.  As I said last week in the D&aacute;il, we must ensure all Departments are on line so we can exercise all options.  When I talk about exercising all options, there are certain things we as a state need to ensure.  If people take their actions further when it is fully ratified, we will need to have all the State mechanisms in place.</p> <p>  The Senator asked a valid question about whether I am doing all this myself.  Absolutely not.  I am working with the various steering groups, including the disability steering group, and the national disability inclusion strategy, which is made up of parents, carers, academics, advocates, designated public officials and umbrella organisations.  The current iteration of it is the fifth disability stakeholder group, or DSG 5, and we are in the process of formulating DSG 6.  That is where members of disability steering groups sit with representatives from all Departments.  I chair it on a quarterly basis.  That is one part of the umbrella.  Under that, each Department has a disability committee, where they meet regularly with members of the disability steering group.  That feeds into and formulates the policy to ensure every Department is working at pace and, when the report is lodged and submitted, the State is in a position to ratify the optional protocol.  That is where we are working on that at the moment.</p> <p>  It is important to note the legislative work going on in relation to the decision support services and the decision amendment Bill that is coming before us.  These are crucial pieces.  Wardship is being abolished.  There are many layers within it.  Everybody is working in a parallel process to ensure that we get the State report submitted and that we are then on track to have decision support services operational and in a position to ratify the optional protocol.  "Nothing about us, without us" is the method of it and that is where I am working with the various groups.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.574" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#D00500"><p>I am thrilled that people with disability voices, who are best educated to talk about the lived experience and to influence that, are being listened to and are influencing Department representatives.  I assume they meet more than quarterly.  The Minister of State said she chairs it quarterly, which implies there are other meetings.  How frequently do they meet?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.575" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#D00600"><p>They could be meeting monthly in some cases.  Education meets frequently, as do justice and social protection.  There is not one Department that does not show up to the national disability inclusion strategy quarterly meeting.  The engagement of the Department representatives who attend with the DSG is wholesome, practical and about what they are doing.  This is an opportunity for the umbrella organisations, parents, carers and designated public officials to hold Departments to account.  They come before me quarterly and, in the meantime, they meet to work through what they have set out as their goals for the next quarter with various officials.  This is at a high level and feeds into circulars and implementation plans.  It is no different from how policy in the Department of Health filters across to the HSE and how they deliver it across various community and network teams.  It is the same for education and justice.</p> <p>  I talk about the Office of Public Works, OPW, all the time because we have the most fabulous monuments but sometimes we cannot access them.  That is a clear practical piece.  The role the OPW has played for me has been heartening, as has the role the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has played.  We have seen how that has fed in to the recent Housing for All policy document.  There is a section on disability and that is because persons are participating from Departments and the DSG.</p> <p>  I have to give the shout-out in relation to employment.  We have a comprehensive employment strategy but, while we have people from the T&aacute;naiste's office participating, we all know employment is a huge issue.</p> <p>  The Senator can see there is an emphasis on a cross-departmental, whole-of-government approach to ensure that when the State report is lodged and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and I want to bring forward the enacting of the optional protocol, each Department is up to speed and in line.</p><p>The most important thing is that the system is in place to ensure that all systems work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.577" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#E00200"><p>That is great.  If there is time for the HSE to reply in respect of the letters, I would value that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.578" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard O'Regan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#E00300"><p>Those letters are certainly considered.  The reason they are issued in the way they are is to be compliant with the Disability Act and to link to the service statements.  We have to provide a factually accurate estimate of when a service might be in place based on the point in time at which the letter is being written.  In order to address that, with the substantial investment in additional posts, the restructuring of the service into the children's disability network teams and the building in of the requirement that service statements are reviewed on an annual basis, we will look to improve that situation over the coming year in order that those letters are followed up by additional letters that improve the timelines for people.  We are very conscious that when those letters issue to families it is not reflective of the direction and model of service we are working very hard to be able to implement, which is around people being able to access essential therapy services as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.579" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#E00400"><p>That is not indicated in the letters.  Nobody sees that.  Another side of it is that where parents are engaged, there is such a turnover of staff that parents start all over again with the next person they are dealing with.  People go on leave, which they are entitled to do and I am not in any way commenting on it, but no replacements are put in for them.  There seems to be a difficulty in recruiting people for short-term placements to cover maternity leave, parental leave or whatever permutations of leave are required.  Whole spaces of time go by where there is no service, then someone else comes in and that parent, or organisation, has to go back over the whole story.  It seems that there is a mismatch.  On the one hand, one cohort of parents is receiving these letters, they are then operating and sharing information in communities, which then state that this is what will happen, and parents have this process repeat, they have to start all over again and tell their story again.  There does not seem to be a handover of files or a centralised understanding for each child, with his or her plan and access to information.  A parent should not have that disheartening thing of "Oh God, here we go" and the process starts again.  We need to hear how that is being planned around.</p></speech>

There will be opportunities to come back on those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.581" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#E00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State and the HSE representatives for coming before the committee.  Their opening statements made reference to the progressing disability services programme intended to reform services and supports for children with disabilities through the creation of the children's disability network teams.  In particular, Mr. O'Regan's statement claimed that the programme provides "fairer access to services ... based on ... needs, ensuring [that] ... clinical teams work ... with families and with education staff to support children and young people", but I have to conclude from the accounts of multiple parents who have explained their situations to me, and those of people who come before the committee, that progressing disability services is currently a failure.  It is as simple as that.</p> <p>  In September, 41 children were waiting for initial contact with the west Cork children's disability network team, CDNT, 11 of whom have been waiting less than four months, while 30 children have been waiting between four and eight months.  To give one example from the very many constituents who have contacted me about this, one child with autism spectrum disorder has received one hour of occupational therapy and one and a half hours of speech and language therapy in the 15 months since the child's assessment of needs.  Some families can afford to pay for this privately but when we are talking about early intervention, it should not come down to who can or cannot afford it. </p> <p>  The committee has discussed a case in Cork where young people will not be able to access spaces in special classes in secondary school because the CDNT will not be able to make the recommendations in time.  I know the representatives cannot discuss individual cases but I am citing these as evidence of the failure of the progressing disability services programme to date.  I do not expect the HSE representatives to comment on individual cases but the teams obviously are not sufficiently staffed.  Promises of staffing next year are not good enough for the children who needed interventions yesterday, or 15 months ago, not to mind over the coming months.  Staffing next year will not address that.</p> <p>  I have a long list of constituents who have major issues with the shortcomings of the CDNTs, as I am sure all public representatives do.  I will contact those constituents later today with the HSE response.  What, if any, assurances can the HSE representatives give that these issues will be addressed?  The HSE previously offered the committee a visit to a community children's disability network team, but it was one of its choosing.  I have been trying for months now to meet the west Cork CDNTs.  I ask the Minister of State to help me arrange that.  </p></speech>

I will invite Professor MacLachlan to also comment on it.  The nature of the reform and change we are engaged in as regards children's disability services is very significant and is one of the most significant reform programmes.  The reorganising of the children's network teams, which will be completed this year, is a major shift in trying to reconstruct how services are delivered in order that they are fair and equitable.  That has to be accompanied by expanding the size of those teams and increasing the staffing on them.  Significant additional posts were allocated for this year, which are being put in place.  There will be additional increases next year, but it is also about introducing new ways for those teams to work, such as the standard operating procedure we have introduced in order that people can have their needs assessed as expeditiously as possible and that we can get into the space of intervention and aligning it with the assessments that need to happen.</p> <p>  This is one of our most significant priority areas.  Colleagues in community healthcare organisations, CHOs, CDNTs and nationally are working in alignment with one another to effect the changes that are needed.  It is in order to make sure that we have a system in place where the kinds of issues the Deputy identified become redundant, we have a service model that is easily accessible, one that is not reliant on families having to use resources in order to access private services, and that the system is equitable.  Professor MacLachlan might want to comment further.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.583" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Malcolm MacLachlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#E00800"><p>I thank Deputy Cairns for her question.  We all share the frustration expressed by her constituents.  It is one of the reasons we have been motivated to develop a completely different approach to providing services to children with disabilities.  As she knows, the basis on which people previously accessed services was often to do with the area they lived in, what school they attended, how rich they were or the nature of their disability.  The design of the CDNTs is supposed to create a situation where there is equal opportunity of access.</p> <p>  I suggest that the PDS approach is working.  For instance, in considering the preliminary team analysis, which is being incorporated as part of the assessment of needs procedure, an intervention is immediately recommended for 86% of the children assessed through that process.  To give the Deputy an idea, prior to the introduction of that standard operating procedure, people were sometimes waiting for four or five years for an assessment and there was a subsequent waiting list for the intervention.</p> <p>  We certainly acknowledge that the teams are not yet fully resourced.  The Minister of State has been very successful in getting funding to support the resourcing of those teams.  There is also a pipeline issue.  We need more therapists across a whole range of different specialties.  Unfortunately, it is not a matter of us being able to immediately resource all teams fully.  We need to identify the pipeline of producing and educating people and not merely in the traditional approaches that have been taken.</p><p>The CDNTs are very much focused on the ethos of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, which emphasises interdisciplinary working and moving away from a sort of deficit medical model and so on.  That also requires a change in work practices among the various clinicians.  We share the Deputy's frustration but we are committed to the idea that this is the right way forward.  It is certainly compliant with the CRPD and I submit that it is already showing very encouraging results.</p></speech>

I cannot say that I can see those results on the ground yet.  It is not the experience of families.  Professor MacLachlan stated the design is for equal access and that it is working, but it is not.  That is not the experience of families.  As I stated, there is a family who got a diagnosis for their child 15 months ago and have received, overall, two and a half hours of essential therapy.  Professor MacLachlan referred to the previous five-year wait.  That is an incredibly low bar.  The case to which I refer is pre-assessment of needs.  He referred to more recruitment of therapists next year.  The reality is that nothing will change in the next year.  People will continue to wait and will have to pay privately, so it is not equal.  Only people who can afford to pay who are getting the services.  Are we at a point where we need to, at the very least, be honest with families in respect of the wait they are facing, rather than those families just being kind of fobbed off by the CDNTs and not hearing back from them, with all the energy and effort that goes into trying to get these services when they are literally not available?  Is it high time to at least acknowledge that and, in the meantime while staffed teams are being built up, maybe consider supports that could be provided in the context of subsidised care in the private sector because that is the only option that people have at the moment?  For some people, it is not an option because they simply cannot afford it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.588" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Breda Crehan-Roche" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#F00500"><p>I thank Deputy Cairns.  As regards the children's disability network teams, this is a significant Government change and change programme.  There will be 91 teams in operation by the end of the year.  Some of them are already in operation.  For example, this has been ongoing in CHO 3, covering the mid-west, for several years.  The teams will be there.  It is not an excuse but there is no doubt the pandemic has affected delivery.  Yesterday, I chaired a meeting.  The information we saw was very encouraging, as my colleague, Professor MacLachlan, just stated.  The whole premise of the progressing disability services programme relates to putting the child and family first.  It is very much a move away from the medical model.  When the teams are operational, there will be local implementation groups.  Families are very much part of that.  It is important that they have a voice and it can be heard.  If there are issues, we need to address them.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the commitment of the Minster of State and the Government to this programme.  The resources provided have made a significant difference and will do so in future.  We are very aware that these are children's formative years and so important.  We are working closely with our colleagues in education.  The good news is that the 91 children's disability network teams are coterminous with the primary care teams.  That is really important because, in the context of therapists and so forth, my colleague, Professor MacLachlan, referred to the fact that we need to train more therapists and retain them.  The commitment from the Government and the additional funding will certainly help in that regard.  There is a significant amount of change and we are seeing good progress.  We need to be in partnership with families because we recognise that the family knows their child better than anyone.  The Deputy is correct that we need to have that honest conversation.  We will see more of that as we go on.  There is certainly great commitment, passion and energy around the whole progressing disability services programme.  A very different picture will be seen next year as the teams bed down.  We are currently seeing significant progress.  Although we cannot comment on individual cases, I am sure my colleague, Mr. O'Regan, will take that up with the CHO in question and the head of service there.</p></speech>

She asked me a direct question.  She asked whether I can help her to set up a meeting.  I will bring her up to speed.  I am currently meeting with the lead agencies.  In CHO 4, the main leads are Enable Ireland, CoAction and COPE.  Ms Crehan-Roche will correct me if I am wrong.  We do not have any HSE organisation in CHO 4 delivering services; my understanding is that it is all outsourced to those lead agencies.  I visited Cork in July but to address the particular point raised by the Deputy, I am meeting CoAction, which covers the area to which she referred, as a lead agency on 9 December.  I have no problem raising the queries the Deputy has put forward and about which I will meet her to discuss after the session.  I also have no problem in going down to west Cork to meet a group if that would help to facilitate or alleviate the issue.  I have no doubt that Ms Crehan-Roche would ensure any supports I need from a HSE point of view will be put in place to facilitate my going down to west Cork.  There are many pieces to this puzzle.  I am clear in my commentary on this.  Communication is the most important piece with parents.  There is a need for up-to-date communication.  I think it was Senator Seery Kearney who stated that sometimes the line in the paper does not truly reflect where things are at.  I will meet CoAction on 9 December.  I have no problem facilitating a meeting with the Deputy in west Cork or taking up the particular issues she has on her desk.  We all agree that 15 months is a long time.  We will try to get to the nub of the problem.</p></speech>

I really appreciate her offer and I look forward to the meeting.  I welcome that the HSE is considering having that kind of honest conversation with families, rather than allowing them to be consistently fobbed off by the system when there are not sufficient numbers of staff in place, as is currently the case, and we are looking at next year.  In the context of the allocation of staff, I wish to highlight that an area of which I am aware and which has a big population has an allocation for the CDNT of the equivalent of 0.5 nurses.  We need to be more ambitious in terms of staffing allocations if our hope is that this issue will be rectified next year, when, as Ms Crehan-Roche stated, all the staff will be embedded and bedded down and all that stuff.  I do not see how half a nurse will be sufficient for a network team to service an area.  All of these promises have been made to have all the staff and everything set up next year, but if there still is not enough staff allocated, we will be back here having the same conversation again.  I wish to highlight the issues in respect of the allocation of staff going forward.  The families with whom I have been dealing will be disheartened they will not be getting the service until next year but they would prefer honest engagement in respect of the fact they will not be receiving it until then.  We need to consider supporting families who need help to get the private interventions they desperately need.  Those private interventions cannot wait.</p></speech>

Her passion for this subject and her grasp of the issues is always very heartening for the committee.  There is another area I wish to ask about but I will first pick up on the issues raised by Deputy Cairns.  I have a specific question in that regard.  Examples have been given of people's lived experience.  Every day when I drop off my children, I meet a mammy at the gates who really needs occupational therapy for her six-year-old boy.  Obviously, she would prefer to receive it in the public system and can ill-afford to pay for it privately but she has been prepared to do so.  She cannot find anybody in the Dublin area who will take on her child and is on a waiting list for a private occupational therapist in Naas.  That is the reality of how difficult it is to find a person to do that kind of early intervention.</p><p>The Minister of State spoke about interaction with other Departments, including in the context of Housing for All.  Has there been interaction with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and his Department on how we can open up that pipeline and ensure that we have suitably trained service providers?  It seems that not only are those people not in the public system, they are not in the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.593" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#G00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for that question.  She is dead right.  If I had all the money in the world in the morning and I wanted to hand it all over to the HSE, we could not recruit because the people are not there.  There is an issue with the supply pipeline.  We are all drawing from the same pool of people.  I refer to the gamut of services, including primary care, private practice, disability services, services for older people and acute services.  We might have only 400 occupational therapists coming through on an annual basis and they have the pick of the services.  Hence, there is movement of staff from disability services to primary care to acute services.  People can move up the ranks quickly because there is a such a shortage of staff.  The Deputy asked whether that conversation happened.  The answer to that question is "Yes".  Was it productive?  It was, very much so.  I have also met the leads in the areas of occupational therapy, physiotherapy, CORU and the universities to engage in this conversation.  There is an appetite to increase the numbers and to work more closely within health to provide work experience, give people the opportunity to participate and to provide longer placements.  That could be used as a buffer while we are bringing more people on stream.</p> <p>  If I had my wish in the morning, I would like to recruit individuals from the various faculties who could populate my PDS teams.  I could have an additional speech and language therapist who could do an extra placement with clinical supervision.  Professor MacLachlan might comment on that with respect to occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists.  I would have extra people in our services.  A positive aspect of that is it would give them good experience and, hopefully, they would consider returning to work in disability services.  Perhaps we could then consider bringing in alternative grades of progression to retain people in disability services.  There must be a career pathway within our teams.  We have not even got to the stage of having that conversation because we are work to ensure we have enough staff to fill the vacant posts.</p> <p>  We are losing staff to our brothers and sisters in the HSE, be it in primary care services, services for older persons or acute services.  We need to increase our capacity in terms of our intake of people and I am having that conversation.  Professor MacLachlan might like to comment on the provision of work experience, similar to what is being done with third-year and fourth-year student teacher who gain experience as substitute teachers.    We would have more of an intake to have those people within our teams.  It would help our capacity in the context of delivering services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.594" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Malcolm MacLachlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#G00300"><p>I agree with everything the Minister of State said.  Deputy Hourigan hit the nail on the head in that there is a great need not only for more training but also to train people in different ways.  The Minister of State alluded to the importance of interdisciplinary training.  Having been involved in training, I can advise the Deputy that, conventionally, people are trained in fairly narrow ways within their own disciplinary blinkers, so to speak.  When they qualify, they have to learn how to work effectively with other disciplines.  We need to adopt a radically new approach to the training of people.  Such an approach would ensure that those training to be occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, psychologists or whatever would all train together from the get-go and when they graduate, they could hit the ground running and know how to interact with other people effectively.  There may be opportunities for direct placements in the final parts of people&rsquo;s training to support the children's disability network teams, CDNTs, more effectively.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the importance of people having a career path.  Much work could be done in that area.  One aspect of this approach is encouraging.  Because we are offering people the opportunity to work in interdisciplinary teams, we will not have the situation we had some years ago where a person who graduated, say, as an occupational therapist might have worked alone and that could have continued for ten or 15 years.  Now, people will be in a more supportive environment where they will be able to be more effective in delivering services.  We want to strongly convey that disability is a great area in which to work.  This is a very exciting time to come into it.  Considerable investment is being put behind the whole ethos of the PDS and implementing the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.595" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#G00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State and Professor MacLachlan for those responses.  I am going to sidestep into another area, although it is related to multidisciplinary primary care and all of that.  I want to raise the issue of home care supports and their availability.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to statutory home care provision.  If people have a chronic illness or long-term disability, the level of training home care workers would benefit from is quite important.  As we move towards implementing that statutory entitlement and the provision of more home care hours, what training is being set out for those who work in that area?</p> <p>  Given some of the reports we have seen in recent months covering the sad and distressing incidents that have occurred, do the Minister of State and the HSE recognise the need for safeguarding legislation?  What do they envisage to be the interaction between largely privately supplied services and community healthcare organisations, CHOs, as we move towards the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare?  What is their view on the need to be able to interact in a dynamic way?  I hope home care will be a major provider and support for people into the future.  If it is to work, it will need to have quite dynamic access to services and integrated communication between that service and the primary care system.  How do they envisage that might work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.596" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#G00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for that question.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who has responsibility for older persons, is leading the work on the safeguarding legislation.  I met her as recently as last night to discuss the matter.  I will be feeding into that process.  I will be focusing on the legislation through the lens of disability.  Before coming to this meeting, I confirmed that there will be funding for it from our side to ensure that we are feeding into the work on it from a policy point of view.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is leading on the legislation but she will not be all alone in that task.  We will be supporting her in respect of it.  I welcome any work that is being done on that legislation.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct in what she said about the statutory home care scheme.  We need to train people and provide them with particular skill sets in order that they can deliver home care and home support.  If training is required, it needs to be at that level.  We are dealing with people who have various issues and we need to be able to react appropriately.</p> <p>  We cannot use the same brush to cover all individuals who are in receipt of home care.  We have increased funding for it.  I would like to hear the HSE's response in this respect.  The answer to the Deputy's question on this scheme is "Yes".  We need to have varied proper training and a more uniform delivery of statutory home care provision.  This relates to a memorandum of understanding on the integration of services between older persons and disability.  If the Minister of State with responsibility for older persons is leading this scheme, we need to ensure the approach is not such that a person seeking support would be told they are not old and therefore that person will not get it and that a person who has a disability will get that support.  We should not make that differentiation.  We should recognise it but there should be a good relationship to ensure that families should not feel they are in a particular category.</p></speech>

With regard to home support, I very much welcome the Government&rsquo;s commitment to home support and home care packages.  There has been great investment in it, which is welcome.  That is fantastic.  We are finding it difficult to recruit workers.  We have the money to recruit but it is matter of getting the people.  We need to consider innovative ways to recruit.  We are competing with the private sector in this area.  Sometimes we recruit and as a result of that the private sector loses people.  We must make sure the service users are looked after.</p> <p>  On assessments, there is a standard assessment tool.  InterRAI is also being used in respect of older persons.  As chief officer of CHO west, I have responsibility for people with disabilities.  I also have responsibility for older people and for a number of other community supports.  We are excited about all of this.  In terms of the market, we need to consider how can we recruit and retain people.</p><p>The big thing is this is around Sl&aacute;intecare.  This is Sl&aacute;intecare in action.  This is about enabling people to live their choice, their will and preference to live good ordinary lives in their community.  We are working with them to do that.  Sometimes the funding is there.  Unfortunately, the manpower is an issue and we have to start looking at that now.  There are all kinds of innovative ways of looking to do that, but certainly it is the bedrock of community.  Where people want to live in their homes, we need to be there and support them to do that.  That they will direct that care is the important part.</p><p> In answer to the question, there is a standard assessment tool.  That is for equity and fairness.  That would be based on need, which is fair.  It is very much based on will and preference and that the person will be enabled to live at home in his or her own home if he or she wishes to do that.</p><p> It also applies to some of the people under 65 who are inappropriately placed in nursing homes.  With the packages of care, the Ministers of State, Deputies Rabbitte and Butler, are passionate about this area.  There has been significant investment and I commend and congratulate the Government on that.  It is certainly the way forward.  It is around avoidance of hospitals as well.  Sometimes people go into hospital who would not if there was that home care package.</p><p> It is an exciting time.  We are here discussing disabilities today, but I would say the enhanced community care and the integrated care programmes for older persons are about keeping people out of hospitals, helping them to live their choice of life, looking at their needs and enabling them in their will and preference to do that.  Certainly, the resources are there.  Manpower is an issue.</p></speech>

A privately supplied employee might not be aware or have suitable training to allow the person whom he or she is supporting to access further services.  If the person that employee is supporting needs occupational therapy, for example, through the public system, we need to ensure the training is good enough that a privately supplied care worker has the full complement of information to be able to access those primary care services.  I want to flag that for people.</p> <p>  I have a quick question for the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  Has there been any consideration within her brief of the issue of long Covid?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.600" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#H00300"><p>There has.  I met with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, on this.  We have done some research on long Covid as a disability but I can go no further than that today.  "Yes", is the answer.  There is work going on behind the scenes on that.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in particular for all the updates she has given us thus far.</p> <p>  I would like to ask the Minister of State for information on respite, in particular, when it comes to decongregation of residential respite.  I work closely with Stewarts Care in Palmerstown which offers incredible residential and holistic care to people with disabilities who need support to be fully independent.</p> <p>  Many of my constituents have children with special needs, some of whom may be adult children who would benefit considerably from respite care.  When you look at the assessments of need that are being carried out in my area of CHO 7, the demand for assessment is considerable.  Approximately 50% of those assessments are coming from requests for children who may have autism.  Looking forwards, that is a significant allocation of resources when it comes to future-proofing for their needs.  In particular, I am thinking of those children going through the system of assessment who in the coming years would benefit, as would their families, from residential respite care.</p> <p>  This is something that has been committed to from a decongregation perspective under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and in the programme for Government.  It is also important given the ageing population we have and how many adult children with special needs rely heavily on ageing parents.  That is the backdrop to my question.  Perhaps the Minister of State would give me some detail on what progress is being made by her and her time at the HSE on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.602" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#H00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for that question.  On decongregation, there were 144 persons assisted to be decongregated in 2021, 143 are planned for 2022 and there were 126 in 2020.  That is the pathway in relation to decongregation.</p> <p>  When we talk about decongregating, we are always looking at the challenges within it.  These are not only the properties but the moving of people who in some cases have complex needs.  I refer to the transitional piece of coming from their current home and going to their new home and the need for extra staff to allow that transitional care piece to take place.  For example, St. Patrick's in Kilkenny did it very well and very successfully with the support of the HSE when the pandemic was at its highest.  Housing is a significant issue in that regard.  There is steady progress all the time.  I would like to be more ambitious.  Under the disability capacity review, our action plan and our framework, perhaps we will see a more accelerated pointed approach to achieving what is expected of us because we have to acknowledge that we have people living in settings that are not suitable.</p> <p>  The Deputy's next question was on respite.  It is something I talk about constantly.  It is one of the core pieces within the programme for Government and my Ministry.  The HSE and the Department are supported in recognising that.  I have to recognise the Ministers, Deputies McGrath and Donohoe, for funding me for the simple reason that I need to create capacity.  The Deputy is correct.  We have different levels where creating capacity is needed.</p> <p>  The Deputy has spoken specifically to the layer relating to autism where we have behavioural challenges.  In fact, due to other sensory needs, such as noise, it might not be possible to use a respite house.  Normally, it might be for four people, but if there is somebody with very high behavioural needs, it might not be possible to have it at full capacity.  We are looking at more innovative alternative ways.  I visited Swords recently and was heartened to see the development they had there.  They had a fabulous respite house which I officially opened, but when they were showing me through, they brought me to the back end - the annexe - which had its own front door where, in fact, it would support an individual who had autism or high-functioning needs.  While it could be part of the house, it was separate.</p> <p>  It is that piece of modelling that I highlight.  We have to become more innovative.  We need to look at creating that layer within.  I recognise parents need that support.  That is why we have 10,000 additional respite bed nights built in to 2021 and we will see more coming on in 2022.  What we will see in 2022 is the guts of another nine respite houses coming on, two of which will be for children with complex needs, with one for those with Prader-Willi syndrome.  We will see then, depending on the demographics and the needs of the area, where we are with that piece of alternative respite to support people with autism.</p> <p>  I was fortunate in the budget this year.  I will have a pilot project coming on to look at where the key performance indicator, KPI, is not always death but is instead that serious emergency, and that is with a view to supporting ageing families.  I thank the Department for its support on it, and the HSE with which we are engaging in that conversation.  The pilot is about how we can have that lower level intervention to support people to live within their communities but that is more supported independent living.  They can still attend day service, they can still attend work but they need that oversight.  The families I think of need to have the peace of mind that their family member has transitioned to move on.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>

I commend Stewarts Care in Palmerstown in my constituency.  It is leading the way in the context of what the Minister of State has just described.</p> <p>  It is great to hear about nine new respite houses coming on stream.  The Minister of State may not have the information to hand today but I would be interested to hear about the geographical spread of those houses.  My sense of things in CHO 7 is that we are underserved and whatever additional resources we can get for children's services like occupational therapy, speech and language therapy as well as residential and respite care would be greatly appreciated.  Such services are greatly needed and I am glad to have the opportunity to put that on record.  I thank the Minister of State and ask her to provide more information on those nine respite houses if possible.</p></speech>

It is a children's respite house.  I do not know the exact location but will revert to the Deputy on that.  Regarding Stewarts, I met a representative of the organisation yesterday, Ms Deborah Jacob, to discuss CHO 7 and we had a good conversation about our children's disability network teams.  I am hoping to have further discussions with CoAction on 9 December to understand how many children are on their teams, the staffing capacity, the staffing shortfalls and the sick leave and annual leave situation.  I want to find out who is in the red box category, whose files have been opened, who has received a phone call and who has received nothing at all.  I plan to get into that level of detail because when we have the information, we can inform parents.  There must be a collaborative approach between the lead agencies, the HSE, public representatives, parents and the Department, and I will do my duty in terms of threading it all together.  Yesterday was my first experience with CHO 7 when I met Ms Jacob and Stewarts Care and I thank them for their support.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy, there is a respite house in CHO 7.</p></speech>

We are building centre-based respite services that we know are really valued by families and which afford them essential breaks.  We are complementing that with other respite options as well so that in the future we are not just creating an assumption that centre-based respite is the only option and that residential services are the only option for people.  We want to have as broad an array of options as possible for people, depending on their individual needs.  That is the approach we are trying to take.</p></speech>

I am going to change the emphasis for a few minutes, if I may.  The Ombudsman issued his report this week on transport supports for people with disabilities, called Grounded - Unequal access for people with disabilities to personal transport schemes.  This did not happen on the current Minister's watch or even on my watch.  Approximately nine years ago a number of transport schemes that were in place to support people with disabilities were suspended and new schemes were put in place.  The Ombudsman writes:</p> <blockquote> 	Living with a disability in Ireland in 2021 should never mean that a person is grounded in their home, unable to participate equally and actively in their community and in work.  Another working group or action plan is not enough. Those people who are adversely affected by the current lack of access to transport supports require immediate and decisive action.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I hope this commentary provides a timely reminder to legislators and policy makers as to the urgency of progressing work so that we are not looking at this issue again in another nine years.  Progress must now be quick and comprehensive. </blockquote> <p>I raise this issue in the context of the earlier conversation about the transfer of responsibilities from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  While that is going on, I fear we will have a situation whereby these schemes, which were being reviewed and redrawn in recent years, are left in abeyance until the transfer process is complete.  Then the question is which Department takes responsibility for them.  The Ombudsman is saying that two schemes in particular, namely, the motorised transport grant and the mobility allowance, are with the Department of Health.  He also commented on the primary medical certificate scheme which the Department of Finance has been looking at since a Supreme Court judgment delivered in 2020.  Work is being done on that scheme in an attempt to clarify matters following that court case.  The aim is to develop a new scheme but that has been going on for quite some time.  The Department of Finance has indicated that it is in consultations with the Department of Health on the matter.</p><p>Does the Minister of State know the current situation in that regard?  Is it still stuck in the transfer or is somebody actually working on it in the Department of Health?  Some people are getting no support while others have support.  The situation is both unequal and unjust but it could be solved fairly quickly if we put our minds to it.  I do not know who is responsible for this area now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.608" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#J00600"><p>The Deputy is correct that it is a function within the Department of Health.  There are two elements to this issue.  We all know the primary medical certificate function sits within the Department of Finance.  The role of the Department of Health in the context of the primary medical certificate is to carry out the assessments through community-based primary care teams.  The Department has an assessment function but does not have a funding function.  The court judgment that was issued in June or July of 2020 clearly stated that the underpinning legislation needs to be looked at.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has written to the Department of Finance to ask the Minister to start that review process.</p> <p>  Regarding the other two options within the Department of Health, a working group was established by the then Department of Justice and Equality under action 104 of the national disability inclusion strategy to review transport supports, encompassing all Government-funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, and that is ongoing.  The Cost of Disability in Ireland study is another piece of the jigsaw.  The two schemes to which the Deputy referred are the responsibility of the Department of Health, but conversations about them are happening with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Both Departments have been involved in a review over recent months.</p> <p>  Since I came into office, I have also met the Minister for Transport to discuss ways to expand transport schemes.  We have discussed the deployment of new buses that meet our accessibility criteria.  I have also been discussing the unequal piece to which the Deputy referred, whereby some people have the mobility allowance while others do not.  I accept it is unjust and unequal but it is being reviewed.  A new scheme is being prepared.</p></speech>

This is mainly for people who are unable to access public transport.  The aim is to provide them with a vehicle they can use or which someone can use on their behalf to get them out and keep them mobile.  My concern is that the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are involved but it is not clear which Department will take the lead on the issue.  When will we have a new scheme in place?  That is what the Ombudsman is seeking.  We need to get a new scheme up and running.</p> <p>  There are discussions about the other scheme going on between the Department of Finance and the Department of Health, but is the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth involved as well?  Which Department is taking the lead on it and which one will bring forward the schemes?</p><p>With the transfer from one Department to another, I am afraid these things will get lost in transit or be delayed because something has not happened where the Ombudsman is looking for urgent action.</p></speech>

We will have to consider that again.</p> <p>  We talked about early intervention.  The Minister of State will know that when parents are told their child has autism or some other condition requiring supports, they find themselves in a haze because they do not know where to go.  There is no pathway that they can follow.  It is hard for them to get into the system.  The information is very disjointed.  There is no co-ordinator or caseworker to deal with them and walk them through every stage of what must be done.  They are just told they will be referred to somebody else for an appointment.  This has caused many problems and much anguish and stress for parents.  Especially given the unknowns parents face, we should consider providing caseworkers that will bring them through the whole process and explain the reason for any slowdown in it.  It is a matter of having a co-ordinator, caseworker or liaison person so parents will understand the process.  Parents are often told things that go over their heads because they are so taken up by the fact that their child may have a special need.  It is traumatic in its own right.  It is important that we try to co-ordinate in this regard.</p> <p>  Let me refer to another area I find a little difficult.  The recruitment process to replace somebody on maternity leave does not start until she is gone.  This results in a gap.  With a bit of planning, we could ensure replacements for those going on maternity leave or taking leave of absence are recruited in advance so as to have a smooth transition and a handover of cases to the person filling in.  I find the gap frustrating.  Maybe the Minister of State could consider tightening up how we manage these things.  Parents find it very frustrating.</p> <p>  That is basically my commentary on the matter.  I thank the Minister of State, my colleague from Galway.  I thank Ms Breda Crehan&ndash;Roche and the other staff for the work they do, which I acknowledge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.617" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard O'Regan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#K00800"><p>I thank the Deputy.  With regard to case co-ordinators, we recognise that any supports we can provide to families as they try to navigate the system are really important.  One of the pieces of work we are doing at the moment with colleagues is to develop the key worker role within the service teams so somebody will be assigned to families to play the role in question, recognising the importance of help with navigation for families.</p> <p>  The second thing we are doing, which concerns autism initially but which will relate to all areas of service provision, is developing the websites and information pathways for all users who need them, including families, staff and the public.  The objective is to have easily accessible and clear pathways for accessing the system.</p> <p>  On the recruitment of staff, two points arise.  First, on resources for backfilling, particularly in respect of short-term replacements, it can sometimes be a challenge for agencies just to get clarity on what resources they have available.  We will continue to work to try to expedite decisions in that regard.  Second, it is a challenge to fill temporary posts and backfill part-time posts when there are so many challenges in filling permanent posts.  There is no doubt about that.  It does impact on service continuity, unfortunately.</p></speech>

They are being funded.  We are taking a step forward in recognition of the role of key workers.  Where there are team leads with full teams beneath them, we will be funding the maternity positions.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is undoubtedly playing a pivotal role in the new configuration of disability services.</p> <p>  I want to query PA services, the congregation, the optional protocol and the transfer of the portfolio.  I will get straight into it.  I would like to ask Mr. O'Regan about the PA service.  He mentioned the additional budgetary allocation in the past two years of 1.7 million personal assistant service hours.  He also mentioned a figure for home support hours of 3.12 million, which is almost double.  Based on all the delegates' statements, the consensus is that the aim is to transfer disability services from a medical model to a social model.  How does Mr. O'Regan envisage that happening when the majority of funding is still being funnelled into home help?  Is it the case that he genuinely believes home help is aligned with choice and control and will and preference, or does he believe the PA service is more aligned with these principles?  PA services offer disabled people what they want when and where they want it while home support provided by an organisation can at times be far more restrictive.  The latter often dictates when someone gets up in the morning, eats, showers and goes to bed at night.  Although all this is happening outside the confines of an institution and in the person's own home in the community, it is, in a way, institutionalisation.  The services have a place within a broader regime of supports but can place limits on young disabled people's lives.  It can be quite astonishing to hear at first hand that people are being put to bed at a time that is not suitable for them and with which they are not satisfied.  How can we justifiably continue to fund the less empowering and perhaps less UNCRPD-aligned service when advancing alignment with the UNCRPD is the ultimate goal?</p> <p>  Could the Minister of State outline how central the PA service will be in the new configuration of interdepartmental services?  How does she envision the shift away from paternalistic home help to a PA service that genuinely offers the choice, control and empowerment that are enshrined in the UNCRPD?</p><p> Regarding decongregation and specifically around funding, I would love to seek explicit confirmation on how many of the 18 congregated settings that were mooted to be transferred into community settings this year actually were.  More critically, in a response to a parliamentary question, I was informed that between allocations for transferring under-65s from nursing and decongregation in 2021 totalled just over &euro;7 million, of which only &euro;1 million was spent.  Can the witnesses commit to that &euro;6 million in unspent funding being a roll-over and ring-fenced accruing amount that will not merge back into the &euro;115 million additional funding announced for budget 2022?  This is extremely important.  If I take one thing from this meeting, I would like it to be that.  The disability capacity review recommends that 150 settings be transitioned yearly up to 2030 if we are to truly decongegate.  We have significantly missed the seven-year target set in the Time to Move On from Congregated Settings report.  We are in a situation that is as bleak in terms of independent living as it was almost a decade ago.  What funding and preventative measures are being implemented to stop disabled people being accommodated in these inappropriate settings to begin with?</p><p> The optional protocol is the elephant in the room.  It has felt like that since the UN special rapporteur presented to the committee.  He stated as clear as the light of day that the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act and the decision support service were not prerequisites for ratification, as the Government has claimed.  The transfer portfolio is one and a half years behind schedule and the personalised demonstration pilot is three years behind schedule.  The Minister of State stated the transfer will be finalised by March of next year.  Could she confirm that the optional protocol will be ratified at least by the second quarter of next year?  I reiterate the special rapporteur's point that it should have been ratified at the same time as the convention was ratified.</p><p> The Minister of State said the transfer could have happened 18 months ago.  If I am not mistaken, she said in the Chamber recently that she will not transfer the portfolio until such time as she has full access to the budget.  This raises several questions.  Having consulted my disabled persons' organisation, DPO, on the matter, it made the point that this decision was not necessarily within the remit of ministerial power.  Regarding discussion with DPOs, as per Article 4 of the convention, I appreciate how complex the transfer is but I hope the articles are being honoured in the protracted process.  As the Minister of State said, "nothing about us, without us".  Was whatever rationale was used to guide the decision to delay the transfer informed by direct lived experience?  I invite the Minister of State to come to Clare and meet with our local DPO, the Clare Leader Forum, and clarify the questions it has.  It has relayed to me that it does not necessarily feel represented in the disability participation and consultation networks.  This committee received correspondence from the Minister to state that the delivery of services provided by the HSE section 38 and 39 organisations and for-profit organisations will remain the remit of the HSE.  If this &euro;2.2 million is staying within the HSE, which is contrary to what the Minister of State said here this morning, can she elaborate on this conflicting information?  If the budget and delivery of specialist and mainstream services will remain within the HSE, why has the transfer taken 18 months?</p><p> I return to the information provided relating to the nine respite houses to be opened in 2022.  I am seeking clarification of one of those will be in CHO 3.  I also appeal to the Minister of State to ensure these centres are located in areas with appropriate infrastructure.  For example, I am aware of one centre mooted for Clare that is in a very isolated area with no access to public transport.  This is a major concern for everybody involved in that so I wish to highlight it here.  I am very glad the Minister of State is here today to shed some light on these matters, which are of grave concern to everyone on this committee and all disabled people and their allies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.621" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard O'Regan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#L00200"><p>Regarding the Deputy's questions about home support, PA services and where the priority rests, in terms of alignment with the UNCRPD, there are a few different things that are not indistinct from each other and need to overlap.  The increase in PA hours over the past two years, which will be increased again significantly in 2022, is the direction we are looking to go with the support of the Minister of State, the Department and the Government in terms of increasing the range and amount of PA hours that are available.  This is in recognition of the importance of this service to people.  It does need to be aligned with other pieces of work such as agreeing exactly what the definition of that service is.  The way the Deputy articulated it and the way I understand it would be in common but there is no clear policy.  It is something we have agreed to progress over the next year.  We are also developing some mechanisms so that there is a common way of assessing and determining how the use of those hours is done on an equitable basis across the CHOs and we have good mechanisms for governance and administration of it.</p> <p>  Regarding home support hours, I understand the Deputy's point about the limitations it can place on people.  The challenge for us is to recognise that those home support hours are very important for people.  We must work with the providers to make sure they are provided in a way that is in line with the UNCRPD so that they are not limiting services to people but instead are enabling services to people.  We need to work towards that.  This is something we have been discussing as part of the work we are doing on the disability action plan referred to by the Minister of State.  We have been discussing what needs to happen to make sure all of the services are aligned with the UNCRPD.  That is not just about the new services we have put in place; it is also about existing services where culture, practice or delivery might need to change so that they are aligned with the UNCRPD.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked some questions about decongregation.  Does the Minister of State wish me to deal with some of them?  Does she want to go first and I can come in after her?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.622" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#L00300"><p>The Deputy's principal question was about the under-65s.  At that point in time, the answer she received meant that there was what looked like an underspend of &euro;6 million from the HSE point of view.  I am looking over at Mr. O'Regan asking if the Deputy is right.  He has reassured me that at the beginning of this month, 12 out of the 18 transferred for the under-65s.  I know for a fact that one of them happens to be in CHO 3 where we are being more ambitious than we should because technically it should be two per CHO.  I think a house is being developed down there and is working with Limerick County Council.  That might be a bit slower but the project in Limerick is a really informative piece regarding how we can work with councils and bring property on stream.  To answer the Deputy's question, we will meet her target by the end of that year but of the two, I am ring-fencing the piece within Limerick.  We will have three when the project is completed.</p> <p>  The ambition for decongregation is 144.  We are currently at 95.  Mr. O'Regan has assured me that we are on track.  That figure is accurate as of the start of this month and we still have two months left to go.</p><p>I do realise that just one year after coming into the post we had to transfer over a few that did not happen because of the way Covid happened, but it actually followed through early in January.  When we set those targets, it does happen.  They have to happen.</p><p> With regard to what is going on with under 65s in 2022,  everyone here believes in the will and preference, and the right of people to live where they choose to live in their community, with the support mechanisms that meet their needs.  I believe it was Deputy Hourigan who earlier brought up the understanding required of the person who provides that home support, and whether they know also what is going on to meet people's needs within the community.  That is all being worked out at the moment.  We have budgeted for 63 people, which is four times the number of under 65s to move to 2022.  That brings all of its own challenges because it is not just about the individual.  It is also about the care package that is required and the considerations about the properties, and whether it is in the home.  That is all being worked out.  At the same time, we are mapping the need of those people who are currently in nursing homes to see where they are medically best supported, while respecting their choice and preference.</p><p> I met with the Clare LEADER forum last August, along with Deputy Crowe and Senators Dooley and Conway.  My door is open at all times to anybody who wants to make contact.  I am probably one of the most approachable and inclusive Ministers of State that one could meet.  I have no problem with that at all.</p><p> On the piece about the transfer of functions, it is a technical movement.  The government level of responsibility for policy development and oversight of disability services, including budget, is moving from the Department of Health to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It does not mean that the functionality of what we do day in and day out, or anything within that, is changing.  My relationship with delivery of services and with the HSE will continue.  The biggest piece that is changing within it is the reporting mechanism for the HSE to two line Ministers.  That is a huge piece changing within it.  In the past, they only ever had to report to one Minister, and now it is two Ministers.  The Deputy is right that the HSE will continue to fund services for section 38 and section 39 organisations, and private providers, under the service level agreements.  Other than that, there is no change whatsoever.</p><p>Senator McGreehan asked earlier about what the policy funding looks like.  While we were on the meeting I received a response that my budget is &euro;2.3 billion, and the Department of children and youth affairs' budget is &euro;1.9 billion.  I will be the bigger sister in the relationship when I move into that Department.</p><p> This gives the committee an understanding of the volume and the complexities of it.  On the delivery of services, however, nothing changes.  We will be looking at it, most importantly, in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the inclusion and equality participation, and a person-centred approach.  I cannot say this enough.  It will be about the person-centred approach at all times, and not just through the medical model.  The approach will be about the whole of the person.</p></speech>

On the issue of the under 65s in nursing homes, in addition to the transitions this year and the transitions that will happen next year, and the mapping that is going on as referred to by the Minister of State, there is also other work going on in pursuit of the recommendations of the Ombudsman's report, including looking at areas around integrated services.  This is not just about how we support people to move from nursing homes to a home of their own choice, it is also about them being able to access the range of primary and other supports they may wish to access.</p> <p>  On the question about respite allocation and making sure that it is used properly, at the moment the position on next year is that a draft of the service plan has been submitted by the HSE to the Ministers for consideration.  Once that is approved we will then be in the position where we will be able to confirm the allocations to the chief officers in the community health organisation areas for their plans.  I absolutely agree that if respite is being developed, wherever it is, it must be something that is beneficial for people.  If it is being set up in isolated locations that do not afford people the opportunity for social connections and all of the opportunities they might want, that is not the model of respite we envisage or is of benefit to people.  I hope the committee will be assured that we certainly would not intentionally go in that direction.  We are trying to go in the opposite direction to make sure people have every opportunity for social participation.</p></speech>

It cannot just be about coming inside the gate of the four walls.  It also has to be what the community has to offer and it must be about participation within that community.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that in CHO3 in 2021, we were very fortunate to open a respite centre there for children with complex needs called St. Gabriel's. They had an operation level agreement of five days per week.  To be fair, when I was there at the official opening, where I was joined by Mr. O'Regan, we also committed to ensuring that this would meet a seven-day commitment in 2022.  This is a fabulous service in the mid-west for children with complex needs.  It is a state-of-the-art facility and a signpost for other CHOs to go to see and to mirror.  Deputy Wynne is very fortunate that it is in her CHO.</p></speech>

In a previous role I was the knowledge management lead for the UN partnership on the rights of persons with disabilities.  We worked across more than 30 countries looking at issues such as ratification and the adoption of the protocol.  Quite a lot of countries ratified and then adopted the protocol but actually do not have the means to deliver on that.  Even though Ireland's ratification was frustratingly slow, it has shown that it has been very genuine in that we want to put things in place to deliver on what that sort of commitment means.  It is the same with the optional protocol: having the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act fully implemented is very important.  It is key to recognising that the optional protocol is not a fast route to solving any of these things.  The members might be aware that the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the UN takes several years to process submissions.  Submissions made through the optional protocol route have sometimes taken four or five years to actually come back to the country, which then has to address them.  I do not think it is a case of either-or.  We should definitely be doing both.  Focusing on the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act will give people their rights more quickly.  In parallel we should be pursuing the protocol, but implementing the Act is key.</p></speech>

I have worked on this function along with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman for the past 18 months.  We secured funding not just in one budget but in two budgets.  With the legislation coming before the children's committee, the pre-legislative scrutiny on it, and also the fabulous work being done by &Aacute;ine Flynn in the decision support service, we are on course to have it up and running by next June.  There is complete momentum.  Regardless of where I sit, the work is being done to ensure that we hit our targets as laid out for us.  I was joined by Niall from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  He is within the remit that is working on that legislative piece.  Himself, Carol Baxter and the team came over from the Department of Justice at the start of 2021 to ensure that this work would be done so we can have that whole-of-government approach with the services in place for the people.  The most important thing is the services are in place.</p></speech>

We need to be really clear that it is not an either-or situation.  I mean that we should hear that there is a value in the operational protocol and we might get immediate results from the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.  From the committee's perspective, we have been really clear that we think both should be progressed simultaneously.  As the Minister of State has said, there are two pieces in the form of the legislative piece and support services.  I ask her to confirm that the services to deliver the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act and the legislation are being developed in parallel and to confirm that when she talks about June she is talking about both of those things.  June is later than we had heard; we had expected it to be in the first quarter, I think, of next year.  Then the service supports would start but all the time the optional protocol keeps getting pushed ahead.  From our perspective, as the Minister of State will be aware, the optional protocol does not add a new law.  It simply gives people a tool to vindicate the rights that they already have and are in the UNCRPD.  It is a way of holding to account.</p> <p>  As the Minister of State has said, there is a long process on the optional protocol and individual cases involved but it is also part of our contribution globally.  The committee members, who are responsible for implementation, were very clear that there is a duty to build up good case law.  When an individual takes a case, under the optional protocol, he or she will also contribute to the building of good case law so that how the UNCRPD is interpreted in different countries can learn from these kinds of cases and examples.  It is a collective raising of standards globally.</p> <p>  I am a little concerned that we have not got a clear date.  We had previously heard January for the optional protocol ratification and we have also heard June.  We need to know that the optional protocol will be ratified at the minimum by June but, ideally, in the first quarter of next year.  We also need to know that the assisted decision-making legislation will not just be concluded by June but we will, in fact, have the services ready to go immediately.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on that and then I might come in on a couple of the other questions.  My question on the optional protocol is really important so I look forward to her comments.</p></speech>

They work completely in parallel.  The decision support services are working away in the background and will be open for business, hopefully, in June 2022.  I have always said June 2022 for the opening of the decision support services.  I must compliment Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn and her team, and I must compliment what Mental Health Reform is doing, in terms of this.  There is really good work being done in the background on this.</p> <p>  I hope that we will be before a committee very soon to have pre-legislative scrutiny on the legislation that is required.</p><p>Some new elements are being introduced in the Bill.  These include tweaks to how things will operate to ensure a smooth process.  Officials are engaging with the Attorney General on issues in the Departments.  We will need to ensure they are in line.</p><p> I do not have a date for its ratification of the optional protocol.  The June date relates specifically to the decision support service and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  I see the Senator shaking her head.  I ask her to hold on for two seconds.  I have always said the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and I are happy to ratify this before the UN review of the report.  The report is going forward.  Professor MacLachlan explained the process really well.  The Minister and I are very open to ratifying the optional protocol even before the UN reviews the report.  I want to be very clear with the Senator on that.  Both Ministers in the Department are completely willing to ensure that happens.</p></speech>

It only just happened at the end and that was also with a Minister who was committed to the area.  The Minister of State will understand that it would be really unacceptable if June were to pass without the optional protocol having been ratified.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.635" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#O00300"><p>Absolutely, but I again reassure the Senator that the officials are engaging with the Attorney General on the optional protocol.  It is essential that we ensure that the State and all of its agencies are in line with that protocol because, as the Senator has talked about, it involves a system and we can learn from it.  That is why we need to enact it but I need to ensure that every system within our Departments and semi-State bodies is ready for it.  I am not holding back but trying to get everything moving at the one time.  The Senator completely understands the complexities involved.  It is a commitment in the programme for Government.  I know exactly how frustrating it can be but I cannot commit to a particular date at this moment in time.  It is a priority behind the scenes, however.</p></speech>

It shows progress in moving forward.</p></speech>

One of the key ones has been touched on.  I refer to the scale of the move from congregated settings and the fact that there has had to be prioritisation in respect of the new residential places rather than all who need them being accommodated.  The transition of those who are in situations we know to be inappropriate still seems to be happening on an incremental scale.  There has been no massive move forward.  That is a frustration we constantly see.  Pilots are run and then programmes are rolled out incrementally instead of there being the sea change we need.</p> <p>  I will bundle three questions together.  One relates to gaps in the service.  One of the problems in the transfer is that the focus can be on transferring existing services, which may push addressing some of the gaps further down the line, which is a concern.  Specific gaps highlighted to this committee involve myalgic encephalomyelitis specialists and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  A really important issue is that of adult autism and ADHD diagnosis.  There is no public pathway to get such a diagnosis.  In moving the pieces that already exist about, we see that there are missing pieces.  This is an opportunity to get this right.  Will the Minister of State comment on those services?</p> <p>  I will add in two or three other pieces.  I will comment on the issue of respite and something that came up when I used to work in the area with older people.  It is a good practice to consider if a massive expansion of respite services is planned.  I refer to the co-location of respite with day services.  This can allow for a continuity of social contact and the relationships that people who occasionally use respite services may have in day services.  </p> <p>  I will also comment on emergency respite for families.  An issue that has come to my attention is that, in the same family, there may be an individual who has particular needs but another family member may have a crisis.  Families have crises that are not related to the member who has a disability.  There is a very long lead-in time in accessing respite which means it may not be possible to respond to an emergency need.  I know of one case where one child in a family needed full-time care but another child was dying of an illness.  The family could not access any emergency respite to allow the child who was dying to be at home.  They were not able to balance the care.  I will just mention that example if this is an area under review.</p> <p>  Others have spoken about the intersections with other Departments.  It is clear that the Minister of State is passionate about her brief but I worry that it is still not being taken up in the same way across other Departments.  In engaging around the national development plan, I was recently speaking to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  We had a very good interaction on many aspects of the national development plan.  However, on the area of disability, he said that I would need to engage with the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We need to really progress universal design within the large-scale infrastructure going in at the moment.  The State is going to do more building in the next five to ten years but universal design is not understood as a standard we should meet in delivering infrastructure.  Will the Minister of State comment on that because this is the chance to get the inclusion piece right?</p> <p>  On the children's disability network teams that are being set up, there is a real concern about gaps that are forming.  We all know that putting a new system in place can be time-consuming but a big concern, particularly for young people, is the developmental years that are being lost.  Existing supports, which may be patchy and which include supports delivered through schools, may be chipped away at or not replaced or staff within them may not be replaced because something else is coming in.  That something may be better, but it is coming in two or three years down the road and these spaces may be lost. </p> <p>  I have commented on a load of things.  I have too many bits of questions.  Does the Minister of State have comments?  Will she comment on the wider question of how she sees shifts pushing across other Departments?  Frankly, even a supplementary budget of &euro;200 million is very small.  We need to be seeing full active inclusion reflected in the budget of every Department and in how they plan their work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.639" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#O00700"><p>I thank the Senator.  I will ask my colleagues in the HSE to answer some of those questions or to assist me in delivering answers to them.  On the gaps, the disability action plan addresses some of them.  However, we are aware that more needs to be done.  On adult autism assessments, we secured funding in budget 2021 to commence this process.</p> <p>  The Senator raised an issue which is critical to disability being addressed through a whole-of-government approach.  I refer to interdepartmental working.  When the national development plan was being developed, I took it upon myself to write to every individual Minister to ask them to disability-proof their submissions to the plan.  When the budget was coming up, I wrote to every individual Minister to ensure that their budget submissions and applications for funding were also disability-proofed.</p><p>The Senator is correct, in that significant infrastructural changes are coming down the track.  That is why there is an entire section on disability in the housing policy introduced by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It covers everything from universal design to adaptations in order that people can stay in their homes and be supported.  That is in the intersectional piece.  I have yet to find a Department that does not let me in the door when I knock.  They all want to work together.  The Senator is also correct, though, in that there needs to be more understanding and awareness of what universal design and inclusion really entail.  We spoke about getting houses for the under-65s and supporting them.  We would be better off building those houses from the ground up because that would provide for universal usage.  It would be a home, but one that could be repurposed within the community.</p><p> I will hand over to Mr. O'Regan to pick up on whatever points I have forgotten.</p></speech>

There is no intention, nor would it be appropriate, that there be any dilution of what has been a hard-earned and hard-fought for investment in those services.  We are clear that that should not happen.</p> <p>  I will ask Professor MacLachlann to comment on the question on gaps in services.  In the development of the clinical programme, we have sought to ensure that those elements of service that are not on the radar, for example, specialist service needs, are comprehended by and incorporated in our clinical structure and included in our planning.</p> <p>  Ms Crehan-Roche will comment on the Senator's question on the availability of emergency respite so as to provide some understanding from a CHO perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.642" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Breda Crehan-Roche" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#P00300"><p>The Minister of State alluded to how respite can be residential, home sharing, day breaks, contract families or summer camps.  There is a broad church of respite.  We know that respite is very important because it enables families to continue caring for their loved ones.  It helps them if they know that they can get regular breaks.</p> <p>  Regarding emergency respite, the Senator cited a sad example and I was sorry to hear of what happened.  Respite beds provide people with breaks for a number of nights or weekends or with planned respite.  However, this is usually trumped if emergency respite is required.  When I was CEO of Ability West, it was sometimes the case that a person who was in on planned respite had to give up his or her place to assist an emergency placement if a family was in crisis, allowing the family to get that valuable respite service.</p> <p>  Sometimes families are unable to keep going.  We must recognise that Covid-19 has had a major impact.  There was an impact when respite was not able to run to its capacity.  Unfortunately, some families must make a tough choice because they cannot take their loved ones home.  That impacts on respite.  We work with the HSE nationally and make funding bids in respect of emergencies.  Where we can, we will provide additional supports.  Sometimes, it is in the non-statutory sector.  It could be in section 38 or section 39 organisations, the private sector or HSE services.  The list of respite services is valuable.  It is important that people have equity and fairness and get the supports they require to enable them to continue caring for their loved ones.  Respite is a broad church.  In respite in the home, people go in and give families a break.  There is home sharing where families are trained to take someone as a guest into their homes.  We have contract families where families are contracted to take in emergencies.  There is a wide range of respite.  I am very familiar with respite in Community Healthcare West, which covers counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.</p> <p>  I hope I have helped the Senator.</p></speech>

I am concerned at the idea of it taking a year to arrive at a definition of "personal assistance".  According to everyone we have heard from, it is one of the most crucial elements.  We should aim for a definition by June.  Will the witnesses clarify whether disabled persons organisations, DPOs, and those who use personal assistants will be central to any definition if a more formalised approach to personal assistance is taken?  I sometimes worry because so many of these services are contracted out.  We have seen in home care that people are contracted out to perform certain tasks and roles.  It is important that the discretion and empowerment component of personal assistance and home care be in place and that we not end up with a contract being issued for this volume of services or those kinds of task.  Will the witnesses comment on their plans to ensure that DPOs are central to any formalisation of the definition of "personal assistance"?  That would be useful.</p> <p>  I will make a final point to the Minister of State.  I appreciate her comments on the national development plan.  The housing element is very much focused on new housing but people with disabilities can also be renters.  I will press this issue with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, this week.  I hope that the Minister of State will follow up on it in a different way, though.  Where people who are renting need to make adaptations to their homes, they should not lose their security of tenure.  We should push for the adaptation and retrofitting of homes to be a combination deal in order that people can retrofit for the environment and universal design at the same time, as it makes sense that this option should be offered to people.  We know that people are sometimes afraid to seek adaptations of their dwellings because they are concerned it will lead to them losing their security of tenure.  This is a practical issue and I do not need it to be addressed now.  I only wished to highlight it.</p></speech>

I apologise if I have misled the committee.  What I meant to say was that it was one of our pieces of work to complete in 2022, not that we will take the whole year to do it.  It is something that I hope to do earlier in the year rather than later.</p></speech>

It is important that we have that work completed by then.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about specialist services.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.647" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Malcolm MacLachlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#P00800"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  I will quickly go through the issues she raised.  She spoke about adult ADHD services.  A pathway has been established for adult ADHD.  It was developed on the mental health side of the house.</p><p>Work is now developing on child ADHD services.  We hope that work will be done across the two clinical programmes for mental health and disability.</p><p> Work has been ongoing over the past year to develop a new protocol around autism.  We will trial that protocol in four different CHOs, starting in January.  The Senator also mentioned a couple of issues around diagnosis.  It is important to point out that in compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, the disability services push a needs-based approach.  As the Senator will perhaps appreciate, two people who could be classified as being autistic may have completely different experiences of autism and, therefore, the sorts of services and supports they need can differ quite dramatically.  It is certainly the case that many people could identify different diagnostic categories and say that something should be developed specifically for those diagnostic categories.  In line with best practice and the UNCRPD, we are trying to develop a needs-led approach so that the interventions are available considering what is required to support people, rather than by a particular diagnostic category. </p><p> The Senator also mentioned gaps in the children's disability network teams, CDNTs.  In the past month, our human resources within the disability services have undertaken an audit so that we are aware of exactly what sorts of services are provided, as well as what sorts of gaps are currently in place across the CDNTs.  That will be one of the rationales for allocating the new posts.</p><p> Mr. O'Regan mentioned the work on specialised services and the clinical programme.  With all of our committee work on the clinical programme, we have lived experience involvement in that.  The specialised services are being developed so that the CDNTs are supported when there are particularly challenging issues.  For example, full expertise may not be available on the teams.  Importantly, that expertise is going to in-reach to the teams, rather than referring than somebody out of the teams and creating a logjam elsewhere.  The CDNTs are a specialised service.  There will be further specialised support on a tiered level to in-reach, to allow the CDNTs to be as effective as possible and to ensure that the person who is receiving the service is getting the service from the same people rather than being shunted from one place to another.</p></speech>

It is important to say it at this point.  One of the most progressive things I have seen as part of the PDS roll-out is that we have abolished the ageing-out aspect.  That piece, in which a child fell off a cliff-edge at six years of age and had to start again, is now gone.  That was one of the gaps that we identified and it has been removed.  That is an important, integral piece of our PDS.  The other piece in the rolling out of the PDS, as Ms Crehan Roche has said previously, is that our network teams will overlap with the primary medical centres.  We are going to have 91 network teams.  We have 96 primary care teams.  That will ensure that geography is not a barrier and there is service throughout the country.</p> <p>  Finally, sometimes when I watch Twitter or when I listen to colleagues, people tell me about all the gaps in the services.  Within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, along with Ms Baxter and Mr. Brunell, I sought and secured funding.  That funding will ensure that I do a mapping of services.  It will not map services relative to the HSE.  It will take into context where we have disability providers, respite, day services, adult education that is being supportive and employability programmes across the country.  It will be an integrated system where people will be able to get a one-stop shop.  It will cover what is nearest to them, what suits them, and who they can contact.  We should not just look at this as a health model; we should look at a whole-of-person model that takes employment, housing, education and health into account.  That funding was secured in budget 2022.  They are working on the pilot.  At the moment the Department is creating its tender to go out.  It will be ready in 2022</p> <p>  We are hoping that the mapping will dovetail with national ASD programme board, so that we will eventually end up with a one-stop shop for disability.  We first need to map to find the gaps and signpost.  That is the plan.  That great work is going on between both Departments.</p></speech>

They were supposed to be established by the end of June.  We are now being told that they will be established by the end of the year.  I note that some are officially established, but that there are still delays in transferring information from one service to another.  We have discussed the gaps' previous speakers have brought those up.  A couple of issues have been being brought to my attention in respect of some CDNTs, specifically about parents being able to obtain an updated educational placement recommendation from their team.  This is required for a child to enter a special class or to enrol in a unit in a secondary school.  Most enrolments take place this month.  They are being told by the CDNT that they will not receive this until January or February.  I wonder if this could be dealt with.  I am sure that this is just due to a staffing issue, but maybe it can be dealt with this year and, hopefully then, it will not arise again.</p> <p>  Many people are bringing up with me, as well as my own colleagues who are hearing this in their own constituencies as well, the issue of services and interventions not being provided.  Instead, parents are being given training by, for example, speech and language therapists to help their children.  Parents are not trained therapists.  They are having major issues with this.  They are being told that this is all they will get and that there will be no intervention for the child.  I hope that down the line there will be invention and that a therapist will be provided.  At the moment, the parents are being left and they are getting no assistance for the child.  Parents are happy to take this course to assist the child, but the child needs professional help.  Could the Minister of State deal with that? </p> <p>  Some would say that assessment of need is sufficient to identify the needs of the child and provide support.  However, if a child wants to gain access to an autism unit, they need an official diagnosis of autism.  They are being told that.  If they do not have this diagnosis from the assessment of need process, where do they get it?  Do they have to go down the line of paying privately?  That option is not open to many people, even though they are being forced down that line anyway.  In addition, some are receiving interventions but they are not receiving them on a regular basis.  Someone compared this to going to the gym.  You need to go on a regular basis.  You need to go every week, or a few times a week.  It is no good to go once a month.  Perhaps the Minister of State could answer some of those questions.  On the assessment of need, we were told that the backlog was only 500 in the summer; now it is 4,000.  Could the Minister of State explain what that is about?  How is that going to be dealt with?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.652" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Malcolm MacLachlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#Q00500"><p>I am happy to answer and I thank the Vice Chairman for the questions.  Interventions should be provided by professionally trained therapists.  Again, however, we are trying to be consistent with the UNCRPD.  Many years ago, when I trained in psychology, there was a model whereby if a child had a problem, her or she would come into a clinic.  I would sit in a room with him or her and have an intervention.  We have realised that this is not the best way to do things; the best way to do things is for the clinician to go to the child, to work in the community and to work with the family of the child.</p><p>The parents have knowledge that clinicians do not have.  It should never be the case that families feel that this is just being handed over to them, but that parents are key interveners in their children's lives.  We need to get the balance right.  Parents need to feel supported and that there is a distinct intervention provided by the therapist.  That intervention has to overlap with what the parents can do.  The therapists will be there for a very short time and then disappear.  The fidelity of implementing what has been suggested lies in respecting the opportunities that parents have to interact with the child, which the therapist does not have.  It should not feel like handing over but like collaboration.</p></speech>

I will have to follow up on that with colleagues and I will revert to her on it.  We will certainly look to make every effort that we can so that there is no impeding the progress of children or their ability to access a service because they are waiting on a report.  We will look at anything we can do to expedite that.  I will talk to colleagues to see how we can progress it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.655" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021112500002#R00300"><p>To follow up on what Mr. O'Regan said, I have a concern about the matter the Vice Chairman raised.  It is not the first time that I have heard it.  I have heard it numerous times.  Correct me if I am wrong, but the health model is a needs-based delivery programme.  It is for children who wish to access various levels of education, whether at a national school or when transitioning from national to secondary school.  There is assessment and diagnosis.  As Mr. O'Regan said, when a child comes in front of the teams, the first matter is an assessment of what the correct intervention is.  Any children coming before our multidisciplinary teams could require numerous interventions, including occupational therapy, physiotherapy or speech and language therapy.  It could take a while to have an overall diagnosis of what that child needs.  The priority should always be intervention.  I have always said that I want to get away from assessment and to intervention.  We seem to be tethered by how the education system is run, which seems to be based on assessment and diagnosis that provides an SNA or access to a special class or special unit.</p> <p>  The Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for special education and I will have to form a working group and to gain a clear understanding of what the Department of Health does with regard to disability.  I would especially like to understand what the role and responsibility of SENOs are.  What is their understanding of the delivery of units, classes and access to education?  Every child has a constitutional right to education and at no stage should a barrier be put in place since they have not received an assessment.  We will take on board everything the committee has said, but our priority is providing timely interventions.  It is critical that the HSE is held to account.  At the same time, there is no point in laying the blame at one Department's door when there are other players on the stage.  Everybody has a role to play.  I will engage with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, about this, but I reiterate that I am concerned about this.  It is a barrier to children.</p> <p>  In the Cork area, there are significant issues in this regard.  Only yesterday, I had a call about Dublin 2 and Dublin 4 with my party colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, and Deputies Bacik and Andrews.  We had this conversation.  Children are being told that they cannot access school places in the coming year.  It is time-sensitive because they do not have an assessment.  We are now formulating our teams and the files have to be turned upside-down because we have to give priority.  Those families need a pathway to education.  Work needs to be done on this and I will not shy from that.</p></speech>

We need clarification about their role.  The National Council for Special Education's website indicates that SENOs are supposed to support children and their families.  I do not want to tar them all with the one brush.  Some are excellent.  I have met many in my career.  Some are almost like guardians for the Department of Education, which is ridiculous.  They should be fighting for the child and for whatever intervention or assistance the child needs.</p></speech>

There is willingness to support the family, child, individual and the school.  There seem to be stumbling blocks.  There are different geographical locations where we are hitting barriers, which we need to peel into.</p></speech>

It is important to note that neither the Act or the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act use the word "diagnosis" anywhere.  A convention has been developed where schools have requested a diagnosis.  Part of the reason for that is so that they can make a stronger case for getting an SNA.  It is not always the case.  SNAs can be appointed without a diagnosis.  There are many challenges with these relevant Acts but this is, in my view, a misapplication of the Act because the word "diagnosis" does not occur in it.  As the Minister of State said, it would be great if we could get alignment between the practice in the Department of Education and the change programme that we are all embarked upon.</p></speech>

I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off.  If they are not switched off, there will be the usual consequences, whatever they are.  The contributions of members who speak from positions in the room that do not have microphones cannot be included in the Official Report.  Members also need to have a microphone in front of them if they are outside of the Chamber.  For the purposes of the Official Report, I have been requested to identify members when they are called to speak.  Members are requested to remove their face coverings when speaking to ensure their contributions can be adequately and clearly recorded.  I welcome members and viewers who may be watching our proceedings on Oireachtas TV to the public session of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  For this purpose, the parliamentary precincts are considered to be the accommodation assigned to the member in the Leinster House complex or its vicinity, or another location in Leinster House or Leinster House 2000.  I ask the members to note that they may participate remotely in proceedings held in public only from the locations listed earlier as privilege to their utterances only applies when participating from these locations.</p> <p>  On behalf of the select committee, I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and his officials.  To provide for the smooth running of the meeting, any member acting in substitution for a member of the committee should formally notify the clerk now if they have not already done so.  Divisions will be taken as they arise.  Members must attend in person in the committee meeting room for divisions, although they may attend the meeting remotely.  Members attending this meeting in accordance with Standing Order 106(3) should be aware that, pursuant to the Standing Order, they may move amendments but cannot participate in voting on that amendment.  If you are not a member, you can move an amendment but you cannot participate in the voting.  I now invite the Minister to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

This section and the other sections just approve that agreement in Irish law.  I will just go through a couple of points on this section, which will probably deal with the issues with the overall Bill.  I have outlined Sinn F&eacute;in's view on the changes to be made to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, under this agreement.  Some of these are positive and some are not.  Some could cause serious issues in accessing different credit lines.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in, and the Irish people more broadly, have a view on this.  We are all too familiar with the conditions and austerity that were placed on the Irish people as part of the financial assistance programme following the crash of 2008 and 2009.</p> <p>  In this legislation, we see reforms regarding the memorandum of understanding on the precautionary credit line.  This is replaced by a letter of intent to be submitted by a member state.  In submitting that letter of intent, the member state would outline its main policy positions, which would then be assessed by the Commission.  Despite symbolically abolishing the memorandum of understanding and replacing it with this letter of intent, the eligibility criteria are hardened so much that they effectively kill the instrument and put it out of reach for most European countries.  That is the core concern we have in respect of this agreement.</p> <p>  Under Annex III, an ESM member qualifies for the precautionary condition credit line provided it meets the following criteria.  It must not be under the excessive deficit procedure, it must have a general government deficit not exceeding 3% of GDP and it must have "a debt benchmark consisting of a general government debt to GDP ratio below 60% or a reduction in the differential with respect to 60% over the previous two years at an average rate of one twentieth per year".  We have made the point that some of these criteria are outdated.  Indeed, the ESM itself has suggested that the criteria need to be changed and yet we are enshrining an agreement subject to these criteria in Irish law.  As we argued at the time, these were never the criteria we should have been using.</p> <p>  Let us consider these criteria.  The credit line would obviously be called on during downturns.  During the financial crisis, all eurozone members, with the exception of Luxembourg and Estonia, were under the excessive debt procedure.  Is it then a credible criterion that a state cannot be under the deficit procedure?  As I have said, during the financial crisis, every single member of the eurozone, bar Luxembourg and Estonia, would have been excluded.  What are the Minister's views on that criterion?  I also have a number of other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.670" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#A00800"><p>I believe the criteria that are in place for access to the precautionary condition credit line, PCCL, are appropriate.  I will outline a number of reasons that is the case.</p><p>The first is it is important to be clear about what are the circumstances in which the PCCL could be accessed.  They could, for example, apply due to a natural event due to an earthquake.  It is all about focusing the availability of this credit line for circumstances that are completely beyond the control of a member state and a government.  Therefore, it is possible that you could have a country that is fulfilling the current Stability and Growth Pact conditions and still, for reasons beyond its control, finds itself in need of assistance to meet funding needs in an emergency.  That being said, the Deputy is aware now of the review that has recommenced by the European Commission in relation to the future of economic governance within the European Union which is focused on the debate about the fiscal rules.  When that debate concludes, and if there were to be a change in the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP, that was to change some of the targets and conditions within the SGP, I entirely expect that the operation and access to this PCCL will have to be in line then with a revised SGP if there were to be a revision in the SGP.  In one way, I take the Deputy's point that at present there are very few countries that would meet the criteria of the SGP, but there is a review under way in relation to that.  Even while there are few countries that meet the criteria of the SGP, it is possible that you could have a country that meets the criteria, as they are currently defined, and still, for reasons beyond control, finds itself in need of this financial instrument.</p></speech>

That is a failure, in terms of the negotiations that have happened and the agreement that has been reached, to reach an agreement that was fit for purpose in today's age.</p> <p>  It is interesting the example the Minister cited in terms of an earthquake.  That may be the case and we will tease that out a little further.  For those who are looking for this type of credit line, it is likely in the main that they will have used their own resources.  In accessing it, we would, more than likely, be in a downturn.</p> <p>  Let us go on to the second criterion, because there is not only one criterion in terms of the excessive deficit procedure that they must reach.  As I said, during a financial crash, only two countries would be eligible for this credit line if that were to happen.  Let us look at the second criterion of not exceeding the 3% deficit of GDP.  The general government deficit is exceeded by 3% in 25 member states.  That means that, currently, if there was an earthquake, to take the Minister's example, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, The Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and we in Ireland, regardless of the size of the earthquake, would all be locked out of this line of credit.</p></speech>

I anticipate that by the time we move into next year, the number of countries that would be in excess of the 3% deficit requirement will begin to change and one will see more countries - due to economic growth and due, I hope, to the retreat of the economic consequences of Covid-19 - fall at or below 3%.  In any event, if there is change in the SGP to reflect a new economic reality, the operation of this treaty will have to reflect it.</p> <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty is correct to say this treaty is being brought in before that debate has concluded.  I would anticipate that it will take at least a year for that debate to conclude and for agreement to be reached on the future of the SGP but in that year, I still believe, there is value in this treaty being implemented because it brings forward by two years overall the kinds of support that may be available to countries if they find themselves facing a natural risk or a banking difficulty.  The enhanced conditions credit line, ECCL, which I suspect is the other credit line Deputy Pearse Doherty will come on to in a moment, is applicable in a broader range of circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.674" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#B00400"><p>The Minister is saying that the other rules may change and if they change then they will be subject to this.  This is legislation that we are enshrining in Irish law today.  Committee Stage has to be decided now.  These are the rules that we are saying should apply to this credit line, whatever about what the Minister and the rest of the finance ministers may decide down the line.  The point I make is these are not fit for purpose.  These do not meet the needs of access to these credit lines because the criteria are too stringent.</p> <p>  While the Minister may make the point that some of those countries I mentioned may achieve a deficit of less than 3% in the upcoming period as the pandemic recedes, let us look at the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is another criterion that has to be met here.  It is that the general government gross debt does not exceed 60% of GDP.  For example, at the end of last year, that means Belgium is out.  Germany is out.  Greece is out.  Spain is out.  France is out.  Croatia is out.  Italy is out.  Cyprus, Hungary, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland are out because they have all exceeded that criteria.  Whatever about reducing your deficit to that level, reducing your debt to below 60% of GDP is not likely to happen in the short term, but then you have the option of reducing it one twentieth per year.  If we look at that, for those whose debts exceed 60% of GDP, they must reduce that ratio in two consecutive years and this would in the main be during a downturn.  If it was to happen, next year or the year after, that a country needed to access this, it would be during a time when it would be spending a lot on the pandemic and so on.  It would be during a time of financial pressure that, to be able to ensure that one can avail of this precautionary credit line, one would have to be reducing one's debt which is the opposite of what one should be doing.  We have learnt the lessons from the policy that was followed here after the financial crash and in some other EU member states that this was the wrong thing to do and we are dealing with the pandemic and the impacts of the pandemic in a different way.  Requiring countries to reduce their debt over two consecutive years, which, as I said, is likely to be in a downturn, for access to this credit would be a bad and harmful economic policy.  Therefore, again, it is not fit for purpose.</p> <p>  Let us take a live example.  Let us consider Italy, for the sake of argument.  Its debt-to-GDP ratio is currently 156%.  What balance would it have to run for two years, most likely during a downturn, in order to access this credit line?</p></speech>

In evaluating the point that the Deputy is making, it is worth emphasising that the Government of the same country, Italy, is committed to the ratification of this treaty too.</p> <p>  All the countries that the Deputy has named that are currently in excess of the SGP have all signed up to ratify this treaty and their Ministers are currently doing what I am doing.  Why is that?  Why would a Finance Minister, who understands the debt dynamics of his or her own country in a way that is superior to how the Deputy and I would, sign up to ratify this treaty?  The reason they will sign up to ratify this treaty is because of the answer I have given the Deputy, which is an expectation that when the debate on the future of the SGP concludes, it will have a parallel effect on the operation of this treaty.  That is the expectation that all governments which are committed to the ratification of it have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.676" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#C00100"><p>That is fine.  The Minister is sitting down and saying that we will get it right the next time around and we will look at these ratios - that were not fit for purpose - and they will be changed.  There is no doubt about it.  The European Stability Mechanism, ESM, is already calling for that ratio of debt to GDP to be increased to 100%.</p> <p>  On the answer to the question I put to the Minister, I am sure he could do this on the back of an envelope.  If the debt-to-GDP ratio in Italy is currently running just shy of 160%, that is 100% above the target in these rules to be able to access the credit line.  The criterion for Italy to access the credit line is that it would have to reduce its portion of debt that is above the 60% by one twentieth.  This means that in each of two years, Italy would have to reduce its debt by 5% in one year and 5% in the next year.  Over a 24 month period Italy would have to reduce its debt by 10%.  I have used Italy as an example, but it could be Ireland, France or Spain.  It does not matter.  If a downturn came and a country needed to access the credit line, that is the type of criterion.  It is likely, as was said, that a country would be in a downturn at that point in time, although there are unique circumstances such as the Minister has pointed out, like natural disasters.  It is likely that a country would be in a downturn at that time.  The idea of having to forcibly reduce debt at that scale of 10% over two years, to be able to access the precautionary credit line, basically makes it inaccessible to countries other than the promise that it may change in the future.</p> <p>  In my time in the Oireachtas I have never seen a situation where we are passing legislation with very clear rules and strict conditions while actually saying "Well do not mind that because we are going to change all of that or we may change that in the future, and if we change that in the future then this will change also."  We must look at what is in front of us now and how it applies now to EU member states.</p></speech>

They see the debt dynamics to which the Deputy refers, and they understand what could be the implications of having to put in place excessive deficit reduction, but they are committed to implementing this treaty. Why are they?  Because, when one brings forward a treaty or a law in front of the House it can only make reference to other laws and other treaties as they stand at this point in time.  That is the reason.</p> <p>  I understand why the Deputy is concerned.  He is pointing to risks within the eurozone and he is pointing to his own political views around the need to reduce debt and deficits, but as concerned as the Deputy is, there is also a relevant question to the points the Deputy put to me.  If the Deputy is so focused on the debt situation of the majority of countries within the EU that could be impacted by this treaty, why have all those governments signed up to implement this treaty?  They signed up because they are aware, as am I, that if and when change were to happen in economic governance, it would impact on the operation of this treaty.  Why is the Italian Government committed to implementing this treaty?  Why has the Belgian Government, and all of the governments listed by the Deputy, committed to doing this?  The reason is exactly as I have just said to the committee.  We are looking at an extraordinarily unique situation this year in deficits, maybe less so in debt, for the reason the Deputy has said, which is that it will come down at a far slower pace for a while - if at all.  Despite all of that, all of the European Union is committed to doing this.  The reason is as I have said to the Deputy on a number of occasions now.</p> <p>  The Deputy is judging all of this by the implementation of deficit reduction paths that are predicated on the exact reapplication of previous deficit reduction strategies.  That is what the Deputy is basing his analysis on.  The fact that every member of the European Union is committed to implementing this treaty would indicate that those countries that could be affected by the scenario as the Deputy has outlined do not accept the Deputy's analysis. </p></speech>

There are different views across Europe in relation to this.  There is a large view out there that this is a very big missed opportunity.  That view has been expressed by those in parliament in Italy with regard to the reforms that could have gone there.  The point here is that we are dealing with outdated rules.  The Minister has acknowledged that the rules that currently exist, the rules that we are enshrining into this legislation, are outdated and are not fit for purpose.</p> <p>  I will now move on to issue of the letter of intent-----</p></speech>

The Deputy has said there is a view by many that this is seen as a missed opportunity.  Those views may well be expressed but in my other role as president of the Eurogroup, I played a role in brokering this agreement.  All of the governments that are in the Eurogroup have signed up to this.  All of them have.  If a view is expressed that this is a missed opportunity, it is not a view that is being expressed by the finance ministers who are representing the countries referred to by the Deputy.</p></speech>

The members of the board of governors of the ESM are, in many cases, the finance ministers of ECOFIN anyway, so the finance ministers themselves or their representatives will be involved in making this decision.  The latter makes it exceptionally unlikely that they would deviate in any way from the rules they themselves are involved in setting.

Gross economic recovery was impacted as a result of the period of recession.  It was lengthened and deepened, and the impact of that was felt by communities and regions.  The point I am making is that there is nothing in this treaty which states that an MOU must ensure that it does not undermine public services or threaten economic recovery.</p></speech>

We are talking about a member state government and a finance minister negotiating to secure additional funding in a time of crisis.  In such a case the negotiation to which I referred earlier would look to strike the best possible balance between getting the member state out of the acute difficulty it could be in and preserving public services and living standards as they stand.</p><p>However, in the absence of a credit line such as this, the hit and damage that could be caused to public services and economic recovery would be far bigger.  This could be pointing to a difference in approach between us in the operation of this line.  I think it is appropriate that conditionality is in place regarding the access of a credit facility such as this, given this uses the pooled and credit funding of the European Union as a whole, to which countries contribute.  The conditionality would also have to be agreed and get the balance right between maintaining public services as they stand and avoiding even worse difficulty if this credit line were not to be available to a country.</p></speech>

They may genuinely think they have the interests of the member state, but they will be coming at it from their own position and views.  We have experienced this.  Was the Minister's predecessor not walking down the steps into the D&aacute;il when he got the call saying he could not burn the bondholders because a bomb would go off in Dublin if he did?  A Cabinet decision taken democratically by elected Members of the Oireachtas elected to the office of Minister was halted by a phone call after a decision in Europe.  That has been our reality and as a result of deciding to fold at that point, unguaranteed bondholders were paid billions.</p> <p>  What is worth noting and welcome in this part of the legislation is that this would not happen today.  Bondholders would be burned.  It is now the accepted principle throughout Europe, through the Single Resolution Fund, that there would be a bail-in and bondholders would be burned, in the first instance, through a tiered structure.  Unfortunately, this comes ten years too late for Ireland and we did not have a Cabinet at the time willing to implement the decisions it took.  I do not know if there was ever a time in history that a Cabinet decision was overturned by a phone call.</p> <p>  It is a bit naive to suggest that just because the Minister's colleagues are in ECOFIN, they will always have Ireland's interests at heart.  We have seen many of the challenges, twists and turns in relation to other objectives Ireland wanted to meet and how they were frustrated along the way, whether by Germany or another entity.  Others have their own ideas, which are valid, but they have their own priorities as regards how the system should work.</p></speech>

I said this was a negotiated outcome and other countries would be involved and I pointed to the acknowledgement that there is conditionality.  I never, in any of my statements, said this would be guided by altruism alone and purely the interests of one country.  This is a negotiated outcome, as I have said repeatedly in my presentation.  The reason is that multiple national interests are at stake, as are the interests of institutions charged with protecting the health and future of the eurozone.  For this reason, I have referred throughout my presentation to other countries being involved in this and the existence of conditionality.</p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's point about what happened to us a decade ago, the abiding lesson I take from that is that if a country loses its economic sovereignty and is not in a position to fund itself and give confidence to others that it will be able to fund itself in the future, it is vulnerable and more open to pressures that can develop.  It is one of the reasons this treaty is now being ratified throughout the European Union.  Through the development of the credit lines the Deputy and I discussed a few moments ago, and especially through the strengthening of the role of the European Stability Mechanism with regard to the SRF, the EU is trying to prevent acute financial crises from developing in the future and mitigate the harm they cause.  Nowhere in my presentation have I sought to infer that this is anything but the outcome of negotiations.</p></speech>

In each of those credit lines conditionality is negotiated with the ESM and, in some cases, the IMF.  Some of the conditionality will be corrective and some will relate to meeting the criteria.</p> <p>  Let me just go back to the Single Resolution Fund because the ESM will also lend to the SRF in order to bail out banks after the bondholders have been burned.  What conditionality do we place on the financial institutions as a result of making that lending available to the Single Resolution Fund which will then make it available to the financial institutions?</p></speech>

I ask the committee to bear with me.  The conditionality involved, at a bare minimum, is the obvious point that the SRF, including the share of the ESM funding the SRF, is funded by contributions banks make.  That is a profound difference from where we were a decade ago.   However, if the Deputy takes me through his other questions, I will see-----</p></speech>

There will be strict conditionality if a member state looks for it.  That could be profound, especially in the context of a memorandum of understanding, MOU.  What conditions will be placed on financial institutions in terms of restructuring or doing whatever is in the public good?  I do not see them anywhere in this comprehensive legislation.</p></speech>

However, the key feature of how we would deal with banks is that all of this would happen after bondholders had been bailed in and in fairness to the Deputy, he made that point earlier.  I ask him to bear with me for a moment.</p></speech>

Did it ever cross his mind that we should impose conditionality on the banks, as we do on member states?  He had a key and prominent role in negotiating this agreement.</p></speech>

The progress we made in ensuring the SRF and ESM are funded by banks rather than the taxpayer was a massive step forward.  The key piece of conditionality in this is, as I explained, that the money that goes into ESM - the share of the ESM that is relevant to this - and to the SRF is a contribution from the banking sector.  There is no further conditionality there.</p></speech>

However, member states, using taxpayers' money, will step in if that is not sufficient at a point in time, but will be paid back.  There are no structural or other conditions that could be applied to member states if they run into financial difficulties.  If a bank is running into financial difficulty, there is bail-in and burning of bondholders, which should have happened ten years ago, but in any event is happening now.  In addition to the bail-in of bondholders, we will have the tiered process and the Single Resolution Fund.  However, if the Single Resolution Fund, which is made up of bank contributions, runs out, taxpayers' money, through the ESM, will be made available to banks.  It has to be paid back but there is no other conditionality on top of that.</p><p>Yet member states that run into financial difficulty have to pay back the money to the ESM in an agreed period and there is a raft of conditionality.  The IMF is drawn in as the ESM.  There are negotiations around structural changes that may happen around possibly selling off assets and changes with laws that might be implemented and so on.  As the lead negotiator in this, did the Minister ever consider that would not be fair or balanced and that maybe banks should have conditionality imposed on them if they run into difficulty?</p></speech>

I will explain why.  It is there because the bondholders at this point will be bearing a cost that they have not borne before.  That is the difference.  The Deputy is wrong in what he says about the taxpayer funding the operation of the ESM.  In these situations it will also be banks through lending to the ESM that will be contributing to the operation of the ESM in backing up the SRF, to be very clear.  In this particular set of circumstances it is banks that are funding the operation of the SRF if it is dealing with a banking difficulty.  The parity of treatment arises in this situation.  It is banks funding the consequences of banking difficulty, not the taxpayer.  That is the key difference.  It is a massive and much-needed improvement on where we have been.  It is a big step forward in how the costs of banking difficulty are borne by banks.  I am not quite sure what other conditionality the Deputy would want apart from the key fact that it is banks which are now in the front line of paying for banking difficulty and not the taxpayer.  That is why this is a step forward and that is why I am recommending this to the D&aacute;il.  That is the huge change in where we are.  That is the contribution they are making.</p></speech>

The actual tiered structure of how to deal with banking failure is appropriate.  We are getting to the point where we should have been, which is what Sinn F&eacute;in had articulated.  The Minister and his colleagues lambasted us and now they cheerlead the fact that bondholders should be burned in a scenario where a financial institution fails, that that should be the first line of defence and that there should be other tiered structures.  The key point is that as we go down the waterfall of bail-in, there is a point where the ESM funds can be made available to the SRF.  They have to be paid back within three years but they are being made available to the SRF for the purpose of providing that support for the banking sector.  That is taxpayers' money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.733" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#F01300"><p>To be completely clear, in that situation loans from the backstop itself are repaid by contributions from the European banking sector.  In addition to repayments that are funded by banking sector contributions, the single resolution mechanism regulation sets out a series of conditions which limit the risk to which the fund, and thereby the backstop, could be exposed.  A contribution from the fund or the backstop itself to recapitalisation could only be made following the bail-in of at least 8% of the total liabilities, including funds, meaning that shareholders and creditors suffer losses before the SRF or the backstop itself is accessed.  My point is that before we get anywhere near the development of those kinds of circumstances, taxpayers will be protected by bondholders being brought in to pay for the cost of banking difficulty and we will have the operation of the SRF.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.734" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#F01400"><p>Yes, but let me say in a friendly way that the Minister misled the committee earlier on because the point is that there are tiered-down, waterfall systems where bondholders will be burned in the first instance and then the fund that is made up of banking contributions - the SRF - would be used.  However, after that it is taxpayers' money: it is contributions from the ESM to the SRF that will flow into the financial institutions.  The Minister gives the impression, maybe by accident, that no taxpayers' money would be used and that the difference between the banks is that it would be all banking money.  That is not the case.  It will be paid back to us by the SRF within a three-year period but before that initial three years there will be a flow of money from the ESM which is capitalised through contributions from member states.  As the Minister mentioned, it will be in excess of &euro;800 million from Ireland, with larger contributions from other states depending on the size of their economies.  It is an important point around the accuracy of what we are dealing with.  It is a tiered structure.  The legislation allows for the ESM to lend to the SRF and sets out the conditionality in relation to that in terms of when the SRF would have to pay back those funds to the ESM.  However, it is a case where taxpayers' money, albeit at the very end of the line, can flow in to financial institutions.  Therefore, returning to the point that I was making earlier, if that is not triggered I do not see an issue in terms of conditionality but if it were to be triggered there is no conditionality on the banks.</p></speech>

Sure, I know the legislation.  However, the Minister is making the point that taxpayers' money would not be used in terms of a contribution to the financial institutions.  That is factually inaccurate.  It will only happen after all of the other safeguards are used but that is exactly what the legislation is.  The legislation is about that last safeguard to ensure a bank would not fail.  When the SRF resources are depleted, there is an ability for the ESM to lend to the SRF which will make money available to the banks, and that has to be paid back.  It is important for accuracy that this is not a difference between us on this issue.  I am not arguing that it should not happen.  I am saying, for the purposes of accuracy, that there is a point where taxpayers' money via the ESM would be made available to the SRF at the end of the line where all other options - the bail-in and the SRF - have been exhausted.  That is when it kicks in.  Therefore, as a result of the fact that there is taxpayers' money on the line - yes, with strong provisions in regard to safeguarding that money and getting it back from the SRF - there should be an ability to look at conditionality on the financial institutions just as you are imposing conditionality on member states for their credit lines.</p></speech>

Where I differ from the Deputy is that the issue of conditionality has less relevance here.  In the circumstances in which the lending between the ESM and SRF happens, by that point so much action would have taken place that would have had a profound impact on the bank.  In those circumstances, we would be talking about a situation in which bondholders have already made a contribution, having huge effect on the value of the bank.  We would be talking about where the Single Resolution Fund has already played a role that will also have an impact on the value of the bank.  Many different steps would need to be gone through, which the Deputy acknowledged and we agree on, before we get to the operation of the ESM.  In those situations, because the ESM is lending money to the SRF, the ESM will also get its money back - which is the taxpayer - albeit at a point in the future.  That is where the contribution of the banks comes in; in all the steps that would happen before we get to the role that the SRF is lending to the ESM.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.745" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#G00700"><p>I am sorry.  I just want to mention something.  I want to bring the debate on this section to a conclusion.  We have discussed it at length.  There were no amendments.  We are now discussing the section and I believe we have exhausted it, so we need to move on.  I need a final response from Deputy Pearse Doherty and from the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.746" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#G00800"><p>As I said, some of the Minister's logic in relation to this is very left field.  He has made the argument that this is a loan to the banks.  But sure, what does he think the other credit lines are to member states?  They are not grants.  They are not cheques that do not have to be paid back.  They are loans as well.  They have to be paid back.  The Minister has argued that it is a loan, therefore, we will get the money back.  That does not make any sense.  The other two credit lines are loans as well to member states with the expectation that member states pay those loans back in the future.  We will disagree on this.  Obviously, as the chair of the Eurogroup the Minister had a key role in this.  I am disappointed.  Yes, the bondholders will be bailed in.  That is good.  We have been calling for that for years.  It is the logical thing to do.  Yes, there is a fund established by the banks and taxpayers' money will not be utilised in the settlements.  That is the right thing to do, but there is scope for conditionality.  For example, we have had it in our own experience here.  Should the board of a bank continue to exist, or should the option be available to the ESM to remove the board of a bank and the CEO of a bank if he or she was involved in reckless lending that forced bondholders to take the hit and the Single Resolution Fund to be exhausted?</p> <p>  The Single Resolution Fund is made up of contributions from financial institutions across member states.  Some of these financial institutions may not have put a foot wrong but will be paying for what could possibly be a rogue financial institution.  That type of conditionality does not exist because you have not put it in place.  Yes, there will be plenty of conditionality and an open book in relation to member states, including that the Minister cannot give the commitment that even those conditions would not affect public services or economic recovery.  Yet, there is no scope for the ESM to introduce that type of conditionality even though the same taxpayers' money that would be made available to the credit line to member states would be utilised by banks through the vehicle of the Single Resolution Fund.  On that point, I will leave my comments on the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.747" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112500002#G00900"><p>I disagree with the analysis put forward by the Deputy.  This is a piece of legislation that seeks to protect the taxpayer and support and help countries when they are in situations of financial and economic difficulty.  In the absence of the credit lines proposed here, countries could find themselves in even tougher and more difficult economic circumstances.  Yes, there is conditionality there because this is other countries that are in effect making money available to countries that are in difficulty.  If they are doing that, it is understandable that on behalf of their own taxpayers they would look to ensure that money is used in a way they think is fit and appropriate.  That is why I believe there is a role of conditionality here.  If Ireland found itself in a situation that our funding was used to support or help a country in the context of an economic crisis, Irish taxpayers would expect a role of conditionality in it.</p> <p>  I refer to the point raised by the Deputy regarding banks.  I agree with much of what he said in that this is about how we ensure banks pay for their own difficulty and pay for cleaning up their own cost.  I expect that in any situation where a bank is involved in finally receiving support from the SRF, those who have been involved in running a bank that needs support from the SRF would find themselves facing some pretty tough questions too.</p></speech>

This morning's meeting is to consider the Supplementary Estimates for the public services in respect of programme A of Vote 29 - Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and Vote 31 - Department of Transport.</p> <p>  I remind members that the committee has no role in approving the Estimates.  It is an ongoing opportunity for the committee to examine departmental expenditure, to make the process more transparent and to engage in a meaningful way on relevant performance issues.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and her officials to the meeting.  They are most welcome.  </p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus should note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to evidence they give.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting, Oireachtas Members and witnesses have the option of being physically present in the committee room or to join the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I think that is about to end shortly.  I hope that the Minister of State will be our last witness who is physically present and that the changes regarding committee sittings will mean that we will soon return to a situation where only the Chair and the clerks will be here in the committee room.  Witnesses will then have to attend remotely.  That will be for a time, and hopefully not for too long.  I think the presence of witnesses in the room is far more productive and interactive.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via Microsoft Teams, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If attending in the committee room, you are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect yourself and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  I strongly advise the practice of good hand hygiene and to leave at least one vacant seat between you and others attending.  One should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.</p> <p>  I call the Minister of State to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank the Chair and the committee for this opportunity to present details of this Supplementary Estimate for Vote 31 - Department of Transport, and for programme A of Vote 29 - Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p> <p>  Taking the Department of Transport first, the Supplementary Estimate is divided into two parts, a substantive Estimate, voting additional funds to the Department, and a technical Estimate, voting the reallocation of savings within the Department&rsquo;s subheads.</p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is a technical Estimate, voting the reallocation of savings within the Department&rsquo;s subheads.</p> <p>  As agreed in the budget, &euro;90 million will be allocated to supports for the aviation sector in the context of the impact of Covid-19.  The aim of additional financial support will be to provide the State's airports with the necessary funds to incentivise air routes, provide discounted airport charges and, ultimately, accelerate the restoration of air connectivity.  The funding will be provided to the airport authorities.  They are best placed to determine where the supports should be targeted to restore lost connectivity, including on long-haul routes where relevant.</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;1.348 million is being allocated to address the shortfall that arose as a result of the introduction of an emergency heavy goods vehicles, HGV, Covid-19 testing regime.  On 28 January 2021, France introduced a legal requirement whereby commercial vehicle drivers travelling on ferries from Ireland to France had to have proof of a negative Covid-19 test result, from either a PCR or antigen test, that had been obtained within the 72 hours prior to embarking on a ferry journey to France.  The French decree which included this legislative requirement was published on 24 January 2021, giving very short notice for truck drivers to meet these new requirements.  It was considered appropriate for the State to pay for private antigen tests for truck drivers to ensure essential supply chains remained open and in the context of the precedent in the UK, where provision had been made for HGV drivers to obtain free Covid-19 tests since 23 December 2021.  Government decision S180/20/10/0648H, dated 19 January 2021, noted that sanctioned spending between &euro;2 million and &euro;5 million could arise.  A total of &euro;1.348 million was spent before the scheme was discontinued.</p> <p>  Turning to the technical Supplementary Estimate, &euro;30 million is being allocated to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, for national roads protection and renewal.  The funding will assist in maintaining the national road network to a high standard and is in addition to the &euro;294.1 million in Exchequer funding already allocated for this purpose in 2021.  The funding will be invested by TII in protection and renewal of existing road assets, with a particular emphasis on safety and repavement works.</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;46 million is being allocated to address the shortfall in electric vehicle, EV, grant funding.  Responsibility for the grant schemes to incentivise the transition to electric vehicles transferred to this Department from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on 1 January this year.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, administers these schemes on behalf of the Department and that organisation was allocated &euro;36.5 million for this purpose from the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  It is helpful to note that the schemes are demand-led and the grants operate on a commitment basis.</p> <p>  To meet the climate action plan target, a significant ramp-up in EV purchase levels is required, notwithstanding recent progress.  The Department of Transport has developed a trajectory for the EV share of the fleet on a year-on-year basis to 2030 to support policy monitoring and evaluation.  The Department anticipates that subhead B6, carbon reduction, is likely to be significantly overspent by year-end, due to the extraordinarily high level of demand placed on both programmes in 2021 by a marked, and welcome, increase in consumer demand for EVs.</p> <p>  The following savings have been identified with the context of the Department&rsquo;s Vote, with a total of &euro;76 million earmarked for reallocation.  Of this, &euro;29 million has been allocated in 2021 to support the A5 road running from the Border to Derry.  This scheme has not yet commenced as it is the subject of a Northern Ireland Planning Appeals Commission inquiry.  The funding is ring-fenced within the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  Normally, the ring-fenced funds would be returned to the Exchequer at the end of the year.  However, as it is not expected that the scheme will proceed until 2023, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has sanctioned the use of the unspent funds in the Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  Another &euro;6 million is being utilised arising from unspent funds as a result of continued delays to the commencement of construction on new Coast Guard buildings for Westport and Greystones.  A &euro;16 million underspend in commercial EV grant schemes is being utilised to address the overspend in the non-commercial EV grant scheme.  This is supplemented by &euro;25 million in underspending on cycling and walking programmes, as these programmes continue to ramp up their capacity to absorb the full allocation of annual ring-fenced funding.</p> <p>  Turning to the 2021 technical Estimate for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, some &euro;28 million is being allocated to the energy programme and will be added to a &euro;132 million forecast capital underspend on the sustainable energy programmes to facilitate the transfer of &euro;160 million in the context of the energy efficiency national fund.  The transfer to this fund will provide additional supports to households impacted by rising energy prices.  A sum of &euro;24.5 million is being allocated to the environment and waste management programme to provide additional funding in 2021 for climate financing, litter initiatives and additional carbon credit purchases.  In addition, funding is being provided for the reimbursement of the climate action fund for 2021 expenditure on the Bord na M&oacute;na bog rehabilitation project.</p> <p>  By the end of the year, the Department is forecasting a substantial capital surplus of &euro;246 million, which arises mainly due to the impact of Covid-19 on the delivery of two of the Department&rsquo;s largest projects.  Those are &euro;80 million on the national broadband plan, NBP, and &euro;132 million on the sustainable energy programmes.  The extensive Covid-19 related restrictions on construction activity between January and mid-April had a significant impact on activity on both the national broadband plan and the sustainable energy programmes this year.</p><p>National Broadband Ireland commenced connections to the new fibre network in January.  However due to level 5 Covid-19 restrictions that were in place until April which closed the construction industry, with certain exceptions, National Broadband Ireland sought an extension of milestones to be delivered in 2021.  A revised target for premises passed by the network to 59,432 premises passed was agreed with the Department.  This is a 40% reduction on the original target of 102,000 premises passed.  National Broadband Ireland has also faced further complexities working with existing networks that have also impacted on progress.  This includes challenges arising in the roll-out of fibre broadband in a rural environment such as significant tree trimming to ensure that cables can be placed on overhead poles and remediation of ducting.  Building work is now progressing across the 20 deployment areas with 277,000 premises now surveyed.  Enabling work is now under way in a further 16 deployment areas.</p><p>  On the energy side, level 5 restrictions in 2020 and 2021 meant that waiting lists on the warmer homes scheme have grown.  SEAI data indicate that for homes completed in the first half of 2021, the average time from application to completion was almost 26 months.  Every effort is being made to maximise activity output since the recommencement of construction activity in the residential and commercial sectors in mid-April.  However, it is inevitable that a substantial budget underspend will accrue by the end of the year.  There is no additional cost to the Exchequer associated with the initiatives being brought before the committee today.  They are being funded from within the 2021 allocation of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on a once-off basis.   </p></speech>

There is a conversation to be had with all stakeholders to ensure that we have an infrastructure that makes people more prepared to buy the vehicles if they have the money.  We accept these are incredibly costly vehicles.  Industry also has its difficulties around chips etc.</p> <p>  There is a narrative around our failure to reach targets on the public electric vehicle fleet.  What are the plans to rectify that and get us back on track?  They are the Department's targets and the Minister of State needs to deliver on them. </p></speech>

I take the point that we have ambitious targets, with 1 million vehicles by 2030.  We want to look at incentives such as low-interest loans.  An office or one-stop-shop has been set up for those who want to purchase electric vehicles and seeing how we can incentivise that.  By the middle of this decade, that is, by 2025 or 2026, the cost of an EV or a petrol or diesel vehicle will be on a par.  The trajectory will be out to 2030.  We are not saying that everyone needs to buy an electric vehicles in the next year or two.  There is an increase of approximately 25,000 new registrations in 2021 to meet the target of 42,540 registered EVs on Irish roads.  The number of new EVs registered to the end of October this year is 16,000.  EVs now represent 15.59% of total car registrations.  Work will have to take place in that regard.  The reason we are here today is to say that we will continue the roll out of the grant scheme.  The charging system across the country is also key because of range anxiety.  The ESB is rolling out that infrastructure across the country.  It is an ambitious target.  The Government and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is working to ensure that we can back up the infrastructure availability with those who want to purchase vehicles.  We do have a ten-year window.  We want to incentivise people in order that they are able to afford it.</p></speech>

I accept that the Minister must have a great deal of engagement with the ESB and other stakeholders on the location of the infrastructure.  It is necessary to do it but unless there is improvement on prices we can have all the plans we want.  All of it should get easier and technology will improve.</p> <p>  Without getting into technical detail that I do not understand myself, I expect there has been considerable engagement with industry on issues around EVs and the longevity of batteries in particular.  Can the Minister of State give us any details on that?</p> <p>  What are the plans around the public fleet?  We need to meet those targets and that is something in the Government's gift.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Ryan has done that.  That is under the carbon reduction subheading.  Preparations are under way to establish an office of low emission vehicles.  It will play an important role on the areas the Deputy outlined.  It will engage closely with the public, with businesses and with public sector consumers to drive the availability of and understanding information around EVs.  There will be a whole new awareness campaign around it.  The public sector will lead the way.  For example, many of An Post's vehicles across the country are low emission vehicles.  It will also look at the strategic placing of the charging infrastructure in places such as rail stations, hotels and key areas across the country.  Therefore there will be a concerted effort around the roll out of the infrastructure and examining how we can inform people.</p> <p>  Many are not ready to change cars in the next two or three years but they may be ready in five or six years' time.  Hopefully technology will have evolved further and there will be other support schemes in place, such as commercial vehicles and getting a grant of up to &euro;10,000 to support purchase by hackney drivers and the limousine sector.  There is also a scrappage scheme for commercial vehicles which are more polluting and high milage.  They are eligible for double the normal grant if they make a switch to electric with up to &euro;20,000 available for a new battery electric vehicle, BEV.  That office of low-emission vehicles will be a key part of ensuring that we can raise awareness and let people know what grants are available and do the work on rolling out the infrastructure across the country.</p></speech>

The committee had an engagement yesterday with the chair designate.  There is a question of the added services that are required.  There may be issues around tendering around the social and community part that needs to be considered when considering what the post office does.  It should be able to tender in the same way as others.</p><p>There was a piece in the <i>Business Post </i>on the national broadband plan and duplication.  We have asked the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan for an update.</p><p>The Minister disputed the figure indicating that 45,000 properties or premises have been passed by Eir in the area covered by the national broadband plan.</p><p> I note the request from National Broadband Ireland for a resource to be provided at local authority level to facilitate the company, particularly when the acceleration element proceeds.  In other words, it requires that a single person would have the juice, for the want of a better word, with respect to planning and engineering, as opposed to it having to deal with the broadband contact who would then have to go to other people.</p></speech>

I will ask the Minister to revert to the Deputy on his query about 45,000 properties if that is okay.</p></speech>

The Minister disputed that figure.  The big issue is that action would be taken as quickly as possible.  The plan is the plan at this stage.  Once we meet the acceleration figure of 60,000, it will at least mean we are keeping up to speed with where we need to be at this time.</p> <p>  The mobile phone and broadband task force needs to be reconstituted.  It should fall under the remit of the Department rather than under the Department of Rural and Community Development.  It should be a clearing house for industry and should do a piece of work bearing in mind that even with the acceleration process, some people will be waiting for four or five years for connectivity.  Engagement is needed with industry and people need to be offered interim alternatives.</p></speech>

The dilemma is that everything, including Departments, is going digital and online.  My focus is to ensure we have a viable post office network.  We are working across government to ensure our postmasters and the post office network are supported in order that they can provide essential services.  I do not need to tell anyone here about the importance of their role throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  They are an important link in their local communities.  That work is ongoing.  I will meet the Irish Postmasters' Union in the next week or two. </p></speech>

She touched on the &euro;90 million allocation for aviation Covid supports.  That funding is welcome and members of this committee have pushed for it.  It will help airlines re-establish key strategic routes and, in the case of Shannon Airport, it will help with routes to Heathrow, Boston and New York.  It is encouraging to see those services reconnected.  The Minister of State will remember meeting representatives of Shannon Chamber of Commerce who did a paper on this matter.</p> <p>  I welcome that Shannon Airport has been included in the regional airports funding programme, for which this committee also pushed.  While those supports are to take account of the current position, looking forward, can the Minister of State give an assurance Shannon Airport will continue to be included in that funding programme?  With respect to the &euro;90 million allocation, can she give a commitment that this type of funding will be made available to our State airports going forward?</p> <p>  It is projected we will not return to 2019 passenger traffic levels until 2024.  The Minister of State will be aware that in 2019, Shannon Airport contributed &euro;3.6 billion to GDP and underpinned 43,500 direct and indirect jobs.  It is of critical importance that the airport and airlines have certainty in order that they can plan into the future.  I would welcome an assurance from the Minister of State that funding will be made available to help the aviation industry to get back on its feet and underpin those routes in the years ahead.</p></speech>

We have had many conversations and the Deputy has highlighted, as have other colleagues, the importance and viability of Shannon Airport.  This relates not only to aviation but the whole mid-west region, hospitality and foreign direct investment.  I thank the committee for its efforts and assistance in keeping the focus on the mid-west region and the need to support our airport infrastructure as a starting point.  Since the airports reopened on 19 July, our focus must now move to enabling Shannon Airport and our other airports to deal directly with airlines.  That is where the &euro;90 million allocation comes in.  The decision on its approval is currently with the European Commission because it needs state aid approval.  I will explain the background to the &euro;90 million allocation.  The previous allocation was &euro;20 million for a Covid-19 damages scheme for Irish airports.  It was specific to Covid-19 but we must continue to support our airports and aviation sector.  We are an island nation.  We do not have the benefit of having an rail link with other European countries.  We rely on aviation.  That is one part of the package.</p> <p>  Regarding the regional airports programme, as the Deputy will know, previously Kerry Airport, Ireland West Airport Knock and Donegal Airport came under the regional airports programme because they had fewer than 1 million passengers per year.  Shannon Airport now comes under that programme, as does Cork Airport.  Some &euro;36 million was provided as part of the regional airports programme.  If Shannon Airport's passenger numbers remain under 1 million per year - not that we would want that - it will remain under the regional airports programme.  The Government has indicated we will continue to consider every sector as we come out of this pandemic to ensure all of them are supported.</p></speech>

Shannon Airport has not reached that level in many years.  I welcome the inclusion of Shannon in the fund programme.  I would like the Minister of State to give an assurance that Shannon Airport will be included in the programme in 2022, 2023 and 2024.  Shannon Airport would then be on a level playing field with the other airports the Minister of State mentioned and with which it is competing.  Such an assurance would be positive.  There is no impediment to including Shannon Airport in the programme from the point of view of state aid at EU level if its throughput of passengers is under 3 million per year.</p></speech>

The Covid-19 damages scheme was specific to Covid.  Shannon currently falls under the regional airports programme.  If the Government is serious about regional connectivity, we need to ensure Shannon Airport thrives and is supported.  As part of the &euro;90 million package, I do not need to tell the Deputy that the transatlantic element will be key for Shannon Airport and many airlines.  It provides a profit margin to ensure they secure transatlantic connectivity.  That is what this funding we have allocated, which I hope will be approved by the European Commission-----</p></speech>

The &euro;90 million has to be allocated before the end of the year.  It is imperative we ensure airports such as Shannon Airport, which did a fantastic job pre-Covid and is on a positive trajectory, can continue to grow.  That will be done through these funds.  We will work to ensure that with the airport and its new chairman, Mary Considine, who is doing fantastic work.  This issue is constantly evolving and is kept under constant review.  We must keep in constant contact with all our airports.  I will meet Shannon Airport management shortly.</p><p>This is constantly under review.</p><p> We had started work on national aviation policy, pre-Covid, before I came into this Department and it was put on hold because of Covid-19, where everyone's focus was.  However, now is a good time, as we are coming out of this pandemic and looking at what aviation looks like in that recovery.  It is in flux, but that work will start again.  That is where working with this committee and working with aviation stakeholders comes in.  Through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, I have met with representatives of airlines and airports and dealing with workers.  It is about listening to the different groups on what is required and ensuring we have that international connectivity, as an island nation.  </p><p> My assurance to the committee is that I will continue to work with Shannon and the stakeholders down there.  I have met with the chambers of commerce which have been very constructive and that helps me in my role.  I want constructive suggestions and ways we can move forward, to get positive results, not just for the mid-west region, but for Ireland.</p></speech>

I did not see any reference in the Estimate here, but I was led to believe a submission was made by the Minister of State's Department, from the RSA, to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DEPR, seeking sanction to take these people on, on a permanent basis.  They would have been employed through a strenuous requirement process in 2017-18 and they are highly experienced.  They are working in counties Clare, Galway, the Minister of State's constituency, and Limerick.  Some of these people were due to be let go on a phased basis between now and next May.</p> <p>  I raised this in the D&aacute;il last week and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, confirmed that plan was put on hold and these people would not be let go until at least next May, which is welcome.  However, it is really only a sticking plaster solution, because 66,000 people are waiting on driving tests.  The very idea that we, as a State, will let go 34 professional and competent people who can deal with driving down these lists is incredible.  I welcome the reprieve that has been given, but there is need for more certainty than that.</p> <p>  We need to be looking after these people who have put in the service over the past three or four years.  We need their services to address the growing lists of people looking for driving tests.  It is important a concrete solution be put in place and that these people would be taken on, on a permanent basis.  I want to hear the Minister of State's views on that. </p></speech>

The Department is in constant contact with the RSA, for which driving testers is an operational matter.  With regard to any request that has come to the Department for extra resourcing for this, we are in contact with the RSA to try to reduce the driving test waiting times, which have come down.  It is not perfect, but they have reduced throughout the country.  We will be liaising with the RSA on its driving tester requirements.  Any request that comes into us has been granted.  Like everything else throughout the country with Covid, we have to assess where we are on looking at the waiting times and whether they are being reduced or whether more staff are required.  These are the decisions the RSA has to make.  We are putting pressure on to reduce the waiting times and get people through the testing system as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister of State to outline her views on what can be done to alleviate the pressure on hauliers.  Obviously, the global price of fuel is dictating the price at the pump to an extent, but the Government must do everything it can to assist businesses through this price shock period.  Hopefully the price will stabilise over time.

This is about hard core business.  Those in business are worried about their bank and about breaching their overdraft agreements.  They need a little bit of headroom.  The Government must look at ways to give hauliers some headroom to allow them to breathe.  I accept that there are world factors at play here and I also accept that we must implement climate change measures.  However, an immediate response is required at the moment and I believe the rebate scheme is the best option in that space.  I welcome the fact that discussions are happening in that regard but there is a degree of urgency around this.</p></speech>

I am interested in the State's prioritisation with regard to its own fleet and that of its agencies.  Reference was made to the purchase of 16,000 new vehicles this year.  It is my understanding that approximately 4,000 vehicles have been bought by the State.  I am not sure if the Minister of State is aware of that figure.  It is certainly in that region but only a tiny fraction are electric vehicles.  Last year only 1.12% of the fleet was electric and this year it is 1.5%.  The State is investing in fleet that will be in use for at least ten years.  We have 2030 emissions reductions targets but we are tiptoeing in the direction of electric vehicles.  What is the Minister of State's response in that regard?  My position on it, from the perspective of the Opposition, is that we will support the Government but we are not responsible for coming up with alternatives.  All we are trying to do is to encourage the Government to deliver on agreed objectives but it is not happening.  What is the Minister of State's response on that?  Does she see this new office as being a paradigm shift?  How does the State intend to improve on those figures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.859" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021112500002#F03500"><p>The office is going to help to raise awareness among people who want to change their vehicle at a certain point, giving them information on the grants available to help with the transition to electric.  An Post was the first mover in the public sector space in the transition to low-emission vehicles.  It is also important to say that in the public transport realm we are investing in low-emission buses.  Athlone will be the first town in the country that will have zero-emission buses.  We have purchased over 280 buses this year, 185 of which are double-decker, hybrid electric vehicles for use in urban areas.  There will also be a rolling out of fully electric, single-decker buses in Athlone.</p> <p>  This is not just about public transport; it is also the private sector.</p><p>I take the Deputy's point about how important this is.  If one looks at reducing emissions, the private car is one of the greatest ways to reduce our emissions here in the country and that office will be key to that.</p></speech>

The Minister of State&rsquo;s initial point, which I accept, is that when people are thinking about making the change, to make information available to them.  I presume that that case does not and should not have to be made to the public sector.  The public sector should be ready to make that move now.  I will leave that point with the Minister of State.  Those are the figures that I have where the State has 4,000 extra vehicles, a tiny fraction of which are electric. The State needs to lead on this.  I know that there are 2030 targets and commitments as to when the State will not invest in fossil fuel vehicles but I believe we need to make greater progress on that.</p> <p>  Moving on to aviation, there have been a number of comments of support for the sector.  There is a commitment in the New Decade, New Approach agreement for Dublin-Derry and Cork-Belfast routes.  I believe a review is under way on those.  I know from speaking to people in those regions that there might reasonably be a question of why one would want to introduce or reintroduce those routes.  In the first instance it is about regional connectivity but there has been a bigger point that has been raised consistently by me which is that it is not just about Cork-Belfast or Dublin-Derry.  It is Dublin-Derry where that creates Derry-Glasgow and Glasgow-Donegal.  It is Cork-Belfast but that creates Belfast-Cork and Cork-Britain.  It is about the interconnectivity and being highly networked.  Can I have an update please on that review, when it will conclude how quickly we might see proposals on those routes?</p></speech>

I do not have the timeline for that but I can come back to the Deputy on it.  This comes back to previous conversations around the fact that we are an island nation and we need to ensure that we have that connectivity.  We have the difficulty at the moment with Covid-19 and we are currently trying to support the airports that we have as best we can.  We are in this flux situation with regard to the next year or two as to where we are going to be on that.  Once that review is completed, we will be in a better position to see the supports that are needed, where we lie as an island nation with that connectivity and what routes we need to ensure are supported through that.  We do not have alternatives other than by sea or air.  The update I have is that the review will be completed shortly and will then be submitted to the Minister.  If we receive any other update as to a more targeted date I will return to the Deputy with that.</p></speech>

We had Second Stage yesterday of the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) (Amendment) Bill 2021 when we would have heard from a range of Deputies from right across the political spectrum as to the funding allocation for that board.  Did the Minister of State hear what was said yesterday and is there a sense within the Department that there will be a shift in that direction to adequately resource the board to bring it in line in comparison - as the figure was repeated time and again - with rail and aviation investigations?  Will there be additional allocations there?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was not present and I know that Deputy Carey has asked for a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, with Government Deputies on some of the issues that were raised yesterday during Second Stage.  I will be asking the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to facilitate that meeting on not just issues of funding but other issues that were raised, before Committee Stage, and that would be helpful. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.869" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021112500002#G01000"><p>I ask the Minister of State to comment on a few figures that are in here.  On the &euro;25 million underspend on cycling and walking programmes, what is the cause of that underspend because there is definitely demand around the country and the ambition also that the Government partners share in cycling and in active transport?  Is it purely down to Covid-19 delays or is it down to having sufficient resources at local authority level for the entire process, from the feasibility, design, tender, construction and planning stages?  Would we not expect to see those underspends as the local authorities get better resourced?  There were more than 240 positions allocated to the local authorities for the active transport schemes.  Do we know if all of those allocations are now with the local authorities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.870" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021112500002#G01100"><p>That is a very good question on the underspend for cycling and walking infrastructure.  We made a commitment in the programme for Government to allocate &euro;360 million every year for walking and cycling infrastructure.  The Deputy is correct in his question as to whether the delay is due to Covid-19, which it partly is, or resources, which it also is.  It is important to say that this is the first full year of the roll-out of walking and cycling infrastructure.  I expect that this will not be an issue in 2022 because of what the Deputy has mentioned on the allocation of resources to local authorities.  They will be better equipped in 2022 to be able to roll out this infrastructure.  I am very eager, having allocated much funding across the country to many local authorities where some are faster than others in rolling this out, to keep the impetus there and to ramp up that capacity.  I will be watching this very closely, as we all will, in 2022 in our towns and villages, as walking or cycling infrastructure is not just an urban issue.  We need to be very clear on that.  This is for county councils across the country, and not just city councils, to ensure that they are identifying towns and villages - be it through the Safe Routes to School programme or otherwise - to ensure that they have footpaths, cycleways and safe routes.  It will be ramped up and I hope that we will not have that significant underspend in 2022.</p></speech>

With the popularity and widespread use of electric cycles and scooters, the Minister of State is correct in that the catchment for active transport has now become much larger because of those electric vehicles and we need to take that into account.</p> <p>  My second question is on the warmer homes schemes.  It states that the average time from application to completion was almost 26 month, which seems like a long time.  Is there any way of speeding up processes within that because we have that large target again within the programme for Government to retrofit 500,000 homes across the country and the warmer homes scheme will obviously be part of that number?  I have also seen figures that up to 1 million homes in Ireland could do with retrofitting but we will obviously target the first 500,000 that need it most and are at risk of fuel poverty.</p><p>Can we speed up that average wait time of 26 months in any way?  Where are the delays in that process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.873" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021112500002#H00200"><p>We need to ensure increased access to these schemes and reduced waiting times.  That is very important.  A new residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme will be established to facilitate the provision of low-cost loans for residential retrofit projects.  In response to energy price increases, there is an energy efficiency national fund of &euro;160 million.  That fund will be paid into and used to improve access to these residential retrofit projects for low-income households and households living at risk of poverty.  The funding will be put in place to try to reduce the waiting time, on which I agree with the Deputy.  We all receive calls in our offices from people who are trying to get their homes insulated and are waiting on somebody to come out to assess them.  This funding will be part of that.  We are under pressure to reduce our emissions at every level and if it is a resourcing issue, this will be part of whatever needs to be done.  The funding will go towards ramping up access.</p></speech>

We need to keep in mind that rising energy prices are a result of oil price rises across the planet and geopolitical reasons.  Carbon tax is not causing the increases about which I hear many people talking.  A small increase is from carbon tax, but the main increase we see in diesel and petrol is due to oil prices.</p> <p>  I will be parochial and ask about County Wicklow.  The Greystones coastguard building project has been going on for some time.  The &euro;6 million allocated to that project and the Westport project is to be reallocated elsewhere.  Does the Minister of State know what is delaying the project, for which funding was in place?  She can respond to me later if she does not have the answer to hand.  However, I am keen to get some sort of guarantee that this money, which has been reallocated this year, will still be available for the Greystones coastguard building next year when the delays, whatever they are, have been overcome.  It has been going on for some time and needs to be done.</p></speech>

I can revert to the Deputy with more information.  To cut to the chase, that is the reason for the delay.</p> <p>  With regard to the residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme, the Department is in the process of setting up a new financial instrument.  This will be a loan guarantee.  It will be delivered in conjunction the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  It is intended that will consist of two components.  One is a low-cost residential retrofit loan-based scheme and the other is a participating retail credit institution.  It is like a one-stop shop to help people who can afford to do something in their home but need assistance, for example, through a low-cost loan.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, is working to ramp up the capacity in all of these areas.</p></speech>

Some &euro;160 million was paid into the energy efficient national fund in 2021.  There are three components.  There is improved access to residential retrofit projects for low-income households and households living in poverty; establishing a new residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme for the provision of low-cost loans for residential retrofit projects; and increasing the number of houses retrofitted through other residential community energy efficiency scheme, especially the soon to be launched national retrofit scheme.</p> <p>  Members, including, probably, the Minister of State, are regularly contacted by people asking what scheme they qualify for, what it covers, where they should apply, when they will secure approval, how much they will get and how quickly they will be able to do the works under the scheme.  Funding of &euro;160 million is great, but when does this come into play for the ordinary person sitting at home?  There is huge buy-in among the general public to make their homes more energy efficient and, by definition, more carbon efficient.  When will these measures come into being?</p></speech>

One of the big issues I see outside of the delays is that years ago a range of people, and pensioners come to mind, had a shallow retrofit conducted and works undertaken under the warmer homes scheme.  In truth, this barely made a blip of a difference to heating those homes.  It certainly would not have registered on the BER rating.  As I understand it, there is still a rule that the SEAI will not go back into these homes and there is no second visit.  This is something that was committed to and then it came off the table for some reason.  How will the Government approach prioritising these people?  I know there are general approaches.  Generally the schemes are designed to support to a greater degree those who are more disadvantaged.  It is not happening.  There are delays of two years and, on top of this, the people I am speaking about are not even on the schemes now because they were visited a decade ago.  How will the Government square this?  I can think of any number of people in my constituency.</p></speech>

Ordinary people do not qualify because they had work done.  If people are willing to go with the changes we must support them.  Is this issue factored into the deliberations?</p></speech>

I will have to go back to the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  There are similar issues in my constituency.  People who got the walls pumped, minor attic insulation or minor works are now told they are not eligible for retrofitting or for the grant schemes.  The issues that are being raised here today can be incorporated into future low-interest loans.  Many of these people can afford some of the payment but they need extra help through the low-interest loan.  I will relay this back to the Minister, Deputy Ryan.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State have information on the Border road?  Having spoken to colleagues on the north side of the Border there is frustration about the A5 and planning.  The funding has been reassigned.  Will it be there in 2023, when I hope the work will commence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.920" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021112500002#J01600"><p>This funding has been on our budget and allocated every year.  This is testament to our commitment to supporting the A5 project.  As the Deputy knows, the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure published the interim report of the Planning Appeals Commission inquiry into the A5.  The Minister, Ms Mallon, has accepted the commissioner's key recommendation on the need for further work, public consultation on flood risk and the consideration of alternative routes for the proposed scheme.  The intention remains that the public inquiry will be reconvened during 2022, as recommended by the Planning Appeals Commission.  The commission will prepare its final report after the public inquiry.  This should then allow for a new ministerial decision to be made.  The final report is expected in early 2023, which is why we can make this decision today.  Our contribution towards phase 1 will not be required in 2021 or 2022.  The commitment will be there in 2023.  We know we can make this allocation today because it will not be spent.</p></speech>

Deputy Matthews mentioned the Coast Guard in Greystones and Westport.  We have heard from the Coast Guard and we will hear from representative groups of volunteers and former volunteers.  We have had a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am flagging this as a concern.  There is underspend.  There are questions about procurement and investment in capital infrastructure.  The earlier part of the previous decade was the last time significant investment was made.  I am raising this as a concern with regard to how the Coast Guard is progressing these projects as part of a wider concern within the Coast Guard.  I will leave it with the Minister of State.  The committee is engaged in work with the Coast Guard, the Department and the Ministers.</p> <p>  Deputy Carey raise the issue of the RSA and driving testers.  I want to come back to this with regard to access to basic facilities at testing centres.  This is something the Minister of State and I have exchanged views on.  The first time I raised it was in a debate on Supplementary Estimates.  That must have been at least 12 months ago if not more.  We are back into winter.  I have the details of an exchange between Unite the Union and the RSA and Unite the Union and the Health and Safety Authority.  It seems very clear from looking at these exchanges and correspondence that there is no reason for the current state of affairs to be the way it is.  I cannot explain why it is this way.  It seems there is an element of spitefulness.  I cannot see anything else in it.  I will make the same case as I made 12 months ago.  These are essential workers.  They perform a very important role in infrastructure for which the Minister of State is responsible.  They might not be directly employed by the Department or the RSA but they are essential as they provide training to drivers, who we want to be fit to drive on our roads and keep themselves and us safe.  They are being treated disgracefully with regard to the most basic requirement for toilet facilities and sanitation.  It needs to be resolved.  It needs intervention from the Minister of State or her colleagues.  I do not know whether the Minister of State has a response on this but I want to leave it with her.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-25a.922" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021112500002#J01800"><p>When the Deputy raised it last we were at the height of the Covid pandemic.  Many of these centres are trying to manage the office throughput and trying to carry out tests.  They have had to make sure these centres were not closed down because of the huge impact this would have on essential workers trying to get driving tests.  Like every workplace there were health and safety protocols in place.</p><p> I take the point that they wanted access, but we have to rely on the on-the-ground experience of these different centres.  Some of them are in shared spaces, that is, there are other businesses within the premises.  They have to manage the throughput through office and make sure that people are safe and that social distancing is facilitated.  The concern was to try to manage the pandemic.  We are in new space now and, it is to be hoped, a better position than we were at this time last year.  More than 93% of the adult population is now vaccinated.  The issue is trying to manage the spread of the virus in these centres and to minimise the numbers who need to go into them.  Over the past 12 months, we have been asked what we are doing to increase the number of people being tested so that they can get their driving licences.  It is a difficult situation.  We are going through a pandemic.  We thought we were coming out of it a number of months ago but we are now in a new space.  It is about keeping people safe and adhering to the protocols.  Again, ensuring that the centres are safe is an operational matter for the RSA, as is ensuring that it is keeping its own staff and those who come through its offices safe.</p></speech>

What I am pointing to, however, is the engagement of the RSA and the Health and Safety Authority's assessment of the issue.  I am not disputing anything the Minister of State is saying but I am asking where is the progress being made on behalf of the RSA?  Is there an inch being given?  The Minister of State talked about variability between different centres.  If that is the case, surely something can be done in some of them in terms of progressing this.  Outside of that, is there goodwill or a measure of respect?  We should spend a few pounds on temporary facilities, if needed.  I will leave that with the Minister of State.  I do not see the level of decency and engagement needed to find a solution coming from the RSA, notwithstanding everything the Minister of State has said with regard the existing challenges.  I need to see more from the RSA on this.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that the Minister of State and the Minister are going to meet with representatives of the IRHA.  Is the Minister of State familiar with the diesel rebate scheme?</p></speech>

This is stitched in.  The maximum amount that may be claimed back is &euro;7.50.  If the price of diesel is below &euro;1.23, there is no rebate.  Those figures are totally out of line.  During the Second Stage debate on the Finance Bill in the D&aacute;il, I asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to consider amending the scheme through that Bill.  Is this a matter that concerns the Minister of State?  Has she made any representations to the Minister for Finance in that regard on behalf of an industry for which she is the responsible Minister of State?  Has she spoken to the Minister about that matter?</p></speech>

We are working across Government on this.  There are certain levers we can pull in the Department of Transport but we need to work with the Department of Finance to see what could be workable while not having any unintended consequences.  We have the diesel rebate scheme.  Businesses may claim VAT back in respect of petrol or motoring costs.  We also have the alternative fuel grant scheme and reduced tolls for alternatively fuelled vehicles.  There are a number of schemes.  As I am saying all of this, I am very conscious that hauliers do not have an alternative.  This is the premise we are all trying to work on.  Hauliers are under great pressure in light of the increased price of diesel.  We have to support them in some way.  This is a global problem.  Deputy Matthews mentioned the carbon tax.  He is correct.  The carbon tax has increased the price of petrol and diesel by 2 cent and 2.5 cent, respectively.  There are more global forces involved in this, such as exchange rates and the cost of raw materials globally.  To come back to the Deputy's point, we are looking at solutions that are workable for hauliers.  I completely understand the pressure they are under.  I am working with the IRHA and the FTAI in respect of the shortage of HGV drivers.  I am working with other countries at an official level, through the RSA, to reach licence exchange agreements.  A ten-year road haulage strategy is also being developed.</p> <p> The sector is under a lot of pressure.  We know about Brexit, supply chains and the new direct routes to the Continent, for which we are thankful.  The sector has adapted and moved.  Even today, as part of the Supplementary Estimates, we have to consider the antigen testing regime that must be put in place for hauliers going to France.  The sector adapted and was flexible and safe in managing the risk from Covid pandemic.  It has had a really difficult 20 months.  I appreciate the pressures it is under.  I am working with colleagues in that regard.</p></speech>

Obviously, we will need more energy-efficient and carbon-efficient vehicles but the bottom line at the moment is that we want to ensure that those businesses will be around to do it.  The highest cost for those in the haulage business is the cost of fuel.  It is very simple.  Obviously, there are also labour costs but, for those who drive the trucks, the highest cost is that relating to fuel.  At present, their fuel costs are nearly 30% higher than they were a year ago.  The rebate scheme is just not doing what it needs to do.  We asked that there be a sense of urgency about this.  The committee will follow up on that.  We ask for a sense of urgency in keeping with what Deputy Carey, others and I have said.  The Minister of State has a meeting with IRHA next week.  That should bring this issue further into focus.  Does she hope to have news for the committee at that point?</p></speech>

Obviously, we need to meet with and listen to the association.  Work is ongoing in this regard.  We want a workable solution.  I commend the IRHA and the FTAI.  They have been under enormous pressure but have engaged with me and with the Department to a great degree.  We want to get a solution.  It will probably not solve everything, but it may ease some of the pressure on this sector, which is absolutely critical with regard to our supply chain.</p></speech>
