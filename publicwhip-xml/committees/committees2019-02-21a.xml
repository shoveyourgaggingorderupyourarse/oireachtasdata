He is joined by Ms Mary Henry, deputy director of audit.</p><p>We will hold over the minutes of the last meeting until the next meeting as I just have not had time to review them yet, and we will hold over matters arising.</p><p>There are three categories of correspondence.  The first item concerns Nos. 1996A<b></b>and 1997<b></b>from the Department of Education and Skills, dated 19 February 2019, which provide a briefing document and an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Correspondence Nos. 1987 and 1995 are from Kildare Wicklow Education and Training Board, dated 15 February and 19 February, and provide a briefing document and an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish these.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Correspondence Nos. 1978A and 1993 from the Irish Council for Social Housing, dated 14 February and 20 February, provide a briefing document and an opening statement for today's meeting.  Is it agreed that we will note and publish these?  Agreed.</p><p>Correspondence Nos. 1979 and 1994<b></b>from the approved housing body interim regulatory committee, dated 15 February and 19 February, provide a briefing document and an opening statement.  Is it agreed that we will note and publish these?  Agreed.</p><p>We will move on to the B category of correspondence, which is from Accounting Officers and Ministers, and follow-up to previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The first item of correspondence is No. 1965 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills on our meeting with Kildare Wicklow Education and Training Board today.  The committee was made aware of this item at last week's meeting and we are formally noting it now.  It is important to stress, and we have to be very conscious today when we have the ETB in, that the Thorn report and, I think, the report by the Comptroller and Auditor General have been referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has made it very clear, and I will read one sentence: </p><blockquote>Having regard to the ongoing investigation ... with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department's legal advice, at the planned meeting, we are in a position to provide the Committee with information and answers on matters in both Dr. Thorn and the C &amp;amp; AG reports, without providing a level of detail which could identify individuals or companies or their activities.</blockquote> <p>We are not going to compromise a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigation here today, or any potential legal cases that could go from it.  I think we all understand that but I have to just make that point clear.  We will note and publish that.</p><p>The next correspondence is No. 1966 from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, providing a copy of the Analysys Mason report on pricing and access arrangements for the metropolitan area network.  We will note that was published the day before the last meeting.  We are now noting this copy.  We did discuss that particular report the last day so we are noting this.  The Department already has published the actual report but we will publish the accompanying letter. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#B00300"><p>Given that the publication of that report coincided with a significant reduction in the cost per metre of fibre, had it been published a year ago it would have or is likely to have brought that reduction at that point.  We are owed an explanation as to why publication was delayed given that it had that impact.  It would be well worthwhile to write back and ask them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#B00400"><p>We will write back and ask for a detailed explanation of the timing, from the time the report was completed, and the discussions they had with Enet last summer when Enet expected it to be published within weeks, and what was the particular reason for the delay.  We want to come back to the broadband issue in our work programme as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#B00500"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#B00600"><p>The Deputy is right on that.  We are writing back to the Department on that specific issue.</p><p>The next item is No. 1968 from the Valuation Office and pertains to the Harold's Cross stadium.  The Commissioner of Valuation has made it clear that there was no contact whatsoever with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine during the process of valuing Harold's Cross.  We have to accept that.  He put it clearly in black and white when he said it would be outside its remit and inappropriate to do so.  We will note and publish that.</p><p>The next item is No. 1972, which was provided by BT at our meeting last week - it is a copy - where BT refers to the Analysys Mason report.  We will publish correspondence No. 1972, which we dealt with last week.  As I said, we have already acknowledged that the Analysys Mason report was published by the Department.  We will publish it on our website as people will want to follow it through our website.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 1973 from the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine stating there were no communications whatsoever between his office, and the Department, and the Valuation Office in relation to the sale of Harold's Cross stadium.  We will note and publish this.  The Department is saying there was no contact so we have to accept that. </p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 1974 from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which provides information on the legislative basis for amending the broadband tender, the decision to extract 300,000 households from the tender and the expert opinion relied on for this.  We can note and we will publish this.  I want to put that on our work programme as an item we want to deal with.  I will make one comment about the letter that he actually sent to us.  It is a detailed letter.  We asked about the state aid issue.  At this point in time we know there is only one tenderer still on the pitch - I will just call it that way - but it had not been formally categorised as the preferred tenderer at this point.  We asked about state aid and I will quote from the second paragraph of page 6 of his letter: </p><blockquote>A formal State aid notification has not yet been submitted to the EU Commission and a formal decision by the Commission in respect of the notified measure has not, therefore, been made, as this can only be done after preferred bidder stage of the procurement process. </blockquote> <p>In terms of the broadband issue, which we will come back to because I am putting it on the work programme, the state aid issue, the European Commission has not given its approval yet for this project because they got to see the details of the tender and the preferred bidder, and what is involved.  So we are a little bit away, one way or the other.  It still has to go to Europe after that stage.  We will just park that and publish this because we want to deal with the broadband issue and the work programme in a few minutes. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#B00700"><p>There is one further aspect to this on which it would be useful to have clarification and which arose on a number of occasions last week.  I refer to the mapping process and the possibility of duplication.  I think we can go back to them and ask them just exactly what has been mapped because there are public entities that have fibre like the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is.  We need to know if they have been included in the mapping process because after all, it would all be public money.  As it is for the avoidance of duplication, that would be helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#B00800"><p>Fine and  I thank the Deputy.  An attachment came with the letter with the heading, national broadband plan state aid compliance update on the mapping of Eir's rural extension plan, dated 8 March 2017.  There is a suggestion that we do not publish this because it is marked privileged and confidential.  However, they have redacted sections of the report, produced by PwC, on pages 6, 7 and 8, obviously in relation to matters that could be commercially sensitive.  I propose that we double check with them that we can publish the redacted form.  We can deal with the redacted issues separately.  From my reading of this report, they have obviously redacted the bits that they consider sensitive.  We will get clearance to publish the redacted version of that appendix that came with that letter as well.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 1977 from the HSE, providing a note requested by the committee regarding the involvement of PricewaterhouseCoopers with BAM.  The HSE advises that there is a framework in place for the provision of professional services to assist in the programme for health service improvement.  The framework provides resourcing and expertise to be drawn down from PwC as required.  So we will note and publish this letter.  The HSE is saying that as far as it is concerned, there is no accounting.  That is its position.  We note and publish that.</p><p> No. 1980B is from the office of the Secretary General of Department of Finance stating that he is unavailable for a meeting on 7 March 2019.  We now have Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, coming to that meeting.  We will reschedule for the Department of Finance as soon as practicable thereafter.  The cancellation suited the other meeting.  That is noted and published.</p><p> No. 1981B is from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  It provides an update to a query raised by the committee on agreeing a contract for the position of chief executive of the authority.  The authority advises that a contract has been concluded under terms and conditions approved by the Minister.  We will note and publish that.  We had a particular query on that.</p><p> No. 1983B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on his attendance at a Committee of Public Accounts meeting to discuss the oversight and implementation of capital projects.  Mr. Watt is making himself available to the committee on 7 March.  He has drawn attention to three other invitations from other Oireachtas committees.  He has also drawn attention to Standing Order 84(2), an internal Oireachtas Standing Order.  Members will be aware of this and should keep it in mind in terms of how we proceed.  While we all agree duplication should be avoided, the committee has never relied on Standing Order 84(2).</p><p> We should deal with the other letters.  Essentially, I want to make one thing clear.  We have already discussed - it was noted at our previous meeting - the position when we decided to invite Robert Watt before the committee.  We specifically framed the invitation around oversight and implementation of capital projects.  We want to know the governance and oversight arrangements.  We made no reference to the children's hospital.  That would have been specific to the Joint Committee on Health and a different Accounting Officer.  It is the case that major capital projects will be asked about on the day he comes in, including broadband, Luas lines, light rail, schools and so on.  Our invitation was not specific to the children's hospital.  He is coming before the committee to discuss oversight and implementation of capital projects.  He has asked our committee to notify the other three committee chairmen of this issue even though they were copied with the correspondence.</p><p> At this stage - I appeal to committee members to bear with me - we have received letters from two other committees on this issue.  I want to note No. 1990B.  It is a copy of a letter from Deputy Colm Brophy, Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, to Robert Watt.  His letter to us says his committee invitation predated our invitation.  I note in that letter of invitation to Robert Watt he discussed twice the issue of health expenditure and the national children's hospital.  He was specifically asking about the children's hospital.  We did not ask about that.  We asked about overall capital project oversight and implementation and governance of capital projects.  I can understand that he might not want to talk on a matter that is specific to one Department.  That is a matter between him and the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.</p><p> There is also a letter on file from Deputy John McGuinness, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  He also says in a letter to Mr. Robert Watt dated 19 February that he accepts the prospect of meeting all four committees on different issues or different aspects of the national children's hospital might be regarded as unduly onerous.  He accepts there should not be duplication.  However, I want to make it clear that we never invited Robert Watt specifically on the national children's hospital.  It is not right to suggest that we were asking about the children's hospital.</p><p> I propose to notify the other committees that our meeting is going ahead.  We note their specific references to the national children's hospital.  That is a different issue from what our meeting is about.  The purpose of the meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in particular is different.  I imagine Mr. Watt is accountable to that committee.  That committee can deal with Mr. Watt in due course.</p><p> We will not get into political argy-bargy with other committees but we have letters and we are proceeding.  The wording of the invitation from other committees to Mr. Watt is a matter for them.  Our invitation is different and he is coming before this committee.  Other committees can take it up with Mr. Watt in due course in their manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#C00200"><p>I remember well the context because I proposed the approach.  It was in the context of discussing the national children's hospital overrun that we considered how the process could lead to a repeat of the difficulties in other projects if we did not have some understanding of what happened.  It was surely around process.  In fact, it was not only the Secretary General we invited.  We also specifically made the request to the person who headed up the procurement section.  Essentially, it appeared that there was quite rigorous oversight on procurement from that section when it came to purchasing things.  We need to understand that role from the point of view of big capital projects.  There appears to be a gap in our scrutiny from an institutional point of view, and the idea is to tease out that particular aspect.  It is critical not only that Mr. Watt comes before the committee but that we understand this from the broader perspective.  We also need to understand it from the perspective of the head of the procurement office.  If there is an institutional gap, then there is a process failure and it cannot but repeat itself.  It is both.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#C00300"><p>For housekeeping purposes at this stage we will note and publish the letter from Robert Watt, No. 1983B and the letter from Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, No.1984B.  We also note the letter from the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, No. 1990B and the letter from the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, No. 1991B.  We will note and publish those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#C00400"><p>I wish to make a wider point.  I realise we are dealing with the letter from the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I will deal with that in a moment.  I raised this matter at the last meeting and I need your guidance, Chairman, on how we will proceed with it now.  When we first dealt with this we discussed the matter with the Secretary General of the Department, his officials and members of the board.  At the time, we did not have any of the minutes of the board meetings or the sub-committee meetings.  We got those after the fact.  We did not have the reports from the independent examination carried out.  As it happens, they shed some light on some of the issues.  Again, we had a false meeting whereby we had the Accounting Officer and the board before the committee but we did not have the information we now have.  That would have enabled us to put the questions that we can now put.  I suggest we get them back in again, because we are now armed with the information.</p> <p>  It may serve as an example to other Accounting Officers in the sense that when this happens we are not going to accept being kept in the dark about reports or accept having to drag information out of people.  They come in and we do not get a chance to put questions that we should be able to put because we do not have the information.  We need to think about this.  Many of these issues centre around boards making decisions on information they do not have.  The Committee of Public Accounts ends up in exactly the same position.  Even after the fact, we do not get information to allow us to do our work.  That is a strong point that we should make in response to the correspondence.</p> <p>  Mr. Watt will come before the committee.  I realise there are sectoral committees.  I have no inclination, nor do other members of the committee, to step on the toes of any sectoral committee.  However, if we are to be honest, there is an element of jockeying for position from some of the committees.  Those sectoral committees have a job to do and good luck to them.  They can bring in Ministers.  We do not seek to bring in any Ministers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#C00500"><p>They can bring in Secretaries General too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#C00600"><p>Yes, but primarily the Minister is responsible to the sectoral committees.  The Accounting Officer, who is the Secretary General, is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are dealing with issues to do with process failures, systems failures and procedural failures, all of which fall under the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  There are times of course when they also fall under the remit of sectoral committees but let the Minister come before those committees with his or her officials and deal with them.  We have to do our job as well.  I do not think we should accept that.</p> <p>  I wish to make another point.  I am not criticising you, Chairman, but I learned in the media at the weekend that there was an invitation or offer being made to other committees to sit with us to discuss some of these issues.  I believe that was a mistake because it devalues the Committee of Public Accounts in some respects.</p><p>This committee has a separate function from the sectoral committees.  I understand the context in which the Chairman made that offer.  He was trying to be helpful. However, it would have been better if that had been discussed here.  That is not a criticism, because I know the Chairman was trying to do the right thing. </p></speech>

The Accounting Officer did not sit on the board, Mr. Quinn did and he is the person who must answer the questions.  How can the Accounting Officer answer questions for somebody who sat on the board?  That is not going to happen.  We should write back to Mr. Quinn, thanking him for his response but insisting that we want him here along with the Accounting Officer.  We should set a session aside for the board to appear again with the Secretary General of the Department so we can put the questions we should have been able to put to them the last time.  If anything, we should do this as an example of what happens if they do not give us the information that they should before they come before the committee.</p></speech>

I have a couple of observations.  Obviously, these letters from Mr. Quinn and Mr. Watt are co-ordinated.  We asked Mr. Quinn specific questions.  He writes: &quot;I refer to your letters of 8 and 12 February.  I will respond to the issues raised therein in due course.&quot;  It is a bit worrying that he has not responded already.  He should be able to answer these questions pretty quickly.  I would have thought they are pretty basic questions.  Why has it taken so long?</p><p>I want to emphasise that as a committee we do not bring Ministers before us.  I think that has only happened once.  Dealing with this issue is definitely within our remit.  Mr. Watt's letter reads:</p><blockquote>I understand that you have also invited Mr. Paul Quinn, Chief Procurement Officer, Office of Government Procurement, which is a Division of my Department, to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  As is normal, I will notify the Committee secretariat of the departmental officials attending with me in advance of the meeting.</blockquote> <p>To whom is it &quot;normal&quot;?  It is not normal to us.  When we invite certain Departments and Accounting Officers, they can bring whoever they want.  On many occasions, however, we have asked specifically for certain officials.  This is not just about the national children's hospital.  The gentleman in question is head of the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  While the OGP is within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it is an office in its own right.  Mr. Quinn is the most senior procurement officer in the country.  We are concerned with issues about the children's hospital and how it was dealt with, but there is a wider issue concerning processes which we need to investigate.  If what has happened with the children's hospital is in any way exemplary, there are wider process issues in the way major contracts are awarded, dealt with and managed.</p><p>Mr. Watt will appear before the committee.  We must specifically insist that the head of the Office of Government Procurement appears as well.  I do not mind whether he appears with Mr. Watt or in a separate session.  In fact, appearing in a separate session might be a good thing.  It is for this committee to decide which sessions we want people to attend, not for anybody else.  We decide the format of our meetings.</p><p>In addition, as part of this discussion we need to hear from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of Government Procurement.  We will obviously ask questions concerning the hospital, but we should also ask about the process that is followed with all other projects.</p><p>It is the full-time job of several officials in the Department of Health to manage the health Vote.  I would also like those officials to attend, along with their Secretary General.</p></speech>

There are officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform whose full-time job is to manage the health Vote, one of the largest Votes in the Government.  I am specifically requesting that the committee invite them to appear if we can find out who they are.  I think there are two of them, but there may be one.  I am open to correction.</p> <p>  I agree with the previous speaker.  Members of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board appeared before this committee.  We need to question its members again, along with the Secretary General, in the very near future.  Given the volume of information that has since entered the public domain, the questions we asked and the answers we were given are no longer the totality of what we need to know.

We have heard from the Joint Committee on Health.  I am making it clear, as Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts, that each of those committees had an opportunity to deal with these issues long before they ever came before the Committee on Public Accounts.  They deal with these matters at their Estimates hearings.  There was nothing preventing those committees from dealing with the prison Vote or the capital plan for the HSE as it relates to the children's hospital when they were discussing their Estimates in recent years.  I do not know what level of discussion they had, but the issues have now landed on our desk.  They all had the opportunity to raise these matters long before they landed on our desk, had they chosen to do so.</p></speech>

The correspondence is noted and will be published.  We have decided on the appropriate action to be taken.</p><p>Item No. 1990, correspondence received from the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, and item No. 1991, correspondence received from the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, are noted, as is item No. 1984, correspondence received from the Chief Procurement Officer.</p><p>Item No. 1985 is correspondence received from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing an update on the review by the OECD of valuing capital assets and moving to accrual accounting.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  In addition to it, there is an attachment, item No. 1985(2)B that deals with the report on employer contributions under the single public service pension scheme which some people will find interesting.  Now that the public service has moved to the single public service pension scheme there are issues as to whether some State bodies are included in the scheme.  The report confirms that relevant authorities - confirmed as being authorities mainly financed directly or indirectly from the Central Fund - do not have to make employer PRSI contributions.  The report lists various bodies in the schedule, Appendix No. 1, which we will publish.  Appendix No. 2 deals with 24 bodies which have been confirmed as mainly self-financing but which are liable for the making of single scheme employer contributions.  The 24 bodies include the National Milk Agency, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported that they should have been making contributions since the Act was passed in 2013.  Some of the bodies have made provision for the contributions, but the last paragraph on page 4 is disconcerting.  It reads:</p><blockquote>In total, 20 bodies have agreed to remit arrears in respect of prior years.  However, there are four public service bodies that did not provide an employer contribution for pre-existing public service pension schemes, but are deemed liable for employer contributions under the Single Scheme.  These bodies did not set aside amounts to meet the Single Scheme employer contributions.  These are the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), the Dental Council and the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAl).  Issues arising in respect of the payment of arrears of employer contributions by these bodies are currently under consideration.</blockquote> <p>The committee will ask that the issue be dealt with and finalised in the current year.  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General like to comment on it?</p></speech>

I picked out the same paragraph.  What is the liability?  Is it likely to have an impact on bodies' ability to deliver services - for example, the Residential Tenancies Board - and is there a repayment schedule for them?  Have they even agreed to one?</p></speech>

They are in discussions on how this matter will be resolved.  They have not yet made decisions.  In many cases, because they are recovering their costs from those who pay fees or charges, one would expect to see an increase in fees or charges in order to make the repayments.</p></speech>

The Dental Council of Ireland has not yet finalised its agreement - I think of all the orthodontic treatment being provided - while the Health Products Regulatory Authority has agreed to remit an amount which has not yet been finalised.

The bodies have to recover an amount from external sources.  On the expected liability on those who purchase the services, for want of a better description, is it the case that the bodies will have to go back to service users to ask them to pay more than they had expected to pay?</p></speech>

However, the matter has not yet been resolved.  In the individual audits of the agencies we were picking up that there was a matter in dispute.  As the quantum had not been determined, provision was not made in the financial statements.  We did not know how big the problem was because the full scope was not clear.  The fact is business continued from 2013 without the collection being made.</p></speech>

It might be helpful to members if I indicated the scale of the moneys to which we are referring.  The lowest amount I can see on the list is for the Teaching Council of Ireland, for which the figure is &euro;60,000, whereas the Commission for Communications Regulation had to make arrears payments totalling &euro;1.13 million.  The repayments for the organisations can be in the hundreds of thousands of euro or less, but they will have to fund them and it is an issue for them.</p></speech>

For example, the income of the Residential Tenancies Board comes from landlords' registration fees.  Landlords who registered paid the registration fee and were legally right in what they did; it is the landlords who do not register are the problem.  The ones who registered were told that the fee was &euro;150 or whatever it was.  Now the RTB has to go back and state the fee should have been &euro;155 or &euro;160.  That is a highly unusual position for an organisation to find itself in.  Essentially, in the absence of the RTB being able to do so, I am concerned that it may affect its ability to deliver in its gigantic body of work, the volume of which is greater than it is currently able to carry out in a timely way.</p></speech>

We will follow through and write to the four groups mentioned in the schedule about the issue.  I thank the Deputy for following through on the point.</p> <p>  Item No. 1969 is correspondence sent to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the organisation Former Local Authority Members &Eacute;ire, FLAME, about the winding up of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.  We note the correspondence which is extensive and was copied to us.  The committee needs to take no action on the matter.</p> <p>  Item No. 1970 relates to property purchase and a decision made by the Property Registration Authority.  The individual is unhappy with the outcome.  However, the matter is not within the remit of the committee.  The person concerned had an issue with how the Property Registration Authority had dealt with title deeds and took the case to the Ombudsman.</p><p>She wrote to the Ombudsman seeking assistance on the matter but because the Property Registration Authority of Ireland, PRAI, had said in its response that she could appeal to the courts it looks as if the Ombudsman said she still has an option.  However, that is not an option in the public service.  What I want to do is write to the Ombudsman to ask not about the particular case but to set out the process on how it deals with cases from the PRAI.  I will ask what the office deems a case it can take up or whether it requires people to go to court before coming back to the Ombudsman.  That should not be the case.  We will write to the Ombudsman for a general note on how it deals with cases in that organisation, but we are not dealing specifically with the case at hand.  We will note that.</p><p> No. 1986C is from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien in relation to the national paediatric hospital development board.  The paediatric hospital will be on our work programme so we will note it and agree to discuss it in our work programme.</p><p> No. 1988C is a copy for the committee of correspondence with the solicitors disciplinary tribunal.  That is not under any circumstances within the remit of the committee so we will note the item.</p><p> Next, we will deal with statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  We will move quickly through that.</p></speech>

It relates to a report on companies in Cork Institute of Technology, CIT.  I have requested on numerous occasions a report on the CIT companies on which a commitment was given at the committee.  We have written a number of times.  I have again written to the committee asking for the report because it is outstanding for so long it is ridiculous.  It did not come up under correspondence.</p></speech>

This could be going on for up to a year.  It is going on at least six months.  It is strange that it did not come up in correspondence.  The report has been promised on a number of occasions and there has been a number of deadlines.  There should not be a major delay with the report and it is deeply concerning to me that it is taking this amount of time.  Could we please write a final letter to CIT saying we want the report by next week&rsquo;s meeting?</p></speech>

The Local Loans Fund, which is winding down, got a clear audit opinion.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland got a clear audit opinion.  The Travellers Protection Fund Investment Account got a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The main purpose of our meeting is to deal with the Kildare Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, 2015 accounts.

The Legal Services Regulatory Authority was established on 1 Oct 2016 and this is its first set of financial statements covering the 15 months to 31 December 2017.  It got a clear audit opinion.  The Law Reform Commission got a clear audit opinion.  Oifig Chomisin&eacute;ir na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la got a clear audit opinion.  Mary Immaculate College got a clear audit opinion but attention is drawn to non-compliant procurement of &euro;524,000.  The Comptroller and Auditor General refers to the matter at the end of the financial statement.</p> <p>  Next, we will discuss the work programme.  Today, we have the Kildare Wicklow ETB financial statements and the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report and also the Thorn report.  The witnesses will come in shortly.  The matter is subject to Garda investigation and we must be careful in that regard.</p> <p>  In the afternoon session we will deal with housing issues.  We will have representatives from the Irish Council for Social Housing and the Approved Housing Body Interim Regulatory Committee.</p> <p>  Next week, on 28 February, we will deal with housing matters again.  We will have the Secretary General before the committee in the morning to discuss housing matters and in the afternoon we will deal with the remainder of the Vote concerning the Local Government Fund.  At that point we will conclude this section of the work on housing and we will include it in our next interim report.  We had a meeting with them some time ago, today's meeting is helpful, and we will conclude then after that with our interim report.</p> <p>  On 7 March we will have Robert Watt, Paul Quinn and others to discuss oversight and implementation of capital projects.  Paul Quinn will specifically discuss the role of the Office of Government Procurement, and officials in relation to the national paediatric hospital development board.</p> <p>  On Thursday, 14 March we have a small matter we did not get to include in the discussion on the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach on the previous occasion, relating to the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  I propose on that day we finish our work on broadband and have the Department back in.  We had it in on 6 December and we had the private individuals in.  We have received correspondence outlining the position in regard to state aid and we will ask for further information.  There is no point in us closing the stable door after the horse has bolted in the sense that the tender has been out there since-----</p></speech>

Somewhere along the line, a good while ago, we decided that it was strictly turnabout so I sat back then and just waited for my name to pop up.  Sure enough it has not been popping up and that just occurred to me but I got a call last week to ask if I would be second speaker on a particular matter so I agreed and I asked the member of secretariat who called me what way that works now.  I was informed that some members had expressed a special interest in a particular matter so they were the leads on that.  I said that I did not really realise that rule had been reintroduced and if that is the rule that is fine, we will all be up early in the morning and pick the meetings that we want to be leads on.  I certainly would have had an interest in the Irish Prison Service, for example, and I stayed on that evening to get extra time and that is fine.  However, funnily enough I was told at that meeting that I was pencilled in to lead on the meeting of 7 March and I noticed that two colleagues are in for 7 March, ironically from the same party as me but I am sure that is coincidental.  The identity of the witness for that meeting is not being lost on me and it is probably appropriate to mention the contents of a newspaper article last Sunday about a report being commissioned by two other committees which seemed to be about this committee and something of a co-ordinated effort to question the Committee of Public Accounts, its remit, its performance, the styles of individuals and all of that kind of stuff.  Is the Chairman aware of-----</p></speech>

I think one of the committees in question is the Business Committee.  I understood that the Business Committee sets the business for the House and determines that there will be statements on X on such a day and on Y on such a day, that this speaker will have two minutes and lead spokespeople will have ten minutes etc. so I wonder what remit it has in procuring a report on the Committee of Public Accounts and what terms of reference were laid out on that?  I know the Committee on Procedures and Privileges may have a remit in that regard but as a committee we are entitled to know what is going on, what terms of reference are being used, who prepared the report and what is the <i>modus operandi</i>here.  That is an aside and I am finished with that issue.</p><p>On lead speakers, let there be one rule or let there not be one rule and if it is turned about it is turned about or if we can express that we want to lead then tell us we can do so because I was phoned and told I was in on 7 March and I notice that I am not here now.  I do not particularly have a problem with that but we should decide what we are doing and stick to it because we do not want the perception that lead speakers are being managed.  I could be forgiven for thinking that might be the case.</p></speech>

I do not appear anywhere on anything either as first, second or third lead.  I have a particular interest in many issues but that is neither here nor there.  The system of working in turn was very straight and just.  Members take their turns and sometimes we have a particular interest in an issue and sometimes we do not but it makes us do the work anyway if we have a particular interest rather than picking and choosing.</p></speech>

In fairness, we regularly get phone calls on this.  I often get called and asked if I will step in and be first speaker or second speaker because a member is not going to turn up.

I want to see that.  We had the view that it should be done by rotation so that everybody gets an equal opportunity.  There will always be somebody who is in line for a meeting and they cannot make it so they phone in and somebody has to step in but they should really be swapping and moving back down the list.  We have a job of work to do to get this end of it right.</p></speech>

That is logical.  There should be rotation and no party should get the first two spots but they can come in later on.  Do we get where we want to go with this?

There was that issue and there was the issue of the reports being done on us which the Chairman might come back to us on.  The third issue is the Irish Prison Service.  We got the response last week and I raised some issues and further issues have arisen since.  I wanted to respectfully ask that we pick a date for a meeting of decent length.  I do not know if members will have the time and I know the schedule is tight but we need a dedicated meeting on issues that have emerged.  The document that has come back falls well short of the sort of response that we need.  I will not hold up the meeting and begin to list them because we would be here until 4 p.m. but we need a full day on the Irish Prison Service and we should not bury it within the appropriation accounts of the Department overall.  It should not be on the day we are dealing the Department of Justice and Equality Vote because there are too many matters there.  I ask that a date be scheduled for that in early course and that might be communicated to us.</p></speech>

Is there any update on the issue that Deputy MacSharry raised about the committee of oversight for IBRC?  We are talking about a very large amount of money.  Mr. McCarthy might remember there is a court issue and there was to be some consideration given to whether there could be a more satisfactory arrangement whereby we would look at this as opposed to it proceeding in the courts.  Can we have an update on that?</p></speech>

The oversight of it is with the Department of Finance as opposed to being supervised by the courts.  It is a big issue and sometimes we deal with issues that are relatively small, in monetary terms in comparison with something like this.  This is a big item and I am unhappy that we have not arrived at a conclusion at this stage about whether there should be an expansion, for example, in this committee having oversight or there being a committee of oversight.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General confirmed to me that Irish Water was another case where a significant amount of assets, &euro;11 billion worth, were transferred from the local authorities to Irish Water.  There is a big capital budget.  Mr. McCarthy told us before that negotiations are ongoing between the Department and his office about the extension of oversight by the Committee of Public Accounts of Irish Water.  When does he think that will come to a conclusion?  There is a gap there in a fairly significant organisation.</p></speech>

This committee formally recommended the establishment of a committee of inspection in one of our work reports.  To my knowledge, that recommendation has never been responded to.  I asked the Taoiseach in questions on promised legislation in the D&aacute;il if he could give an update on that and if it has happened.  He said he was not in a position to tell me but that he would ask the Minister to respond and we have heard nothing since.  I support Deputy Murphy.</p></speech>

Following on from what Deputy Cullinane said, and to be clear, we need one session with Mr. Watt and, in the same session or another one, the head of procurement.  We need the two individuals who are over health spending in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We need the board to come back in and the chairs of the sub-committees, the Secretary General of the Department and the new chair.  We also need the assistant secretary of the Department of Health who did all the work on this.  I hope that is agreed.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

We need a session to deal with those and as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I was going to raise the following issue last week or the week before.  This committee, through the secretariat, has done a whole range of periodic reports.  This is more than a week's work but maybe by St. Patrick's weekend we can go through those reports and send letters to all the relevant Departments to follow up on the recommendations or actions in those reports.  We do not know if they have ever been dealt with.  I went through a number of them recently and I have no clue whether the recommendations or actions have been taken on board or acted upon.  Is it a case of drift with those reports?  We need to do a piece of forensic work in following up on the actions and recommendations of the hundreds of hours that have gone in here to bring those recommendations and actions about.</p></speech>

We have got a detailed response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on each point of every report we have issued so far with however many recommendations contained within across different Departments.  I think we went through the recommendations in public session, point by point, as to whether they were accepted.  We were not happy with the responses of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on several occasions.</p></speech>

The next point is that the periodic report for the committee's work from September to December is due and the secretariat hopes to circulate its work on that electronically tomorrow to the members of committee.  For people watching proceedings, that will not be a report of the Committee of Public Accounts that any committee member has an input on.  Rather, it is the secretariat's summation of the work to date.  That draft working document from the secretariat will be circulated tomorrow and we need to have a special meeting to discuss that which does not interfere with our Thursday meeting.  The only available slot is next Tuesday at 11 a.m.  It will take a second reading after that.  We definitely have to publish that before we break for St. Patrick's week.  We are telling everyone to get their reports in on time.  This report runs to the end of December and we are not going away in March without our report on last year's activity completed.  I ask committee members to pencil that in.  I ask members to try to read the report when they get it.</p></speech>

Members who want an input into that report have to be physically here to give their input.  The secretariat will then go away and draft the report and we will then finalise it.  We will not be circulating any of our draft report until the day we publish.  We will clear it in private session and then publish it as we have done for our most recent reports.</p></speech>

The letter states that local management was contacted and this is the answer, namely, that all vehicles are accounted for.  Part of the potential issue is that with the best will in the world, the Secretary General is the Accounting Officer, while the head of the Prison Service in County Longford is not, perhaps, fully up to speed with what is going on and he is dependent on local management which may not be as candid as it should be in answers to certain questions.</p> <p>  It would be useful for us to get on with a good exchange at the committee.

In the afternoon we will look at housing issues in connection with the appropriation account of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government when we will be joined by representatives of the Irish Council for Social Housing and the approved housing body interim regulatory committee.  First, we will examine the 2015 financial statements of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, as well as the supplementary report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Thorn report on that ETB.  It is very unusual for us to look at accounts that are more than three years old.  We have been in correspondence with the Department of Education and Skills which has stated sets of accounts and the report have been sent to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its attention.  I understand an investigation is ongoing.  It is appropriate, therefore, that we proceed in a manner which will not undermine the investigation in any way.  I ask for the co-operation of members and witnesses in that regard.  The reports in their entirety have been referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  What is being investigated by it is not for discussion here.  I, therefore, ask members not to ask anything about the Garda investigation.  Even if pressed, the witnesses are not to answer questions on matters subject to Garda investigation and should not feel pressurised to do so.  I will intervene to make sure nothing happens here to compromise the investigation or proceedings that may follow from it.  I will not allow the Committee of Public Accounts to compromise such proceedings.  We will have to be quite strict in that regard, but I believe everybody understands the seriousness of the matter.  </p><p>We are joined from the Department of Education and Skills by Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General; Mr. Hubert Loftus, Mr. Gary O Doherty, Ms Martina Mannion, and Mr. Phil O'Flaherty.  From Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board we are joined by Mr. Noel Merrick, chairperson; Dr. Rory O'Toole, director of schools; Mr. Joe Kelly, director of organisation support and development; Ms Caitriona Murphy, director of further education and training; and Dr Deirdre Keyes, chief executive.  </p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off all mobile phones fully.  Merely leaving them in silent mode will not prevent them from interfering with the recording and broadcasting systems.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  That sentence could not be more significant.  They have absolute privilege which is not to be abused.  That is very relevant in the light of the Garda investigation.  Nobody should attempt to abuse the privilege attached to proceedings in the Oireachtas.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Again, I stress the importance of that sentence.  I am not talking about names being mentioned, but I cannot allow lines of questioning that seek to identify a person or an organisation.  We cannot go there.  It is a standing rule, but we must be absolute and strict in applying it today.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy or policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol. </p><p>We will now hear opening statements from the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, and Dr. Keyes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.215" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#L00300"><p>As members will recall, I have outlined to the committee on a number of occasions the broad events that gave rise to the delay in carrying out and completing the audit of the financial statements for Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board for 2015.  In the end, we were only able to complete the work in December last year.  I have prepared a supplementary report on the relevant events, in addition to the normal format audit opinion, as provided for in section 7(4) of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.</p><p>The report deals with serious lapses in controls over procurement of a number of capital projects and certain other expenses in KWETB during 2015.  In that year, the ETB had receipts of over &euro;111 million and expenditure of &euro;109 million.</p><p> Some further context may be helpful to the committee.  Members will recall that the ETBs were established in July 2013, usually involving the amalgamation of two, and in some cases three, of the previous vocational education committees, VECs.  In addition, they took over the operation of training centres from the then F&Aacute;S.  The first period of account for the boards covered 18 months to the end of 2014, but there were delays in agreeing the format of accounts, a matter that was not settled until around October 2015.  In addition, new boards were appointed following the local elections held in May 2014 and there were further delays in some boards in appointing audit, risk and finance committees.  A new code of practice for governance of the ETBs was only issued in March 2015.  The combined result was a sector-wide delay in completion of the first cycle of audited financial statements, with knock-on delays for the 2015 statements.</p><p> We commenced the audit of the 2015 financial statements in January 2017.  In the course of the audit testing, audit team members identified concerns about certain procurements, project cost overruns and propriety matters.  A formal query on these matters was issued to the then chief executive of KWETB in June 2017.  The information and supporting documentation provided by KWETB in response to the audit query were assessed as being inadequate.  This was unsatisfactory, and so those matters of concern were brought directly to the attention first of the then chair and vice chair of the board and the chair of the audit committee of KWETB and, shortly thereafter, to the attention of the Department of Education and Skills.  The audit of the 2015 financial statements was suspended pending the outcome of any action the board or the Department might take.</p><p> In October 2017, the Minister appointed a statutory inspector to investigate the matters raised from the audit and some other matters that the Department had been separately pursuing with KWETB.  Arising from that inspection, a number of issues have been referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister has issued a statutory direction to the board about the implementation of a corporate governance action plan developed on foot of the statutory inspector's report.</p><p> We recommenced the audit process in April 2018 and reissued the audit query.  Fresh responses to the questions we raised were provided by the new chief executive, and these are reflected in the supplementary report and the statement on internal control.</p><p> Given the ongoing Garda investigation, I do not propose to recite the details of the specific instances of concern picked up by the audit.  More generally, the report concludes that the board was unable to challenge the KWETB executive in an effective way during 2015.  Underlying causes for this include incomplete information being provided to the board, delay in the establishment and functioning of statutory sub-committees and a lack of internal audit resources.  An effective process for review of internal controls was not in place.  Steps are being taken by KWETB to address these weaknesses.</p><p> It may also be useful to consider whether there are lessons to be learned generally for the ETB sector as a whole.  For example, while a key function of the boards of ETBs is oversight of their executives, they are heavily dependent on the same executives in the exercise of that function.  It may be worth considering whether, and to what extent, boards should have operational independence of the executives.  The committee will recall in recent months noting that, in issuing their 2017 financial statements, boards across the sector were critical of the level of resources available for internal audit and of the adequacy of the financial management systems they inherited from their predecessor VECs and with which they continue to operate.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#M00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  I will shorten my opening statement as I go.  I am joined by colleagues who have already been introduced.  My opening statement will focus on two areas, those being, the background to the circumstances of this audit report and the Thorn investigation, and the supports and oversight arrangements that the Department has put in place to support the sector in implementing good governance practices.</p> <p>  I advised the committee by way of correspondence in September 2018 that the Department was in receipt of the final report from Dr. Thorn, which was published last September.  I also advised the committee of directions issued to the ETB.</p> <p>  When we received from the Comptroller and Auditor General the 2015 financial statements and this audit report on 15 January, we considered them and arranged for the laying of them before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 13 February.  The Department intends to co-operate fully with the committee on issues contained with the report while also recognising, as the Chair has indicated, the ongoing investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We trust that the committee understands that, while our commitment and willingness to be open and transparent on all matters relating to the issues, including the publication of the Dr. Thorn report in September, are clear, we are also required to give careful consideration to public engagement on the issues.</p> <p>  I wish to be clear - the issues that arise in KWETB are of serious concern to the Department.  The responses that the Department received at the time of our initial engagement with the ETB in 2017 pointed to ineffective governance and accountability, particularly in respect of the use of public resources.  For that reason, the Minister appointed an independent investigator under the Education and Training Boards Act 2013, signalling that this was something that we considered warranted a serious response from the Department and that, when conducted under the legislation that created the ETBs, also permitted the Minister to take necessary action and direct the ETB to take appropriate steps to rectify any issue of concern that may have been found.</p> <p>  The investigator was given terms of reference by the Department to investigate all matters relating to issues of concern.  These broad terms of reference allowed the investigator to review any other matter that came to his attention in the course of the investigation.</p> <p>  Dr. Thorn made a number of findings.  The committee will be aware that his report is included in an appendix to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  In summary, Dr. Thorn found that, regarding the ETB's governance procedures, adequate arrangements to manage procurement and conflicts of interest were in place according to documented procedures.  On an operative basis, however, the implementation of procurement processes and management of projects in several instances was found to be flawed or suboptimal.  He further found that the board of the ETB should have been more proactive in ensuring oversight of its management of projects.</p> <p>  The Department issued his report to the board of the ETB.  The board fully accepted the findings and set out an action plan.  The Minister, acting under his powers by virtue of section 41 of the ETB Act, issued directions with which the board was required to comply.  These directions included a request for the board to review the initial action plan presented to the Department in light of Dr. Thorn's findings and to implement a final action plan, to be agreed with the Department.  The board was also required to review the measures in place in the ETB to prevent conflicts of interest and inappropriate interventions in processes relating to procurement, contract and project management, and to provide mandatory governance training to new and existing board members.  The board was also required to conduct a self-evaluation with appropriately qualified external input and to provide regular updates to the Department.</p> <p>  Having actively engaged with KWETB since the Thorn report, the Department is aware that the board, the new chief executive and the executive staff are adopting a pro-active approach to improving governance arrangements and addressing matters of concern.  The ETB has provided the Department and, I understand, the committee with an update on its corporate governance programme, which incorporates the updated action plan.  This identifies a robust programme covering not just the directions issued by the Minister, but other governance matters considered by the board to support good governance.  The ETB has indicated to the Department its intention to revise this plan further to take account of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the revised code of governance for the ETBs, which was updated and issued in January.</p> <p>  Regarding supports and oversight arrangements for the sector as a whole, the ETB sector has undergone significant reforms in recent years.  The decisions to move from 33 VECs to 16 ETBs, to incorporate new responsibilities for training provision and to establish SOLAS have seen unprecedented change, with consequential structures and support mechanisms needed to support them.  These changes include: a legislative reform programme; a governance reform programme; the placing of internal audit on a statutory basis; and the establishment of Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, as the national representative body for the sector, which plays a critical role in the Department's reform programme for ETBs and the development and implementation of sectoral policies and arrangements for ETBs.</p><p> Another important change is the way in which the ETBs prepare financial statements.  They are now on a calendar-year basis and use a common and agreed template to ensure consistency of reporting and layout in that presentation.  The Department acknowledges that there had been delays in ETBs submitting their financial statements ahead of statutory deadlines, and significant progress has been made in recent years.  In the case of ETBs the statutory deadline for accounts is 1 April.  All ETBs submitted their draft statements for 2017 by that date in 2018.  In respect of 2018, the Department has been engaging closely with the sector to continue to impress upon it the need for continued compliance regarding the submission and the monitoring of progress.  The progress made since the establishment of the ETBs can also be assessed by the average time it took them to submit their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General, which has reduced significantly.</p><p> In more recent times the Department has focused on practical arrangements which support good governance in the sector, including the planned roll-out of shared payroll and financial services, the creation of a dedicated public service reform function in ETBI, putting in place a national procurement policy for the sector and enhancing supports on building and capital projects.</p><p> Regarding payroll and financial services, work is under way to move the ETB payroll and finance systems to a shared services model.  When the VECs were first amalgamated, work was undertaken to merge and stabilise existing payroll and finance systems in the newly established ETBs and to implement some interim projects to support them in the introduction of shared services.  In tandem, business cases were prepared and signed off to support the investment required in implementing new payroll and finance shared services systems in the sector.  The procurement phase for the payroll project was completed in 2018.  Procurement for the ETB finance project is under way.  The roll-out of the payroll project will commence in the second quarter of 2019 and is to be completed over the next two years.  It is envisaged that the roll-out of the finance project will commence in 2020 and conclude the following year.</p><p> A reform function was established in ETBI in September 2010 with procurement as one of its key initiatives.  Furthermore, a legal services unit based in ETBI was established in 2016.  The unit has developed a legal services framework for the ETB sector in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  The unit has resolved approximately 130 queries from ETBs and has developed a log of legal queries which enables the provision of management information.</p><p> The ETB sector continues to have high levels of participation in national contracts and frameworks.  In addition to individual ETBs utilising OGP contracts and frameworks, the sector has developed ETB-specific frameworks.</p><p> As for governance and compliance, a national procurement policy for ETBs was put in place in 2018.  In addition, this year will see the roll-out of a new corporate procurement plan template for ETBs and the development of a sectoral multi-annual procurement plan, which will help identify goods and services that require public procurement due to aggregation thresholds.  Upskilling of staff across the ETB sector is also being supported.</p><p> Another key area is better governance in capital and building projects.  Better lead-in periods are important in the context of ensuring projects are delivered in a manner that is fully compliant with Department requirements.  The summer works scheme is one example of this, and better lead-in times are now being provided.</p><p> The Department has established supports for the sector.  The Department's technical guidance documents and design team procedures provide ETBs with clear guidance on how school building projects should be designed and delivered, including in respect of procurement; the Department's planning and building unit provides designated contact points to provide support, guidance and advice to ETBs; and the Department is facilitating ETBs with access to project managers.</p><p> Regarding control procedures, prior to a major project being devolved to an ETB, a service level agreement is put in place between the Department and the ETB.  This agreement sets out in detail the governance arrangements for the project.  As part of these arrangements, at least two separate meetings must take place between the Department, the ETB and their design teams.  Through these meetings, and at other key decision points, both administrative and technical staff within the Department review the progress of the project.  Under the service level agreement, SLA, the ETB is required to submit monthly project progress reports to the Department which must bring to the Department's attention any issues that have arisen with the project.  The Department also sets limits for the ETB and its design team in respect of change orders.  The final account for the project must also be sent to the Department to ensure that the final cost is in line with the tender outcome.</p><p> As for smaller-scale projects, new enhanced project control procedures were introduced in May 2016.  These procedures require two additional interactions with the Department during project delivery.  The first is a requirement to seek approval to lodge planning permission, and the second is a requirement to seek approval to place a contract for construction.  These additional interactions with the ETBs provide additional oversight and assurance that individual projects are delivered in accordance with the project brief.  Further strengthening of these procedures took place from January 2018 with the submission of tender reports for smaller-scale projects together with itemised pricing documents.</p><p> The Department carries out an annual programme of compliance checks among schools and ETBs of around 120 devolved projects.  This involves visits to schools and ETBs and the checking of supporting documentation.  While these checks can identify issues with individual projects, the overall feedback on compliance is positive.  The outcome from this is made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p> Change is ongoing and will take a number of years to embed; the new ETBs continue to develop as single entities, adapting organisational structures and practices accordingly and developing their response to their new responsibility for training.  There is a demanding reform programme that is bringing measurable benefits to the sector and at the end of which we expect to have robust structures that will enable ETBs and SOLAS to benefit from the economies of scale generated by the reform programme and to deliver top-class education and training services to the public.</p><p> We also have a robust governance regime, which helps to support ETBs to embed good governance practice in the sector.  However, we are conscious that, notwithstanding having codes, policies and tools to support good governance, both the Thorn and  Comptroller and Auditor General reports provide broader lessons for the sector and the Department, particularly in areas of procurement and governance.  We remain open and willing to learn from these issues and to adapt and enhance our existing reform and governance measures.</p><p> I am happy to answer any questions from the committee on matters arising.</p></speech>

Some of the issues to which we referred have been dealt with in the opening statement, so it is good to get the feedback on the broader issue.</p> <p>  At this stage I call Dr. Keyes to make her opening statement.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.221" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Deirdre Keyes" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#N00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee.  Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board was established in 2013 under the provisions of the Education and Training Boards Act.  Its primary function under this Act is the better co-ordination and delivery of education and training in counties Kildare and Wicklow.  Equally, of no less importance is the regulation of that co-ordination and delivery in line with the statutory requirements of Government, in particular the Department of Education and Skills, SOLAS and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The ETB Act of 2013, the code of practice for the governance of ETBs, formerly of 2015 but replaced by the current circular of January 2019, Department circulars and ministerial directions that apply from time to time provide the regulatory framework under which we are obliged to operate.</p> <p>  Regarding the co-ordination and delivery of our education and training services, KWETB in 2015 was in receipt of circa &euro;111 million.  In 2016 and 2017 the allocation to KWETB grew to &euro;115 million and &euro;130 million, respectively.  In 2018 the total budget was &euro;135 million.  Almost 70% is allocated to salaries, with KWETB employing 2,572 staff, the majority of whom are teachers, tutors and support persons to our services and schools.  Our learners are the centre of our work.  We currently have 12,453 primary and post-primary students and circa 10,000 learners in further education and training.  KWETB has been a leading and innovative provider of education and training and is integral to the fabric of the communities in Kildare and Wicklow, both rural and urban, through the presence of our 25 schools - primary and post-primary - and one institute of further education.  Our further education and training is delivered in 25 centres and through various contracted training programmes, including apprenticeships.  We are responsible for the provision of youth services and social inclusion projects in both counties, in addition to supporting many other initiatives and services - for example, music generation, school completion and outdoor education.</p><p>We also provide a range of services to our schools and centres in the areas of human resources, corporate services and finance.  We manage 70 buildings and premises both for ourselves and other patrons.  Our capital programme in 2015 was is in excess of &euro;14.2 million and in 2018 this has increased to &euro;15.7 million.  </p><p> What we do is important and it is incumbent on us to take the responsibilities we have been given very seriously to ensure quality of delivery, support and progression for all our learners and importantly, value for money through propriety in our financial matters.  It is therefore of regret that the Comptroller and Auditor General and Thorn reports which are before the committee today point to serious lapses and gaps in terms of our required regulatory, financial and propriety responsibilities.  While the reports note there were arrangements and documented procedures to manage procurement and conflicts of interest in place, their findings highlight serious concerns and shortcomings on an operative basis in the implementation of procurement and other processes during the period of the investigation.  We accept these findings. </p><p> I am here today as the Accounting Officer of KWETB to give account to the committee of its general administration, in particular to respond to the Comptroller and Auditor General 2015 audited accounts and supplementary report, and indeed any other matters the committee may wish to raise. </p><p> While it is my intention to fully engage with the committee, there are a number of matters that have been referred to the National Economic Crime Bureau.  A criminal investigation of these matters is currently under way and as such, there might be topics that I and the other representatives from KWETB are not in a position to discuss.  I can confirm that we are co-operating in full with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that this investigation can reach its conclusion in as efficient and timely a manner as possible. Considerable resources and time have had to be diverted to this investigation.  Despite this, our core work has continued and I am indebted to our teachers, tutors, leaders and support staff who are committed to the service of teaching and learning in our ETB. </p><p> While acknowledging and accepting the seriousness of the findings of both reports, I hope that I can provide assurances to the committee that KWETB has set out to build a robust culture of corporate governance, building on the policies and controls that had previously been in place but strengthening them in areas of oversight and internal control in, but not limited to, the key areas as identified in both reports.  Our current corporate governance programme reflects the requirements of ETBs with regard to our internal practices and reporting to our board, our external oversight and reporting requirements to Government, committees of the Oireachtas, respective Departments, and the Minister, as well as other agencies and funders.  Particular attention has been paid to procurement processes and oversight, document retention and control, risk management, management of conflicts of interest, and other matters of propriety.  This programme now needs to be advanced in line with the additional requirements as set out in the new code of corporate governance for ETBs as issued in January 2019 by the Department of Education and Skills. </p><p> We are also working closely with the other statutory reporting and auditing authorities of the state as relevant to ETBs.  The office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is currently conducting the 2016 audit.  The ETB internal audit unit, IAU, has concluded its ICT and youthreach audit work.  The ICT opinion report has been sent to the Department and we are currently working on the management response to the youthreach audit.  The IAU have commenced a full internal audit of KWETB's procurement processes, procedures and internal controls.  This audit is both timely and welcome.  In line with any findings and recommendations of the IAU audit work and related reports we are committed to adapting our corporate governance programme, internal controls and risk registers.</p><p> The corrective and immediate actions that have taken place in the light of both the Thorn and Comptroller and Auditor General reports are of particular importance.  While the final Thorn report, "Investigation into Certain Matters in Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board", was not issued for the attention of the board and executive of KWETB until 12 September, it was noted by Dr. Thorn that the response of KWETB had been both comprehensive and constructive in the manner in which the executive and board committed to dealing with its recommendations and findings.  On the issuing of the report, the Minister, in accordance with section 41(3) of The Education and Training Board Act 2013, gave a number of directions to the board on the performance of its functions.  The board accepted the directions in full.  In addition to these directions, the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills also directed the chief executive, that is, myself, on a number of matters. Those matters related to a range of actions to which KWETB had committed as part of the recommendations made by Dr. Thorn, the expectations of the Department in terms of the delivery of these actions and the reporting and oversight arrangements that were to be put in place. </p><p> During the period from September to November 2018, the executive worked on its action plan for presentation and agreement of the board at its December meeting.  A final corporate governance programme was presented and approved by the board on 13 December 2018.  A full report was issued to the Department in January 2019.  An updated report has been prepared for the Committee of Public Accounts by way of a briefing paper.  A steering group comprising the chairperson, vice chairperson and members of the executive has been constituted to have oversight of this programme and to report to the board on its progress. </p><p> During what has been a very difficult period for KWETB, it is important to assure the committee that both the board and executive have worked hard to ensure that we continue to deliver on our legislative responsibilities.  We achieve this by delivering a quality service for all our learners; this at all times remains at the core of what we do.  All of our actions under our corporate governance programme are to ensure the best quality of experience for our learners, proper learning environments, physical spaces, adequate resources, both financial and human and ultimately value for money for the Exchequer.  We are fully committed to this and are fully mindful of the governance responsibilities that go with that. </p><p> As chief executive of KWETB, I wish to formally confirm my commitment to the highest standards of propriety and good practice to the learners, staff, communities of Kildare and Wicklow, Minister for Education and Skills and the members of the Committee of Public Accounts. </p></speech>

I have some brief questions for the Comptroller and Auditor general to begin.  First, he issued a supplementary report.  Is that very unusual?  Second, on the ETB structure, are they registered for PAYE?  For what taxes are they registered?  Do they have charitable status?  The third question relates to properties that may have been on the register for ETBs.  What work, if any, is undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General to ascertain value for money in relation to rental income to the ETBs and whether it stacks up with normal valuation standards for the annual rent roll in terms of what the property cost, and so on?</p></speech>

From memory, there have only been three or four in more than 20 years.</p><p>A point worth drawing to the attention of the committee is that there was a previous supplementary report in relation to Kildare Vocational Education Committee, again picking up on points in relation to difficulties with substantiating the procurement, the development of a school and the sale of property.

We pay the VAT over and then we pay the contractor tax at the relevant rate.  When the contract is first signed, we register it on the Revenue Online Service site.  When the payment is made, that is registered on the site as well.  Then we pay over the tax at the end of each month, or bimonthly in some cases.</p></speech>

We have analysed those subsistence claims for 2016 and 2017.  I assure the committee of that.  We are pursuing those subsistence claims which were outside the subsistence bands as prescribed.  We have prescribed travel and subsistence rates from the Department of Education and Skills in line with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regulations for all public servants.  Our travel and subsistence log is presented to the line manager.  There are internal controls over that and internal checks are made by finance.  They are only paid after that process has taken place.</p></speech>

If the moneys cannot be recouped, there may be a liability on the part of the organisation.  As I recall it, the difficulty here was that there was no counter-checking and no authorisation was done of the travel and subsistence of the chief executive.  In many organisations, there is a process where the chief executive discusses his or her expenses with the chairman of the board, but that was not happening in this case.</p></speech>

There must be checks along the way and I do not understand how something like this could happen in 2015.</p></speech>

At page 23 of the financial statements at A, B and C, there is a list of the various buildings that are occupied.  The rents on some of them seems very high.  The further education centre in Arklow costs &euro;250,000 in annual rent which seems like a huge sum.  Can I have a bit of background to a sum of that magnitude?

This is a very important question in relation to leases.  Our finance committee is currently reviewing all our leases and the expenditure on them and hopes to present a report to our full board at its next meeting.  It is a very significant area of expenditure and is primarily in the area of adult and further education and training where, unlike schools, we do not have permanent buildings and are in rented property situations.  That is being reviewed by the board and it is a significant cost in rent terms.</p></speech>

I explained the audit of the 2015 financial statements in my opening statement.  There were difficulties with the first sets of financial statements for the ETBs in settling the format of the financial statements for them, and there were a number of other issues.  That caused a knock-on delay so we were starting the audit of this at the beginning of 2017.  The difficulties that were uncovered in the course of the audit obviously delayed the completion of the 2015 financial statements and that has had a knock-on effect for 2016, 2017 and 2018.  We are currently doing the audit of the financial statements for 2016.  I expect we will do 2017 as well this year.  We will have to do 2018 and 2019 next year.  It is very unsatisfactory but the circumstances were quite unusual.</p></speech>

There was complete dysfunction in governance and oversight control.  Everybody was asleep at the wheel.  We cannot talk about what happened as we have been warned it is not allowed, but there are issues and concerns.  Where was everybody when this was happening?  It seems to have been controlled by individuals and executives.  Where was the Department of Education and Skills, the Secretary General, the governing board and the audit committee while all this was happening?  Somebody has to answer questions.  There was the Thorn report and the witnesses are telling us today that everything is hunky-dory, they have learned their lessons and nothing will ever happen again from now on.  How can we assure the public that this is not happening elsewhere?  There are many ETBs around the country.  Can the Secretary General comment on that?  The witnesses used lovely words, referring to robust governance, regime codes, policies and tools to support good governance, but where were those words in the last few years?</p></speech>

That is what they have indicated they have put in place.  We are obviously very concerned about the findings of the reports.  We were concerned when the Comptroller and Auditor General approached us about issues arising in Kildare and Wicklow ETB.  We also had a number of other issues ourselves.  When we put those together we had a concern.  We asked the ETB for responses and we were not satisfied with them.  That is the reason we advised the Minister and the Minister decided to put the statutory review in place.  Obviously the Comptroller and Auditor General paused his audit until that was complete and then took account of it.  Clearly, there are matters of concern, as Dr. Thorn indicated, about the effective operation------</p></speech>

We have sought to update governance arrangements to ensure it does not happen again.  We have put a number of elements in the code of practice, in particular the code of governance, to deal with issues that have come up in this regard and we will continue to do so.  We did that before the Comptroller and Auditor General's review was complete.  We will listen to the views of this committee and we might seek to update the code of governance further.  We have amended procedures on minor, small devolved projects and on big devolved building projects as a result of, among other things, the lessons we have learned in this regard.  We have not seen anything that would cause concerns that there might be similar activities elsewhere in the ETB sector but that does not mean we can take absolute assurance from that.  We are seeking to develop the role of the independent internal audit service for the ETBs further and we have a number of arrangements in the code of governance to examine issues.  We will be considering different types of thematic reviews within the sector to see if we have learned from the lessons.</p> <p>  The biggest lessons for me are: how can we ensure that members of ETBs have an oversight, and how can we ensure that the culture within an ETB, both members and staff, allows for people to look at other people's behaviour and where there are difficulties in that behaviour there are arrangements in place for a culture of challenge?  That is an overall governance challenge, and that is what we must examine.  The training we are putting in place on the code of governance will hopefully assist in that regard.  Obviously, however, the findings are very strong in both the Thorn report and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p></speech>

In the buildings area we carry out compliance checks.  We have an annual programme of compliance checks of 120 devolved projects across schools and ETBs.

The Department was already aware of the issues and was following up with the education and training board on the matter prior to the issue coming to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General as part of the audit.  We explained our position on the matter.</p> <p>  Reference was made to temporary accommodation for Naas community national school.  This was a school in prefabs.  It had demographic needs.  Two additional prefabs were approved to cater for those needs.  Separately, the original, older prefabs in the school incurred some damage in storms.  Emergency approval was granted to make repairs but there were concerns among the parental group about the suitability of the full school to be in operation at that location.  A decision was made at the time to temporarily locate the school at a vacant permanent building that the Department had built in Craddockstown.  We had earmarked that as an advance building for Naas community college.  That was a temporary move.  The prefabs were provided in the original location for Naas community national school but because of parental concerns the school did not go back to the original prefabs.  Those prefabs were then vacant and the education and training board had a demographic need for two prefabs in Maynooth.  They were relocated there.</p> <p>  The overall context when looking at this issue is the scale and extent of demographic growth in the Kildare area at the time.  During the past decade primary enrolments in Kildare have grown by approximately 20% while post-primary enrolments have grown by close enough to 35% or 40%.  There were extraordinary demographic pressures and it was not easy to manage and cater for these at the time.  That is the context.</p> <p>  The question of most pertinence in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General was the procurement process for the removal of the prefabs from Naas to Maynooth.</p></speech>

Obviously, we are working closely with the board.  Clearly, a matter as big as this has an impact on KWETB as a whole and on the head office in particular.  The board has to manage through all these issues and deal with the Thorn report and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General as well as supplying information for the Garda investigation.  That has an impact on the capacity of the organisation.  We have supported the organisation by allowing for additional staff at head office to engage with that.  That is a challenging issue for any organisation to work its way through.</p> <p>  From our point of view it is a question of devolving projects to the education and training board or advancing with the currently devolved projects that have proceeded.</p></speech>

There are particular decisions that can only be made by the board and that have to be referred to the board.  Moreover, the code of governance and oversight arrangements of the board and the respective committees of the board are set out.  The audit and finance committees are of particular importance but all the other committees are relevant too, including boards of management of schools and youth committees, etc.  These are the structures in place to allow the board to have oversight.  Perhaps I might talk to the chairperson about it.</p></speech>

A given number of meetings is required.  Again, that is set out in the Education and Training Boards Act.  The required number of meetings is set out for the finance committee and the audit committee.  Each of the committees has terms of reference.  The finance committee reports to the board.  The audit committee reports to the board.  That reporting arrangement is set out.</p><p>I know that in our case the finance committee reports more regularly to our board.

I know that since I came in, the board has met its statutory requirements by way of meeting, in addition to which it has had a number of special meetings.

Part of information gathering is that the information should be tested.  There should be a very strict internal control and then that goes to the audit committee to be checked and the audit committee reports to the main board.  The finance committee has done its work on the finances.  I do not think the Comptroller and Auditor General has found any want in the actual finances, as distinct from the procurement procedures and all of these matters.  As well as that, there is an internal audit unit, IAU.  My best information is that the audit committee did ask the internal audit unit to test the procurement procedures back as far as 2016 or 2017, but the IAU had other needs at that stage and that did not happen.  It is happening now.</p></speech>

When I see that sentence or hear about reassurance it does not help me in any way because what really jumps out from all of the reports was the confirmation in the Secretary General's opening statement that Dr. Thorn found that governance procedures were adequate and that adequate arrangements were in place.  That is deeply troubling.  Much of the opening statements from the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board and the Department are about the recent changes.  While these are very welcome, they were in place and this happened.  I have never seen this in the almost two and a half years I have been a member of the committee.  Page 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's supplementary report sets out key audit concerns.  I will not read them out but I counted 11.  It refers to incomplete documentation, documentation being held off site, inadequate information being provided to the audit team when it asked questions, including when it returned with further questions.  Before I ask my questions, the Comptroller and Auditor General said this is one of four special reports in the past 20 years.</p></speech>

That is what we are here for so this is a very practical application of it.  If Mr. Merrick does not have the information, I ask him to revert to me before the end of the meeting with the details of how many times the board has met in hotels, the reasons therefor and what notice was given to members.  Are the minutes being published online and how many sets of minutes have been published online?</p></speech>

We are here as a result of a special report which followed a previous special report, as well as Dr. Thorn's report and a current Garda investigation.  The scope of our questions has been limited and I am just asking practical questions on governance.  I am a great admirer of what I still call the vocational education committees.  I served ten years on one of them and they do wonderful work.  The whole principle and ethos behind them is wonderful.  I place them right up there with the universities.  They do tremendous work and I know many people, including in my family, who have benefitted from the VEC system.  Today is about governance, how something so shocking could happen and how it will be prevented in the future.  How many times have meetings been held in hotels?</p></speech>

I have looked at all of this and the lovely language but it does not take away from the fact that that language was in place at the time and all of this still happened.  One thing that jumps out is that the board was passive.  I am not sure if I agree with that but that is what Dr. Thorn said.  How does Mr. Merrick feel about that as chair of the board?  He was a member of the board at the time.  Can he help us with that conclusion and finding from Dr. Thorn?</p></speech>

It is very difficult for ordinary members on a board.  They are there voluntarily.  There is no backup or training.  I agree with all of that.  That is a failure on the part of the system and the Department of Education and Skills in not ensuring that.  I appreciate that the amalgamation went through too quickly, without any backup.  I know the shared services, which I probably will not have time to get to, are probably not up to scratch yet.  It has been brought to our attention that in Athenry, in Galway, it is extremely difficult and the staff are working under significant pressure.  I want to get back to the board because I cannot get away from the fact that everything was in place to stop this from happening and it did not stop it.  That is the kernel of it for me.</p> <p>  The board got legal advice.  Was it clear to Mr. Merrick as an ordinary member, and is it clear to him now, how legal advice works?  Who gets that?  I understand the chairperson got the legal advice.  Was that brought to the board's attention?  Did the board sanction that?  What would happen now if the board needed legal advice?</p></speech>

That brings me to Mr. Merrick who sat on the finance committee for a time.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General contacted the chair of board.  Mr. Merrick said he first became aware of this in July or August 2017 and all of this was a surprise.  How was it a surprise?  It strikes me that the external State auditor identified the weaknesses and not the internal controls within Kildare-Wicklow ETB.  The audit committee was surprised, the finance committee and the board were surprised and knew nothing, and yet the Comptroller and Auditor General's office identified these weaknesses.  How did that happen?</p></speech>

The Kildare-Wicklow ETB incurred significant expenditure with certain hotels without a competitive procurement process and subsistence claims by the then chief executive did not comply with regulations.

I would say that this is a complex process.  In any situation where there is discussion of taking an action against an official it has to be done with legal advice.  It is a very tricky situation.</p> <p>  Audit committees and internal audit capacity in an organisation are absolutely vital to the effective control of the organisation.  It is something that many of the boards have now, if one likes, come to see that for 2017 they were insufficiently supported in terms of internal audit and capacity.</p></speech>

To be fair to the board, a board can only work, as far as I can see, on information that it is given.  If information is withheld from or not given to a board or any of its subcommittees, the board does not work.  Was it the case that the board was not able to do its job sufficiently because it was not given sufficient information on many of the issues that the Comptroller and Auditor General dealt with in his report?</p></speech>

Obviously, there is an expectation that boards can ask questions.  Boards have an obligation to identify what information they need and to specifically seek information.  The fact that there had been difficulties throughout the years in respect of internal audit and, if one likes, the functioning of audit committees is systemically important and something that we must increasingly have an eye to.</p></speech>

Because we saw the settlement and the arbitration agreement resulting in additional expenditure, we wanted an explanation for the additional expenditure on that specific project.  It is worth making the point that, according to the board minutes, there was discussion of the speeding up but there is no evidence that anyone considered that this could result in additional cost.  That is an example of where, if information was not forthcoming that speeding it up will result in an additional cost, it would be perfectly reasonable for a board member to ask the board before agreeing to it whether the speeding up would have a cost implication.  There are learning points on both sides.</p></speech>

My final question is to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and relates to the Act, which underpins the work of the ETBs.  I imagine he would agree with the observations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General and me in this matter.  There were two supplementary reports, one of which related to the VECs, although there was some crossover with the issues that emerged at the Kildare and Wicklow ETB in 2015.  Dr. Thorn, who was appointed by the Department, published a report that made findings that were of considerable concern to the Department and the Committee of Public Accounts.  There was also the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report and a criminal investigation, which we obviously cannot discuss.  Through all of that process, how did an individual get redeployed and why were the powers of suspension and removal never acted on?  Notwithstanding the criminal investigation that is ongoing, is that a reasonable question to ask given that the Act was designed to ensure that power was available?</p></speech>

It was a matter for the VEC at the time to consider any disciplinary process for the CEO.  I am not aware that a disciplinary process was considered and the Department certainly did not raise a disciplinary process with the VEC at the time.</p> <p>  There are some parallels between the issues but it is not an exact continuation.  It is important to note that there was follow-up after 2012.  There was an internal audit review of procurement in the VEC that was subsequently given to the ETB when it was established.  That was one of the reasons the ETB's internal audit service decided not to have a further procurement audit.  It had effectively just done a procurement audit.  There were management findings which would be considered by the audit committee in terms of their effective implementation.  The Department did not conclude a view on this matter until the Thorn report was completed.  That report was completed and published after the former CEO had retired.  There was no necessity for the ETB or the Department to consider, nor would it have been possible, to consider.  I do not think there was enough of an outcome.  I think it was only after the Thorn report and the follow-on Comptroller and Auditor General report that the issue could possibly have been considered, whatever that consideration might have been but that is a matter for the ETB. </p></speech>

I have not met the new CEO.  We have been in correspondence but we have not formally met.  I wish him well.  I realise he is accounting for things that happened before his time.  I acknowledge the huge demographic pressures in both Kildare and Wicklow.  A very sizeable staff is employed by the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, and the education value of what it does is not in question.  In fact some exemplary work is being done and I acknowledge that.</p> <p>  The witnesses are essentially answering for the previous board and previous chairpersons.  Would Mr. Merrick accept that when any inkling of these issues came to light, there was a circling of the wagons with respect to how they were handled?

We were very shocked by it.  It all happened very quickly.  By October 2017 Dr. Thorn had been formally appointed to his position, so an investigation was ongoing very quickly.

Being very open to criticism of the organisation itself is part of that.  It certainly seemed that there were efforts by some members of the board to raise issues.

There was &euro;1.9 million of expenditure on ICT equipment.  Somebody who had previously worked on the VEC on a short-term basis got that contract.  A second issue I want to pick up comes under the report's statement of the views of the Department of Education and Skills.  The report stated that the Department would continue to insist on adherence to proper procurement practices in VECs.  It went on to remind the VECs of this.</p> <p>  There was a code of governance and an understanding that proper procurement practices would have to be in place.  Special attention was to be given to Kildare VEC.  Some of the same points and some of the same language appeared in the 2012 report as appears in the report that has just recently been issued.  How does Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; account for that?  Where is this code of governance?  It is only as good as its implementation.</p></speech>

That went into detail on the initial establishment of the ETB and the procurement arrangements in place.  There was a management response.  We encouraged the internal audit unit to undertake that follow-up review.  It was very important.  There was a management response to that.  I assume that was considered by the internal audit committee of the ETB.  That is where the most disappointment has arisen.  We have also undertaken a follow-up audit of devolved programmes, which we also talked about.  We put a code of governance in place, which was not in place in 2010, and we have updated the code of governance in 2019.</p></speech>

Practice has developed significantly in the sector as a whole as a result of the various elements we have put in place, including working under procurement with Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, and so on.  However, there are clearly severe shortcomings in this particular ETB, which have given rise to the Thorn report and that of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

I will answer it in steps, if that is all right.  The Department is supported by an internal audit service that has had challenges.  It has engaged staff, but staff have moved on to other careers in the buoyant labour market for accountants.  It is engaging external supports at the moment and seeking to recruit further.  It is supported by the role of ETBI in procurement and training.  Should that be an absolute assurance?  I do not think so.  As the Accounting Officer I am equally concerned.</p><p>I have to work further to ensure that the governance is in place and is tested appropriately and we are still looking at ways of doing that.  I have talked through, in the background statement and the opening statement, a range of additional changes we put in place.  The question is, when we do all of those, are they still going to add to it.</p><p> The internal audit service is, again, following up on procurement in the ETB.  Would I have absolute confidence?</p></speech>

The ETBI is the body recognised in the legislation which has a role in supporting the sector.  They are really a critical piece of infrastructure in the sector to support the 16 ETBs.</p> <p>  There are two other points the Deputy had raised that I might just assist on.  The first relates to the roll-out of the training.  There is training available on the new code through ETBI which will be in existence for the existing boards in the knowledge that the boards will be refreshed following the local elections later on this year and there will be further, more robust, training rolled out in the autumn in relation to board chairs, audit committees, executives.  This is part of the lessons learned and the additional supports that we are making available.</p> <p>  The other issue which might assist the Deputy is on the internal audit unit.  The Secretary General has already explained regarding the resourcing issue but, separately, since 2015, of 75 audit opinions from the internal audit unit, only nine indicated inadequacies in controls, and of those, many related to the ICT issues.</p></speech>

I would have thought that was almost top of the agenda.  In 2010, the accounts led to a special report on what I accept is a different organisation, but a constituent part of this.  There is now a special report on the 2015 accounts.  We are talking about 2015 accounts in 2019 and we do not know what has happened and how the organisation has functioned in the interim.  The last thing this ETB can sustain is yet another shortcoming in the accounts and the running of the board.  In terms of risk, I would have thought that would be something both the Department and the ETB would have as top of the agenda.  Is it something that appears on the agenda every month?  Is it something for a special meeting?  How is it handled?</p></speech>

What I can help the Deputy with is that one of the 21 projects that we have as part of the KWETB corporate governance programme is the new code of governance, and that is very much part and parcel of that governance programme that we are trying to drive within the organisation itself.</p></speech>

We have prioritised the area of procurement in terms of our responses to the Thorn report and also as part of, as the director of schools has referred to, our corporate governance programme.<br/><br/>On our procurement process, we have adopted, since 2018, the ETB sectoral policy on procurement which is very, very robust.  Within that there are internal controls about a number of things that relate to procurement.  There would be procurement authority, financial authority, etc., and then the conflict of interest management is integral to the internal control around the procurement process and other processes.<br/><br/>We have our conflict of interest management procedure and I suppose that is in line with the ethics of public office where people declare.  We are very mindful of the fact that, in the context of the history and in the context of creating a culture of corporate governance, we must have a system for emerging conflicts of interest.  Therefore, that is inserted at various stages of the procurement process, and also the opportunity to disclose.  Staff are mindful of that.</p></speech>

We have 21 particular areas and a roadmap.  There are timeframes and deliverables.  We provide that report to the board on a regular basis, as one will see in the submission I gave to the committee.  While the code of governance is operational, it is equally important that it is embedded in the organisation, that there is an understanding of what is good practice and that there is a support programme for all staff at all levels, not just in head office but in schools and centres, etc.  There are still objectives to be met within our code of governance programme but we have commenced considerable work and achieved a lot underneath it to date, particularly in the nine or ten areas of concern that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report highlighted.  We have prioritised those actions.  We are monitoring it.  The project very much focuses on deliverables.  Mr. Kelly might confirm if that is correct.</p></speech>

We are determined not to just tick boxes and do things for the sake of it.  We are focused on the things that have real impact.  We have started by trying to identify what exactly we are trying to achieve and we work backwards from that on the plan itself.  There are a number of important items that are relevant to project governance to try to ensure that we deliver on the plan and that it is not just something nice that we put forward in front of people.  The first thing is that we have a steering group that is made up of executives, the chair and the vice chair of the board.  They will provide leadership, direction and project management governance for us.  We are working closely in collaboration with the Department to develop the programme in the first place and we will have quarterly review meetings with it in respect of progress.  We will also appear before the audit and risk committee for regular reviews of where we are and seek some input and value-add on areas on which the committee believes we might need to focus.  The board itself will be given regular updates and will have been very much involved in the creation and development of the programme.  We also use best project management methodology, which includes an internal project manager within our team, we have a sponsor from the executive team, we have weekly project meetings and we have a process that is important to manage the core and secondary project deliverables.  We also have a sign-off process to ensure we do what we said we would.</p></speech>

If an issue that emerges in an ETB does not emerge across the board, there does not seem to be a mechanism for that to be identified.  We need to examine these three issues nationally but there might be specific issues in an ETB that are not captured by the national audit.  If the group does an internal audit in an ETB, there could be a significant problem but it might not be subject to the audit.  When the audit committee makes a suggestion at local level, that is based on the flow of information.  The committee is discussing the matter, however, because there was not a flow of information into the audit committee.  I do not know how the Department can know if the audit committee does not receive the information about what it should be auditing.</p></speech>

The issues included the adequacy of the internal audit service, in respect of, for example, ICT and procurement.  Those are examples where the centralised internal audit unit has the capacity, because the issues were common across the ETBs, to bring that sectoral learning to ensure that what is learned in one ETB is carried across for other ETBs.  The terms of reference of the internal audit unit allow it to do specific audits of ETBs where specific issues have arisen.  To date, one of the potential challenges has been capacity, as we have spoken about.  At the moment, however, the audit committee with the five additional external auditors has nine members of staff between audit and support staff.  Even when its recruitment process has finished, it will have nine.  The challenges with capacity that were faced in the previous years will, hopefully, see an improvement following the recruitment process of the additional auditors.  Notwithstanding parts of the issues and the reason that it had to seek external support was the challenging environment of securing auditors, the internal audit unit has identified the recruitment difficulties, including the length of time it has had to advertise without getting responses.  The Department has given over &euro;300,000 to the internal audit unit in support.</p></speech>

The problem, however, is the issue that may emerge in an individual ETB due to something going wrong.  If the audit committee does not receive the flow of information from an ETB, how does it know something is going on?  If it spots something for which it would like internal support, I am sure it would take two years before somebody has the opportunity to address it.  If the internal audit committee believes there is an issue with an aspect of what is happening in an ETB, is there a facility for it to inform the chief executive or the board and commission its own external audit at whatever cost on an area of activity within the organisation?  If not, the Department has taken the ETBs' ability to respond to local programmes entirely out of their hands.  Does that facility exist and has such a situation ever happened in an ETB?</p></speech>

A particular company was employed to provide ongoing legal advice at the time.  The Dr. Thorn investigation then commenced.  That piece of legal advice ended at that stage and the firm was stood down.  The ETB was then entitled to seek another set of legal advice because an investigation had been started and under its insurance policy, the board was entitled to draw down the advice of a different company.  It took a while before all of the advice was available.  We asked for it early on and it was subsequently released in six or seven big folders.</p></speech>

With regard to the legal advice the former chairman obtained, I am going to say it was in a personal capacity, even though in his opinion he was seeking it on behalf of the board but without its approval.  When I say "in a personal capacity," I am not suggesting he went off and just obtained legal advice for himself.</p></speech>

The initial advice had been that the board be informed and that the best way forward was to set up a sub-committee of the board to investigate on behalf of the board.</p></speech>

Dr. Keyes has no knowledge of it.  Does anybody in the room have knowledge of any conflict of interest between the company that holds the lease for the &euro;7 million and anybody else involved with this?  No.</p> <p>  Following on from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's questions on the legal standing of the lease if the procedure was breached, if a contract was signed for this amount of money without board approval, what would the result be?  This is a very difficult situation to be in.  Taxpayer moneys have been committed without due process, as far as I can see.  We have heard Ms Mannion refer to lessons learned, which is a new term that must have arisen from a think tank or focus group somewhere.  I have looked at a lot of retrospective governance at this committee recently.  Mr. Kelly mentioned that he was very focused on ensuring that this did not become a box-ticking exercise.  Is it his opinion that most of our corporate governance structures until now have been box-ticking exercises?  For all the governance structures, rules and boards in place, at the end of the day we have a problem in front of us.  I take from Mr. Kelly's commentary that it would be his opinion that up to now most things have been box-ticking exercises and that he is trying to change things.</p></speech>

We are working very hard to try to fix those weaknesses and enhance some of the processes, procedures and practices we have had in the past.

The reason for governance structures is so that there can be accountability, but if the structures are in place and nobody is adhering to them, then to my mind they are box-ticking exercises.</p></speech>

There can be many practices, procedures and policies, but it has to be ensured that they are embedded within the organisation and become part and parcel of how we do business.  It is fair to say, from what we have heard today and previously, some of those areas have not been as strong as we would like them to be.  The cultural piece is very important to us, and it is at the top of our list in terms of our governance programme.</p></speech>

I was referring to confidence in the Department in relation to the 2010 accounts and the 2012 special report.  The Thorn report after that repeated some of the failures and shortcomings from the 2010 report.  I was asking about confidence in the Department's role regarding this.  It is not a disinterested party.  There is a lot of money channelled through the Department.  It issues codes of governance.  It issues circulars to say how things should be done.  It would be a great difficulty for me to say that I have confidence in the Department in the context of that sequence of events.  It should not have repeated itself.  The meeting has heard some additional information.  We have not had sight of the 2016, 2017 or 2018 accounts.  We are still in trouble on this as a consequence of that.</p></speech>

Can Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; say that he can express confidence in his role as Accounting Officer?  Is he confident that he did everything that he could possibly have done to avoid this?  Is he confident that the special observation that was happening did occur and, if so, and it was the case that a special eye was being kept on an area where there had been failings in the past, how did the events which transpired occur?</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that there was not a fully functioning expanded internal audit unit for the sector.  It is unfortunate that the governance of the ETB did not manage the work of the ETB, notwithstanding the likes of the internal audit follow-up report on the 2012 audit be completed.  We have a series of detailed follow ups with the ETB on major projects and minor projects.  We followed up on the major projects and we spotted a number of the things that arose here before they were brought to the attention of Comptroller and Auditor General and brought them to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

The meeting will resume on the housing issue at 3.30 p.m. rather than 2.30 p.m. </p> <p>  I have one question.  There were various issues including the Comptroller and Auditor General being unable to complete the 2015 audit.  We had the Thorn report.  I have a simple question that this committee asks.  Has anyone quantified the loss or potential loss to the taxpayer as a result of all these issues?  It is one of the first meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts where no one has tossed out a figure for a potential loss.  Has it been quantified?  I will ask the three witnesses individually.</p></speech>

It will be so historic.  From the perspective of a Chairman of a Committee of Public Accounts, justice delayed is justice denied.  The taxpayer will be denied if there is a loss.  It has already taken six years and nobody has been able to put a figure on the loss, if there is a figure.  In another few years, we might have a figure, or we might not.  I believe there is something wrong with the whole process if, six years after an issue arises, we do not even know if there is a loss.  The witnesses can understand my position.  They do not have an answer.  I suppose they will say to me it is a rhetorical question but they get where I am coming from.  I am surprised at the position we are in if these issues were so serious as to take up so much time.  Even when Mr. Thorn was sent in, why did somebody not try to deal with this?  Why did the finance committee not check whether we were out of pocket?  If the organisation is out of pocket, it is the front-line services, including the youth services and all the other great services provided, that are affected.  If there was less money in the organisation and something else got cut, that is what we are here to know about.  Six years after some of these issues arising, people are just beginning to ask the question.  The answer is that we will wait until the Garda completes its work and look at it at that stage.  I find that delay-----</p></speech>

It is frustrating but not good enough that it has taken so long.  I am not even talking about the old VEC, just this one.  I will leave it at that.  I thank the witnesses for attending.  It is a difficult kind of meeting when there is a report that has gone to the Garda but I am satisfied the meeting was conducted properly.  Nothing was said there that could compromise any investigation by the Garda or any case, if it arises in due course.  That was the important concern I had.  We have probably asked questions to which we have not got answers so we ask that the information sought be sent on to the committee as soon as possible.  We look forward to receiving the accounts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 in due course.  That is a little bit away yet but we will wait and see.</p></speech>

Before we proceed I wish to make one remark about our work programme.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had written to us saying he was available for 7 March.  We confirmed this morning that he will attend the meeting on that day.  I understand the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach is also seeking his attendance before it.  No doubt he will be able to attend both committees at a suitable time interval.  We look forward to seeing him on 7 March.</p><p>In terms of Accounting Officers, recently we had the Secretary General of the Department of Health before the committee dealing with the children&rsquo;s hospital and he also went to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health on another day.  It is normal that Secretaries General should attend their line committees and the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is not a case of one or the other.  We are proceeding on the basis of his letter indicating that he will attend on 7 March.</p><p>This afternoon we have representatives from the Irish Council for Social Housing and the approved housing bodies interim regulatory committee to help our consideration of the housing Vote, which we will be examining next week.  Neither of the bodies are accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts but are here to help our understanding in our examination of the Department's vote.  I stress the point that they are here voluntarily to assist us in our understanding of the housing issue.</p><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is joined by Ms Deirdre Quaid, deputy director of audit.  From the Irish Council for Social Housing we have Dr. Donal McManus, chief executive officer, who is joined by Ms Tina Donaghy, Mr. John Hannigan and Ms Karen Murphy.</p><p>From the approved housing body interim regulatory committee we are joined by Dr. Mary Lee Rhodes and she is accompanied by Ms Susanna Lyons and Mr. Pat Fitzpatrick.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off entirely.  That means putting them on airplane mode, as merely putting them on silent mode will still interfere with the recording system.</p><p>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Some of those present may have time commitments so we will take the two opening statements and then we will allow committee members to ask questions.  I invite Dr. Mary Lee Rhodes to make her opening statement, followed by Dr. Donal McManus.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleagues, Ms Susanna Lyons, head of regulation and Mr. Pat Fitzpatrick, approved housing body services.</p> <p>  The interim regulatory committee was set up in 2014 by the then Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, as a non-statutory committee to oversee the implementation of the voluntary regulation code for the approved housing body sector and to advise the Department on the development of statutory regulation.  The regulation office was established to implement the code, pending enabling legislation.  It sits within with Housing Agency and is overseen by the interim regulatory committee.  After five years of development and operation of the voluntary code, we have a robust regulatory framework to which a large number of AHBs have voluntarily signed up and which is being applied transparently, effectively and with meaningful consequences for non-compliance.</p> <p>  For brevity, I will henceforth refer to approved housing bodies as AHBs and the interim regulatory committee as the IRC.  As members will be aware, there are four statutory agencies with relevant oversight responsibility for various aspects of AHBs.  These are local authorities, the Residential Tenancies Board, the Charities Regulator and, for some AHBs, the Health Information and Quality Authority.  However, as pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his recent annual report, the AHBs nevertheless "function as arms-length bodies with their own legal status and with the capacity to transact business in accordance with their own constitutional arrangements".</p> <p>  Until the establishment of the voluntary regulation code, there was no active, centralised oversight of these organisations following their approval as AHBs.  The voluntary regulatory code was launched in 2013 and set out key requirements relating to governance, financial viability and performance management to which all AHBs signed up to the code are required to adhere.  The regulatory framework has developed over the past five years, with the establishment of the governance, finance and performance standards and related protocols.</p> <p>  Oversight has increased significantly through the regulation office and the IRC, and the AHB sector has demonstrated advancement relating to best practice and compliance across all areas of the regulatory requirements.  The current framework provides for an open, transparent, proportionate, and risk-based regulation based on the principles of comply or explain.  Larger AHBs and those planning significant growth are subject to more rigorous regulation than smaller ones.</p> <p>  Each year the regulation office issues an annual report and sectoral analysis with detailed information on housing stock, funding and finance, staffing, assets and performance management, thereby providing an important overview of the AHB sector.  More importantly, each year the regulation office reviews the annual returns provided by the AHBs and issues an assessment report and assessment outcome.  The assessment outcome is linked to eligibility for Government funding and is required by the Housing Finance Agency in order to approve loan finance.</p> <p>  In the 2017 to 2018 cycle, 83% of AHBs signed up to the code demonstrated substantial compliance, with 9% requiring additional written clarification.  Where areas of non-compliance relating to governance, financial viability or performance management were identified, organisations were required to enter into a process of engagement with the regulation office.  A total of 14 AHBs were deemed to require ongoing engagement to bring them into compliance.  Following due process and due diligence, three AHBs were deemed unsatisfactory due to significant non-compliance and the Department was informed of these.  As of September 2018, the IRC also provides a list of all AHBs in engagement to the Department.  Circular 15/2016 states that only those AHBs having received a satisfactory assessment will be eligible for funding from the Department.</p> <p>  However, a statutory regulatory body would have investigation and enforcement powers which are currently absent from the existing voluntary framework.  The absence of these powers and the existing terms of reference of the IRC limit the ability of the regulation office to go beyond deeming an AHB to be unsatisfactory.  In addition, the lack of a statutory basis for the regulator impacts on the ability of other Government agencies to enter into memoranda of understanding regarding protocols, a situation that can delay appropriate follow-up on significant issues.</p> <p>  That brings us to the other subject of this invitation, on the nature of the interactions between the IRC and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I have already outlined the interaction in relation to the voluntary regulation code and note that an official from the Department is a member of the IRC.  As stated in the introduction, the IRC has two main objectives, the second of which is to advise the Department on the development of statutory regulation.  That was a substantial element of the IRC's work to June 2017.  After that date, the ongoing work to bring legislation to the Government has largely been in the hands of the Department, with the IRC providing input on an as-requested basis.  A new draft of the proposed legislation has recently been provided to members of the IRC and discussion of same will be on an upcoming agenda.</p> <p>  At the request of the Department, the IRC is reviewing its terms of reference and protocols between the Housing Agency, the regulation office and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Those are being reviewed in light of questions around the sustainability of the existing framework in advance of the introduction of a legislative framework.</p><p>In conclusion, the establishment of the voluntary regulation code and the regulatory framework developed by the IRC and the regulation office has provided proactive centralised oversight of organisations following their approval as AHBs.  This ensures public investment in AHBs signed up to the code is safeguarded.  It also provides assurance to key stakeholders, lenders and investors that the AHB sector is well governed, well managed and financially viable.  The regulatory framework established has been successful to date.  It has, however, a number of limitations, as highlighted above.  It is important that the framework advances to a statutory footing, with the appropriate independent powers and functions, as soon as possible.  A statutory regulatory body will be of significant benefit to tenants, the AHB sector itself, the Government, local authorities, lenders and, in future, investors.  I thank the committee and I will endeavour to answer any questions.</p></speech>

The Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, is the national representative federation for housing associations.  Accompanying me are my colleagues, Ms Tina Donaghy, vice president of the ICSH and head of development with Fold Ireland, Mr. John Hannigan, ICSH council member and CEO of the Circle Voluntary Housing Association, and Ms Karen Murphy, ICSH director of policy.  We have supplied the committee with a number of background papers which I hope will provide members with further understanding of the sector.  I refer to two aspects in particular, the role of the sector and its engagement with other stakeholders.</p> <p>  The ICSH was established in 1982 by a number of voluntary, non-profit and co-operative housing associations that believed non-profit housing associations working together could play a more significant role in meeting the housing needs of specialist groups, such as older people, people with disabilities and formerly homeless households, as well as the housing needs of low-income families, using new housing management approaches.  These housing associations had witnessed social housing being provided throughout the rest of the EU by a range of not-for-profit housing associations and co-operatives.  That was in addition to housing provided by the public housing authorities.  It was felt Ireland was missing out in not providing additional options for those households in need of social housing.  </p> <p>  The ICSH has almost 260 members.  These comprise a small number of larger, tier 3, organisations, many active throughout the country, as well as a large number of smaller community or regionally-based organisations that have provided a specific type of housing service in a local community.  Approved housing bodies also work in partnership with local authorities in the refurbishment, rejuvenation and management of local authority estates, in urban and rural local authorities, towns and cities.  As well as providing and managing social housing, AHBs have provided supports to tenants to improve their quality of life.  In some cases, that has involved providing supported housing, and ensuring older people do not have to move to nursing or care homes prematurely, or providing supports to vulnerable families and children.  </p> <p>  Some ICSH members have been active providing rental housing for families since the 1890s, such as the Iveagh Trust in Dublin, and still continue to deliver new housing today.  The sector, therefore, has a long-term commitment to providing housing and investing in local communities.  By the 1980s, it was estimated that non-profit housing associations owned and managed around 2,000 homes throughout the country.  Much of that early success was achieved by local voluntary effort, such as raising finance and securing the donation of sites and properties.  ICSH members, also known as housing associations or approved housing bodies, have a social mission and purpose and assist local authorities in addressing housing needs.  The recent expansion of the sector from the 1980s, in providing homes and new types of housing services to address gaps in housing provision, was facilitated by the introduction of two State capital funding schemes by the then Department of the Environment.  They were the capital assistance scheme, CAS, in 1984 and the capital loan subsidy scheme, CLSS, in 1991. </p> <p>  These schemes yielded over 27,000 new homes, with CAS comprising over 60% of the total.  As well as being supported by central government and local authorities through the subsidised sites scheme, as well as Part 8 schemes, approved housing bodies also sourced sites locally themselves.  Those have delivered an estimated 6,500 new homes.  Output figures for the sector, contained in the background paper, show that delivery of homes by housing associations increased from a few hundred in the 1980s to more than 2,000 homes in 2009.  That was before the property crash and Government cutbacks in social housing expenditure.  During the 1990s and 2000s, it is estimated that housing associations provided between 20% and 30% of all new social housing annually. </p> <p>  Currently, within the commitments under the Government action plan on housing and homelessness, Rebuilding Ireland, the sector is earmarked by Government to provide one third of the total 50,000 social rented homes.  In 2018, approved housing bodies delivered approximately 38% of social rented homes via build, acquisition and long-term leasing.  In 2017, approved housing bodies delivered 2,330 homes, the highest ever total, through new build, acquisition and long-term leasing, more than 1,000 of which came through new construction.  This is a significant increase in delivery since 2013-14 when only a few hundred homes were delivered due to the reduction in capital expenditure and the elimination of the capital loan and subsidy scheme.</p> <p>  Since 2010, there has been a significant change in the capital financing of approved housing bodies.  A mixed funding scheme has been introduced comprising a capital advance leasing facility, CALF, and payment and availability agreements.  This includes a maximum of 30% State capital loan, with the remaining finance of 70% being raised either through the option of the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, or private financial institutions.  This new approach of taking on more risk through borrowing loan finance has necessitated significant organisational change and upskilling within approved housing bodies wishing to increase their capacity to provide more homes.  This transition to mixed funding for the sector occurred incrementally over 34 years in EU member states, whereas in Ireland we have fast-tracked it within five to ten years.</p> <p>  Since the economic crash, AHBs have been working with private sector developers.  An example is completing unfinished estates to make them available for social housing.  Alongside these new capital funding arrangements, there has been a range of new statutory, regulatory and compliance requirements for AHBs.  AHBs now come under the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act, the Charities Act and HIQA in some cases, as well as the requirements of the voluntary regulation code, VRC, and various covenants of financial institutions, to name a few.  These are in addition to the contractual requirements with local authorities comprising the terms and conditions of the capital funding schemes.</p> <p>  Importantly, there are a number of strategic issues which the sector is encountering and will be encountering in coming years.  These include continued access to sites to meet targets for delivery, the reclassification of AHBs as part of the local government sector, which is a particular focus for those developing approved housing bodies with significant delivery plans and that wish to reverse classification, access to affordable and cost rental schemes, the new statutory regulation framework and increased delivery of supported housing particularly for older people.  </p> <p>  The delivery of housing for people with specific needs remains challenging, particularly given the current restricted nature of homes available.  Different approved housing bodies within the sector have different ambitions and capacities.  A number of larger approved housing bodies are focusing on significant scaling up of social housing delivery using loan finance, as well as seeking to deliver additional forms of intermediate rental housing.  Others approved housing bodies are focusing on consolidation and succession planning.  Although approved housing bodies will develop in different ways, the sector will still rely on a coherent policy framework on finance and regulation from the Government to enable the AHBs to play its part in meeting housing needs.  We look forward to any questions.</p></speech>

I also thank them their opening statements and for being in a position to help us with our work in this area.  I will start with Dr. McManus and develop some of the points he made in this opening statement on how approved housing bodies are funded.  He spoke of the changes in 2010, I think it was, to a mixed funding.  AHBs, however, are funded first of all by a 30% upfront capital loan.  That is the capital allowance loan facility, CALF, which comes from the State.  The other 70% is then financed by the approved housing bodies themselves.  That can come from other borrowings, the Housing Finance Agency or a combination of both.  How does it work normally or what is the popular model?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1050" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Donal McManus" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#SS00600"><p>The dominant form at the moment is accessing loan finance from the Housing Finance Agency.  As the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned a few years ago, there was very little finance coming in compared with the Housing Finance Agency.  Mr. Hannigan will comment further on that aspect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1051" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hannigan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#SS00700"><p>It is predominantly from the Housing Finance Agency at present but these models of operation are very new.  Although the AHBs have been in operation for 30 years, given this classification, it is effectively a new sector.  There has been a ramping up of seeking to attract other funders to come into the market in the past five or six years.  We in the Circle Voluntary Housing Body, for example, have just undertaken a loan with Allied Irish Bank.  Other AHBs have utilised other pillar banks in Ireland and there have also been those AHBs that have used special purpose vehicles, SPVs, with foreign banks now coming into the market.</p><p>The reality is that classification has changed the way we look at things.  We need a broader base of funders in this sector to meet the classification requirements.  We are progressing that very quickly.  At this point, probably 90% of the funding is coming from the HFA, but over the next two to three years there will be a dilution of that through other borrowers coming into the market.</p></speech>

Much of this started in 1991 so the first stream of housing from that process will be coming into the ownership of the approved housing bodies.  Since 1991 these schemes have been funded primarily through State funding, yet the approved housing bodies will end up owning the properties.  While it might be illogical that they could decide to do something else with them or one might say that would not happen, essentially the State has no guarantee that these properties will remain as social housing.  Would that be a concern?  Has Dr. McManus's organisation explored or examined that or is it aware of any debate on this?</p></speech>

Where there is a mortgage in place for 20 years, initially with the capital assistance scheme, there are certain requirements the local authority housing has with the approved housing body for 20 years.  Some of those have come out of mortgage.  Where they have come out of mortgage with the local authority, the housing associations continue to provide the rental housing to the people on the waiting list.  By and large there has been no change for those organisations in terms of their <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>.  It is also because they are charities.  They are not in the business of selling off properties to make gain.  Their social mission is to provide social rented housing.</p></speech>

A special committee on housing was established after the previous general election and it examined a range of issues relating to housing.  One of the main issues was that we do not have enough public or social housing.  In fairness to the approved housing bodies, they do not see themselves as filling that gap for the State, but given that the State has not built a large amount of public housing, they fell into providing perhaps more of the social housing that the State provides or has some influence over than was intended.  The witness is correct that in some cases it might be unlikely that they would change the use, but there was some discussion in the committee as to whether there would be guarantees built into the contracts, given that the majority of funding is coming from the State, that the properties would remain for public or social housing, and if it was the case that an approved housing body was of a mind to vary the use, sell or whatever it is for whatever purpose, the State would have the first opportunity to buy through the local authorities.  However, there is no conditionality in it.  Notwithstanding what the AHBs may or may not do or the logic of what they might do, the fact is that there are no guarantees.  Once they have repaid the loan and they own the properties, they can do what they wish with them.  Is that the position?</p></speech>

The new regulation coming into place will help as well from that point of view.  It is a new regulation being brought in under statute.  That will help the process of keeping a link with the social housing by AHBs in the longer term.  We would be keen to have those options explored.</p></speech>

Will she expand on that point?  What role will the regulation play in terms of ownership of the properties, given that the State played a significant part in making sure these properties were funded and then they are in the full ownership of the approved housing bodies?  What protections are there to ensure those properties remain in use for public and social housing?</p></speech>

The legislation went deeply into that point and I believe a great deal of information was provided to this committee in another report regarding the disposal of assets.  How to deal with that in the regulation remains a key question for members of the committee and the Department.  On the other side, that specific point created issues around classification in other jurisdictions.  We do not have an ability to control that now and we could if it is written into regulation, but writing it into regulation has issues as well.</p></speech>

Each company is a company limited by guarantee and has charitable status.  As such it must have within its memorandum and articles of association that it is providing housing for vulnerable people or people in disadvantage or wording to that effect.  To get approved status in the first place, the bodies must have that in their memorandums and articles of association, and having it in the memorandums and articles of association is what gives them their charitable status.  It is an additional safeguard that exists already in charity law.</p></speech>

I believe there is a working group to be set up in the Government to progress it.  We have made submissions both to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and a working group set up under the Department of Finance on this.  I am not quite sure of the position with that.  In terms of the process, we looked in detail through the reasons for the classification.  In some of them the issues can be addressed fairly easily.  We thought some were probably more spurious issues.  Some are quite challenging issues in terms of the level of finance.  Mr. Hannigan mentioned the need to spread the level of finance to other financial options.  There are also controls around lettings and allocations.</p></speech>

The second part concerns the ambition to get it off the State's balance sheet.  I imagine the mixed funding model of 30% CALF funding, and then a bigger portion of the 70% of funding that comes from the Housing Finance Agency at present coming from the private sector, is in part, driven by the ambition to get it off the State's balance sheet.  Is it a factor?</p></speech>

The requirement is from a business perspective.  They are businesses as well as charities.  The requirement is to spread the risk in terms of having a single funder.  At this time, a large proportion of the funding comes from a single funder.  It is and operates as a bank.  Therefore, it has all of the same risks as any other bank might have, even though it is State-backed.  I have worked in the UK and Irish markets in respect of social housing for a long time and there are other mechanisms by which funding can be obtained at a much lower rate, which would be beneficial in the delivery of social housing in Ireland.  These models are different from using HFA moneys.  Getting it off the balance sheet is a factor.  It was off the State's balance sheet, but it is now back on it.  It used to be that for every euro the State invested in social housing, the AHBs could generate &euro;3 to deliver three times the amount.  This may be more restricted in the future.  It is not definite yet, but the signs are that it is likely to be restricted, particularly when there are potential overruns on one particular type of project versus another on the State's balance sheet and given the longer-term impacts this may have.</p></speech>

It is linked with market rents in a particular area, based on the local authority's understanding of what rents in that area look like.  It is usually marked below them, at 80% or 92% of current market rents.</p></speech>

Is there then the potential that the ethos of the approved housing bodies must change to suit the ambition to take the approved funding for such bodies off the balance sheet?  In other words, how do we get to the point where we take the approved housing bodies off the State's balance sheet without having an impact on what they do at present?</p></speech>

It is based on a number of elements that must be market related, not market based.  In other words, it fluctuates with the market in some shape or form.  That does not mean that we need to change the ethos of the organisations to deliver it.  What we need is a change to the mechanisms they operate.  For example, Circle, Fold and many other AHBs have been in existence for many years and are charities by nature.  They want to continue as charities and will do so.  A body does not have to be a non-charity to meet the requirements of the new mechanisms to receive funding.  What they have to do is change the mindset about how the mechanisms work.  It is complex.  As Dr. McManus pointed out, we need to work with Departments to influence the right people in the CSO and EUROSTAT to see that some of what has been said does not add up in some cases.  There may be other elements that may require to change or be marked differently for the facilitation.</p></speech>

He may have answered my next question.  From his organisation's perspective, does he support the ambition that approved housing bodies be taken off the State's balance sheet?  Having listened to what he said, is he confident that this can be done, if it is something he supports, without having a significant impact on how approved housing bodies are funded and deliver and how homes are allocated?  Does Dr. Rhodes have a view on the matter from a regulatory perspective?</p></speech>

Even in the private landlord sector, under the housing assistance payment scheme and the rental accommodation scheme, there is still a 100% allocation from the local authorities.  That will continue and we want to see it continue in terms of the partnership in place.</p></speech>

From a regulatory perspective and specifically the interim regulatory committee's perspective, we were established at a time when the AHBs were off-balance sheet and much of the regulation process was taking place on the assumption that the sector would be off-balance sheet.

It has been a year since it happened and the initial draft of the regulation was completed in June of that year.  It has created some uncertainty in the environment.  I have been a member of the committee for five years.  One of the main contributions the regulation could make is creating a stable, well regulated and well financed sector that could access private funds to deliver more houses without using Government assets.</p></speech>

It is very helpful to have a discussion with them before we meet officials from the Department.  There is a major housing crisis but we have so many agencies involved which is difficult to understand.  When I began to list them, I gave up.  How many approved housing bodies are there?  We also have the Housing Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, the Land Development Agency, 34 local authorities and the land aggregation scheme.  That is just the beginning of the list.  Coming from Galway in particular, where people have been waiting on the list since 2002, it beggars belief.  There is plenty of land in public ownership, including Ceannt Station, the docks and Dyke Road.</p><p>It is mind-boggling.  How many approved housing bodies are there in total? </p></speech>

I come from a background of thinking that local authorities should provide housing at all times.  The AHBs should be additional.  Housing should not be based on charity.  Charity should have no role anywhere.  That is just my personal preference on public housing.  In regard to tenure, I always understood that AHBs had discretion on the allocation of housing to tenants.  Our guests are shaking their heads.  I am delighted, but I did not understand that and I spent a long time at council level, much to my regret.  They have no discretion.  Is it correct that all the bodies signed up with our guests' organisations take 100% of the names from the local authority lists.</p></speech>

He or she will only pay the differential rent.  That is based on the local authority whose area the property is in.  Depending on what part of Galway it was in, for example, the property the Deputy referred to would be under the Galway scheme.  The contribution would be based on the percentages that the local authority charged.</p></speech>

The funding that comes via the payment and availability agreement is being used to build up an asset base owned by charitable organisations, whereas the HAP goes to private landlords.  That is not a public asset.  The model of the CALF and the PA agreements creates a charitable asset that can only be used for charitable purposes.  The HAP goes directly to private landlords, for the use of private assets and for private gain.</p></speech>

They will have planned maintenance, reactive maintenance and major repairs.  In December just gone, we released the performance standard.  In that context, the regulator expects AHBs to have a sinking fund provision in place.  That means a stock condition survey has been completed.

Over the four years that the regulation has been in place, we have seen an improvement.  This does not mean we can state that all of the moneys in place are adequate.

I am sorry for the delay in getting started.  I remember the debate on the voluntary code.  Some of us were very enthusiastic about making it a statutory code and being much more ambitious and quicker in doing that.  I understand there is a bedding-in period but I refer to the ability at the time this was debated to get European Investment Bank money and other moneys.  We were in the middle of a crash and it was early in the term of the then Government and it was becoming obvious that there was going to be a housing shortage.  Maybe three or four years before it became very obvious in some parts of the country, it certainly had become very obvious early on in the area I represent.  It was a lesson on where money can be got, rather than a matter of being told there is no money.  The European Investment Bank had significant funds.</p> <p>  One of the impediments at the time - it is still an impediment - was that because approved housing bodies are governed by the charities regulations, they were precluded from making a loss.  That was the impediment to being able to leverage the funds.  The witnesses have said the Department of Finance will have to be involved when the code becomes statutory.  Reference was also made to the ability to draw down finance.  How will the impediment associated with charitable status be overcome?  Does it involve a co-guarantor of the loan?  How will it work practically?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1403" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hannigan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#YY00700"><p>Most funders, when lending, require one to make a degree of surplus so there will be what they call "interest cover".  Thus, if one defaults, there is an amount of money large enough to allow the funder to take its interest, at least in terms of the year or period question.  There is a covenant requirement.  In the majority of cases, the funder does so much due diligence in respect of the organisations that the chances of a body to which it is lending making a loss should be reduced significantly.  Where a loss is made, the circumstances are normally considered over a period of time.  The Charities Regulator has also got to the point where, in any particular year, it is does not allow the organisation to budget for a loss.  It does not like the organisation to plan for a loss.  If it makes a loss, regard is had to how it has performed over a period and whether it has reserves that can cover it for the period in question.  Obviously, if an organisation continued to make losses over a longer period, it would probably go into a default situation.  The regulator would be asking why that is occurring and whether it is down to poor governance, poor management or financial viability issues.  Our colleagues behind us are expert in this area, as they have already demonstrated.</p> <p>  Overcoming the problem involves consideration of the value of the assets.  If one defaults, the bank, regardless of whether it is a State bank, the HFA, or another, will take possession.  That has never happened in this sector in Ireland.  Actually, it has never happened in the sector in the United Kingdom either.  That sector has been in existence for roughly the same time, but on a much bigger scale and involving much bigger figures.  At this point, we have a very well-run sector.  Very shortly, I hope, it will have a statutory regulation.  There is still quite a lot of oversight by local authorities and the Department in terms of each scheme that we have to go through.  There is a significant amount of due diligence work done by both local authorities and the State in terms of each scheme that we provide at this point in time.  The circumstances are also examined by the relevant third-party bank, be it the HFA, EIB or a private lender such as Allied Irish Banks or Bank of Ireland.  Therefore, there is a significant amount of due diligence done that I hope will mean we will not see a default that would put the assets at risk.</p></speech>

Personally, I do not have any issue with public housing or housing that comes from the public waiting list being delivered through voluntary housing bodies, approved housing bodies or others so long as there is security of tenure and the rents are regulated and affordable.  Can we have more of it, please?  That would probably be my call on it.</p> <p>  I am aware it was going to be tier 3 in the first instance, and then tiers 2 and 1.  In my constituency, I have quite a bit of experience right across the spectrum in this regard.  The bigger organisations tend to be the ones that run into fewer problems.  It might just be in my area but I certainly have come across serious problems with some of the organisations further down the food chain.  There have been cases where rents were not collected, insurance was not paid and there were very significant risks.  What is the timeline for the regulation of tiers 2 and 1 to give some guarantees?  There are problems and I suspect the regulators will run into serious problems with some organisations.</p></speech>

There are 179 tier-1 organisations and 50 tier-2 organisations regarding which we have visibility.  I mentioned earlier that we have a premise of governance and financial viability.  One of the key tasks of the regulation office is to ascertain whether organisations are operating with a surplus or deficit, whether they are operating with a deficit for more than two or three years in a row, what their liquidity looks like, and whether they are generating positive cashflows.  When we talk to the organisations, we indicate they will not make it in the long term if they are not able to pay in the short term.  We have come across organisations that have struggled in regard to financial viability for reasons that the Deputy identified.  Maybe they did not collect rents in the most effective or efficient way, or maybe they had a percentage of voids or had to pay a large maintenance bill.  When we are speaking to the tier-1 organisations, we speak in that language and ask them to ascertain whether they are sustainable, where the risks lie, how the risks are managed and how their financials are managed.  Regulation is not just about compliance; it is also about education and putting in place some management tools to help the organisations reach their objectives.</p></speech>

Let us say there is a fairly decent asset base and 30 houses built in the 1990s that are coming towards the point where there will no longer be a mortgage on them.  I have come across cases where bodies have quite a bit of money on deposit, more than they would require for a sinking fund, and where they are functioning very well, collecting the rents and all the rest of it.  What is the position on the reinvestment of that money?  The bodies cannot keep accumulating where the asset could be beneficially used for the same purpose.</p></speech>

These are independent legal entities.  It is up to the boards and executive to decide how and when they are going to reinvest.</p><p>Certainly, when we sit down with organisations and we see very high cash balances, we ask if that is the most effective use of resources, whether they be charitable resources or housing resources.  For the larger organisations, it would be asked if that fits with its treasury management policy.  There seems to be no benefit to an organisation just holding on to such moneys and not reinvesting and providing more homes where that type of money is available to invest in a community or parish to deliver more.  In some cases it may be that they do not have the capacity to do so themselves.  They may in fact be run by volunteers.</p></speech>

Progress is slow.  Fewer than 20 organisations have merged but the trend now is that more boards, for succession planning purposes, have decided to finish and to transfer to another AHB.  That has happened in a few cases.  It is small at the moment but we think that is a trend going forward to manage the assets over the long term.</p></speech>

For example, typically, the local authority sends a list of names that can be selected from.  Some organisations will do courses such as tenancy courses.  One criticism of the sector is that there can be a degree of cherry-picking and that the local authority will perhaps not do the tenancy courses and end with people who have more difficulties, and that is a more difficult situation to manage.  How would the witnesses respond to that?</p></speech>

If we do receive large numbers of nominations at a time, it is because we probably have a new development to let.  If a development of 20, 30 or 40 units at a time is being let, a level of refusals is being planned for various reasons.  That is the reason, on occasion, that we would be sent a list of names to allow for any slippage or refusals.  We work in partnership with the local authority.  We work, not only to house people but also to meet their needs, not only now but into the future.  We look at tenancy sustainment issues and whether people are best placed to create a new community, so to speak, so that there will be cohesion within the community and rather than putting people together who are going to cause conflict.  We work in partnership with the local authority.  I have examples from my own organisation where we have saved nominations that we thought possibly might not be able to sustain a tenancy in an environment independently.  We work with the local authority, accept the nomination and the referral, and work with it to sustain tenancies.  Sometimes they do not succeed but we work with the local authority as well to find an alternative that will succeed.</p></speech>

In terms of a social mix, where there is a very big development, although we do not have many obvious examples of that, as rather than hundreds of units, a big development would be perhaps 100, where does that fit in with the allocations policy?  I had understood initially that when those were set up, the 25% was to allow for us to get to a point where it is almost a cost rental, but that was not the case.</p></speech>

However, within my organisation we have larger numbers.  We will have a development coming up at the end of this year involving 103 units.  The intention is that they will all be aimed at older people, those aged 55 and older.  I do not think we have any big examples where we have delivered mass housing accommodation for families.</p></speech>

It would have been at a very set level.  It was never to bump up the potential income streams, as it were, or even the types of tenancies that might be there, and it was more to do with the social cohesion element of it, where there may be individuals who cannot live with others for a particular reason or who were not able to.  That element of the 25% is gone.  It is now 100% in the vast majority.  In our programme at the moment, we have about 350 houses which will be delivered in 2019.  Of that, probably about 60 properties come under CAS, so the kind of differentials there would be in terms of the numbers under that scheme can be seen.  Under CAS, we still take 100% from the local authority as well.</p></speech>

A number of tier 3 groups have been working with the ICSH to examine creating mechanisms by which private finance can be generated.  We have gone through several phases, the first phase was examining the feasibility of a special purpose vehicle which was worked through the PwC and the ICSH members.  We are now effectively into phase 3 where we have gone out to the market.  We have had term sheets back from private banks outside the HFA, and I can say that without a doubt we have had offers of nearly &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion worth of funding overall from that.  There is a huge appetite to work with the public housing sector in Ireland.  That is based on the fact that it is now part of a global market.  Investors from other countries, pension schemes and large equity investors, as well as our own pillar banks, see that there is a return that can be made which is reasonable spread over quite a long period of time, has good security behind it and, most importantly, that there is a professional group of people involved in the delivery and management of that public housing.</p></speech>

If we are waiting for a new build, that takes a while, but initially our project was to have the finance and also the vacant units and properties to deploy the money into those properties.  That is still is there.  If the money and properties are there, we can do that more quickly than going through the construction process.  That is where we started off the project from, that is, with vacant properties, institutions that wanted to transfer their properties, and having finance at the other side.  It is not always neat how that happens but certainly that is the objective.</p></speech>

Dr. Rhodes, who left when I was out of the room, made the comment that the funding was going towards a charitable asset, whereas with the HAP scheme it is for a private gain.  Following on from that, we hear that private funds have been invested.  What I heard an hour ago is slightly different from what is being said now.  On the one hand, we have a charity and, on the other hand, we have billions being invested in it.  We have headroom in terms of accounts and cash assets.  I had not intended speaking on this but I had a problem with this recently when I noticed an approved housing agency has an office in a very expensive part of Dublin and I wondered who was paying for it.  In terms of auditing, I know we cannot have full insight but I always get concerned when I hear the description "not-for-profit" mentioned because I find no profits will be made if people are paid enough to get rid of them.  On one hand, we have this charitable asset and, on the other hand, we have this private gain, but when we drill down into this, private people will gain from this in terms of investment.  In terms of security of investment, if there is a reduction in the interest rate, this is a good place to invest money because it is, excuse the pun, as safe as houses.  I do not like speaking about a witness who has left but it would have been helpful if Dr. Rhodes had stayed in order that we could have teased out this issue of a charitable asset versus private gain.  To my mind, there are many private hands in the bucket here.  Mr. Hannigan might comment on that.</p></speech>

Almost all of them that are registered both with the regulator and through the ICSH are charities.  The asset is managed-owned by that organisation.  It is not owned by anybody else.  It is funded in different ways.  Some of it is funded through the State, some of it is funded through the Housing Finance Agency, which we should bear in mind is a State body, and some of it is funded through banks.  There are different types of funding institutions that are similar to banks.  Pension funds are similar, there are private equity firms that operate across the world, and there are other international banks such as Nordbank and so on.</p></speech>

Fold Ireland provides housing for older people and we promote independence to enable people to live in well designed, quality accommodation for as long as possible, to lessen the burden on the State, to keep people in their homes and to be able to bring services to them to enable people to remain healthy and independent for as long as possible.  Our markets changed here significantly and the private rented sector is on the increase because people cannot afford to access affordable accommodation or to purchase accommodation.  We need to look at getting people who need quality accommodation to live in at affordable rents into public housing.  That is where we all need to be aiming towards because our economy needs that.  As was said, the people who do those jobs need somewhere to sleep and we need affordable accommodation for people to live in from across all sectors.  Our accommodation is not affordable at this time if one is not in public housing.</p></speech>

It could bring support on housing in the Chairman's area as well.  There was a lot of local activity carried out by voluntary organisations.  Initially we majored on special needs and then we moved into more family type housing because housing management added value.  The Chairman is asking why we are providing family housing and we are doing so because people in the sector such as Ms Donaghy and others were housing professionals who provided a house management service and assisted the local authorities, even in rejuvenation and rehabilitation schemes so there is added value there.  The first early social housing was in the sector by The Iveagh Trust prior to the formation of the State and they were big blocks of 300 to 400 units which were successful.  Local authorities took over but the sector majored on special needs and then moved in where it felt it could add something.  We are not trying to take over local authorities.  We are trying to add value to the local authorities to offer choice for people on the waiting list.  There was a very limited choice for people in housing in Ireland.  One either went to council housing and got housed, bought a house out in ten years or bought one's own house.  There were no real options for people outside of standard type housing.  We are here because we address gaps in the housing system and then we thought the sector was adding value and local authorities feel they can work with us to add value.  We are not trying to replace them but we can add value and this is 2018, not 1973.</p></speech>

The ICSH is the main operator in that area.  The State balance sheet has been mentioned here as has EUROSTAT and it is a bit above the control of the AHBs.  It is above the Minister's control because EUROSTAT will call this and it does not even matter what the Minister for Finance says because EUROSTAT will make those decisions.

The Chairman was saying it is above the Minister and I agree that it is above any single Minister.  In fairness to some of the Ministers, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government have all come out in public with support for getting reclassified and that is what is actually needed.  An all-of-Government approach is required in order to deal with it.</p></speech>

It gets paid on a monthly basis or a quarterly basis, depending on the agreement.  When we get to the end of that debt, we have the value of the asset, which is very significant compared to the 30% plus interest that was lent.  We have the opportunity to borrow again.

In terms of practical issues, I am interested in transfers.  We are talking now about people rather than houses, bricks and mortar.  If there are issues with tenants of approved housing bodies and those tenants need a transfer, how easy is that to accomplish?  Transfers are probably relatively easy for the larger housing bodies or for local authorities, although the latter do not like transferring tenants.  Can approved housing bodies transfer tenants back to local authorities, for example?  I ask the witnesses to outline the process involved in transfers between housing bodies and other bodies like local authorities, if that happens.</p></speech>

Sometimes as tenants age, they need to move to another area where there is greater family support.  We would engage with their local authority and also with the local authority in the area to which they want to move to see if there are any opportunities available.  Obviously, when we are operating in very high demand areas, we find that a lot of people want to come in.  It is a matter of working in partnership with the other providers, which can be other approved housing bodies or local authorities.  We will facilitate transfers where needed.  I have seen it in the past as well where we used the website of the Irish Council for Social Housing to advertise opportunities to move to more rural areas, back when there was a lot more accommodation available.</p></speech>

I used to work for an intellectual disability organisation which was a tier two AHB.  We had about 165 houses in total but we actually employed 560 people because we provided direct one-to-one support for a large number of people with intellectual disabilities.  That is where the figures get muddied a little.  There can be four times the number of staff for the number of houses-----</p></speech>

When a single figure gets thrown around, people say that the approved housing body sector is an industry in itself.  I have also heard from local authorities that when an AHB housing development is proposed, there might be one or two people from the local authority involved but that four or five people from the AHBs arrive into meetings in fine suits and cars.  Various local authorities have said that to me in the last 12 months.  Maybe they are not talking about the organisations represented here today but they have said to me that they cannot understand it when all of these suits arrive.  They would argue that there is a complete imbalance in terms of the running of their housing department versus the various member organisations.  The witnesses must have heard that criticism.</p></speech>

As I said, these things get bandied about at public meetings of local authorities on a regular basis.  It is in the interests of the AHBs for the committee to see the situation from their perspective too.</p> <p>  I wish to focus now on the last annual report of the ICSH.  Reference is made to the mortgage to rent scheme in 2017 and a total of 87.  That is a hopeless figure.  I can imagine the amount of work, training and so on that has gone into that in the local authorities and in the approved housing bodies, as well as the paperwork involved but the outturn is only 87.  That is abysmal.  The setting up of this scheme probably involved as much work as the setting up of much bigger schemes but the return is very small.  Why is that the case?  Why are there so few mortgage to rent arrangements?  Where is the blockage?</p></speech>

It is now probably 200 or 300, which is still quite low.  There are a lot of moving parts in the mortgage to rent scheme, including financial institutions and banks.  One of the issues is we are not able to predict how quickly we will get schemes over the line.  Transferring one unit involves almost the same amount of work as transferring a scheme of 30 or 40 units.  It is labour intensive.</p></speech>

I have heard that in the small print it is stated that where someone is in negative equity, nobody talks about it and that it is technically parked, but it can come back and bite him or her at a later date.  When banks agree to transfer under the scheme, is there an absolute write-off where someone is in negative equity?  I know that the problem is diminishing as prices increase, but is the issue of negative equity dealt with?</p></speech>

I ask the witnesses to take it in a positive way because we are all here to help people with a housing problem that needs to be dealt with.  I will make up a figure.  Let us say a house is worth &euro;300,000 and the Irish Council for Social Housing takes it over for &euro;160,000.  That is figure with which it deals.  I do not believe the bank formally writes off the negative equity of the person in question who is the meat in the sandwich.  Constituents have spoken to me about the massive sting in the tail about which nobody had told them.  What is most worrying is that the Irish Council for Social Housing which has dealt with all of these cases is telling me that it cannot answer on this fundamental aspect of the scheme because it is confidential between the bank and the person who is participating in it.  The Irish Council for Social Housing is a fundamental link in the chain.  Everybody sitting around the table should know what is involved.  I am telling the witnesses that they need to be aware of the full financial implications of any arrangement in which the Irish Council for Social Housing is involved, not just from its point of view because that is a silo mentality.  Where will it be down the road if the bank in my example comes back to the person concerned to ask for the other &euro;140,000?  I am disappointed that the position is not clear cut.  The Irish Council of Social Housing should know the full picture of the entire financial arrangement, not only the bit that affects it.  The people who have been on to me are probably right in what they have said.</p></speech>

There is the issue of Central Bank consent for the credit unions to have a vehicle and there is also the issue of large approved housing bodies in the sector.  Rebuilding Ireland contains a commitment to support the sector in developing its own off-balance-sheet vehicle to draw off-balance-sheet finance into the sector.  The credit unions received approval from the Central Bank to set up their own vehicle to move money out of them into a vehicle to lend for social housing.  They are two slightly different issues and sometimes they are confused-----</p></speech>

There is the work being done on the vehicle the sector is establishing to draw private finance into it.  There are also the credit unions and perhaps other institutions.  The credit unions could consent to establishing a vehicle to take money from them.  The Central Bank has certain requirements and regulations for moving money.</p></speech>

There is a consideration about which I cannot speak about because it is commercially sensitive.  One of the conditions for the credit unions to be able to do this is that they do it using their own vehicle.  The problem is that it has not been set up.  The credit unions have been allowed by the Central Bank to do this, but they have not done so yet.</p></speech>

Will the Irish Council for Social Housing send us a note explaining it in layman's English?  Phrases have been tossed around and the public is lost.

Recently, with the increase in market rents, the terms of the agreements are sometimes far shorter than was previously the case and the percentage of market rent payable may also be far lower.  In the early days of the model, the AHB may have received 90% or 95% of market rent, but it may now receive 80% or 85%.  Under the model, the percentage of market rent AHBs can claim has dropped.  That keeps the level of investment by the State on a more even keel.</p></speech>

I decided to hold my questions over until the end and allow other members to contribute first.  I thank the representatives for their attendance.  I apologise for the late start, but our morning session ran late.  We had an engagement with the Department some time ago and thought it would be useful to obtain the views of representatives of the AHB sector.  How many houses have been built by approved housing bodies?  I am looking at page 9 of the financial statement for 2017.  It notes that in 2017 AHBs built 550 properties and acquired 975.  For 2018, there was a target of 1,500 new builds, while the number of acquisitions decreased, which is probably to be welcomed.  How many properties were built in 2018?</p></speech>

The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government last appeared before the committee in the autumn.  It only collects statistics every three month, and the results might not be released for a couple of months.  We might not know how many houses were built five months ago.  I am putting the same question to Ms Murphy, and I hope she can send on some information on the builds, acquisition or revolving funds, as she described it.  We would appreciate a breakdown of what was achieved in 2018 and the targets for 2019.</p> <p>  I thank our witnesses for attending.  Our next public meeting will be on Thursday, 28 February, when the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will be before us.  We will look at the local government fund, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report from 2017 and the central funding of local authorities.  We will be joined on the day by officials from the Department and representatives from the County and City Management Association to discuss public housing.</p></speech>

It arises from an invitation sent by the committee.  It was the unanimous view that the Secretary General should appear before the committee.  We sent an invitation and set out a number of dates that would be convenient for members.  There were five or six dates given.  The letter of response stated basically that the Secretary General had agreed to appear at the Committee of Public Accounts because he had received four invitations.  Deputy Pearse Doherty then wrote to the members of the committee requesting that we would not deal with the Government business of today but would suspend the meeting until such time as we had clarification as to the attendance of Mr. Watt at this committee.  On 20 February, this letter arrived setting out that Mr. Watt will attend but that I would have to confirm with the Chairs of the other committees as to which is the relevant one.</p> <p>  We had a discussion on it before the Minister came in because it is a matter that was going to arise.  It is felt by the members, in respect of Deputy Pearse Doherty's letter that Mr. Watt should attend, part of this committee's brief is to examine his Department and the Department of Finance.  That is where we stand.  We want to put it to the Minister-----</p></speech>

The Deputy's proposal is that Mr. Watt would come, that we would get a date and that hopefully it would be in the next week or so.  I think that is being fair to Mr. Watt.  He already knows this.</p><p>The Minister is an <i>ex officio</i>member on the select committee.

It is regrettable that it has come to this.  The committee unanimously agreed three weeks ago that the Secretary General of the Department for which we are the select committee would come before us so that we would gain a deeper understanding of the role of the Department and its oversight of major capital projects.</p> <p>  After initial correspondence, it was indicated that he would not appear before this committee or dates were not suitable.  We provided five or six suitable dates that we thought he could accommodate.  We also asked that Mr. Paul Quinn appear before the committee as well.  To date, we have received no acceptance of any of those dates.  Indeed, we received a letter of conditionality which places an onus on the Chair of this committee to adjudicate as to the appropriate committee.</p> <p>  This is a simple matter.  We are elected members of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  We have agreed that the Secretary General should come before us.  The Secretary General should come before us.  It should not be conditional.</p> <p>  On the basis that we have not got acceptance from the Secretary General that he will appear before us on a date that is acceptable to both parties, I proposed the deferral of these Estimates.  This could be wrapped up in a quick phone call and we could proceed to take the Estimates in a short period of time.</p> <p>  I feel strongly that respect is a two-way street.  I respect the Minister when he is before this committee as he answers the questions that we put to him - one cannot take that away from him - and the Secretary General and the officials.  As a committee of the Irish Parliament, respect has to be shown to us as well.</p> <p>  Up until now, there has been refusal to accept any of the dates that are acceptable and a letter with conditionality was issued yesterday.  On that basis, until we have clarity, I propose deferral of these Estimates.</p></speech>

That is understandable on the part of the committee.</p> <p>  Both Secretaries General have at times appeared before the committee.  It is not an unreasonable request.  While Mr. Watt has now agreed to meet the committee, it is reasonable that he would facilitate the committee in a reasonable timeframe to come in and discuss the issues that the committee wants to discuss with him.  It is good that he has now agreed but, as Deputy Pearse Doherty stated, a quick phone call or short suspension of the business should be perfectly capable of sorting this out.</p></speech>

I always do my best to answer any questions the Deputy puts to me even though, frequently, as is the Deputy's right, he may be dissatisfied with the answers that I give.  This is my third committee appearance over the past four weeks in addition to the questions that I answer from all of the committee members in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p> <p>  As for the issue that is in front of us here, the committee members will be aware of the context of this in terms of the number of committee invitations that my Secretary General has now received.  It is a challenge that I face too.  I am regularly invited in front of many different committees but my view is that the committee to which I am accountable is this one and if I begin accepting invitations to other committees, it would cause challenges with the relationship that I have with this committee  and would make it difficult to do the work that I am meant to do.  We now find the Secretary General of my Department is dealing with the same matter because of the growing number of committees that want him to appear.  This is the committee to which I and my Department are accountable.</p> <p>  I am willing to engage with the Chairman to see is there a way through this, which there is, to meet the needs that have been articulated here today.</p><p>I am not going to give a commitment to say I can do all this in ten minutes because there is an issue regarding the number of different committees to which Mr. Watt has now been invited, an issue I also have to deal with.  My proposal is that I am willing to work with the committee to ensure we come up with a mutually agreeable way of ensuring that accountability is delivered because both myself and my Secretary General have a duty to do that.  It is a matter for the committee members if they are willing to accept that proposal, which I offer in good faith, and still go ahead with these Estimates this morning.  If they are not willing to do so and want this matter resolved before the Estimates are taken, my Secretary General and I will commit to coming back to the committee promptly to consider how to resolve this.</p></speech>

There was a bit of movement in the letter the committee received yesterday, although only a bit.  This can be resolved with a little will.  There is no reason these Estimates need to be deferred for longer than a short a period of time.  They should be taken today but the committee has unanimously tried to facilitate the Minister and the official, Mr. Paul Quinn, coming before the committee and we have been unsuccessful.</p> <p>  I did not want to take this action.  I have spoken to the Secretary General about this matter. The Department is accountable to this committee.  When a committee has unanimously decided to ask a Secretary General to appear before it he or she should be willing to appear.  We all have our own schedules and demands.  We agreed between five and six dates in a period of three weeks that we are willing to facilitate the Secretary General's appearance.  </p> <p>  I suggest we defer.  The problem might be resolved by a phone call and we can come back promptly and deal with it and, if not, we need to defer to another day.</p></speech>

I appreciate that and know the many duties of each of the committee members.</p> <p>  I am committed to resolving this in an orderly way.  I am not going to walk out of this committee and create an expectation with the Chairman that this can be done in a minute.  That is not the case.  The challenge relates to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Chairman, as a previous Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, knows the particular status of that committee.  It wants to see my Department.  This committee wants to see my Department.  The Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health is speaking in similar tones about my Department.  There is one other committee that wants to do the same.  Given that we have Estimates here in front of this committee that deal with funding, for example, for the Revenue Commissioners for an extraordinary event that will have huge consequences for our country in a couple of weeks time, I hope that my commitment to try to resolve this will facilitate the passage of these Estimates here this morning.  I will work with the chairman to resolve the matter if that is not the case.</p></speech>

For example, this letter from Mr. Watt requires me to confirm with the other chairs of the other committees.  I have the greatest respect for the committees of this House and the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I was previously Chairman, and they have a role to play.  This committee is the one that the Minister's Department and Mr. Watt are obliged to come before.  He has a responsibility and I feel he is playing games with us.  He did not respond to the particular dates that we asked about.  He responded in a way that puts the onus on others to make the decision.  Quite frankly, it is not for others to make the decision.  The remit is ours.  I have no objection if Mr. Watt wants to go before other committees but we have reached an impasse this morning.  We need clarification on this.  Would it help to suspend for half an hour to discuss this with the Minister and see can some process be put in place whereby we will get that clarification and take all of the ambiguity out of it as to who will agree to what?  It is not my job-----</p></speech>

That is fine and no one can dispute that.  As far as playing games is concerned, I think Deputy Doherty and the Chairman are playing a game.  On the one hand, they are demanding that this is resolved before the Estimates are taken but, on the other hand, they have made no attempt to deal with the other committees on this and come to a resolution within the Oireachtas committee system to arrive at a solution.  This is being brought to a head for political reasons, not organisational reasons, and has nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the committee.  That is the game here.</p><p>I have been around long enough to see a ready-up being orchestrated around the Estimates and the Minister coming in this morning.  I do not think there is any <i>bona fide</i>, realistic attempt being made to deal with this suggestion because the Chairman and other committee members have not earnestly dealt with the four or five other committees that have asked Mr. Watt to come in.  I could make a strong argument that Mr. Watt should go before the health committee and give testimony.  I could make plenty of arguments for other committees.  I think we should deal with the chairmen of the other committees involved before ultimatums are issued and before we start abandoning Government business and the Estimates here today.</p></speech>

Let us examine a couple of facts.  This is the committee to which the Secretary General is accountable.  He should have responded to a unanimous request, issued three weeks ago, to come before the committee.  We reached out and tried to facilitate a number of dates and he should have responded positively to that.</p> <p>  The request which came from me to the committee that he appear before this committee was accompanied by the suggestion that we invite members of the health committee to attend that session to avoid the issues of duplication and repetition.  The Secretary General is accountable to this committee.  The suggestion that we are not working with other committees is nonsense and the Deputy would understand that if he was aware of the full facts.</p> <p>  The request which came from me to the committee that he appear before this committee was accompanied by the suggestion that we invite the health committee in on that session to avoid the issues of duplication and repetition.  The general secretary is, obviously, accountable to this committee.  The suggestion that we are not working with other committees is nonsense and, if the Deputy was aware of the full facts, he would understand that.</p> <p>  Let me also make the point that the only other committee, aside from the Committee of Public Accounts, which has requested the Secretary General to appear before it is the Committee on Budgetary Oversight of which I, and a number of members of this committee, are also members.  The request for the Secretary General to appear before that committee was submitted on 5 December 2018, nearly three months ago, and was nothing to do with the national children's hospital.  It was to do with the desire to understand the continuous overruns in health expenditure and how the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is monitoring that and ensuring they will not be repeated again this year.  The fact that the Secretary General has not accepted that request, outstanding for nearly three months, is now added to the point that there are four different committees requesting his attendance before them.  The Secretary General would not be requested to appear before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight again if he had appeared before it in December or January.  </p> <p>  That is the issue here.  I have made this point in private session.  The Secretary General should, without doubt, come before this committee if he is requested to do so.  He should also appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and we have suggested inviting members of the health committee to our meeting as they are entitled to attend and to participate in that discussion to ensure there is no duplication.</p><p>I dispute all of the suggestion of games or anything else.  This was well flagged.  The Secretary General knew my position on this.  He raised it with me privately where made it very clear that a committee cannot allow this position to continue that a Secretary General refuses to come before committee.  We are either serious politicians on a serious committee or we are not.  I regret that it has come to this, but we have been dealing with this for three weeks privately.  It now comes to the point where we have Estimates, which are straightforward enough.  We will have them concluded within a short period of time, but as the Secretary General is refusing to come before this committee, we have to ask ourselves why should we at this point be accommodating this work on the schedule until this issue is resolved.  I believe it will be resolved.  The actions we are taking today will resolve it, but it needs to resolved.  We cannot allow a precedent to be set where the unanimous view of a committee would be that the Secretary General should appear before it, and for some reason a Secretary General, whoever he or she may be, believes that they have the entitlement to refuse to attend.  The only other people who have refused before to come before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach, are the vulture funds.  We have criticised and lambasted them on the fact that they refused to come before this committee and now our own Secretary General is refusing to appear before this committee</p></speech>

He is is crystal clear on this, Chairman.  As to the matters that Deputy Doherty has raised on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, I have been in front of this committee to deal with issues there.  I am the person accountable to the Oireachtas and to this committee.  The Chairman used the language of "common ground".  That is the basis of the work that I am doing.  I and my Department are accountable to this committee.  We need to ensure that this is resolved but I have to be cognisant of the fact that I now find myself in a situation that there are other committees of the Oireachtas that now feel they want to question my Department and my Secretary General on these issues.  What I am saying publicly to the Chairman is that I will work to resolve this.  I hope my proposal to resolve this will allow passage of the Estimates.  If it does not do that, is the call of the committee but it  sends out a particularly troubling signal on how we conduct business given the importance of some of the Votes that are here.</p></speech>

It is the entitlement of any committee of the D&aacute;il to seek to have the presence of the Accounting Officer.  That is a well-established precedent.  We all understand people who are Accounting Officers are very busy people and, of course, there is the matter of the Secretary General arranging his diary.  Nobody is disputing any of that.  What we are concerned about, in the context of the extraordinary events, where we are here talking to the Minister who has been very helpful to the committee - I wish to acknowledge that publicly, when he is here in person with one of his deputy Ministers, which is all to the good - but the fact is that the Secretary General in the Civil Service structure is the Accounting Officer.  The Minister is not the Accounting Officer.  We had plans which were approved by Government on spending which went, I believe the Minister would agree, almost totally off the rails for a variety of reasons resulting in a massive cost to taxpayers and a massive delay to a project cherished by almost everybody in the country.  The matters are very significant and important.  The sums are very significant and important, as are the implications of what has happened as to how Government governs.  The Minister's document today is full of commitments to reform to ensure transparent and effective public systems.  That is something that we want to see on behalf of taxpayers.</p> <p>  One might say that this is a dispute about dates but it is easily resolved by an absolute confirmation that within a reasonable timeframe the Secretary General will attend the committee, subject to his other commitments.  He is obviously a very busy person which is not in dispute.  The committee has set out to facilitate him out of respect for him and his office.  At the end of the day, the Minister, as Minister, expects that the Secretaries General as Accounting Officers will be available to relevant committees.  </p> <p>  We are not talking about some hierarchy of committees.  The fact is that given the oversight management function of the Department of Finance, which Department is responsible to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, Committee of Public Accounts and the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  That is what the D&aacute;il has decided to and we all have to live with that.  The Minister must live with that as Minister, but so must the Secretaries General.  We are asking for a reasonable arrangement of availability on the part of the Secretary General.  Otherwise, a precedent will be set which will be really bad for democracy where Secretaries Generals would feel empowered to either defer, over a long period of time or even refuse to meet the committees of the D&aacute;il in the exercise of the Accounting Officer functions for which they are responsible.  From that point of view, the Chairman's proposal that there might be a short adjournment during which a pathway would be identified where this can be resolved to the satisfaction of everybody is an acceptable and sensible one.</p></speech>

First of all, it places the onus on the Chairman to determine if this is relevant committee, that it is not the Committee of Public Accounts.  It also places the onus on the committee to inform all other committee chairpersons.  What I am saying, very simply, is that the committee has agreed unanimously - I am unaware as to whether Deputy Deasy was present or supported this proposal -  that the Secretary General come before the committee.  The Secretary General informed the PAC that he would be appearing before PAC and only PAC, if that is correct.  I am willing to stand corrected on that.  We offered him between five and six different dates on which we could facilitate his attendance before this committee.</p></speech>

In my view if there is any question mark as to where he should attend, that is a question for the other committees, because this is the one that he is directly accountable to.  The Minister may be smirking but that is the fact.  He is the Accounting Officer and this is the committee on Finance, Public Expenditure, Reform, and Taoiseach.  The Committee on Health would have less of a call on him, as I see it.  The Secretary General of the Department of Health is accountable to the Committee on Health.</p><p>This is the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health would have less of a call on Mr. Watt as I see it because the Secretary General of the Department of Health is accountable to that committee.  As I understand it, the Committee on Public Accounts deals with historical expenditure based on Comptroller and Auditor General reports.  We have a lot of experience at the top table here and this is the committee to which Mr. Watt is directly accountable.  The thrust of his letter is that he will attend before one committee and that the committees should get together and agree on which committee that should be.  That is how I interpret that letter.  We also have to be honest as Members of Parliament that an element of competition has developed between Oireachtas committees.  There is no doubt about that, and there should be better co-ordination.  I do not know if that is a matter dealt with at the level of chairpersons at the meetings of chairpersons of committees.  There should be better co-ordination and no race or competition when we are dealing with issues of such importance.</p><p> The question mark in regard to Mr. Watt's attendance before a committee does not, in my view, relate to this committee because he is directly accountable to this committee.  I think we should try to deal with these Estimates, if we can.  There is a lot of cost incurred in getting all of the witnesses here today and their time and our time is valuable but we also need to resolve this issue.  I do not think we should do that in a public forum.  I think we should adjourn and discuss the matter in private session and try to find a resolution.  First, I would like to know from the Minister in public session if it is the position of his Department that the Secretary General should only attend before one Oireachtas committee and, second, what are the consequences, as he sees them, of this committee not disposing of the Estimates today?</p></speech>

I do not know what the difference is between a smirk and a grin but whatever I was doing I was doing it because the point Deputy McGrath made at the start of his contribution regarding this committee being the sectoral committee is a point I made myself earlier.  This is the committee to which I am accountable and I am in front of all members very regularly.</p></speech>

I have said that on a number of occasions.  I said when I came into the committee today that the Secretary General has agreed to come before this committee but there are other Oireachtas committees that believe they are entitled to question him.  I have found myself in this situation before.  For example, when dealing with another health matter last year my committee was receiving invitations from the Department of Health to appear before it at the same time that this and other committees wanted to quiz me on the same matter.  This is an issue for the Oireachtas to resolve.</p> <p>  On Deputy McGrath's point, it is unlikely that we will resolve the matter this morning, but there is a serious issue here.  I reiterate that the Secretary General has said he will appear before this committee and I will find a way of resolving the issues raised today.  This is not a matter of diaries.  As busy as I and the Secretary General are, so too are members.  This is an Oireachtas committee and we are dealing with a serious matter.  I will find a way of dealing with this matter that works for all, but respect needs to go both ways.  I will not act to the deadline that is being presented this morning by some members.  I will resolve this matter.  If my offer to do so does not lead to the committee being willing to consider the Estimates this morning, that is a matter for the committee, which we will have work through.  </p> <p>  In response to Deputy Michael McGrath's question on whether I believe my Department is accountable to only this committee, the answer is "No".  My Department also has a relationship with the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and my Secretary General as Accounting Officer has a relationship with the Committee of Public Accounts as well.  There are three committees which either I or the Secretary General appear before.  On the question regarding what are the consequences of not dealing with the Estimates this morning, under Standing Orders we do have some time before these Estimates have to be disposed of.  In the statutory environment in regard to this matter, we do have the ability to spend up to four fifths of last year's expenditure before these Estimates need to be disposed of.  I would have hoped that in terms of how we do our business and the fact that time has been scheduled to dispose of them this morning we can and should do so.  </p> <p>  I do not want to add to the challenge that we have this morning.  If my offer is not satisfactory to the committee, I will respect that.  As I said, I will resolve this matter but the committee must also respect that I cannot respond to the deadline set this morning by the committee.  To do so now would underplay the difficulty we have in regard to the multiple Oireachtas committees that want to play a role in the issue.</p></speech>

This issue is born out of frustration.  We have been dealing with it for nearly three weeks and we still do not have an acceptance of any of the dates.  Some of the dates suggested by the committee to Mr. Watt have passed.  I think we should go into private session to agree a number of dates on which we could facilitate Mr. Watt coming before the committee and then proceed with the Estimates on the basis that this matter will be resolved.  We should not have to wait three weeks before we even know if the Secretary General is coming before the committee.  There has been a breakthrough but it is conditional and there is still no acceptance of any of the dates suggested.  We have suggested numerous dates to the Secretary General and he still has not accepted any one of them.  This raises concern for me.  I suggest that we go into private session for a brief time and agree a number of dates on which the committee can facilitate Mr. Watt and that that be relayed to Mr. Watt and also to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, who has agreed to try to resolve this issue and that we then proceed to deal with the Estimates.</p></speech>

Before doing so, I would like to address a remark made by Deputy Deasy because it is on the public record.  I am not playing games on this issue and neither am I playing politics with it.  I want to be absolutely clear about that.  What Deputy Deasy may not understand or have knowledge of is that in regard to the date for the proposed meeting the clerk has made numerous attempts by telephone and by email to arrange a date. I have worked with the clerk to try to get agreement from Mr. Watt.  Mr. Watt wrote in response to our invitation, not to us, but to Deputy Fleming and he put the onus on Deputy Fleming to talk to the other chairpersons.  When pressed about our invitation, Mr. Watt responded conditionally and suggested that I talk to the other chairpersons.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has been clear in his response this morning that he is accountable to this committee.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt is playing games.  That is how I view it.  I will not let him play games with an Oireachtas committee.  The matter has been raised this morning arising from a letter that Deputy Pearse Doherty wrote to all of us and to the clerk.  It is my job to clarify the position and to work with members and the Minister and his officials to achieve what is necessary for the Government in the context of the Estimates but I will not allow Mr. Watt to fool around with me.  That is for sure.  I will not allow him to attempt to make a fool of me as a member of this committee.</p></speech>

This is selective memory by a couple of members of this committee with regard to what is said and what is not said.  The reality is that the other side of what the Chairman just said is that there has been bona fide attempt by the committee to organise with the other committee chairpersons to deal with this definitively, as suggested by Deputy Michael McGrath.  The Chairman cannot on one hand deal with this in isolation and on the other ignore the realities of the system of Oireachtas committees that are competing almost for jurisdiction in this regard.</p><p>That is the problem here.  I do not need to be lectured on jurisdiction, what has happened and what has been said and not said.  I have been on the Committee of Public Accounts often enough to know that people try to hijack jurisdiction all the time, as Deputy Michael McGrath alluded to.  There are two sides to this.  If there were honesty in dealing with this affair, I would agree with the Chairman and go along with his assertion.  I do not agree, however, because I know how things actually operate around here and I do not believe there has been a conscious, honest attempt to deal with this behind the scenes.</p></speech>

I have made the point and corrected my position on this.  The Secretary General has refused to come before this committee on any of the five, I believe, or possibly six dates on which we said we could accommodate him.  I made it clear that there was a breakthrough with the letter last night.  I believe it was in response to the letter I issued and the fact that Mr. Watt had acknowledged that I made a suggestion that we would take this course of action regarding Government business.  I have acknowledged there is a breakthrough but it is deeply conditional and Mr. Watt still has not accepted any of the dates the committee has proposed.  That said, we had moved to a position where we were about to resolve this.  That is what this was about, and that is what the clerk, the Chairman and the members of the committee who were involved in this recently wanted to do.  This is not just about this issue; this is about precedent and ensuring that a Secretary General who is the Accounting Officer for an Oireachtas committee, regardless of whether it is the health committee, the agriculture committee or the finance committee, appear before the committee within a reasonable time if asked to by that committee.  That is what this is about.  It is bigger than the issue at hand.  I believe we were finding a way forward and that we could move on and deal with the Estimates, which I do not think will take that much time.  I propose that we go into private session and agree a number of dates that we can relay to the Secretary General and the Minister so as to ensure that this is resolved and that that meeting can be facilitated as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1732" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022100002#G01700"><p>I must come in on two points.  First, I reiterate the fact that the Secretary General had agreed to come in, and I have now made a commitment to resolve this matter and ensure we find a way of moving forward on it.  Second, there is also an issue of precedent here, which the Oireachtas must reflect on, which is that there are multiple committees that believe they now have a role in this issue.  The way this committee is speaking about this matter this morning and the fact that it is the committee to which the Accounting Officer and I am accountable do not get away from the reality that there are other committees that also believe they have a role to play in this.</p> <p>  The Chairman made the assertion a moment ago that the Secretary General of my Department is playing games with him or the committee.  I categorically refute that.  The Secretary General and I take our responsibilities to the Chairman and to this committee exceptionally seriously, and any idea that the Secretary General is playing games with the Chairman as a Member of the Oireachtas or with this committee is not the case.  On the Secretary General's behalf, I wish to make that very clear.  I also reiterate what I said a few moments ago, that when the committee has indicated other dates, we will resolve this matter.</p></speech>

It is that the Chairman would have a conversation with the Chairs of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Committee on Health, and the Committee on Budgetary Oversight on the basis of having a hearing held in this committee, and inviting the Secretary General and members of those committees to participate in that hearing.  It would be a joined-up approach between the different committees that are vying for jurisdiction and it might resolve this to everyone's satisfaction.</p></speech>

The group comprises a significant number of Votes, namely, the Votes for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and for the Office of Government Procurement; the Votes for a number of offices under the aegis of my Department, namely, the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service, the National Shared Services Office and the Office of the Ombudsman; and the Votes for superannuation and retired allowances, which covers Civil Service pensions, and the Secret Service.  The Vote for the remaining element of the Public Expenditure and Reform group, that for the Office of Public Works, is handled separately by this committee.</p> <p>  I note that the committee has been supplied with a very detailed briefing by my Department&rsquo;s officials on the various Votes in the Public Expenditure and Reform group, including those organisations under the aegis of the Department.  Further detailed material is also contained in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2019 which were prepared by my Department and published in December 2018.</p> <p>  In an overall context, it is worth noting that the total net allocation for 2019 for the Public Expenditure and Reform group, comprising eight Votes, shows a modest increase of 3.2% on the 2018 allocation.  The 2019 overall net figure is &euro;537.7 million compared with &euro;520.9 million in 2018.  The structure of the Public Expenditure and Reform Vote remains unchanged, with two strategic programmes focused on public expenditure and sectoral policy and on public service management and reform.  The requested resources for each programme, in terms of staffing and funding, are set out in Part III of the Estimate.  In total, we are seeking a 5% increase in net spend on this Vote.  The increase is required on the first programme, namely, public expenditure and sectoral policy, due to an increase in administrative pay to cover the cost of posts created in 2018 but yet to be filled, the pay increases under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-20, and &euro;800,000 due to a decrease in expected income from EU programmes and a reduction in income from the additional superannuation contribution that has replaced the pension related deduction since 1 January.  In 2018, the Department consumed 96% of its gross expenditure, when capital carryover is included.  The 2018 gross saving of &euro;2.6 million, or 4% on the provisional outturn, was the lowest since my Department&rsquo;s establishment in 2011.</p> <p>  On programme B of the Public Expenditure and Reform Vote, dealing with public service management and reform, reform of our public service has consistently been a key priority for this Government, and a comprehensive series of reforms have been implemented since we published the first public service reform plan in November 2011.  I launched the current iteration of public service reform, Our Public Service 2020, at the end of 2017 and the framework became operational during 2018.  This builds on the work and achievements of the previous reforms while setting out a path up to 2020.  The three pillars are delivering for our public, innovating for our future and developing people and organisations.  One of the key considerations of the OECD in its assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s second public reform plan 2014&ndash;16 was that the next phase of development for the Irish public service must focus on innovation.  To this end, Our Public Service 2020 contains a number of firm commitments to champion a culture of innovation across the public service.</p> <p>  Some &euro;500,000 has been included in my Department&rsquo;s reform agenda fund on a pilot basis.  This money has been set aside as a resource to incentivise public service bodies to fund or co-fund innovative projects.  My Department will be seeking applications that encourage the use of new technologies, create opportunities for new partnerships, and strengthen our ability to innovate and develop solutions across different Departments.</p><p>These are generally for small projects but we want to see what we can learn.</p><p> As Minister for Public Service and Reform, I recently introduced the first public service data strategy on how we can store and manage large amounts of data.  In parallel, the Data Sharing and Governance Bill, which the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, dealt with in the House last night, aims to create the legal basis for the governed sharing of non-sensitive data between entitled public service bodies.  Ireland achieved first place in the European Commission&rsquo;s open data maturity assessment for the second year in a row.  Ireland&rsquo;s open data portal contains over 8,000 datasets that cover a range of areas including housing, water quality, statistical and geographic data.</p><p> Access to official, open format non-personal data supports more effective decision-making.  It is essential that the public service continues to develop digital services that meet the needs and expectations of people.  An important element of how we do this is the acceleration of the digital delivery of services which is covered in Our Public Services 2020.  Key to progress in the provision of digital public services is having people with the right skills in the right roles to develop these services.  We have been working with Civil Service HR departments to progress a range of initiatives relating to ICT professionalisation in the service.  We recently introduced the first ever ICT specialist programme.</p><p> In addition to progress in public service reform, we continue to pursue a number of wide-ranging reforms that are covered in the opening statement circulated to members.  I will, therefore, only  touch briefly on where we stand in respect of the Data Sharing and Governance Bill and on improving the use of data.  I already dealt with the open data strategy.</p><p> Work continues to develop equality budgeting, an area which continues to be important to me.  I am working with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, on this in the context of identifying how we can develop and generate more data on the impact of equality budgeting on more Government services.  As announced in my budget 2019 speech, equality budgeting is to be expanded to further develop the gender budgeting elements.  The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume looks at particular spending streams to see how we can develop new objectives and indicators.  I am very serious about seeing how we might make more progress in this area.</p><p> This is the third and final year of the current spending review process.  Over 50 analytical papers have been published.  I am pleased to hear that many of these papers are being used in public debate on Government spending.  We are moving into our third year and looking at how we can develop a more robust database regarding the effects of Government spending.</p><p> I will conclude by commenting on Brexit.  Clearly, the latter is the key challenge we need to manage in the coming weeks.  The T&aacute;naiste will publish the omnibus Bill - which deals with 15 different areas across nine Departments - on Friday.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does not have a legislative section in the Bill.  That section is the responsibility of the Department of Finance.  I will be appearing before different committees to brief members on the respective sections of the Bill.  All of the engagement I will have with this committee will relate to the finance aspect.</p></speech>

The opening statement gives an explanatory note of the work done by both, so I will not speak to that.  However, I wish to highlight the appointment of Brexit co-ordinators at principal officer level across all divisions of the Department.</p> <p>  I will refer to the key figures in the Finance group of Votes for 2019.  There is an increase of &euro;23 million or 5.7%.  The primary driver of this increase is the provision of a &euro;21.7 million increase for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners relating to increasing staff numbers and other costs relating to staff, almost all of which is to deal with the coming challenge of Brexit.</p> <p>  The gross allocation sought for the Department of Finance Vote in 2019 is &euro;41.1 million, of which some &euro;10.5 million is provided for a fuel grant scheme for disabled drivers.</p> <p>  The allocation for Vote 8, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is applied towards a single programme.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is completely independent of the Department.  Its Vote in 2019 is &euro;8.657 million to allow it to deal with the 290 sets of accounts produced by public bodies.</p> <p>  I will speak in more detail on the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Its work is always instrumental.  In 2018, Revenue collected a record &euro;54.6 billion for the Exchequer.  Its audit and compliance section yielded &euro;573 million, which in turn yielded 17 different criminal convictions and led to the publication of 754 cases published on the tax defaulters list.  For 2019, Revenue requested a budget allocation of &euro;378.58 million, an increase of 6% on the 2018 net Estimate.  Nearly three quarters of the budget relates to payroll for an increased employment ceiling of 6,384 staff.  It is worth putting in context a figure about which the committee has asked me on many occasions.  We are hiring an additional 600 staff, which is nearly a 10% increase on the total number of people working for Revenue.  This is driven by their needs in dealing with Brexit.  Additional funds are required to develop Revenue&rsquo;s ICT systems.  This will be done by the deadline to which I referred.</p> <p>  Finally, Vote 10 relates to the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC.  It will receive an increase of &euro;1.582 million, or 97.3% on the 2018 estimate.  The committee will be familiar with the reasons behind that.  The TAC is recruiting 33 more staff in order to allow it to deal with the number of cases with which it must deal.  On Tuesday morning, the Government agreed to significant legislative change in relation to appointing a chairman of that body and other necessary data and processing changes which I will bring before the committee very soon.</p></speech>

The Minister wrote to me during the week regarding an issue I raised during Question Time in the D&aacute;il recently regarding the number of customs officials that Revenue has recruited so far.  As of 11 February, 230 additional staff had been appointed.  Revenue has confirmed that in a no-deal scenario, it will need 600 additional staff.  When Niall Cody, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, was before the committee recently, he stated that under the central-case scenario, the requirement would be 600 additional staff from January 2021 but that, in the event of a hard, no-deal Brexit, this would have to be brought forward in order to have the staff in place as quickly as possible in 2019.</p><p>The reality is that we now have 230 and we may need 600 in five weeks' time.  Will the Minister update the committee about where we are with that?  It is a concern with regard to our state of preparedness as 230 is only about 40% of the required number in a no-deal Brexit scenario, which we hope does not happen, though it may.</p></speech>

We would obviously look to deliver it early in the year.  I confirm to the committee that the deadlines and timings of those figures will be delivered.  The letter that I sent to Deputy Michael McGrath was open in answering the question which he put to me in the D&aacute;il regarding how many are in place.  The letter goes on to state that we will have in place the 400 we said we would have in place by the end of March.  If further resources or commitments are needed from me for those deadlines to be met by the Revenue Commissioners, I will supply them.</p></speech>

What is very different to what I indicated to members last year is that there is a very high level of demand and interest in doing this work.  Off the top of my head, I think over 3,000 people applied for these jobs who would then be available when needed.  The Revenue Commissioners have decided that there is clearly training and work that needs to be done to get the 400 in place by the end of March.  If the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners comes back to me and says that we need to appoint a further 200 in the following weeks, we will do that.  I will ensure that all the resources are in place to do that.  We have made a significant number of changes to make sure that land is purchased and available to the State at the two key ports in which the Revenue Commissioners will need to do their work.</p></speech>

It will be a highly significant figure, given the amount of additional funding that has gone into agencies and the recruitment of additional staff, especially in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  With regard to my own Vote, the majority of additional expenditure has been in the Department of Finance, to ensure that we have staff in place within the Revenue Commissioners.  That figure for this year for the Revenue Commissioners is an additional &euro;13.5 million.</p></speech>

In other words, that is the money which has been spent or is planned to be spent on Brexit this year and next year, which would not have been spent if Brexit did not exist.  I am looking for those data.  I do not expect them now.  I know it requires pulling together many Votes.</p></speech>

Across a number of Departments, &euro;25 million will be required for current expenditure on additional staffing.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc and Bord Bia will require &euro;71 million.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation will require an additional &euro;14 million.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will require &euro;5 million.  That is just in budget 2019.  As the Deputy knows, budget 2018 and budget 2017 also included additional current expenditure.  The other big block of funding is the funding that has been put in place for the future growth loan scheme.  I will come back to the Deputy with the figure for capital expenditure in the coming days.</p></speech>

The Minister said there would have been previous expenditure in 2017 and 2018.  Do we have any estimates of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1765" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022100002#L01200"><p>I do not have that in front of me.  To be more specific, I am saying that the increases in current expenditure that build on other increases in Government expenditure that we would not have made for 2019 are at least &euro;115 million.  I have given the Deputy the example of the Revenue Commissioners.  If further needs develop and I need to make further resources available, I will do that.  I am very conscious that at the end of March, in a no-deal scenario, due to the uniqueness of this event and despite all the preparation to be ready for it, developments and changes will happen that are very difficult to forecast at this point.  As we move through the coming weeks, if my key agencies, especially the Revenue Commissioners, come to me and state that they now need to do things differently because new issues have emerged, I will respond quickly to the issues identified.</p></speech>

I had suggested this year and next year.  If the Minister could also report on what has been spent in 2017 and 2018, that would be very helpful.  With regard to resources, the Minister spoke about the Tax Appeals Commission.  He has provided it with significant extra resources.  I know he has a report with a series of recommendations.  Does he believe that those recommendations, if implemented, will deal with the unacceptable backlog?  It is taking many years for individual cases to be dealt with, which is not acceptable.  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman has a significant backlog.  It is taking between 12 and 18 months to deal with cases that go for full adjudication and investigation.  I understand that that office has made a request for sanction for some additional resources, which do not require Exchequer expenditure because it is funded by a levy on the industry.  Sanction is required nonetheless.  Will the Minister look at that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1767" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022100002#L01400"><p>I will see if we have information with regard to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  I am confident that this will make a big difference to the list of appeals to the Tax Appeals Commission.  I accept that the list is too large and needs to change.  I believe it will make a difference because the additional current resources I am making available here are to hire more case managers.  More people will be available to manage cases and, in turn, by managing the cases, this will reduce the number of appeals.  I know the Deputy is familiar with this matter but a good chunk of the issues with which the Tax Appeals Commission is dealing are legacy issues that it received when its work was transferred from the Revenue Commissioners.  I would not put in place such a significant percentage increase in this organisation if I did not know that it was needed.  I have met the commissioners about this matter.  We are also looking to put in place some other office facilities to in turn allow these case managers to do the work.</p> <p>  I will have to come back to the Deputy on the question about the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></speech>

We rely on anecdotal evidence and feedback from individual businesses, community groups, sporting bodies, festival organisers and representative bodies.</p><p> It seems there is a serious problem in this space.  Some businesses with a significant public footfall, such as pubs, nightclubs, businesses in the leisure industry and play centres, are being put out of business.  Cost is a significant factor in the closure of some businesses.  Many more are saying they too will be in jeopardy if the trend associated with insurance costs continues.  We have a working group on the cost of insurance and the report of the Personal Injuries Commission.  Second Stage of the Judicial Council Bill was concluded in the Seanad some time ago and the Bill is awaiting Committee Stage.  We need to deal with the issue of award levels.  Can the Minister give a commitment that the Government will prioritise the passage of that legislation in order that we can have guidelines issued to the Judiciary in respect of what constitutes appropriate awards?</p><p> On the question of the Garda insurance fraud unit, I understand the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, met the Garda Commissioner some weeks ago and the Commissioner confirmed he did not want the unit to be funded by the insurance industry.  I can understand and accept that.  It needs to be set up and funded, however.  Could the Minister comment on that?</p><p> My final question relates to VAT on food supplements.  Could the Minister update the committee on his discussions with the Revenue Commissioners on this issue as time is ticking?  Today is 21 February and on 1 March, a significant change is due to be made with a standard rate of 23% to be applied.  This would have a detrimental impact on many of the businesses and the consumers they serve.  The position of the Revenue Commissioners on the concession applied to minerals, vitamins and fish oils has been stated many times.  I have seen multiple Revenue Commissioners determinations - including screen grabs from their website, although they have been taken down since - that other food supplements were zero rated also.  Therefore, there has been a real lack of consistency on this issue.  The bottom line, however, is that the change on 1 March should not go ahead.  I ask the Minister to give us an update on that.</p></speech>

On his four points, he has already acknowledged the planned legislative change that is under way.  Key to this is the fact that the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act was enacted last year.  It will make a contribution to dealing with our understanding of this issue, which in turn will help in dealing with the issue with premiums.  I will give the Deputy a commitment to working with the Oireachtas to ensure that the various Bills referred to will be passed.  I met the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, as recently as last night on this issue.  I met him after we dealt with the Estimates in the D&aacute;il to review our position on this issue and determine how we can make legislative progress more quickly than we might be able to at present.</p> <p>  On the point on the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its organisation and funding of a unit to deal with this issue, I agree with the Garda Commissioner that it would be utterly inappropriate for any industry to make a contribution to the funding of a part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is paid for by general taxation, and that is not going to change no matter what the need is.  That is the only way we should pay for resources for the Garda.  Commissioner Harris has indicated to the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, that he will consider how this issue is being dealt with and determine whether there are any changes he needs to make, but that is a decision for him and one I will accept.</p> <p>  With regard to VAT on food supplements, I am well aware of the issue.  A number of advertising campaigns are now being run on this issue, including campaigns with me featuring prominently.  I have been contacted frequently on the matter.  I must restate, however, that this is an issue the Revenue Commissioners are taking very seriously.  Their view is that the law as it stands is not being implemented in the way it should be.  They believe, and have said to me, this is causing issues in regard to the integrity of VAT law.  I am aware, however, of the business concerns that this is causing and some of the consumer and health concerns that are now being raised.  The Revenue Commissioners and I are working with one another on this.  I will accept whatever decision the Revenue Commissioners make on this matter because I will not go down the path of creating the impression that I can issue directions to the Revenue Commissioners on how they implement the law.  That is not the case.  We will be working on this issue on that basis in the coming days.</p></speech>

As stated by Deputy Michael McGrath this morning, the point was made that the change is being implemented on 1 March and that there is very serious concern in small businesses all over the country.  It was asked whether it would be possible to at least put the date back and enter into discussions with all the stakeholders.  I am aware that the Minister said at the last meeting that this has happened but there is now a lot of evidence to suggest smaller businesses have not been consulted at all.  It is only now that they are beginning to write to Oireachtas members and the Minister.  On that front, I ask him to put the date back and perhaps give a chance to the businesses concerned to enter into some sort of consultation with him or the Revenue Commissioners to arrive at a position that is commercially sensible.</p></speech>

I said this at the time in question and later in the D&aacute;il.  Consultation takes place on the development of policy but the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is the only body charged with implementing it.  As I said to the Chairman, I am aware of all the issues now being raised here but there is a decision that is only for the Revenue Commissioners to make.  They are aware that this debate is taking place today.  They have received a lot of contact on the issue.  In the remaining period, we will see whether there is a way in which this issue can be dealt with.</p></speech>

I will be brief with my questions.  I want to pick up on some of the issues that have been raised by Deputy Michael McGrath and by the Chairperson.  We raised the issue of food supplements on Report Stage and Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  Is it still the Government's intention to look at policy in this area as part of the tax strategy group papers?</p></speech>

It was a great question.</p></speech>

It was short and loaded.  On one hand the Deputy agreed with me that Revenue is independent and, on the other hand, he asked me to agree that it would be helpful for it to defer the date of implementation.  How does he think such a statement would go down in Dublin Castle?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1789" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022100002#N00900"><p>I recognise the independence of the Revenue Commissioners.  As I have said before, I really respect the Revenue Commissioners.  They have done an excellent job.  They are one of the few institutions that came through the crash in whose actions, particularly in recent years, we are able to have pride.  The Minister is 100% right.  They interpret policy.  It is our job to set policy.  Has work begun on the policy regarding VAT on food supplements?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1790" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022100002#N01000"><p>We are in the early phases of such work.  As the Deputy knows, the target date for the tax strategy group papers is the summer.  We have begun the early work on that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1791" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022100002#N01100"><p>I will make one point and then jump to a similar issue.  In the Minister's view, would it be appropriate to cut the issue of food supplements out of the tax strategy group review and have it as a standalone paper?  That would allow the issue to be accelerated and could assist the Revenue Commissioners in their determination of when the decision with regard to the 23% VAT rate will be implemented.  Is that possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1792" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022100002#N01200"><p>The short answer to the Deputy's question is yes, it could help.  The challenge we have, however, is that this is a very complex area.  The Deputy knows this.  There can be a world of difference between the VAT rate on an ingredient and the rate on a processed product which includes the ingredient.  We are seeing if there are ways in which we can do this work even more quickly than we had originally planned, but we had been aiming to have completed this work by July as part of the tax strategy group papers anyway.  That is pretty soon.  If we can do anything to aid with some of the difficulties around this issue, we will do so if doing so respects the independence of Revenue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1793" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022100002#N01300"><p>I recognise that issues around VAT are deeply complex, but it would be helpful, and something I would support, if that analysis could be brought forward.  It might result in the Revenue Commissioners looking at the timeframe if they thought, for example, there was a piece of paper from the Department relating to future policy on this issue.  The Minister hears very clearly from across the political divide, as he did during debate on the Finance Bill, that there is an issue and that we would like it to be resolved, although we do understand the complexities.</p> <p>  The second issue is similar and has the same type of solution.  I refer to the issue of betting duty, which the Minister has agreed to review as part of the tax strategy group papers.  The Minister and his officials will be familiar with the fact that, since the budget, a number of independent bookmakers across the State have closed, which has resulted in a number of job losses.  The first payment in respect of the excess duty is due in April.  As we have discussed, and I will not rehearse it again, we were told that this measure would put some companies to the wall.  An agreed industry proposal is now being examined.  I genuinely believe this issue needs to be carved out from the tax strategy group papers because July is too late for that industry.  Many of these bookmakers are trading at a loss.  Their banks are breathing down their necks and telling them that they cannot continue to make these losses month after month.  All they can indicate at the minute is that Government is reviewing this issue as part of the tax strategy group papers.  Unless they can indicate at an early stage that there is serious potential for change in legislation in this area, some of them will close.  Certainty needs to be brought to this.  If there is any way to deal with this issue prior to the tax strategy group papers, which I believe is possible, it should be done.  If this could be dealt with in April or May, it would give certainty to some of those bookmakers.  While they would still have to incur those losses over 2019, at least they would know that a different scenario might arise in 2020.  I encourage the Minister to look at that option.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1794" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022100002#N01400"><p>We are now evaluating the further proposal which was put to us by the industry.  In particular we are evaluating whether it is consistent with EU VAT directives.  We have received a proposal and it is being looked at as we speak.  Only this week my officials in this area met a company that has been one of the lead voices on the issue.  Work in this area is further advanced in terms of the tax strategy group process.  That is in line with the commitments I gave to this committee.  As to whether I would be able to make a statement in advance of the tax strategy group papers, it will depend on the work we do and on whether we can establish if there is a different way to deal with this issue.  I am aware of further closures that took place in January, but I have not established whether there is a link between the closure of those businesses, which is of course regrettable, and the introduction of this levy given the fact that across all of last year, and in previous years, we have the seen the closure of many independent bookmakers.  I have to establish if there is a link.  We are further advanced on this issue than on other matters in the tax strategy group world.  Will I make a statement on it in advance of the tax strategy group papers?  It depends on whether the work we are doing at the moment yields a scenario we believe can work.</p> <p>  I will not be flippant in dealing with this matter because we are talking about people's livelihoods and family businesses, but I want to briefly make a point which I made to the Deputy during debate on the Finance Bill.  Every time I go to consider a tax change, I am warned that it will have very negative consequences for every sector it affects.  If I was to listen to all of those warnings all of the time, I would never be able to make a tax change.  I am not being flippant, because I appreciate that these are independent small businesses.  That is why we are doing work in this area more quickly than in any other area of the tax code.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1795" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022100002#N01500"><p>I appreciate the Minister's response and that he has to make the connection.  There is a history of independent bookmakers closing down.  I understand that certain books and audited accounts have been made available to the Minister, or at least to his officials, with which he can verify the connection between firms that were already struggling and which could not survive even under the old regime, never mind with the new additional 1% levy.  That connection should be easy enough to establish.  I hear what the Minister is saying.  The issue of State aid obviously needs to be teased out.  I believe the issue can be resolved because there was no levy on online gambling until we passed legislation a couple of years ago and there is a different regime for track-side betting.  If that issue can be resolved there is no reason why clarification could not be brought to this matter at an early stage.  I encourage the Minister and his officials, who I know are working with industry to ascertain its views and to scrutinise its proposal.  Certainty could save jobs in this area.  Timing is important to that.</p><p> I welcome the Minister's statement on the fraud squad and private industry resourcing part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I raised the issue on the day the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, announced his report.  It was an ill-thought-out suggestion to be included.  We have wasted much time on the discussion of whether it should happen and on Insurance Ireland examining its feasibility.  We have moved on, thankfully, but we still do not have a fraud squad.  Similar to the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda is independent in the exercise of its duties.  It will be up to the Garda Commissioner to decide if he believes it is appropriate to establish such a squad.  I believe it is, but it is up to Mr. Harris to determine that.  Will the Minister make it clear, to this committee and to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that if there is a view within the force that an insurance fraud squad is needed, then the requisite resources will be made available by the Department?  Individuals will need to be employed in positions within the squad.  That is one of the key issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1797" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022100002#O00200"><p>That will depend on all the other issues raised with me at that point.  We will have an Estimates process later in the year.  If a case is made for this to be one of the top priorities for An Garda, then I am sure we will find a way of responding positively.  When I sit down, before and after the summer, with representatives from the Department of Justice and Equality, however, I am sure there will be a host of different issues they will want to raise with me.  I cannot give a commitment now as to how I am going to respond.  I do not know what the figures are going to be nor what else will be raised at the same time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1798" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022100002#O00300"><p>That is a disappointing response.  We understand the Garda will have different priorities.  It deals with white-collar crime, gangland crime and everything else, so this may not be the issue at the top of its agenda.  From the perspective of this committee, however, in dealing with community groups regarding issues such as play areas, marts and people trying to run festivals or motor insurance, we understand the impact this issue is having on insurance premiums.  I encourage the Minister to point out to his Government colleagues that this squad should be a priority as part of a solution.  It should also be made clear to the Garda that it is not being asked to compete for resources in combating insurance as opposed to securing additional resources for areas such as white-collar crime or gangland crime.</p> <p>  It should be stated that it is understood there is a need for additional action on insurance fraud and that money will be carved out for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It will, of course, be understood to be a reasonable amount and that 500 people are not going to be employed to staff this unit.  The Garda should be made aware that these resources will be made available as a ring-fenced budget and not cut from other budgets.  That is where the Minister's response is disappointing.  It is stated repeatedly that this is a priority.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, tells us all of the time that this is one of the big issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1799" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022100002#O00400"><p>As I said, I will respond positively to whatever recommendations come from the Garda, on this and other matters.  When I sit down with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, however, he will have many priorities he wants to see funded.  If An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na states this is a key area it wants to work on and if the Department of Justice and Equality supports that, I am sure we will make progress.</p></speech>

There is a 6% increase in the budget of the Revenue Commissioners.  Does the Minister believe that is an appropriate increase in the context of a no-deal Brexit?  There has been no agreement on how the Border will be dealt with in a no-deal scenario.  The only statements from the Government refer to the need for difficult conversations with the EU.  We do not know what the outcome of those difficult conversations will be.  We keep hearing from the EU that the integrity of the Single Market will need to be maintained and the Border will be an EU frontier.  Does the Minister believe this increase is appropriate to deal with all scenarios, including the outcome of those discussions with the EU after a no-deal scenario, which we all hope will not materialise?</p></speech>

If the Revenue informs me, however, that additional issues are developing, further work needs to be done and more resources are needed, I will respond to that request quickly.  We are going to be in a completely new territory in a no-deal scenario.  I expect things will happen, particularly in our supply chains in what will be an utterly unprecedented period, that may mean the Revenue needs further support.  If that is the case, I will supply that.  I will then come in front of the Oireachtas and explain why.</p></speech>

Additional supports will be needed in certain sectors in a no-deal scenario.  Has the Government, or the Minister, examined the issue of the regions in a no-deal scenario?  We hear from all of the experts that some regions in the State will be especially affected.  The south east and the north west, including Donegal, have been mentioned.  Is the Government, and the Minister's Department, considering additional support for the regions to counterbalance the impact of a no-deal scenario?</p></speech>

For example, I gave a higher priority to the opening of work on the N4, which is happening tomorrow, because of what Brexit could mean for the north west.  That is the best and biggest example of how we have made changes in our capital plan to try to deal with the effect a no-deal Brexit will create for different parts of the country.  On current expenditure, we have again examined this issue, and that is why the Minster for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, is launching the regional enterprise plans.  On Monday, we will be launching the regional enterprise plans for those parts of the country that may be particularly affected by Brexit.  We have already done that.  The key feature of Budget 2019 is that we are increasing capital expenditure by between 22% and 24%.  That will make more sense as we move through the year.  If there is ever a year where we need to do that, it is this year.</p></speech>

The meeting is timely to discuss a full range of issues related to implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process generally.  There are a number of issues I would like to address in my opening statement, following which I look forward to a discussion with members.  I acknowledge the important and constructive role the committee plays in expressing tangible cross-party support in the Oireachtas for the Good Friday Agreement and working to support its full implementation.  Importantly, it engages with stakeholders, North and South, east and west, to consolidate peace and deepen reconciliation.  Its members have a deep commitment to the Agreement, as do I, and had countless hours of engagement with those working in communities and at the interface in Northern Ireland.  The committee has at all times sought to build understanding across communities and encourage and facilitate steps forward in the process of reconciliation, which is at the heart of the Agreement.  As T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I know what this work involves and demands and see the impact and value of the committee's engagement on behalf of both Houses of the Oireachtas in supporting the peace process and the Agreement in whatever challenges arise.  With its important facility for MPs representing Northern Ireland constituencies to participate, the committee is a very practical expression of the all-island engagement enabled by the Agreement.  It is good to see many Northern representatives here.  While they are always welcome, they are particularly welcome today, given some of the challenges with which we are coping.</p> <p>  I turn first to Brexit.  While there are many settings within the Oireachtas in which we are addressing the challenges of Brexit, the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process is the Government's fundamental concern in the negotiations, as it is for everyone present.  As such, it is the first issue I want to address.  The Government remains firmly of the view that the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal by the United Kingdom and to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts is to ratify the withdrawal agreement agreed to last year between the European Union and the British Government.  The Taoiseach's recent joint statement with President Juncker was clear that the backstop was an integral part of the withdrawal agreement.  It was also clear that the backstop was not a bilateral issue but a European one.  I reaffirmed this with Michel Barnier at our meeting in Brussels on Monday of this week.  It is important to be clear at all times that the backstop is intended to constitute an insurance policy for the avoidance of a hard border in all scenarios.  We hope it will never be used or, if it is, that it will be replaced quickly by a future relationship agreement.  The Government remains convinced that it is absolutely necessary and this view is shared across the joint committee, or at least I hope it is.</p> <p>  The European Union is committed to exploring and seeking to agree to alternative arrangements with the United Kingdom to replace the backstop in the future.  We want a comprehensive future relationship agreement in place by the end of 2020 in order that the backstop will never need to be used.  We want to get on with that work once the withdrawal agreement is ratified.  However, no credible alternative arrangements have been put forward by anyone inside the negotiations or elsewhere which would achieve the shared goal of the United Kingdom and the European Union to avoid a hard border.  The backstop is a necessary guarantee based on legal certainty, rather than wishful thinking.  As well as ensuring there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland, we believe these arrangements represent a good outcome for Northern Ireland, should they ever be necessary.  This view is shared by a number of political parties and business, farming and trade union leaders from both communities in Northern Ireland.  Their cross-community engagement to explain the importance of the backstop as the necessary insurance for jobs and the economy is important and welcome.</p> <p>  In November the British Government signed up to the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, as it stands, and other important provisions to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts.  The European Union has listened to British concerns.  In December the European Council and the joint letter from Presidents Tusk and Juncker provided important reassurance.  Were the United Kingdom's proposals for the future partnership to evolve, the European Union would be prepared to reconsider its offer and adjust the level of ambition of the political declaration, while respecting its established principles.  A no-deal Brexit would, of course, be the worst possible outcome and in no one's interests.  In simple terms, everybody would lose, in some cases significantly, in a no-deal, worst case scenario.  However, the Government is preparing comprehensively for this scenario, just in case.  With the vital co-operation of Opposition parties, we are advancing no-deal legislation which will be published tomorrow.  It will ensure we can deal domestically with the undoubted serious challenges of a no-deal exit, should it happen.  However, the focus of our engagement at EU level remains on securing the deal which has been reached with the British Government through the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>  It is important to recall the protections included in the protocol to the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts.  The protocol, expressly and fully, respects the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent as guaranteed by the Good Friday Agreement.  It also underpins North-South co-operation and protects the all-island economy, including through the avoidance of a hard border.  It provides for the maintenance of a single electricity market on the island.  It makes legally binding the United Kingdom's commitment to ensuring there will be no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Good Friday Agreement, including through the maintenance of EU directives in the area of non-discrimination.  Consistent with the citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, the protocol confirms the EU citizenship of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and their continued access to EU rights, opportunities and beliefs.  Ensuring the access of those entitled to Irish citizenship in Northern Ireland to specific EU benefits, for example, in the areas of healthcare and education, will be addressed during the transition period in the context of the future relationship.</p><p>This is reflected in the preamble of the protocol.  The protocol also importantly provides for the maintenance of the common travel area, ensuring that the current bilateral arrangements can continue whereby Irish and British citizens can live, work, study and access healthcare, social security and public services in each jurisdiction.  I am glad to say that, in legislation that will be published in the morning, we have arrangements in place to protect many of these important public services should there be a no-deal Brexit.  In addition, the protocol confirms the EU and UK commitment to the PEACE and INTERREG programmes, which have contributed in such significant ways to supporting the peace process in all its dimensions over the past 25 years, and which are a major practical expression of the European Union's solidarity and support for peace and reconciliation.  The Government warmly welcomes the Commission's proposal for a special new PEACE Plus programme to build on and continue the work of the successive PEACE and INTERREG programmes.  The firm commitment of the UK Government to the PEACE Plus programme is also welcome.  As the Government, the EU as a whole and the UK have always sought, the protocol protects the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts from the challenges that Brexit undoubtedly poses. </p><p> On restoring the Good Friday Agreement institutions to full operation, which everyone in this room wants to see, the commitments and obligations of the Good Friday Agreement remain for both Governments under any scenario.  The Government continues to engage with the British Government as co-guarantor to secure the full implementation of the agreement and the effective operation of all of its institutions, including the Northern Ireland Assembly and power-sharing Executive, and the North-South Ministerial Council.  The continuing absence of these vital institutions of the agreement is a source of deep concern for the Government and indeed for the British Government.  Since the assembly elections in March 2017, the Government has worked tirelessly with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland in successive phases of talks to secure an agreement that would see the devolved institutions fully operational once again.  We have also consistently engaged to seek progress with the implementation of outstanding commitments from previous agreements, including an Irish language Act as envisaged under the St. Andrews Agreement.  Unfortunately, as everyone here knows, the necessary agreement between the parties has to date not been secured.  However, we will continue to work until all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are operating effectively again.</p><p> The two-year absence of the devolved institutions simply cannot continue.  As everyone here is acutely aware, there are pressing decisions and issues across a range of areas, which require a functioning Executive and assembly.  These institutions are also urgently needed to represent the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland, most significantly at present on the challenges raised by Brexit.  These institutions are the most powerful symbol and expression of what the Good Friday Agreement has achieved in Northern Ireland, namely, co-operation and power sharing between both communities on the basis of equality, respect and parity of esteem.  There could be no more persuasive advocates, in Brussels, London, Dublin, Washington and beyond, for the unique interests and needs of Northern Ireland than a power-sharing Executive working to address the interests of everyone it represents.  No one says it is easy, but there is no other available way to address the political and identity divisions in Northern Ireland and to deliver for all the people.  We must get the power-sharing institutions back working again.  The Government is equally anxious to see the North-South Ministerial Council operating again in order to oversee and develop North-South co-operation on matters of mutual interest, including the resumption of that constructive engagement to address the all-island challenges raised by Brexit that was commenced at the North-South Ministerial Council in the second half of 2016.</p><p> The Government will continue to do everything possible, in accordance with our responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  To this end, the Secretary of State, Ms Karen Bradley, and I met the leaders of the five main political parties at Stormont last Friday, further to our respective consultations with each of the party leaders in recent weeks and months.  This meeting sought the parties' views, at this stage, on how a new talks process could most constructively be commenced in the period ahead.  All of the party leaders confirmed their wish to participate in the institutions again and provided views on the necessary basis for an effective talks process.  It was not an easy meeting last Friday; that is no secret to anybody.  People are sceptical, understandably so.  It is up to the Governments in particular to respond to and address that scepticism to move this process forward.  It was agreed that the two Governments will engage further with the parties to seek an urgent way forward with a new political process that can secure an agreement for a functioning Executive, assembly and North-South Ministerial Council.  Following these further consultations, I do not in any way underestimate the way to go in achieving that resolution.  However, I continue to believe that an agreement can be achieved and that there is an increasingly urgent need for talks with a credible basis to commence.  I will continue to work with the Secretary of State and each of the party leaders, in some cases North and South, to get the necessary political process under way as soon as possible. </p><p> On constitutional issues, I am acutely conscious of a view currently being expressed that because of the ongoing challenges of the peace process, or because Brexit is raising so many challenges for the island as a whole, now is the moment to move ahead with consideration of constitutional status issues as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.  I respect, and the Government respects, the right of everyone on this island to make the case for the constitutional future that he or she wishes to see for Northern Ireland, whether he or she is nationalist, unionist or neither.  The Good Friday Agreement and the two sovereign Governments explicitly recognise and validate the legitimacy of both of these constitutional positions, which are deeply held.  People have the right to take part in discussion, dialogue and engagement on the kind of future they would like to see.  The Government hears, shares and is working to address the real concerns, worry and frustration that people in the North feel about the acute challenges that Brexit raises.  However, the Government is also very clear that we cannot and will not seek to use Brexit to advance any kind of constitutional agenda.  These are separate and distinct issues.  They are big challenges in both cases.  At present, the Government does not believe that sufficient support exists for a Border poll that would result in constitutional change.  The Government's priorities are therefore, first, to secure the effective functioning of the devolved institutions and the North-South Ministerial Council and, second, to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the achievements of the peace process as the UK leaves the EU.  That is our only agenda as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, and the Government believes that this is an important message to clearly convey at this time.</p><p> One aspect of the Good Friday Agreement that is perhaps less prominent in political exchanges but no less important for the future of everyone on this island is the commitment to the achievement of real reconciliation, following the tragedies and suffering of the past.  I recognise that this has always been a major area of focus for the committee's engagement, as it has been a continuing priority for successive Irish Governments.  Reflecting this, the Government has provided for a substantial increase of &euro;1 million for my Department's reconciliation fund this year, bringing the total budget to &euro;3.7 million.  In 2018, the reconciliation fund made grants to over 150 projects, supporting organisations across the community and voluntary sector.  The vast majority of funding goes to projects and organisations in Northern Ireland because this is where the greatest need for reconciliation clearly lies.  The groups supported by the fund are building meaningful links across communities, addressing the issues that are impacting on their lives, including sectarianism, and working to create better understanding between people and traditions on this island, and indeed between Ireland and Britain.  Reconciliation is a vital component of the peace process and the Government is committed to supporting this work at community level through the reconciliation fund and ministerial engagement with representatives of different community traditions.</p><p> I wish to make a few comments on the pressing need to deal with the legacy of the past and address the suffering of victims of violence and their families.  This was envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement when it was signed almost 21 years ago, but victims and survivors are still waiting for a system that can deal comprehensively with their legitimate needs and expectations.  Addressing the past is also a necessary element of reconciliation, particularly for those individuals and communities that suffered most through the dark days of the Troubles.</p><p> The new policing dispensation in Northern Ireland cannot continue to be weighed down with legacy issues, when the PSNI&rsquo;s focus needs to be on policing for today and in ensuring that cross-community confidence in the new policing arrangements achieved through the Patten reforms is maintained and advanced.  We saw once again last week the almost endless difficulties that legacy issues raise with the concerning announcement that the PSNI had discovered significant new material for investigations being conducted by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.  My thoughts are first and foremost with all of the families affected, as they have to wait now for even longer to see the reports of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.  This development makes clear once again that the Stormont House Agreement framework, agreed by the two Governments and political parties, is urgently needed to provide a comprehensive process for addressing legacy investigations and issues in Northern Ireland, focused on the needs of victims and survivors.  We are still working to get this in place and it must be achieved.</p><p> Significant progress was made in the political discussions that took place since 2014 and a public consultation on draft UK legislation was conducted by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the latter part of last year.  There was significant engagement with this consultation from individuals and groups across Northern Ireland, and importantly also from victims and survivors in this jurisdiction and indeed in Britain.  It was not an easy process but it was a necessary one.  The responses to the consultation are now being reviewed by the British Government and I am informed that this process is nearing completion.</p><p> The Government&rsquo;s concern is to see that the process continues to advance to implement the Stormont House legacy framework in full, including moving ahead to legislative phases in both jurisdictions as needed and as soon as possible.  We also continue to press for confirmation of the necessary resourcing for legacy inquests to proceed in Northern Ireland, consistent with the Article 2 obligations on the UK Government.</p><p> We continue to proactively engage with the Secretary of State and all of the political parties to secure the implementation of the Stormont House legacy framework as speedily as possible.  The drafting of legislative proposals in this jurisdiction to support and implement the Stormont House framework is also advancing, led by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  The Government has already published a general scheme of a Bill to provide for enhanced co-operation with legacy inquests in Northern Ireland and a draft Bill is being finalised.  This legislation will be of immediate relevance for the ongoing inquest into the Kingsmill massacre at the Belfast Coroner's Court.  Draft legislation is also being advanced to provide for the establishment of the independent commission on information retrieval, which will conduct its work on an all-island basis.</p><p> A number of cases remain of particular concern for the Government and the D&aacute;il.  These include the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and other attacks in the South where the Government continues to pursue the request to the British Government, as set out in successive D&aacute;il motions; the Ballymurphy massacre where an inquest is continuing in Belfast; and the case of Pat Finucane, whose 30th anniversary was marked last week.  The Government&rsquo;s position remains that an independent public inquiry should be established into the murder of Pat Finucane, in line with the commitments made at Weston Park in 2001.  Today is the 31st anniversary of the shooting of Aidan McAnespie.  It is important to raise it today on 21 February.  Our concerns, as always, are with his family.</p><p> The Taoiseach and I have been glad to have the opportunity to meet many of the victims&rsquo; families in these cases in recent months.  We have reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to seeking progress and supporting their right to truth and justice, consistent with the supporting motions adopted by the D&aacute;il in each case.  More broadly, the Government will keep working to secure the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement framework, which can provide victims&rsquo; families with a way to access whatever truth and justice is possible in their case.  Implementation would be an important step towards achieving a truly reconciled society in Northern Ireland.  I believe that can be achieved, and I strongly welcome the committee&rsquo;s ongoing engagement on legacy issues of such importance for people directly affected by the violence and conflict, and integral to the peace process founded on the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p> We are at a very sensitive moment with Brexit.  I more than appreciate the frustrations in Northern Ireland having to listen to other people debating their issues in many ways.  I will try to be as open and free as I can be in that regard, but obviously I am somewhat restricted in what I can say on some things.</p></speech>

We see ourselves very much as offering advice to people, particularly the victims or survivors.  We have reached out to areas in the North.  Most of the communities we visited have appreciated that someone is listening.  That plays an important role in people overcoming some of the tragedy they have experienced in their lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1847" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1332" speakername="Declan Breathnach" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019022100002#G00300"><p>I reiterate what the Chair has said.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his frankness and openness.  I understand the sensitivity over those talks to achieve the best outcome for the entire island.  Not alone is there sensitivity, but major concern.  Pundits have suggested that we will experience a 6% slowdown in our economy, a loss of 55,000 jobs, a 2% increase in unemployment and a 30% increase the cost of consumer goods in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I listened to the T&aacute;naiste speaking in the D&aacute;il earlier today.  It is important to hear him reaffirm that the buck stops at the backstop.  He also gave a commitment to continued co-operation on health services operating in both directions.  I would have asked about that important matter had he not reaffirmed it here today.</p> <p>  We are reaching the endgame; there is no doubt that the end is nigh.  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe that in the short time remaining until 29 March an agreement can be reached?  If it cannot and an extension of time is sought, on what premise would that extension be granted?</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the importance of protecting the human rights deriving from the EU and the Good Friday Agreement.  How can he ensure that there will be no diminution of those rights?  He referred to the agreement to continue PEACE funding.</p><p>We have had many presentations from Border communities and organisations trying to plan in respect of programmes which benefit communities, businesses and local authorities North and South.  To what degree is the commitment that appears to be coming from the British Government on matching funding directed right across the North rather than focused clearly, as is needed, on troubled areas and along the Border corridor?  A mapping exercise was completed by the British Government and published in December 2018.  It identified 156 areas of North-South co-operation, including the implementation bodies, agriculture, the environment, health, tourism, education, including higher and further education, energy, telecommunications, justice and security, and fisheries.  To what degree will the omnibus Bill published tomorrow provide legal guarantees that these areas of co-operation will be nurtured and continued going forward?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1849" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris Hazzard" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019022100002#H00200"><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for a substantive, thought-provoking and constructive contribution.  Bearing in mind that plenty of people want to come in, I will be brief and to the point.  The headline around Brexit, the Good Friday Agreement, the backstop and no hoarding at the Border is that we are all on the same page.  As such, I will get to a point where differences start to come in.  Despite the rhetoric and platitudes, people in the North are very disappointed that the Irish Government is not moving legislation to allow our democratic rights to be protected going forward.  Come 29 March, we will lose our democratic right to participate in European elections.  It is entirely in the gift of the Irish Government to redistribute MEP seats to the North.  For political reasons, the Government has decided not to do so.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to outline why that is the case, despite the fact that both he and the Taoiseach stood up and said Northern citizens would not be left behind again.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to paragraph 52, which provides that we will continue to share EU rights and benefits going forward, but the Government has fallen at the first hurdle and Northern citizens will face a second class citizenship in respect of those rights and benefits.  This is something entirely in the gift of the Government.  Next week, the Government will move legislation on the redistribution of those seats within the State whereas they should be redistributed towards the North to preserve those rights.  I am sure other speakers will have other questions, but I would like a very clear and definitive answer on that.</p></speech>

The common travel area is something we have taken for granted.  It has kept lines of communication open over decades.  I am delighted that arrangements are in place in the event of a no-deal Brexit to keep the common travel area open.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to elaborate, however, on healthcare, social security and public services.  The T&aacute;naiste says the two-year absence of devolved institutions cannot continue.  What more can we do to get the parties to agree to sit together?  It is causing huge difficulties in our negotiations on Brexit.  I welcome the fact that the Government has provided a substantial increase of &euro;1 million towards reconciliation funding this year, bringing the total budget to &euro;3.7 million.  While it is hugely significant, we need to do a great deal more.  I have seen at first hand at the committee the extent to which, as the Chairman said, this funding has been acknowledged by all communities on the island and, indeed, in the UK.  There have been calls for a Border poll.  How helpful is this?  Is it the right time to call for a Border poll?  What should the Government be doing to keep the lines of communication open at this very difficult time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1851" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019022100002#H00400"><p>There are a lot of questions there.  I will try to be accurate in the answers.  Deputy Breathnach referred to the impact of a no-deal Brexit.  A no-deal Brexit will put huge pressure on the economies of Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Britain as well as on the economies of other member states.  No one should pretend we can have a contingency plan which is comprehensive enough to manage a no-deal Brexit easily.  That is nonsense.  It cannot.  It will have an impact on our economic growth and on jobs which would otherwise have been created.  We will still be creating jobs, but not as many.  It will mean we have to operate on the basis of a deficit for another year or two rather than to have a surplus.  Undoubtedly, we will have to borrow to fund and protect vulnerable sectors.  I take beef and agrifood as an example of an area in which we have received confusing messages over the last number of weeks on the imposition of tariffs under the World Trade Organization rules that could be triggered in the context of a no-deal Brexit.  Whether one is a farmer in Northern Ireland or down here, the impact is of great significance.  Imagine the consequences for milk produced in Northern Ireland, 40% of which is actually processed south of the Border, if tariffs of somewhere above 40% were imposed.  This would mean a loss for everyone.  It would be crazy and we cannot allow it to happen.  I do not believe it will happen, by the way, but we do not control all of the levers.</p><p>We need to plan for that worst-case scenario on a just-in-case basis and we are.  Tomorrow morning at 9 a.m., we will publish a very lengthy Bill with 15 Parts dealing with, <i>inter alia</i>, cross-Border healthcare arrangements.  To reassure the members, I note that even in a no-deal, worst-case scenario, we will have emergency legislation in place to ensure that cross-Border healthcare provision can continue.  Children from Belfast will be able to come to Dublin for specialist paediatric care while people in Donegal will be able to cross the Border to Altnagelvin Hospital for treatment.  Myriad health services being provided on a cross-Border basis will be able to continue.  We are doing the same to legislate to protect an all-island electricity market and introducing provisions to support students who have had special privileges to date between the UK and Ireland.  I benefitted from them at university in England for a while.  The British taxpayer paid for some of my third level costs just as many British people are enrolled in Irish universities at the moment.  Without a legislative basis, that arrangement cannot continue.  People would be treated as coming from a third country and subject to the fee structure applying to foreign students.  We could not continue to provide grant aid through SUSI to Irish students studying in British universities and other third level institutions if we did not provide for it in legislation.  I refer to social welfare.  There are thousands of British people in Ireland who receive a pension from the UK on a weekly basis and there are many Irish people living in the UK who receive pensions from here.  Again, we need a legislative basis to ensure that can continue.  Otherwise, at 11 a.m. on 29 March, which is the time Britain will formally leave the European Union, a lot of people could be very adversely impacted very quickly.</p><p>There is a whole series of other areas to address, including transport.</p><p>Believe it or not - I never thought I would have to say this - we must now put primary legislation in place to facilitate a train travelling from Dublin to Belfast because that train will be travelling out of the European Union and into a third country.  There will essentially need to be a legal basis for the recognition of a driver's qualifications, safety certifications and so on.  The same goes for buses.  Even when it comes to driving between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, I am sure some of the members have heard about the potential need to carry proof of insurance in the other jurisdiction.  These are things we never thought we would have to deal with - again - but they are the kinds of practical things Brexit throws up.</p><p> There will be 15 Parts to the Bill, and then we will introduce, I think, about 28 secondary pieces of legislation through what are called statutory instruments in various areas, including mutual recognition of driver licences and so on.  To reassure the committee on one level, we are preparing in every way we can for a no-deal Brexit, as is the EU collectively, because there are many things we cannot do ourselves and which are EU competences, whether that be in aviation, financial services or whatever else.  That said, I think the impact of a no-deal Brexit would be very dramatic indeed and I do not believe people will allow it to happen because of those consequences.  I certainly hope I am right about that.</p><p> Regarding the extension of Article 50, Deputy Breathnach asked me whether I believe a deal could be done that could be ratified in Westminster before the end of March.  Yes, I do.  Are we there yet?  No, we are not, but work is ongoing to try to find a way of doing that.  The parameters within which we and the EU operate are pretty clear.  We are not reopening the withdrawal agreement.  It is already a very fine balance of compromises on both sides.  If it is reopened and changed, that will have knock-on effects and others will look to open other areas, whether that is Spain seeking to open something relating to Gibraltar or whatever else.  That said, we must try to find a way of providing the reassurance that many in the British Parliament, in Westminster, are seeking before they can ratify this deal.  We are trying to do this in a way that does not undermine the effectiveness of a guaranteed insurance mechanism to reassure people that they will never face the reintroduction of physical border infrastructure between the two jurisdictions on this island.  That is the challenge.  We are happy to reinforce the point that no one wants the backstop ever to be used.  I hope we will be able to avoid it through a comprehensive future relationship agreement.  If it is ever used, we want it to be temporary.  However, we cannot agree to time limits or unilateral exit clauses because if one cannot answer convincingly the question what will happen after that period, then it is not a backstop at all.  Alternative arrangements may well emerge.  We need to have an open mind on that.  If a review mechanism is triggered within the backstop, we must have an open mind to replacing the backstop with alternative mechanisms.  This is already catered for in the Irish protocol of the withdrawal agreement and in the relationship declaration on the framework for the future.  The test here, however, is that the alternative arrangements must do the same job.  Therefore, I would say to people who say we must have a time limit or a unilateral exit clause and that there are alternative arrangements that can prevent border infrastructure, "Let us see them."  I have been involved in a process that has tested many of these alternative theories and, quite frankly, they have not stood up to scrutiny.  There are those who believe there are alternative mechanisms.  In the future they can be tested.  If they work, perhaps they can be agreed as the basis of replacing a backstop.  They must do the job, however.  That is the key issue here, and there is absolute solidarity across the European Union on this.  We cannot have, as an unintended consequence of Brexit, the re-emergence of physical border infrastructure, which in my view would have a desperately corrosive impact on relationships between communities, particularly in Border counties, and a very detrimental impact on an all-island economy which in many ways has reinforced the normality that so many of us have got used to over the past 20 years.</p><p> How do we ensure no diminution in rights?  I have lots of notes on this but do not worry, I will not read them all out.  Essentially, anyone born in Northern Ireland has a right to be an Irish citizen or a British citizen or both under the Good Friday Agreement.  That is the beauty of the agreement.  If one is an Irish citizen, one is an EU citizen.  It is simple as that.  As soon as one travels into the EU, one gets all the rights of an EU citizen - to study, to work, to move around and so on - which is why, in my view, many people will want those entitlements through Irish citizenship.  This is one of the reasons so many people are applying for Irish passports at present.  In the future, they may want them for practical reasons rather than reasons of identity.  What is more challenging, then, is how we ensure no diminution in rights for people while living in Northern Ireland.  In many ways residency rights and citizenship rights are different.  There are many EU citizens living outside the EU who hold onto their EU citizenship rights and come back into the EU.  This does not necessarily mean they can force the Government of a state outside of the EU to implement EU legislation in order to implement their rights, and this is where this gets tricky.  My understanding of the way in which this works is that the withdrawal agreement effectively becomes an international treaty with legal effect and, therefore, people will be able to go to the UK courts to ensure that their rights are in no way undermined and that there would be no diminution in their rights as a result of Britain leaving the European Union.  The British courts system would have to bear this in mind in the decisions it makes, but it will be up to the UK to put systems in place that can follow through on the commitments to which it has signed up in the withdrawal agreement.  I know there is a lot of focus on the backstop, but there are many other really important things in the Irish protocol of the withdrawal agreement relating to rights, the common travel area, CTA, and so many other areas that are hugely valuable for everyone, whether one considers oneself British or Irish in Northern Ireland.</p><p> I have met a number of North-South bodies, and in many ways some of them are kind of in limbo because they are not getting a clear direction from the North-South Ministerial Council and they are essentially continuing to operate as they did.  However, it is very hard to give new political direction or to implement new political thinking because we do not have the North-South bodies functioning as they should in terms of the political end of that infrastructure because of the absence of a functioning Assembly and an Executive.</p><p> Mr. Hazzard raised one main issue, that is, the European elections.  We have had a discussion on this in Cabinet.  I raised it with Cabinet because we are trying to get the balance right here.  There is no example of a constituency outside of the European Union voting for and electing MEPs.  By the way, I am one of the advocates, as is the Taoiseach, of the extension of voting rights for Presidential elections to everyone in Northern Ireland and to all Irish citizens all over the world.  We will hold a referendum on this on 25 October which I hope everyone in this room will support.  There is a practical issue here around the idea that an election in Northern Ireland could be held after Brexit if Northern Ireland is outside of the European Union.  Who would hold the election?  Who would manage it?  In the absence of devolved government, would the election be run effectively by the British Government to elect MEPs?  Who would vote?  Would it just be Irish citizens and EU citizens or would British passport-holders in Northern Ireland be able to vote as well?  There is a practical reality here.</p><p> One of the ways we could potentially do what Mr. Hazzard would like to do - to have some representation in the European Parliament, particularly in the context of the backstop being triggered, if it were ever to be - where there would be regulatory alignment with the rules and regulations of the European Union in Northern Ireland and therefore an understanding of them if they were to be changed, is through my proposal for observer status in the European Parliament.  An accession state that wishes to join the European Union has observer status in the European Parliament in the year before it joins.  It does not vote, but its representatives are present for all debates and can contribute to them.  I wonder if it would be possible to have something similar where perhaps there could be two observers from each of the communities in Northern Ireland, certainly in a case where the backstop was to be triggered.  However, how that could be facilitated is something that would need to be tested legally.  It would also have to be facilitated by the European Commission and the European Parliament and that would not be straightforward.  I assure Mr. Hazzard that we have talked about the issue.  It is not as if we are ignoring it for party political reasons.  We are not, but there are practical considerations that pose the questions I have raised.</p><p> Senator Feighan asked how we could get the Northern Ireland institutions up and running again.  Some people in this room will have received feedback from the meeting held last Friday.  It was a difficult enough meeting.  I believe Sinn F&eacute;in, in particular, found it frustrating and did not believe it was a serious process, but it was a serious effort by the two Governments to get people around a table to have a serious conversation.  It was not the start of a new process and was not meant to be, but it was the first time in a year that all of the party leaders had sat around a table and had had a discussion, even if it was somewhat tense, on the parameters within which we needed to work to get a system of devolved government working again.  To be honest, I believe the two Governments need to do more together.  We must look at how they can do some of the political heavy lifting to help the parties to find the basis of an agreement.  From Sinn F&eacute;in's perspective, the rights agenda is very important.  The SDLP and the Alliance Party also had sensible suggestions to make, as did the UUP and the DUP.  It was an honest discussion, at the end of which we said the two Governments needed to talk to each other and the party leaders to find a way to put a basis in place which would be taken seriously by all parties to make  another attempt at finding an accommodation for each other in a way that would allow the institutions to be re-established.  We cannot afford to have a half-baked proposal and fail again.  As the political capital in Northern Ireland is running thin and people are losing faith, we must be careful.  Whatever we do next must have a good chance of succeeding.  I am consciaous of this in the conversations I am having with my counterparts in the British Government.</p><p> We are increasing PEACE programme funding and will continue to increase it.  I am glad that the appetite in the European Union for continuing to support the programme will be strong through to the end of 2020 and beyond.  The indications are that the British Government would also like to contribute to it, as we hope and expect.</p><p> I do not wish to get into the question of a Border poll because I am not sure it would help.  People have different perspectives which I respect.  I hope they also respect my perspective.  We are trying to get a deal that will protect this island, North and South, from the potentially extraordinarily damaging impact of Brexit.  It is difficult and many people feel threatened by it.  Introducing a conversation on the demand for a Border poll at this time has an even more intense polarising effect on communities, but that is not to say it is not a legitimate aspiration.  Of course, it is.  People in Northern Ireland should be able to talk about having a nationalist aspiration, just as they should be allowed to talk about having a unionist one.  That is what the Good Friday Agreement should facilitate.  However, there is an issue in looking at the multiple challenges we face and trying to navigate a way through them.  We only have 36 days left.</p><p> To respond to Deputy Breathnach's question about an extension of Article 50, Ireland will not be an obstacle to its extension if there is a sincere request from the British Government.  However, if the European Union is to agree to it, there will have to be a plan to go with it.  It cannot just be a case of seeking another six or 12 months.  There would have to be a convincing plan, whereby the British Government could state what it would do if it was given another six months and how it would get the deal across the line if given more time.  If the request was sincere and there was proper thought behind it, it could happen, but the Prime Minister has made it clear that she is not seeking an extension of Article 50, certainly not at present.  She has to manage politics at Westminster, but that is the job of the British Government.  What we must do is contribute to the EU side of the discussion.  We must ensure we are informed, consistent and respectful of the United Kingdom and at the same time not make decisions that will fundamentally undermine core positions that were settled in the withdrawal agreement and which should not be undermined now in any attempt at compromise.</p></speech>

He is correct that he was murdered 31 years ago today, on a lovely sunny February afternoon while on his way to a Gaelic match.  I am a member of the same club, Aghaloo O'Neills Gaelic Football Club, and my brothers and many club members participated in the investigation the Government commissioned into Aidan's murder.  This week we learned that the PSNI had withheld vital information on loyalist murders in the North.  This has rocked confidence among nationalists and republicans.  The T&aacute;naiste said the PSNI had discovered significant new material.  It did not discover it.  It has covered it up.  It has been covering up, redacting and destroying evidence for as long as I can remember.</p> <p>  Roseanne Mallon was murdered 25 years ago and the inquest into her death was recently concluded.  It was a sham because the coroner did not take into consideration the fact that evidence had been destroyed and, therefore, was not available.  People are very frustrated at the cover-up and lack of evidence.  People were murdered in cold blood in the North of Ireland and the British are doing their best to ensure we will never get to the truth.  What role will the Irish Government play in holding the PSNI, the Judiciary and others to account on these matters?  Aidan McEnaspie's mother, Lizzie, and his sister, Eilish, who was a tireless campaigner, have both died.  They fought all of their lives for the Crowley report.  Will the McEnaspie family finally be given the Crowley report to give them closure on Aidan's death?</p></speech>

It is a measure of their efforts that the Government, officials and civil servants have been successful in ensuring the Irish case has been heard loud and clear in the European Union.  It is extremely valuable to us and welcome that there is full support across the European Union for the Government's position.</p><p>The professionalism shown on all sides has been very productive.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, it is important as we approach the end game that we remain resolute in our stance.  Following on from the T&aacute;naiste's remarks, I have no doubt that will be the case.  Whatever will be agreed by the British Government there is no guarantee the UK Parliament will support it.  There are increasing signs of dissent and a continuing failure to achieve a clear Government line that is effective and has majority support in the UK Parliament.  It is important that we continue to show unity of purpose and a determination to get this right to ensure that everybody is treated equally, particularly in the north of our country.  </p><p> The issue of getting the administration in the North up and running again has been mentioned.  I note the T&aacute;naiste's comment that at the meeting at which he spoke to people from the different parties about this, they said they want and are willing to work to make that happen but there are huge barriers to that step forward.  In the absence of an administration in the North, everybody's case is weakened.  The majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU.  The voices of businesses and ordinary working people are behind the T&aacute;naiste in his efforts.  We do not underestimate the pressure the Irish Government may be under but the T&aacute;naiste can be assured of our commitment and unity on the essential purpose.  There is nothing more important than that.  </p><p> The Border poll was also mentioned.  As we all know, people have a right to their nationalist and unionist identities.  I accept that at this point there is not a majority in the North for a successful Border poll but it is a legitimate aspiration.  One of the weaknesses of the Good Friday Agreement is that is makes no provision for such a poll in the future.  I accept that the British Government reserves the authority to instigate such a poll but we need to articulate a cogent objective pathway in this regard.  I accept this is not the right time for such a poll but people have a right to this aspiration.  Like my colleague, Deputy Breathnach, I live in a Border constituency.  We are acutely aware and concerned about the impact of Brexit.  There is no Brexit that will work for the Border areas.  The harder the Brexit the greater will be the impact.  </p><p> I encourage the T&aacute;naiste to maintain the determined and focused work he is doing.  I have not heard anybody say they disagree with anything that he is doing.</p></speech>

We appreciate the T&aacute;naiste's comprehensive opening statement.  People will take great comfort and reassurance from much, but not all, of his address this afternoon.  It is important to make the point that this is in contrast to his remarks in the D&aacute;il Chamber last night which I do not think were helpful in regard to the ongoing process.  The only people who take comfort from those remarks are the people who insist on denying equality and a return to the institutions in the North.  It is important to make the point that the Good Friday Agreement exists because the North is different, because it is contested, because there are competing identities there and because Belfast is not Finchley.</p> <p>  We are discussing the prospect of Irish and EU citizens who are resident in the North losing rights after Brexit.  The reality is that currently these people do not have the full and equal status of Irish citizens in this jurisdiction.  This is a cause of grave concern for people.  These anomalies are to the fore in the here and now regardless of Brexit.  I acknowledge and appreciate the change in tone around the issue of advocating for reunification.  Many of these anomalies are the very reason people are suggesting it as the legitimate democratic alternative.  We are 36 days away from Brexit.  One wonders if it will be okay to start the conversation about Irish unification in 37 days.  The only thing that people are advocating here is the beginning of a conversation.  Two of the biggest reactions at the recent Waterfront Hall conference were in response to a request from the floor that the Irish Government stop appropriating the term "Ireland" because many of us are Irish in Ireland and the statement that we would not be stopped or hindered in discussing and planning for reunification.</p> <p>  In terms of the omnibus Bill, while not wishing to pre-empt any future T&aacute;naiste and noting the T&aacute;naiste's comments around citizenship rights versus residency rights, is there anything in that Bill to address the concerns around citizenship and is there anything that he or the Irish Government can do in concert with the Good Friday Agreement to ensure that Irish citizens in the North are legislated for here by the Irish Government to stop, for example, Irish citizens being taken to court for asserting their Good Friday Agreement rights?  I reaffirm Sinn F&eacute;in's commitment to working collaboratively with the T&aacute;naiste on the legislation when it comes before the Seanad.  I think people will be watching it very carefully on all the macro issues the T&aacute;naiste alluded to, in particular whether it legislates for our rights.</p></speech>

Like a lot of other people we were very concerned to read and hear the story last week in regard to incomplete evidence.  We continue to follow that story closely.  Obviously, the police ombudsman in Northern Ireland plays an important role in supporting public confidence in the new policing arrangements as envisaged in Patten.  It is vital there is full co-operation by all relevant authorities with the police ombudsman's work.  I note that in addition to the further investigation of the ombudsman's office, the ombudsman, Dr. Michael Maguire, has asked that an independent review be undertaken of the methods used for disclosure of information to his office.  This is a story that will go on for some time.  I can understand why people would be concerned and cynical about it, particularly families impacted in the case concerned.  The powers we have are somewhat limited, but we can raise questions in the context of our political interaction with the British Government and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  On the Crowley report, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has said that he wants to examine the issue to see if he can do anything.  I do not want to raise expectations too much.  The Crowley report has been made available but it is a redacted version.  I know that for many people this is frustrating but there is a legal reason that is the case.  Many people gave evidence and contributed to the discussions that led to that report on the basis of anonymity and so there is a legal obligation to respect that.  That is the difficulty, which I explained when I met the legal representatives of the family.</p><p>To answer Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, it is good to hear that businesses on the Border are supportive of what we are trying to do.  If one takes identity politics out of this, the backstop which is actually being offered by the EU on a temporary basis, to which the UK Government has agreed, essentially allows Northern Ireland to be given unfettered access to the rest of the UK market and unfettered access to the EU Single Market and Customs Union.  From a trading and business perspective it is effectively the best of both worlds, recognising as it does that Northern Ireland is a unique construct, being part of the United Kingdom but subject to the Good Friday Agreement and so respecting different identities and requiring power sharing.  Because of that uniqueness, the EU has compromised significantly and has stated that a state outside the European Union will be given unfettered access into the Single Market.  It is an extraordinary offer and I think businesspeople and farmers see that.  No barriers are being put in place to cover the costs of trading into the rest of the UK, though some very limited checks may be required for goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.  The freight industry has recently published a report which states that no more than nine lorries per day will be checked.  Is that what we are all falling out over?</p><p> I do not want to get sidelined into talking about the backstop again but I can understand why businesses see things in this way.  The difference between that scenario and the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, potentially trading on WTO terms with tariffs and non-tariff barriers, as well as customs and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks, are huge.  The obligation on all of us to find solutions that do not involve physical border infrastructure is a huge challenge.</p><p> I take the point on the need for a roadmap.  There is a lot of work to do, in particular to reach out to unionists to give them reassurance that this not an agenda to turn a minority into a majority and, somehow, not recognise their sense of identity in Northern Ireland, regardless of the constitutional construct or what people vote for.  Political reconciliation is required, as is political trust, but this will take quite some time.  The rush for a roadmap to a Border poll in the middle of what we are trying to achieve at the moment will force people back into their corners again because they will feel threatened by it.</p><p> In answer to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, a lot of people in Sinn F&eacute;in have mentioned what I said last night in the D&aacute;il Chamber but let us be clear about what was happening.  Sinn F&eacute;in was trying to pull the Government down, with 36 days to go until Brexit and less than two days to go to publishing emergency legislation which tries to protect many people in Northern Ireland as well as people south of the Border.  There is political chaos at Westminster and no functioning devolved government in Northern Ireland.  Last night's proposition would have left us with no Government, here or in Northern Ireland, throughout the Brexit process.  In that context, it is inconceivable that I would not have pushed back on the motion last night.  It was a serious motion that could have triggered a whole series of events that would have put this country under massive pressure and it was a really irresponsible thing to do.</p><p> While Sinn F&eacute;in has responsibilities in the process of getting devolved government up and running in Northern Ireland, I do not believe it is the main obstacle and in the discussions we had up until a year ago, Sinn F&eacute;in was willing to work constructively to re-establish devolved government.  We all have an obligation to work together and putting down motions of no confidence to pull down a functioning Government that is working night and day to protect everybody, North and South, from the potentially very serious consequences of Brexit would have had a significant impact on the ability to get devolved government functioning again in the North and on a whole range of other sectors.  That is the context of what I said last night, in addition to the fact that I was attempting to protect a colleague of mine who I believe was being unfairly targeted.</p><p> The Senator is right to say that Northern Ireland is different.  In fact, it is unique.  Irish people in Northern Ireland are as Irish as I am, and the whole point of the provisions in the Good Friday Agreement is that they have the right to hold that identity.  On the other hand, many people in the North consider themselves as British as the people of Finchley, and they should be able to do that too, even though Northern Ireland is not the same as Finchley, for obvious reasons which I do not need to go into here.  This sense of identity is what makes Northern Ireland so different but also, potentially, so polarised and that is what we are trying to deal with.</p><p> As for discussing reunification, can we do that in 37 days time, rather than 36?  That may be a slightly provocative comment and I take the Senator's point.</p></speech>

I am entitled to have hopes and dreams for this island too but I need to respect those of everybody else.  I expect other people to respect mine and this is how we can all live together.  Hopefully, it is how we can get through Brexit too.</p><p>On the omnibus Bill, we cannot do everything through national legislation.  We can do a lot and we are doing a lot, and members will see what I mean by that when they see the legislation.  A series of important issues are being dealt with by statutory instruments, where we do not need primary legislation.  For other areas, the EU will have to introduce contingency measures, some of which will be legal while others will offer temporary facilitation.  There is a competence issue and we cannot take on national competence in an area where we work through the EU.</p><p>In the legislation and the statutory instruments, the Senator will see the areas for which we can provide legislation to give protection.  The UK has agreed to do what it needs to do in Westminster to complement what we are doing, because that is the only way we can protect Irish citizens in the UK and this shows people that the British and Irish Governments are trying to work together in practical areas.  If members think we have missed something in the Bill, we have given over most of next week for a Second Stage debate and the following week for Committee and Report Stages.  Members will find me very open to amendments which are justified, make sense and stack up.  I do not want to pretend we own this legislation and, though I am sponsoring it as the Minister, nine other Government Ministers and their Departments are involved.  It is not party political or policy driven but is about trying to protect the <i>status quo</i>as best we can in a no-deal scenario.</p></speech>

I thank the T&aacute;naiste for coming to the committee today.  He will be aware of and recognise that there are many sections of communities in the North of Ireland who suffer because they do not have equality.  This is not only a recent thing since the Assembly collapsed two years ago: this has been going on for many years.  People from the LGBT community, the Irish language community and other sections of the community may never have had equality in their lifetime.  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government will be aware that there are still a number of issues that have never been implemented.  The Assembly has been collapsed for two years.  It collapsed because a lot of those agreements have never been implemented in their entirety.  This is a massive issue.  People who raise this with me say that they want and deserve equality as much as anybody else.  As a co-guarantor, the T&aacute;naiste has a special remit with regard to the agreements.  Is there a progress report?  Does the T&aacute;naiste do progress reports?  Prior to the Assembly collapsing two years ago what did the Government do to try to get the outstanding issues implemented in their entirety as per those agreements?  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

It is good to see him back at the committee since his last presentation here.  I have a concern that people in the North, nationalists in particular, who look to this Government to support them and be the guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, feel neglected and have been left behind.  There are issues around where and how people vote.  The T&aacute;naiste recently attacked Sinn F&eacute;in for not taking our seats in Westminster.  The people in the North have decided against Westminster and have turned their backs on Westminster.  They decided to vote for Sinn F&eacute;in for our particular policies.  We are, however, here today as MPs and we are looking for speaking and voting rights within this committee, and speaking rights within the D&aacute;il to ensure that the voice of Northern representation is not lost in the future.</p> <p>  On the issue of Brexit, the T&aacute;naiste said there can be no other solution but I believe there is a very simple solution, which is Irish unity.  The T&aacute;naiste has said that one cannot mix the two things together but I certainly believe there is an opportunity to use Irish unity as the only solution.  It needs no borders and would create no borders.  It would actually alleviate the need for borders.  It would give the Irish people as a whole the right to self-determination.</p> <p>  The other issue is around a referendum.  The T&aacute;naiste has said there is no reason to have a referendum on Irish unity at the moment.  What criteria has the Irish Government set or proposed to the British Government on how a referendum would be called?  Unfortunately, the Good Friday Agreement left it that it would be the British Government and the British Secretary of State, who would call it with no input from the Irish Government.  Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate what is the current criteria that we can work with for a roadmap towards exactly how a referendum would actually happen in the North?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1866" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elisha McCallion" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019022100002#N00500"><p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and thank him for his contribution so far.  I am sure I do not need to outline to the T&aacute;naiste his Government's responsibilities with regard to its obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  He will be very well aware of all the responsibilities of which the Irish - as co-guarantors of the agreement - bear the brunt.  Every person in this room is working towards mitigating against any form of Brexit, be it hard or soft, or whatever it is called these days.  It is very important that we remind ourselves that no one in this room brought that about.  We did not ask for Brexit.  The people of the North voted against Brexit.  Every day that passes takes us a day closer to a crash-out or no-deal Brexit.  I am aware that it has been talked about quite a bit already in today's conversation, but I genuinely believe that it is irresponsible for the Irish Government to not consider opening up that conversation around the constitutional issue.  What I heard today from the T&aacute;naiste about the constitutional question is disappointing.  While he said it is his only agenda as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement to protect the institutions and the North-South Ministerial Council, I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that it is his Government's obligation to uphold the entirety of the Good Friday Agreement, which in itself allows for the issue of consent.  While I appreciate the Government's position around trying to manage against the Brexit debacle that none of us has asked for, but which we find ourselves in, there is an option on the table that is not being considered from the Irish Government's point of view.  It is irresponsible and I find it baffling that legislation will be published tomorrow that none of us has seen.  I certainly have not seen it and I assume from the conversation today that nowhere in that legislation is there an option for consideration of a Border poll.  We are asking for the introduction of a conversation.  Nobody is asking for a Border poll to happen tomorrow.  Going back to what Deputy O'Dowd said, it has been outlined already in relation to the potential of a roadmap.  The T&aacute;naiste said there is no rush to a roadmap to this, but with respect it is now 20 years after the Good Friday Agreement.  It should be the Irish Government's priority to have these conversations.  We all accept that unionism is vitally important to the conversation.  We need to ensure we bring unionists into the conversation, but whether we accept it or not citizens are beyond the Government in this regard because it is happening organically at kitchen tables and in workplaces.  People are talking about this.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that the Irish Government should be planning and preparing for unity and it should be opening up that conversation in a space that is safe, secure and responsible.  I find it baffling that at this stage we are still not even considering it as an option in the event of a Brexit that none of us has asked for.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that Brexit will have disastrous consequences for the entire nation, but particularly for people living in Border constituencies.  As a Border constituency MP, I hear daily of people's fears and concerns about the return of a hard border.  It is important in a post-Brexit context that cross-Border initiatives are maintained and protected.  The upgrade of the A5 dual carriageway is one such cross-Border initiative in my constituency.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that this project is vital to the area in terms of opening up the western transport corridor and bringing connectivity from Dublin right through to the north-west region.  It also has the potential to bring economic prosperity and development to an area that has been neglected by the British and Irish Governments for far too long.  The region needs that development even more in a post-Brexit context.  Last week the Irish Government made the decision to defer &euro;27 million that was earmarked for the A5 upgrade.  I seek the T&aacute;naiste's assurance today - I am aware the Taoiseach has already done so - that the A5 will not be impeded by that and it will not act as a barrier or a delay in the project going forward.</p><p>The Irish Government originally committed &euro;400 million to this project, but that amount was significantly reduced to &euro;75 million, with a view to the remainder being reinstated at a later date.  Now that the project is ready to begin, with works possibly commencing this year, will the Irish Government revisit its original commitment of &euro;400 million?  I appeal to the T&aacute;naiste, as we cannot allow further delays to the project.  The money is necessary to see the road to completion in its entirety from Derry to Aughnacloy.  There have been a number of fatal tragedies in recent weeks and months.  We cannot allow delays that will ultimately cost lives.</p></speech>

Previously, he was vociferous about corruption.  In the North, we have seen a number of issues, in particular two major ones - Red Sky and RHI.  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe it to be right and proper that people in the North must endure that kind of governance or lack of governance?  Not much seems to have been said about it.<br/><br/>The T&aacute;naiste referred to people living in Britain getting Irish pensions and <i>vice versa</i>.  I live in a Border constituency and deal with social welfare issues daily.  The question of frontier workers needs to be addressed urgently.  There are benefits and tax credits that people working in the South and living in the North can claim.</p></speech>

I gather from his comments that he is downbeat about the possibility of having the political institutions - the Executive, the Assembly and the North-South Ministerial Council - restored in the near future.  It is disappointing that, more than two years on, we do not have functioning political institutions in Northern Ireland at what is a critical time in the history of these islands.  Have the talks been adjourned <i>sine die</i>or have arrangements been made for the Secretary of State, the T&aacute;naiste and the political parties in Stormont to meet again?  Has any consideration been given to the idea floated by some people of an independent chair for the talks?Every effort has to be made.  There is an onus on Sinn F&eacute;in, the DUP and the two Governments to ensure that we have those institutions, which came about after a great deal of hard work by different Governments and political parties.</p><p>I am glad that the T&aacute;naiste mentioned the legacy issues.  The Dublin and Monaghan bombings are a major issue in my area.</p><p>Mr. Molloy referred to voting rights at this committee, but this is not a legislative committee.  Generally, committees are proportionately representative of the groupings and political parties in the parliaments they represent.  The day that this committee needs to vote will be a day that we on this island will be going backwards.  I sincerely hope that we never need to have votes.</p></speech>

We all support their efforts.  His recent trip to the US was a great success, in that it galvanised Irish America.  The support of Congressman Richard Neal and the House Ways and Means Committee is enormous, as it sent a message to the UK that Irish America and its powerful position on that committee, which will decide on the future trade arrangements between the US and the UK, will not support any trade arrangement.  When we met Congressman Neal and other Irish American Congressmen, they told us that they wanted to know where the border between the UK and Ireland and the EU would be and how it would function.  They wanted Britain to sign up to the backstop, which people seem to forget it negotiated.  Those congressmen are concerned about the Good Friday Agreement and the peace.</p> <p>  We are discussing the Border poll and related matters.  The issue of unification is not just a name or aspiration.  As the former Attorney General, Mr. Rory Brady, stated, achieving it is a constitutional imperative and an obligation, not simply an aspiration to have.  The policy neglect in that context that we are currently suffering needs to be resolved.  I agree with Deputy O'Dowd about the roadmap, but one of the concerns about that relate to the Belfast High Court case last year in which Mr. Justice Paul Girvan ruled that, although it would be prudent for the Secretary of State to have a policy on how a referendum would be called and how she would determine that the majority of people were in favour of a referendum, he could not legally require her to do so.  Although we need clarification in this regard, it is not a matter for the next 36 days.  That conversation around a new agreed Ireland - a vision that we can all share of the best future for everyone in the island - is probably not for the 36 days.</p> <p>  I wish to bring the T&aacute;naiste's attention to a report - I partly assisted in compiling it - by two experts on preventing violent extremism.  Professors Pat Dolan and Mark Brennan are chairs in UNESCO.  This is about having facts.  Their view is that, if there is a return to a hard border, there will be a return to violence.  The question is the scale of the violence.  It is important for the UK Government to listen.  It needs to know.  When the UK had its debate on the Brexit referendum, it did not have the facts.  If the UK Government is deciding to do a U-turn on the backstop, it needs to be aware of the fact that there will not just be economic consequences for this island, but also circumstances that we do not want to see returning.  There was a reason for the Good Friday Agreement and the backstop, and it is the reason we do not want a U-turn on the latter.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair for allowing me to contribute and the T&aacute;naiste for attending the meeting.</p></speech>

I think everyone has contributed.</p> <p>  Mr. Maskey asked what we had been doing about the equality issues.  Some of those present might remember how, the summer before last and shortly after I entered this job, when we went straight into the heat of negotiations, I made it clear that it was a previous British Government commitment under the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to facilitate Irish language legislation.  We supported that, as it needed to happen.  I got roundly criticised by unionism in Northern Ireland for taking sides and so on when really I was just repeating what had been an Irish Government policy for many years in light of the commitment that had been made by a British Government.  That is still our position.  Northern Ireland is a unique place where identities are held strongly, and if people are not allowed to express their identities, they feel that in terms of a lack of acceptance by others.  Unfortunately, that is why the Irish language issue has become such a divisive one politically.  Language should not be about divisive politics.  It should be about allowing people to be who they are.  That is why many Irish language speakers feel frustrated that this issue has become such a divisive one politically when it should be the opposite, namely, a celebration of the diversity of identity in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  We are always looking for ways in which we can recognise the threat, unfortunately, that some unionists feel from the Irish language.  People talk to me about the Irish language being used as a political weapon.  That sounds unrealistic to many in this room, but for others it is very real, and we must find ways of addressing that if we are going to get agreement, compromise and facilitation.  There are other elements that some unionists regard as part of their identity that some nationalists or republicans feel offended by, too.  We need to try to find ways to deal with these issues, which have become contentious and been part of contentious election campaigning, that take the heat out of this while also getting something real done.</p><p>My record has been one of honest conversation about how we do that.  I spent many hours, in particular with members of the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, until this time last year trying to do that.<br/><br/>I refer to the broader support we have, as a Government and as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and at what the Government has looked for in terms of North-South consultative forums, successive talks processes from 2014 to 2017, inclusive, talking about the need for a bill of rights and talking honestly about the Irish language and how we can overcome that issue, which really was the obstacle a year ago, because perceptions were the problem here in terms of what was being asked for and what was real and what was not.<br/><br/>The questions from Mr. Francie Molloy related to nationalists feeling left behind.  I really hope those who share the same views on nationalism do not feel left behind.<br/><br/>Let us think about Brexit and about what the Government, of which I am a part, could have been doing in terms of its approach to Brexit.  We have a &euro;75 billion east-west trade relationship with Britain, but we have not talked primarily about that today, last week or last month.  Primarily, we are talking about how we protect the peace process and how we ensure there is no border infrastructure that acts as a barrier to the movement of goods and people.  We are talking about people in Northern Ireland primarily in the context of the Brexit debate and many people have asked me why there is so much focus on the Border when the majority of the trade is east-west.  That is because, as I have often said, some things are more important than commerce and trade.  What I would say to nationalists, unionists and people who are neither in Northern Ireland is that we are trying to find a way of getting an outcome to Brexit that by and large protects the <i>status quo</i>and then allows us to re-establish a functioning Executive so that we can start to build on all the other things we need to do around legacy issues, reconciliation and allow people to freely talk about their future aspirations under the Good Friday Agreement in a way that is less threatening and less divisive.  We are in the middle of a potential crisis that needs to be resolved.  That has to be our focus right now, but I can promise that, in many ways, people who live in Northern Ireland have got more attention from the Government in Dublin at one level, than the people in the Republic in the context of Brexit.<br/><br/>Let me reassure everyone that no one is being left behind.  We will not, and we will not let the EU, sign up to any deal that involves a really damaging unintended consequence of Brexit.  That is what we have been firmly trying to do for many months.<br/><br/>On the question of speaking rights and so on, I take Deputy Brendan Smith's point that if we come to a point where we are voting in this committee-----</p></speech>

We have to be honest with ourselves.  This is not a fully representative committee.  There are no unionists in this room.  I know the witnesses can say they choose not to turn up, but that does not solve the problem.  If we are going to have a real conversation here in the future about Northern Ireland and its future, shared responsibilities and so on, we have to find a way of having that conversation with people who represent a big portion of the population of Northern Ireland.  There is a very complete picture here in terms of the nationalist perspective but some of the issues that have been raised today and some of the painful legacy issues of the past involve families who would not regard themselves as being represented here.  Let us be honest about it.  All of us have work to do and the last thing we need to be doing is splitting this committee with votes and trying to force things through because one party may have more representation than another party.  That is not exactly the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement but, in fairness, I do not think that is the point Mr. Molloy was making and I do not want to attribute it to him.  I think what he was trying to say is that he wants to have a real say here, recognising the fact that he represents Irish people and I do not think that is an unreasonable sentiment</p></speech>

That would be really good.</p> <p>  On the criteria for calling for a Border poll, we know what it is in the Good Friday Agreement.  Basically, it is up to the judgment of the Secretary of State, as to whether he or she thinks there is a majority that has effectively changed its mind or has a new perspective that needs to be taken account of.  Some would say that is not ideal but that is what is in the Good Friday Agreement.  That is all the more reason the two Governments have to have a very close relationship on Northern Ireland, so that these decisions are discussed and managed appropriately.</p> <p>  Is it irresponsible for the Irish Government not to pursue a Border poll at the moment as one of the Brexit options, as Ms McCallion suggested?  I do not think it is.  I refer to adding that into the mix right now, when we are trying to get an agreed compromise with a parliament in Westminster that does not have any nationalist representation from Northern Ireland in it, and I am not going to get into that as Sinn F&eacute;in has to make its own decisions and it has valid reasons for making the decisions it makes.  The truth is that we have to try to get an agreement ratified right now in Westminster and to bring a Border poll into the mix-----</p></speech>

I have heard those debates in Northern Ireland, where nationalism has a new confidence and it wants more radical solutions in some cases.  That has to be part of the debate but that is all the more reason we need an Executive and an Assembly that can manage that debate, so that it does not become a polarised and threatening one and that there is leadership by example coming from the top down in politics.  When one talks about a safe and secure space to have this discussion, I would respectfully ask, in the context of the Brexit debate right now, whether we have a safe and secure and balanced platform for this discussion.

The Government will make money available for the project when it is ready to proceed.  We have not pulled funding from it.  In many ways, it was a saving that was offered to us because the project would not be ready to draw down funds until the end of the year at the earliest.  As soon as it moves ahead and there is a need for funding, the Irish Government will meet its commitment straightaway.  There will be no delay in that regard.  The way it was explained and sold probably led to some ambiguity that should not have been allowed to gain traction because people were talking about the Irish Government pulling money from the project to pay for the national children's hospital which was proving to be more expensive than we had thought it would be, but that is not what is happening.  If the project is ready to proceed in June, July or August, the money will be made available and we will have to find a saving somewhere else.  However, we are being told that the project will not be ready to start drawing down money until the end of the year at the very earliest and probably into the start of next year.  We are absolutely committed to spending the money we have signed up to spend to support the project because we know that we need to connect the north west more effectively to the rest of the country and the A5 project is a big part of that objective.  We have committed to giving &euro;75 million in total, but it was more than that.  The figure was reduced in the midst of the recession in Ireland when we were borrowing huge amounts of money from an emergency fund, with a lot of strings attached which made it very difficult for us to commit to giving &euro;400 million.  That is why the figure was reduced to &euro;75 million.  I am pretty confident that if the project gets under way, the Irish Government will not hold it up owing to a lack of funding.  We need to speak to the British Government about the matter to have it built.  I promise those present that, as a Government, we are very committed to having the A5 project completed.</p> <p>  In response to Mr. Brady, my understanding is the RHI inquiry was fairly robust and that it is going to report next month.  It is going to be an awkward period in which some people may be put under pressure.  Of course, lessons need to be learned and the new Executive will need to take account of them, but people should not be waiting for the inquiry to report in order to use it in a destructive way.  Instead we should be learning lessons from it, fix what was broken and then try to get the Executive functioning again, but there is a danger that the bitterness that may come from the inquiry will delay even further the opportunity to get the Executive up and running.  I am not for one minute saying we should ignore the recommendations made; of course, we should not.  When I say "we," I am referring mainly to the political parties in Northern Ireland.  There will have to be political consequences after such an inquiry.  I respectfully suggest the consequences should include a restructuring of how the new Executive will work in order to make sure that whatever is uncovered by the RHI inquiry cannot happen again because the systems in place will not allow it.  </p> <p>  In response to Deputy Brendan Smith's comments, we did consider having an independent chair.  We received a recommendation and towards the end of last year approached somebody to be an independent chair, but that person then had to pull out.  We are talking to the parties and there is no real objection to having an independent chair, but the Governments have to satisfy themselves whether they should bring in somebody new to the process and spend weeks or months waiting for them to build trust, confidence and relationships with the parties to get a deal done, or whether they should build on some of the work done up to a year ago.  As all of the parties know each other pretty well at this stage, we have to decide whether we have the capacity to start a process that would last not for months but for weeks and which would involve the two Governments also doing some heavy lifting in moving some of these difficult and contentious but important issues forward.  We are having some direct discussions with the British Government on how best we can do this.  I do not think anybody has the energy or enthusiasm for a new five or six-month process.  What everybody seems to want is honest and comprehensive interaction to get several things done and agreements in place which would provide a basis for re-establishing the Executive.  To be honest, it will take a lot of work to get there because the trust issues of the past four or five months have been very damaging.</p></speech>

We had the Minister in attendance yesterday so we have a good understanding of what is in this convention but we will start with her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1906" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2019022100002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss our convention on social security signed recently between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom.</p><p>In the context of Brexit, my objective is to ensure that the reciprocity of social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exists for Irish and UK citizens moving within the common travel area, is safeguarded and maintained.  This has been the aim since immediately after the referendum in the UK on 23 June 2016.  This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s overall commitment to maintain the common travel area, which is one of our four Brexit priorities.</p><p>Ireland and the UK share a long history of co-operation and reciprocity in social security matters.  The principle of reciprocity has been reinforced in bilateral agreements and arrangements on social security between our two countries since 1924 and, subsequently, in EU co-ordination regulations.  That reciprocity is underpinned by the principle of equal treatment so that Irish citizens in the UK enjoy the same benefits as UK citizens and <i>vice versa</i>.  These rules are designed to protect people moving and working between each State and to minimise any disadvantages they might experience.</p><p>From a social welfare perspective, maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>through safeguarding and preserving that very reciprocity is of crucial importance to me, my Department officials and our Government.</p><p>Because of the unique nature of the common travel area and the associated rights and privileges which it provides, and will continue to provide for Irish and British citizens in each other&rsquo;s countries, it was agreed that Ireland and the UK would formalise the pre-existing common travel area social protection arrangements in a legally binding agreement.</p><p>Last year, I met with the then UK Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and we agreed the objective of ensuring that the reciprocity of social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exist for Irish and UK citizens moving between Ireland and the United Kingdom under the common travel area, are safeguarded and maintained.</p><p>Since then, there has been intensive work at official level to develop and finalise the agreement to underpin these arrangements.  That agreement was signed on 1 February and is now subject to the ratification process in both Ireland and the UK and is the reason we are here today.</p><p>Under the terms of the agreement all existing arrangements with regard to recognition of, and access to, social insurance entitlements will be maintained in both jurisdictions.  This means that the rights of Irish citizens living in Ireland to benefit from social insurance contributions made while working in the UK and to access social insurance payments if resident in the UK are protected and <i>vice versa</i>.</p><p>There are approximately 132,000 people in receipt of a UK State pension living in this country and approximately 1,000 people receiving child benefit payments from the United Kingdom for children residing in Ireland<b>.</b></p><p>There are 28,760 people residing in the UK who are in receipt of a State pension (contributory) from Ireland.  Some 840 people residing in the UK are in receipt of full rate child benefit payments from my Department.  These payments are in respect of 1,830 children, 95% of whom live in Northern Ireland.  A further 920 people residing in the United Kingdom are in receipt of child benefit supplement payments from my Department in respect of 2,010 children, 97% of whom reside in Northern Ireland.  We want to ensure the continuation of these payments and that is the purpose of the bilateral agreement.</p><p>The agreement means there will be no change to social welfare payments, which will continue to be made as usual.  Where payments are made from Ireland to the United Kingdom or from the United Kingdom to Ireland, these arrangements will also continue.  It means our citizens can be absolutely sure that their social welfare benefits and entitlements remain as they were, and are, before Brexit.</p><p>As part of the ratification process the agreement was laid before the Houses on 7 and 8 February and it was the subject of a D&aacute;il motion on 12 February as a result of which we are here today.  As the Chairman expressed, the motion has a return date of 5 March.  Once the parliamentary procedures are completed, letters of exchange will be arranged.  The convention will be brought into effect by way of ministerial order.</p><p>The ratification process in the UK is also under way and it is also expected to be completed by 29 March.  If there is a no-deal Brexit then the convention will be required to come into effect immediately.  If there is a deal, which we all still hope there will be, the convention need not take effect until the end of all of the associated transition periods.<br/><br/>While I am confident that the ratification process will be completed in both jurisdictions before 29 March, we need to be sure that export and payment of benefits between Ireland and the United Kingdom and <i>vice versa</i>can continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit even if all the necessary steps in the ratification process are not completed on that date.  Therefore, it is prudent to proceed with Part 11 of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019, which we discussed here yesterday.  These amendments to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 are also designed to maintain the<i>status quo</i>in the common travel area with respect to social welfare arrangements.  <br/><br/>I have also included amendments to the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984, which provides for the insolvency payments scheme.  The scheme covers wage-related entitlements of employees who are employed in Ireland by an employer who has become insolvent in Ireland or another EU member state, including the UK.  Once the UK leaves the EU, employers in a state of insolvency under the laws of the UK will not fall within the scope of the Act.  That means employees of those employers who work and pay their insurance in Ireland would no longer be covered by the protections set out in the Act unless we make the amendments to section 12 of the miscellaneous Bill.  The purpose of the amendments in this part of the Bill is to ensure that those employees will continue to be covered by the scheme in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Given the economic uncertainties that may prevail in a no-deal scenario, it is vital that we continue to provide this protection to workers in Ireland and that is why I am introducing these amendments in the Bill.<br/><br/>The Government has discussed this proposed legislation throughout our meetings in January and February.  Its provisions were also the subject of intensive and daily engagements between Departments and the Parliamentary Counsel.  As outlined yesterday, the Government expects to publish the full omnibus Bill on 22 February.  It is our intention that it would go before the D&aacute;il for Second Stage from 26 to 28 February, it would go through Committee and Report Stages from 4 to 8 March and it would then go to the Seanad for Second Stage on 11 and 12 March to be followed by Committee and Report Stages on 13 and 14 March.  It will come back to the D&aacute;il if amendments are required.  <br/><br/>This convention is an essential element in the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>in the common travel arrangements we have enjoyed for many years.  It brings certainty to an area that affects many Irish and British citizens.  I genuinely appreciate the support of this committee and its co-operation and efforts and hope that they will help ensure that our Parliament will ratify this convention and pass the miscellaneous legislation in the next number of weeks.  I am happy to respond to any questions members may have.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1908" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2019022100002#B00200"><p>The Minister gave a very thorough overview of the legislation and convention yesterday so I will not dwell on too many points.  The figures given by the Minister today and yesterday show how important it is that there is certainty and a seamless transition through very uncertain times for everyone.</p> <p>  I will home in on one area, namely, the provision relating to overlapping.  I have some concerns that I hope the Minister will be able to allay.  She would be aware that in 2012, a European Court of Justice ruling allowed people who had worked in the UK to avail of the winter fuel payment.  I think approximately 132,000 people are eligible to apply for the British winter fuel payment, which can range from &pound;100 up to &pound;300.  Certainly it is a very important payment for those people.  That ruling did not stop people also qualifying for the Irish fuel allowance.  I am seeking clarity regarding this overlapping.  I read through the document and there is no specific mention anywhere of the winter fuel payment.  Can the Minister clarify whether overlapping will do away with that so that people will only be able to qualify for one payment, be it the Irish fuel allowance or the British winter fuel payment?  A bit of clarity would be helpful.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1909" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2019022100002#B00300"><p>The drafts of the Bill, which is the miscellaneous Bill and not the convention, include a head that includes the avoidance of overlapping of benefits.  What we are doing is maintaining the current rights.  Obviously, what we want to do is to try to avoid the situation we had a while ago.  That ambiguity arose because there was no legislation that prescribed anything in law.  One of the heads of the Bill that will be published tomorrow will detail how we intend to avoid it but that does not mean that it necessarily will not be open to challenge.  We are prepared and we hope that we will be able to prescribe in law that someone cannot avail of something in both scenarios.  Obviously, we want to maintain what we have in this instance and, in essence, this is about trying to perfect what we thought we had before it was undermined by the European Court of Justice ruling regarding jurisdiction rights of people in the UK and Ireland to apply for each other's fuel payments a number of years ago.  The draft head will include a motion of avoidance of overlapping benefits but we will maintain the current arrangements and are not changing the rules for anything else.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1910" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2019022100002#B00400"><p>So the Minister is saying that she will be seeking to change things so that people will not be able to avail of both payments.  That will be really concerning for many people.  We will wait and see what is in the legislation once it is published tomorrow but I would have concerns.  We will wait and have a look but it would be of grave concern to the 132,000 Irish people who worked in the UK.  In respect of being told there will be no changes, that is a significant change for many people.  Many people are not aware that they could qualify for the winter fuel payment in the UK.  I know a large number of people do qualify in accordance with the ruling by the European Court of Justice in 2012.  We will look at the legislation tomorrow but I would have concerns in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1911" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1306" speakername="Joan Collins" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2019022100002#B00500"><p>I apologise for not being able to attend the meeting yesterday.  This is all part of the transition in respect of a deal or no deal.  The dates are very tight.  Committee and Report Stages will take place in the Seanad on 13 and 14 March.  The Bill will go back to the D&aacute;il before 29 March.  In her speech, the Minister said there might be a problem in the event of no deal.  Could we get clarity on that?  What is in place in terms of future changes after 29 March?  Is there agreement that if a problem between the UK and Ireland regarding social security comes up, there is an arrangement to deal with it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.1912" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2019022100002#B00600"><p>When we met last March when I went to the UK to meet the then Minister, Esther McVey, the principle we agreed would be set out in the convention was that we wanted to continue doing exactly what we have been doing for donkeys years.  Officials from my Department and her department finessed that agreement and finalised it towards the end of December.  That agreement was signed on 1 February.  The agreement was part of the withdrawal agreement so it was detailed in protocol 20 that we were to do this and we had the blessing of everybody so that in the event of a deal, there would be an orderly transition on continuing to legally do what we have always done with each other's citizens for a long time.  In December, when things looked a bit ropey and it looked like there might not be an orderly Brexit, the Government decided that we needed to put in contingency plans regarding the common travel area we want to continue to enjoy after a no-deal Brexit.  That is where this piece of legislation came from.</p><p>We started to draft the heads of the Bill to replicate everything that was in the convention, which is to have exactly the same <i>status quo</i>on March 30 as we have on March 29.  We started that in December so that in the event of a no-deal Brexit this new legislation would give me the legal basis to continue to pay what we have been paying.  Since we started drafting that Bill the convention was completed and signed off on 1 February.  We have now discovered that since the convention processes have started in this Parliament and in the UK Parliament I actually do not need section 11 of the Bill.  Because the ratification process had started in both parliaments, and because there is the goodwill and intention to complete it even if it is not completed by the Irish or the UK parliaments before 29 March, I can by regulation legally instruct my Department to continue paying as can the new Minister in the UK, Amber Rudd, legally continue to pay, because we are in the process of ratifying.  In essence, because we have started the ratification process I do not need the double surety of the legislation I thought I needed.  We will finish the ratification process today and the committee will send a message back to the D&aacute;il.  That is our part done.  <br/><br/>The process in the United Kingdom is slightly different in that they must lay their convention before the Houses for a 21 day cooling off period.  This is to allow their MPs to make submissions, objections or enhancements, or just comment on it, to the Privy Council.  The Privy Council is meeting on 13 March and the cooling off period finishes on 19 March.  If there are no changes to be made they will ratify their convention on 19 March or thereafter.  If all of that happens then we do not need to worry about anything.  If it does not happen, then I and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in the United Kingdom, Amber Rudd, will both have to sign a regulation to say that given that we are in the middle of this ratification process, which has not yet been completed, we will sign regulations to allow us to continue paying what we have always paid until the ratification process is legally binding - because we know it will happen within a matter of days or weeks of the exit date of 29 March.  It is most likely that while I will go ahead with section 11 of the Bill it will not be needed to commence, but I will have to go ahead with section 12 with regard to the insolvency requirements and securities that are needed around that.  I am aware that it is a little odd, but the situation we are in is very odd.  Either way, I want to guarantee that on 30 March and thereafter people will have the securities and the rights exactly as they had on 29 March, regardless of which mechanism we use to ensure those rights are continued on 30 March.</p></speech>

Obviously it can be changed and adapted at any stage.  Yesterday we talked about this - I believe it was Senator Higgins who had asked about it.  The Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill is currently not on our Statute Book, but if it was it would be included in the list of schemes in the current bilateral.  At some point in the future if parents take paid parental leave and they live in the United Kingdom but work in Ireland we will adapt it.  We want to continue to enjoy the friendly relations and securities we have with each other, between Irish people living in Britain and British people living in Ireland, for many years to come please God.</p></speech>

The UK process is not in our hands and we have to assume it will happen.  The Minister made the interesting point that if the ratification is not complete payments will continue because the Minister can issue a regulation while the ratification is in process.  How long can the Minister work under that regulation? Is it time specific or is it open ended?</p></speech>

The principle is that so long as the goodwill and intention of both parliaments exists, and as long as the intention that has been laid out by Esther McVey, Amber Rudd and the UK Government that it wants to do this does not change, then one would expect the process to continue.  We will know very quickly if there is a problem with the process.  I do not expect-----</p></speech>

I will use the Deputy as an example for argument's sake.  He cannot work in Ireland and in the UK subscribing a contribution in the same week.  There is no overlap around anything else that requires a contribution.  The winter fuel allowance in Ireland or the UK does not require a contribution: it is an additional add-on and does not have a legislative basis.  This is why there was an anomaly and why we are moving to secure no overlap in the future.  I do not believe there was ever an intention of the Irish Government or the British Government to have rights and entitlements that would overlap in the first instance.  We are going to ensure in the regulations that this anomaly does not occur again.</p></speech>
