He is joined by Ms Mary Henry, deputy director of audit.</p><p>We will hold over the minutes of the last meeting until the next meeting as I just have not had time to review them yet, and we will hold over matters arising.</p><p>There are three categories of correspondence.  The first item concerns Nos. 1996A<b></b>and 1997<b></b>from the Department of Education and Skills, dated 19 February 2019, which provide a briefing document and an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Correspondence Nos. 1987 and 1995 are from Kildare Wicklow Education and Training Board, dated 15 February and 19 February, and provide a briefing document and an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish these.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Correspondence Nos. 1978A and 1993 from the Irish Council for Social Housing, dated 14 February and 20 February, provide a briefing document and an opening statement for today's meeting.  Is it agreed that we will note and publish these?  Agreed.</p><p>Correspondence Nos. 1979 and 1994<b></b>from the approved housing body interim regulatory committee, dated 15 February and 19 February, provide a briefing document and an opening statement.  Is it agreed that we will note and publish these?  Agreed.</p><p>We will move on to the B category of correspondence, which is from Accounting Officers and Ministers, and follow-up to previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The first item of correspondence is No. 1965 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills on our meeting with Kildare Wicklow Education and Training Board today.  The committee was made aware of this item at last week's meeting and we are formally noting it now.  It is important to stress, and we have to be very conscious today when we have the ETB in, that the Thorn report and, I think, the report by the Comptroller and Auditor General have been referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has made it very clear, and I will read one sentence: </p><blockquote>Having regard to the ongoing investigation ... with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department's legal advice, at the planned meeting, we are in a position to provide the Committee with information and answers on matters in both Dr. Thorn and the C &amp;amp; AG reports, without providing a level of detail which could identify individuals or companies or their activities.</blockquote> <p>We are not going to compromise a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigation here today, or any potential legal cases that could go from it.  I think we all understand that but I have to just make that point clear.  We will note and publish that.</p><p>The next correspondence is No. 1966 from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, providing a copy of the Analysys Mason report on pricing and access arrangements for the metropolitan area network.  We will note that was published the day before the last meeting.  We are now noting this copy.  We did discuss that particular report the last day so we are noting this.  The Department already has published the actual report but we will publish the accompanying letter. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#B00300"><p>Given that the publication of that report coincided with a significant reduction in the cost per metre of fibre, had it been published a year ago it would have or is likely to have brought that reduction at that point.  We are owed an explanation as to why publication was delayed given that it had that impact.  It would be well worthwhile to write back and ask them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#B00400"><p>We will write back and ask for a detailed explanation of the timing, from the time the report was completed, and the discussions they had with Enet last summer when Enet expected it to be published within weeks, and what was the particular reason for the delay.  We want to come back to the broadband issue in our work programme as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#B00500"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#B00600"><p>The Deputy is right on that.  We are writing back to the Department on that specific issue.</p><p>The next item is No. 1968 from the Valuation Office and pertains to the Harold's Cross stadium.  The Commissioner of Valuation has made it clear that there was no contact whatsoever with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine during the process of valuing Harold's Cross.  We have to accept that.  He put it clearly in black and white when he said it would be outside its remit and inappropriate to do so.  We will note and publish that.</p><p>The next item is No. 1972, which was provided by BT at our meeting last week - it is a copy - where BT refers to the Analysys Mason report.  We will publish correspondence No. 1972, which we dealt with last week.  As I said, we have already acknowledged that the Analysys Mason report was published by the Department.  We will publish it on our website as people will want to follow it through our website.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 1973 from the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine stating there were no communications whatsoever between his office, and the Department, and the Valuation Office in relation to the sale of Harold's Cross stadium.  We will note and publish this.  The Department is saying there was no contact so we have to accept that. </p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 1974 from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which provides information on the legislative basis for amending the broadband tender, the decision to extract 300,000 households from the tender and the expert opinion relied on for this.  We can note and we will publish this.  I want to put that on our work programme as an item we want to deal with.  I will make one comment about the letter that he actually sent to us.  It is a detailed letter.  We asked about the state aid issue.  At this point in time we know there is only one tenderer still on the pitch - I will just call it that way - but it had not been formally categorised as the preferred tenderer at this point.  We asked about state aid and I will quote from the second paragraph of page 6 of his letter: </p><blockquote>A formal State aid notification has not yet been submitted to the EU Commission and a formal decision by the Commission in respect of the notified measure has not, therefore, been made, as this can only be done after preferred bidder stage of the procurement process. </blockquote> <p>In terms of the broadband issue, which we will come back to because I am putting it on the work programme, the state aid issue, the European Commission has not given its approval yet for this project because they got to see the details of the tender and the preferred bidder, and what is involved.  So we are a little bit away, one way or the other.  It still has to go to Europe after that stage.  We will just park that and publish this because we want to deal with the broadband issue and the work programme in a few minutes. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#B00700"><p>There is one further aspect to this on which it would be useful to have clarification and which arose on a number of occasions last week.  I refer to the mapping process and the possibility of duplication.  I think we can go back to them and ask them just exactly what has been mapped because there are public entities that have fibre like the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is.  We need to know if they have been included in the mapping process because after all, it would all be public money.  As it is for the avoidance of duplication, that would be helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#B00800"><p>Fine and  I thank the Deputy.  An attachment came with the letter with the heading, national broadband plan state aid compliance update on the mapping of Eir's rural extension plan, dated 8 March 2017.  There is a suggestion that we do not publish this because it is marked privileged and confidential.  However, they have redacted sections of the report, produced by PwC, on pages 6, 7 and 8, obviously in relation to matters that could be commercially sensitive.  I propose that we double check with them that we can publish the redacted form.  We can deal with the redacted issues separately.  From my reading of this report, they have obviously redacted the bits that they consider sensitive.  We will get clearance to publish the redacted version of that appendix that came with that letter as well.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 1977 from the HSE, providing a note requested by the committee regarding the involvement of PricewaterhouseCoopers with BAM.  The HSE advises that there is a framework in place for the provision of professional services to assist in the programme for health service improvement.  The framework provides resourcing and expertise to be drawn down from PwC as required.  So we will note and publish this letter.  The HSE is saying that as far as it is concerned, there is no accounting.  That is its position.  We note and publish that.</p><p> No. 1980B is from the office of the Secretary General of Department of Finance stating that he is unavailable for a meeting on 7 March 2019.  We now have Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, coming to that meeting.  We will reschedule for the Department of Finance as soon as practicable thereafter.  The cancellation suited the other meeting.  That is noted and published.</p><p> No. 1981B is from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  It provides an update to a query raised by the committee on agreeing a contract for the position of chief executive of the authority.  The authority advises that a contract has been concluded under terms and conditions approved by the Minister.  We will note and publish that.  We had a particular query on that.</p><p> No. 1983B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on his attendance at a Committee of Public Accounts meeting to discuss the oversight and implementation of capital projects.  Mr. Watt is making himself available to the committee on 7 March.  He has drawn attention to three other invitations from other Oireachtas committees.  He has also drawn attention to Standing Order 84(2), an internal Oireachtas Standing Order.  Members will be aware of this and should keep it in mind in terms of how we proceed.  While we all agree duplication should be avoided, the committee has never relied on Standing Order 84(2).</p><p> We should deal with the other letters.  Essentially, I want to make one thing clear.  We have already discussed - it was noted at our previous meeting - the position when we decided to invite Robert Watt before the committee.  We specifically framed the invitation around oversight and implementation of capital projects.  We want to know the governance and oversight arrangements.  We made no reference to the children's hospital.  That would have been specific to the Joint Committee on Health and a different Accounting Officer.  It is the case that major capital projects will be asked about on the day he comes in, including broadband, Luas lines, light rail, schools and so on.  Our invitation was not specific to the children's hospital.  He is coming before the committee to discuss oversight and implementation of capital projects.  He has asked our committee to notify the other three committee chairmen of this issue even though they were copied with the correspondence.</p><p> At this stage - I appeal to committee members to bear with me - we have received letters from two other committees on this issue.  I want to note No. 1990B.  It is a copy of a letter from Deputy Colm Brophy, Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, to Robert Watt.  His letter to us says his committee invitation predated our invitation.  I note in that letter of invitation to Robert Watt he discussed twice the issue of health expenditure and the national children's hospital.  He was specifically asking about the children's hospital.  We did not ask about that.  We asked about overall capital project oversight and implementation and governance of capital projects.  I can understand that he might not want to talk on a matter that is specific to one Department.  That is a matter between him and the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.</p><p> There is also a letter on file from Deputy John McGuinness, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  He also says in a letter to Mr. Robert Watt dated 19 February that he accepts the prospect of meeting all four committees on different issues or different aspects of the national children's hospital might be regarded as unduly onerous.  He accepts there should not be duplication.  However, I want to make it clear that we never invited Robert Watt specifically on the national children's hospital.  It is not right to suggest that we were asking about the children's hospital.</p><p> I propose to notify the other committees that our meeting is going ahead.  We note their specific references to the national children's hospital.  That is a different issue from what our meeting is about.  The purpose of the meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in particular is different.  I imagine Mr. Watt is accountable to that committee.  That committee can deal with Mr. Watt in due course.</p><p> We will not get into political argy-bargy with other committees but we have letters and we are proceeding.  The wording of the invitation from other committees to Mr. Watt is a matter for them.  Our invitation is different and he is coming before this committee.  Other committees can take it up with Mr. Watt in due course in their manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#C00200"><p>I remember well the context because I proposed the approach.  It was in the context of discussing the national children's hospital overrun that we considered how the process could lead to a repeat of the difficulties in other projects if we did not have some understanding of what happened.  It was surely around process.  In fact, it was not only the Secretary General we invited.  We also specifically made the request to the person who headed up the procurement section.  Essentially, it appeared that there was quite rigorous oversight on procurement from that section when it came to purchasing things.  We need to understand that role from the point of view of big capital projects.  There appears to be a gap in our scrutiny from an institutional point of view, and the idea is to tease out that particular aspect.  It is critical not only that Mr. Watt comes before the committee but that we understand this from the broader perspective.  We also need to understand it from the perspective of the head of the procurement office.  If there is an institutional gap, then there is a process failure and it cannot but repeat itself.  It is both.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#C00300"><p>For housekeeping purposes at this stage we will note and publish the letter from Robert Watt, No. 1983B and the letter from Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, No.1984B.  We also note the letter from the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, No. 1990B and the letter from the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, No. 1991B.  We will note and publish those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#C00400"><p>I wish to make a wider point.  I realise we are dealing with the letter from the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I will deal with that in a moment.  I raised this matter at the last meeting and I need your guidance, Chairman, on how we will proceed with it now.  When we first dealt with this we discussed the matter with the Secretary General of the Department, his officials and members of the board.  At the time, we did not have any of the minutes of the board meetings or the sub-committee meetings.  We got those after the fact.  We did not have the reports from the independent examination carried out.  As it happens, they shed some light on some of the issues.  Again, we had a false meeting whereby we had the Accounting Officer and the board before the committee but we did not have the information we now have.  That would have enabled us to put the questions that we can now put.  I suggest we get them back in again, because we are now armed with the information.</p> <p>  It may serve as an example to other Accounting Officers in the sense that when this happens we are not going to accept being kept in the dark about reports or accept having to drag information out of people.  They come in and we do not get a chance to put questions that we should be able to put because we do not have the information.  We need to think about this.  Many of these issues centre around boards making decisions on information they do not have.  The Committee of Public Accounts ends up in exactly the same position.  Even after the fact, we do not get information to allow us to do our work.  That is a strong point that we should make in response to the correspondence.</p> <p>  Mr. Watt will come before the committee.  I realise there are sectoral committees.  I have no inclination, nor do other members of the committee, to step on the toes of any sectoral committee.  However, if we are to be honest, there is an element of jockeying for position from some of the committees.  Those sectoral committees have a job to do and good luck to them.  They can bring in Ministers.  We do not seek to bring in any Ministers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#C00500"><p>They can bring in Secretaries General too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#C00600"><p>Yes, but primarily the Minister is responsible to the sectoral committees.  The Accounting Officer, who is the Secretary General, is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are dealing with issues to do with process failures, systems failures and procedural failures, all of which fall under the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  There are times of course when they also fall under the remit of sectoral committees but let the Minister come before those committees with his or her officials and deal with them.  We have to do our job as well.  I do not think we should accept that.</p> <p>  I wish to make another point.  I am not criticising you, Chairman, but I learned in the media at the weekend that there was an invitation or offer being made to other committees to sit with us to discuss some of these issues.  I believe that was a mistake because it devalues the Committee of Public Accounts in some respects.</p><p>This committee has a separate function from the sectoral committees.  I understand the context in which the Chairman made that offer.  He was trying to be helpful. However, it would have been better if that had been discussed here.  That is not a criticism, because I know the Chairman was trying to do the right thing. </p></speech>

The Accounting Officer did not sit on the board, Mr. Quinn did and he is the person who must answer the questions.  How can the Accounting Officer answer questions for somebody who sat on the board?  That is not going to happen.  We should write back to Mr. Quinn, thanking him for his response but insisting that we want him here along with the Accounting Officer.  We should set a session aside for the board to appear again with the Secretary General of the Department so we can put the questions we should have been able to put to them the last time.  If anything, we should do this as an example of what happens if they do not give us the information that they should before they come before the committee.</p></speech>

I have a couple of observations.  Obviously, these letters from Mr. Quinn and Mr. Watt are co-ordinated.  We asked Mr. Quinn specific questions.  He writes: &quot;I refer to your letters of 8 and 12 February.  I will respond to the issues raised therein in due course.&quot;  It is a bit worrying that he has not responded already.  He should be able to answer these questions pretty quickly.  I would have thought they are pretty basic questions.  Why has it taken so long?</p><p>I want to emphasise that as a committee we do not bring Ministers before us.  I think that has only happened once.  Dealing with this issue is definitely within our remit.  Mr. Watt's letter reads:</p><blockquote>I understand that you have also invited Mr. Paul Quinn, Chief Procurement Officer, Office of Government Procurement, which is a Division of my Department, to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  As is normal, I will notify the Committee secretariat of the departmental officials attending with me in advance of the meeting.</blockquote> <p>To whom is it &quot;normal&quot;?  It is not normal to us.  When we invite certain Departments and Accounting Officers, they can bring whoever they want.  On many occasions, however, we have asked specifically for certain officials.  This is not just about the national children's hospital.  The gentleman in question is head of the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  While the OGP is within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it is an office in its own right.  Mr. Quinn is the most senior procurement officer in the country.  We are concerned with issues about the children's hospital and how it was dealt with, but there is a wider issue concerning processes which we need to investigate.  If what has happened with the children's hospital is in any way exemplary, there are wider process issues in the way major contracts are awarded, dealt with and managed.</p><p>Mr. Watt will appear before the committee.  We must specifically insist that the head of the Office of Government Procurement appears as well.  I do not mind whether he appears with Mr. Watt or in a separate session.  In fact, appearing in a separate session might be a good thing.  It is for this committee to decide which sessions we want people to attend, not for anybody else.  We decide the format of our meetings.</p><p>In addition, as part of this discussion we need to hear from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of Government Procurement.  We will obviously ask questions concerning the hospital, but we should also ask about the process that is followed with all other projects.</p><p>It is the full-time job of several officials in the Department of Health to manage the health Vote.  I would also like those officials to attend, along with their Secretary General.</p></speech>

There are officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform whose full-time job is to manage the health Vote, one of the largest Votes in the Government.  I am specifically requesting that the committee invite them to appear if we can find out who they are.  I think there are two of them, but there may be one.  I am open to correction.</p> <p>  I agree with the previous speaker.  Members of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board appeared before this committee.  We need to question its members again, along with the Secretary General, in the very near future.  Given the volume of information that has since entered the public domain, the questions we asked and the answers we were given are no longer the totality of what we need to know.

We have heard from the Joint Committee on Health.  I am making it clear, as Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts, that each of those committees had an opportunity to deal with these issues long before they ever came before the Committee on Public Accounts.  They deal with these matters at their Estimates hearings.  There was nothing preventing those committees from dealing with the prison Vote or the capital plan for the HSE as it relates to the children's hospital when they were discussing their Estimates in recent years.  I do not know what level of discussion they had, but the issues have now landed on our desk.  They all had the opportunity to raise these matters long before they landed on our desk, had they chosen to do so.</p></speech>

The correspondence is noted and will be published.  We have decided on the appropriate action to be taken.</p><p>Item No. 1990, correspondence received from the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, and item No. 1991, correspondence received from the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, are noted, as is item No. 1984, correspondence received from the Chief Procurement Officer.</p><p>Item No. 1985 is correspondence received from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing an update on the review by the OECD of valuing capital assets and moving to accrual accounting.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  In addition to it, there is an attachment, item No. 1985(2)B that deals with the report on employer contributions under the single public service pension scheme which some people will find interesting.  Now that the public service has moved to the single public service pension scheme there are issues as to whether some State bodies are included in the scheme.  The report confirms that relevant authorities - confirmed as being authorities mainly financed directly or indirectly from the Central Fund - do not have to make employer PRSI contributions.  The report lists various bodies in the schedule, Appendix No. 1, which we will publish.  Appendix No. 2 deals with 24 bodies which have been confirmed as mainly self-financing but which are liable for the making of single scheme employer contributions.  The 24 bodies include the National Milk Agency, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported that they should have been making contributions since the Act was passed in 2013.  Some of the bodies have made provision for the contributions, but the last paragraph on page 4 is disconcerting.  It reads:</p><blockquote>In total, 20 bodies have agreed to remit arrears in respect of prior years.  However, there are four public service bodies that did not provide an employer contribution for pre-existing public service pension schemes, but are deemed liable for employer contributions under the Single Scheme.  These bodies did not set aside amounts to meet the Single Scheme employer contributions.  These are the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), the Dental Council and the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAl).  Issues arising in respect of the payment of arrears of employer contributions by these bodies are currently under consideration.</blockquote> <p>The committee will ask that the issue be dealt with and finalised in the current year.  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General like to comment on it?</p></speech>

I picked out the same paragraph.  What is the liability?  Is it likely to have an impact on bodies' ability to deliver services - for example, the Residential Tenancies Board - and is there a repayment schedule for them?  Have they even agreed to one?</p></speech>

They are in discussions on how this matter will be resolved.  They have not yet made decisions.  In many cases, because they are recovering their costs from those who pay fees or charges, one would expect to see an increase in fees or charges in order to make the repayments.</p></speech>

The Dental Council of Ireland has not yet finalised its agreement - I think of all the orthodontic treatment being provided - while the Health Products Regulatory Authority has agreed to remit an amount which has not yet been finalised.

The bodies have to recover an amount from external sources.  On the expected liability on those who purchase the services, for want of a better description, is it the case that the bodies will have to go back to service users to ask them to pay more than they had expected to pay?</p></speech>

However, the matter has not yet been resolved.  In the individual audits of the agencies we were picking up that there was a matter in dispute.  As the quantum had not been determined, provision was not made in the financial statements.  We did not know how big the problem was because the full scope was not clear.  The fact is business continued from 2013 without the collection being made.</p></speech>

It might be helpful to members if I indicated the scale of the moneys to which we are referring.  The lowest amount I can see on the list is for the Teaching Council of Ireland, for which the figure is &euro;60,000, whereas the Commission for Communications Regulation had to make arrears payments totalling &euro;1.13 million.  The repayments for the organisations can be in the hundreds of thousands of euro or less, but they will have to fund them and it is an issue for them.</p></speech>

For example, the income of the Residential Tenancies Board comes from landlords' registration fees.  Landlords who registered paid the registration fee and were legally right in what they did; it is the landlords who do not register are the problem.  The ones who registered were told that the fee was &euro;150 or whatever it was.  Now the RTB has to go back and state the fee should have been &euro;155 or &euro;160.  That is a highly unusual position for an organisation to find itself in.  Essentially, in the absence of the RTB being able to do so, I am concerned that it may affect its ability to deliver in its gigantic body of work, the volume of which is greater than it is currently able to carry out in a timely way.</p></speech>

We will follow through and write to the four groups mentioned in the schedule about the issue.  I thank the Deputy for following through on the point.</p> <p>  Item No. 1969 is correspondence sent to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the organisation Former Local Authority Members &Eacute;ire, FLAME, about the winding up of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.  We note the correspondence which is extensive and was copied to us.  The committee needs to take no action on the matter.</p> <p>  Item No. 1970 relates to property purchase and a decision made by the Property Registration Authority.  The individual is unhappy with the outcome.  However, the matter is not within the remit of the committee.  The person concerned had an issue with how the Property Registration Authority had dealt with title deeds and took the case to the Ombudsman.</p><p>She wrote to the Ombudsman seeking assistance on the matter but because the Property Registration Authority of Ireland, PRAI, had said in its response that she could appeal to the courts it looks as if the Ombudsman said she still has an option.  However, that is not an option in the public service.  What I want to do is write to the Ombudsman to ask not about the particular case but to set out the process on how it deals with cases from the PRAI.  I will ask what the office deems a case it can take up or whether it requires people to go to court before coming back to the Ombudsman.  That should not be the case.  We will write to the Ombudsman for a general note on how it deals with cases in that organisation, but we are not dealing specifically with the case at hand.  We will note that.</p><p> No. 1986C is from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien in relation to the national paediatric hospital development board.  The paediatric hospital will be on our work programme so we will note it and agree to discuss it in our work programme.</p><p> No. 1988C is a copy for the committee of correspondence with the solicitors disciplinary tribunal.  That is not under any circumstances within the remit of the committee so we will note the item.</p><p> Next, we will deal with statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  We will move quickly through that.</p></speech>

It relates to a report on companies in Cork Institute of Technology, CIT.  I have requested on numerous occasions a report on the CIT companies on which a commitment was given at the committee.  We have written a number of times.  I have again written to the committee asking for the report because it is outstanding for so long it is ridiculous.  It did not come up under correspondence.</p></speech>

This could be going on for up to a year.  It is going on at least six months.  It is strange that it did not come up in correspondence.  The report has been promised on a number of occasions and there has been a number of deadlines.  There should not be a major delay with the report and it is deeply concerning to me that it is taking this amount of time.  Could we please write a final letter to CIT saying we want the report by next week&rsquo;s meeting?</p></speech>

The Local Loans Fund, which is winding down, got a clear audit opinion.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland got a clear audit opinion.  The Travellers Protection Fund Investment Account got a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The main purpose of our meeting is to deal with the Kildare Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, 2015 accounts.

The Legal Services Regulatory Authority was established on 1 Oct 2016 and this is its first set of financial statements covering the 15 months to 31 December 2017.  It got a clear audit opinion.  The Law Reform Commission got a clear audit opinion.  Oifig Chomisin&eacute;ir na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la got a clear audit opinion.  Mary Immaculate College got a clear audit opinion but attention is drawn to non-compliant procurement of &euro;524,000.  The Comptroller and Auditor General refers to the matter at the end of the financial statement.</p> <p>  Next, we will discuss the work programme.  Today, we have the Kildare Wicklow ETB financial statements and the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report and also the Thorn report.  The witnesses will come in shortly.  The matter is subject to Garda investigation and we must be careful in that regard.</p> <p>  In the afternoon session we will deal with housing issues.  We will have representatives from the Irish Council for Social Housing and the Approved Housing Body Interim Regulatory Committee.</p> <p>  Next week, on 28 February, we will deal with housing matters again.  We will have the Secretary General before the committee in the morning to discuss housing matters and in the afternoon we will deal with the remainder of the Vote concerning the Local Government Fund.  At that point we will conclude this section of the work on housing and we will include it in our next interim report.  We had a meeting with them some time ago, today's meeting is helpful, and we will conclude then after that with our interim report.</p> <p>  On 7 March we will have Robert Watt, Paul Quinn and others to discuss oversight and implementation of capital projects.  Paul Quinn will specifically discuss the role of the Office of Government Procurement, and officials in relation to the national paediatric hospital development board.</p> <p>  On Thursday, 14 March we have a small matter we did not get to include in the discussion on the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach on the previous occasion, relating to the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  I propose on that day we finish our work on broadband and have the Department back in.  We had it in on 6 December and we had the private individuals in.  We have received correspondence outlining the position in regard to state aid and we will ask for further information.  There is no point in us closing the stable door after the horse has bolted in the sense that the tender has been out there since-----</p></speech>

Somewhere along the line, a good while ago, we decided that it was strictly turnabout so I sat back then and just waited for my name to pop up.  Sure enough it has not been popping up and that just occurred to me but I got a call last week to ask if I would be second speaker on a particular matter so I agreed and I asked the member of secretariat who called me what way that works now.  I was informed that some members had expressed a special interest in a particular matter so they were the leads on that.  I said that I did not really realise that rule had been reintroduced and if that is the rule that is fine, we will all be up early in the morning and pick the meetings that we want to be leads on.  I certainly would have had an interest in the Irish Prison Service, for example, and I stayed on that evening to get extra time and that is fine.  However, funnily enough I was told at that meeting that I was pencilled in to lead on the meeting of 7 March and I noticed that two colleagues are in for 7 March, ironically from the same party as me but I am sure that is coincidental.  The identity of the witness for that meeting is not being lost on me and it is probably appropriate to mention the contents of a newspaper article last Sunday about a report being commissioned by two other committees which seemed to be about this committee and something of a co-ordinated effort to question the Committee of Public Accounts, its remit, its performance, the styles of individuals and all of that kind of stuff.  Is the Chairman aware of-----</p></speech>

I think one of the committees in question is the Business Committee.  I understood that the Business Committee sets the business for the House and determines that there will be statements on X on such a day and on Y on such a day, that this speaker will have two minutes and lead spokespeople will have ten minutes etc. so I wonder what remit it has in procuring a report on the Committee of Public Accounts and what terms of reference were laid out on that?  I know the Committee on Procedures and Privileges may have a remit in that regard but as a committee we are entitled to know what is going on, what terms of reference are being used, who prepared the report and what is the <i>modus operandi</i>here.  That is an aside and I am finished with that issue.</p><p>On lead speakers, let there be one rule or let there not be one rule and if it is turned about it is turned about or if we can express that we want to lead then tell us we can do so because I was phoned and told I was in on 7 March and I notice that I am not here now.  I do not particularly have a problem with that but we should decide what we are doing and stick to it because we do not want the perception that lead speakers are being managed.  I could be forgiven for thinking that might be the case.</p></speech>

I do not appear anywhere on anything either as first, second or third lead.  I have a particular interest in many issues but that is neither here nor there.  The system of working in turn was very straight and just.  Members take their turns and sometimes we have a particular interest in an issue and sometimes we do not but it makes us do the work anyway if we have a particular interest rather than picking and choosing.</p></speech>

In fairness, we regularly get phone calls on this.  I often get called and asked if I will step in and be first speaker or second speaker because a member is not going to turn up.

I want to see that.  We had the view that it should be done by rotation so that everybody gets an equal opportunity.  There will always be somebody who is in line for a meeting and they cannot make it so they phone in and somebody has to step in but they should really be swapping and moving back down the list.  We have a job of work to do to get this end of it right.</p></speech>

That is logical.  There should be rotation and no party should get the first two spots but they can come in later on.  Do we get where we want to go with this?

There was that issue and there was the issue of the reports being done on us which the Chairman might come back to us on.  The third issue is the Irish Prison Service.  We got the response last week and I raised some issues and further issues have arisen since.  I wanted to respectfully ask that we pick a date for a meeting of decent length.  I do not know if members will have the time and I know the schedule is tight but we need a dedicated meeting on issues that have emerged.  The document that has come back falls well short of the sort of response that we need.  I will not hold up the meeting and begin to list them because we would be here until 4 p.m. but we need a full day on the Irish Prison Service and we should not bury it within the appropriation accounts of the Department overall.  It should not be on the day we are dealing the Department of Justice and Equality Vote because there are too many matters there.  I ask that a date be scheduled for that in early course and that might be communicated to us.</p></speech>

Is there any update on the issue that Deputy MacSharry raised about the committee of oversight for IBRC?  We are talking about a very large amount of money.  Mr. McCarthy might remember there is a court issue and there was to be some consideration given to whether there could be a more satisfactory arrangement whereby we would look at this as opposed to it proceeding in the courts.  Can we have an update on that?</p></speech>

The oversight of it is with the Department of Finance as opposed to being supervised by the courts.  It is a big issue and sometimes we deal with issues that are relatively small, in monetary terms in comparison with something like this.  This is a big item and I am unhappy that we have not arrived at a conclusion at this stage about whether there should be an expansion, for example, in this committee having oversight or there being a committee of oversight.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General confirmed to me that Irish Water was another case where a significant amount of assets, &euro;11 billion worth, were transferred from the local authorities to Irish Water.  There is a big capital budget.  Mr. McCarthy told us before that negotiations are ongoing between the Department and his office about the extension of oversight by the Committee of Public Accounts of Irish Water.  When does he think that will come to a conclusion?  There is a gap there in a fairly significant organisation.</p></speech>

This committee formally recommended the establishment of a committee of inspection in one of our work reports.  To my knowledge, that recommendation has never been responded to.  I asked the Taoiseach in questions on promised legislation in the D&aacute;il if he could give an update on that and if it has happened.  He said he was not in a position to tell me but that he would ask the Minister to respond and we have heard nothing since.  I support Deputy Murphy.</p></speech>

Following on from what Deputy Cullinane said, and to be clear, we need one session with Mr. Watt and, in the same session or another one, the head of procurement.  We need the two individuals who are over health spending in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We need the board to come back in and the chairs of the sub-committees, the Secretary General of the Department and the new chair.  We also need the assistant secretary of the Department of Health who did all the work on this.  I hope that is agreed.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

We need a session to deal with those and as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I was going to raise the following issue last week or the week before.  This committee, through the secretariat, has done a whole range of periodic reports.  This is more than a week's work but maybe by St. Patrick's weekend we can go through those reports and send letters to all the relevant Departments to follow up on the recommendations or actions in those reports.  We do not know if they have ever been dealt with.  I went through a number of them recently and I have no clue whether the recommendations or actions have been taken on board or acted upon.  Is it a case of drift with those reports?  We need to do a piece of forensic work in following up on the actions and recommendations of the hundreds of hours that have gone in here to bring those recommendations and actions about.</p></speech>

We have got a detailed response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on each point of every report we have issued so far with however many recommendations contained within across different Departments.  I think we went through the recommendations in public session, point by point, as to whether they were accepted.  We were not happy with the responses of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on several occasions.</p></speech>

The next point is that the periodic report for the committee's work from September to December is due and the secretariat hopes to circulate its work on that electronically tomorrow to the members of committee.  For people watching proceedings, that will not be a report of the Committee of Public Accounts that any committee member has an input on.  Rather, it is the secretariat's summation of the work to date.  That draft working document from the secretariat will be circulated tomorrow and we need to have a special meeting to discuss that which does not interfere with our Thursday meeting.  The only available slot is next Tuesday at 11 a.m.  It will take a second reading after that.  We definitely have to publish that before we break for St. Patrick's week.  We are telling everyone to get their reports in on time.  This report runs to the end of December and we are not going away in March without our report on last year's activity completed.  I ask committee members to pencil that in.  I ask members to try to read the report when they get it.</p></speech>

Members who want an input into that report have to be physically here to give their input.  The secretariat will then go away and draft the report and we will then finalise it.  We will not be circulating any of our draft report until the day we publish.  We will clear it in private session and then publish it as we have done for our most recent reports.</p></speech>

The letter states that local management was contacted and this is the answer, namely, that all vehicles are accounted for.  Part of the potential issue is that with the best will in the world, the Secretary General is the Accounting Officer, while the head of the Prison Service in County Longford is not, perhaps, fully up to speed with what is going on and he is dependent on local management which may not be as candid as it should be in answers to certain questions.</p> <p>  It would be useful for us to get on with a good exchange at the committee.

In the afternoon we will look at housing issues in connection with the appropriation account of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government when we will be joined by representatives of the Irish Council for Social Housing and the approved housing body interim regulatory committee.  First, we will examine the 2015 financial statements of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, as well as the supplementary report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Thorn report on that ETB.  It is very unusual for us to look at accounts that are more than three years old.  We have been in correspondence with the Department of Education and Skills which has stated sets of accounts and the report have been sent to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its attention.  I understand an investigation is ongoing.  It is appropriate, therefore, that we proceed in a manner which will not undermine the investigation in any way.  I ask for the co-operation of members and witnesses in that regard.  The reports in their entirety have been referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  What is being investigated by it is not for discussion here.  I, therefore, ask members not to ask anything about the Garda investigation.  Even if pressed, the witnesses are not to answer questions on matters subject to Garda investigation and should not feel pressurised to do so.  I will intervene to make sure nothing happens here to compromise the investigation or proceedings that may follow from it.  I will not allow the Committee of Public Accounts to compromise such proceedings.  We will have to be quite strict in that regard, but I believe everybody understands the seriousness of the matter.  </p><p>We are joined from the Department of Education and Skills by Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General; Mr. Hubert Loftus, Mr. Gary O Doherty, Ms Martina Mannion, and Mr. Phil O'Flaherty.  From Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board we are joined by Mr. Noel Merrick, chairperson; Dr. Rory O'Toole, director of schools; Mr. Joe Kelly, director of organisation support and development; Ms Caitriona Murphy, director of further education and training; and Dr Deirdre Keyes, chief executive.  </p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off all mobile phones fully.  Merely leaving them in silent mode will not prevent them from interfering with the recording and broadcasting systems.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  That sentence could not be more significant.  They have absolute privilege which is not to be abused.  That is very relevant in the light of the Garda investigation.  Nobody should attempt to abuse the privilege attached to proceedings in the Oireachtas.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Again, I stress the importance of that sentence.  I am not talking about names being mentioned, but I cannot allow lines of questioning that seek to identify a person or an organisation.  We cannot go there.  It is a standing rule, but we must be absolute and strict in applying it today.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy or policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol. </p><p>We will now hear opening statements from the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, and Dr. Keyes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.215" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#L00300"><p>As members will recall, I have outlined to the committee on a number of occasions the broad events that gave rise to the delay in carrying out and completing the audit of the financial statements for Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board for 2015.  In the end, we were only able to complete the work in December last year.  I have prepared a supplementary report on the relevant events, in addition to the normal format audit opinion, as provided for in section 7(4) of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.</p><p>The report deals with serious lapses in controls over procurement of a number of capital projects and certain other expenses in KWETB during 2015.  In that year, the ETB had receipts of over &euro;111 million and expenditure of &euro;109 million.</p><p> Some further context may be helpful to the committee.  Members will recall that the ETBs were established in July 2013, usually involving the amalgamation of two, and in some cases three, of the previous vocational education committees, VECs.  In addition, they took over the operation of training centres from the then F&Aacute;S.  The first period of account for the boards covered 18 months to the end of 2014, but there were delays in agreeing the format of accounts, a matter that was not settled until around October 2015.  In addition, new boards were appointed following the local elections held in May 2014 and there were further delays in some boards in appointing audit, risk and finance committees.  A new code of practice for governance of the ETBs was only issued in March 2015.  The combined result was a sector-wide delay in completion of the first cycle of audited financial statements, with knock-on delays for the 2015 statements.</p><p> We commenced the audit of the 2015 financial statements in January 2017.  In the course of the audit testing, audit team members identified concerns about certain procurements, project cost overruns and propriety matters.  A formal query on these matters was issued to the then chief executive of KWETB in June 2017.  The information and supporting documentation provided by KWETB in response to the audit query were assessed as being inadequate.  This was unsatisfactory, and so those matters of concern were brought directly to the attention first of the then chair and vice chair of the board and the chair of the audit committee of KWETB and, shortly thereafter, to the attention of the Department of Education and Skills.  The audit of the 2015 financial statements was suspended pending the outcome of any action the board or the Department might take.</p><p> In October 2017, the Minister appointed a statutory inspector to investigate the matters raised from the audit and some other matters that the Department had been separately pursuing with KWETB.  Arising from that inspection, a number of issues have been referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister has issued a statutory direction to the board about the implementation of a corporate governance action plan developed on foot of the statutory inspector's report.</p><p> We recommenced the audit process in April 2018 and reissued the audit query.  Fresh responses to the questions we raised were provided by the new chief executive, and these are reflected in the supplementary report and the statement on internal control.</p><p> Given the ongoing Garda investigation, I do not propose to recite the details of the specific instances of concern picked up by the audit.  More generally, the report concludes that the board was unable to challenge the KWETB executive in an effective way during 2015.  Underlying causes for this include incomplete information being provided to the board, delay in the establishment and functioning of statutory sub-committees and a lack of internal audit resources.  An effective process for review of internal controls was not in place.  Steps are being taken by KWETB to address these weaknesses.</p><p> It may also be useful to consider whether there are lessons to be learned generally for the ETB sector as a whole.  For example, while a key function of the boards of ETBs is oversight of their executives, they are heavily dependent on the same executives in the exercise of that function.  It may be worth considering whether, and to what extent, boards should have operational independence of the executives.  The committee will recall in recent months noting that, in issuing their 2017 financial statements, boards across the sector were critical of the level of resources available for internal audit and of the adequacy of the financial management systems they inherited from their predecessor VECs and with which they continue to operate.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#M00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  I will shorten my opening statement as I go.  I am joined by colleagues who have already been introduced.  My opening statement will focus on two areas, those being, the background to the circumstances of this audit report and the Thorn investigation, and the supports and oversight arrangements that the Department has put in place to support the sector in implementing good governance practices.</p> <p>  I advised the committee by way of correspondence in September 2018 that the Department was in receipt of the final report from Dr. Thorn, which was published last September.  I also advised the committee of directions issued to the ETB.</p> <p>  When we received from the Comptroller and Auditor General the 2015 financial statements and this audit report on 15 January, we considered them and arranged for the laying of them before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 13 February.  The Department intends to co-operate fully with the committee on issues contained with the report while also recognising, as the Chair has indicated, the ongoing investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We trust that the committee understands that, while our commitment and willingness to be open and transparent on all matters relating to the issues, including the publication of the Dr. Thorn report in September, are clear, we are also required to give careful consideration to public engagement on the issues.</p> <p>  I wish to be clear - the issues that arise in KWETB are of serious concern to the Department.  The responses that the Department received at the time of our initial engagement with the ETB in 2017 pointed to ineffective governance and accountability, particularly in respect of the use of public resources.  For that reason, the Minister appointed an independent investigator under the Education and Training Boards Act 2013, signalling that this was something that we considered warranted a serious response from the Department and that, when conducted under the legislation that created the ETBs, also permitted the Minister to take necessary action and direct the ETB to take appropriate steps to rectify any issue of concern that may have been found.</p> <p>  The investigator was given terms of reference by the Department to investigate all matters relating to issues of concern.  These broad terms of reference allowed the investigator to review any other matter that came to his attention in the course of the investigation.</p> <p>  Dr. Thorn made a number of findings.  The committee will be aware that his report is included in an appendix to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  In summary, Dr. Thorn found that, regarding the ETB's governance procedures, adequate arrangements to manage procurement and conflicts of interest were in place according to documented procedures.  On an operative basis, however, the implementation of procurement processes and management of projects in several instances was found to be flawed or suboptimal.  He further found that the board of the ETB should have been more proactive in ensuring oversight of its management of projects.</p> <p>  The Department issued his report to the board of the ETB.  The board fully accepted the findings and set out an action plan.  The Minister, acting under his powers by virtue of section 41 of the ETB Act, issued directions with which the board was required to comply.  These directions included a request for the board to review the initial action plan presented to the Department in light of Dr. Thorn's findings and to implement a final action plan, to be agreed with the Department.  The board was also required to review the measures in place in the ETB to prevent conflicts of interest and inappropriate interventions in processes relating to procurement, contract and project management, and to provide mandatory governance training to new and existing board members.  The board was also required to conduct a self-evaluation with appropriately qualified external input and to provide regular updates to the Department.</p> <p>  Having actively engaged with KWETB since the Thorn report, the Department is aware that the board, the new chief executive and the executive staff are adopting a pro-active approach to improving governance arrangements and addressing matters of concern.  The ETB has provided the Department and, I understand, the committee with an update on its corporate governance programme, which incorporates the updated action plan.  This identifies a robust programme covering not just the directions issued by the Minister, but other governance matters considered by the board to support good governance.  The ETB has indicated to the Department its intention to revise this plan further to take account of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the revised code of governance for the ETBs, which was updated and issued in January.</p> <p>  Regarding supports and oversight arrangements for the sector as a whole, the ETB sector has undergone significant reforms in recent years.  The decisions to move from 33 VECs to 16 ETBs, to incorporate new responsibilities for training provision and to establish SOLAS have seen unprecedented change, with consequential structures and support mechanisms needed to support them.  These changes include: a legislative reform programme; a governance reform programme; the placing of internal audit on a statutory basis; and the establishment of Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, as the national representative body for the sector, which plays a critical role in the Department's reform programme for ETBs and the development and implementation of sectoral policies and arrangements for ETBs.</p><p> Another important change is the way in which the ETBs prepare financial statements.  They are now on a calendar-year basis and use a common and agreed template to ensure consistency of reporting and layout in that presentation.  The Department acknowledges that there had been delays in ETBs submitting their financial statements ahead of statutory deadlines, and significant progress has been made in recent years.  In the case of ETBs the statutory deadline for accounts is 1 April.  All ETBs submitted their draft statements for 2017 by that date in 2018.  In respect of 2018, the Department has been engaging closely with the sector to continue to impress upon it the need for continued compliance regarding the submission and the monitoring of progress.  The progress made since the establishment of the ETBs can also be assessed by the average time it took them to submit their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General, which has reduced significantly.</p><p> In more recent times the Department has focused on practical arrangements which support good governance in the sector, including the planned roll-out of shared payroll and financial services, the creation of a dedicated public service reform function in ETBI, putting in place a national procurement policy for the sector and enhancing supports on building and capital projects.</p><p> Regarding payroll and financial services, work is under way to move the ETB payroll and finance systems to a shared services model.  When the VECs were first amalgamated, work was undertaken to merge and stabilise existing payroll and finance systems in the newly established ETBs and to implement some interim projects to support them in the introduction of shared services.  In tandem, business cases were prepared and signed off to support the investment required in implementing new payroll and finance shared services systems in the sector.  The procurement phase for the payroll project was completed in 2018.  Procurement for the ETB finance project is under way.  The roll-out of the payroll project will commence in the second quarter of 2019 and is to be completed over the next two years.  It is envisaged that the roll-out of the finance project will commence in 2020 and conclude the following year.</p><p> A reform function was established in ETBI in September 2010 with procurement as one of its key initiatives.  Furthermore, a legal services unit based in ETBI was established in 2016.  The unit has developed a legal services framework for the ETB sector in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  The unit has resolved approximately 130 queries from ETBs and has developed a log of legal queries which enables the provision of management information.</p><p> The ETB sector continues to have high levels of participation in national contracts and frameworks.  In addition to individual ETBs utilising OGP contracts and frameworks, the sector has developed ETB-specific frameworks.</p><p> As for governance and compliance, a national procurement policy for ETBs was put in place in 2018.  In addition, this year will see the roll-out of a new corporate procurement plan template for ETBs and the development of a sectoral multi-annual procurement plan, which will help identify goods and services that require public procurement due to aggregation thresholds.  Upskilling of staff across the ETB sector is also being supported.</p><p> Another key area is better governance in capital and building projects.  Better lead-in periods are important in the context of ensuring projects are delivered in a manner that is fully compliant with Department requirements.  The summer works scheme is one example of this, and better lead-in times are now being provided.</p><p> The Department has established supports for the sector.  The Department's technical guidance documents and design team procedures provide ETBs with clear guidance on how school building projects should be designed and delivered, including in respect of procurement; the Department's planning and building unit provides designated contact points to provide support, guidance and advice to ETBs; and the Department is facilitating ETBs with access to project managers.</p><p> Regarding control procedures, prior to a major project being devolved to an ETB, a service level agreement is put in place between the Department and the ETB.  This agreement sets out in detail the governance arrangements for the project.  As part of these arrangements, at least two separate meetings must take place between the Department, the ETB and their design teams.  Through these meetings, and at other key decision points, both administrative and technical staff within the Department review the progress of the project.  Under the service level agreement, SLA, the ETB is required to submit monthly project progress reports to the Department which must bring to the Department's attention any issues that have arisen with the project.  The Department also sets limits for the ETB and its design team in respect of change orders.  The final account for the project must also be sent to the Department to ensure that the final cost is in line with the tender outcome.</p><p> As for smaller-scale projects, new enhanced project control procedures were introduced in May 2016.  These procedures require two additional interactions with the Department during project delivery.  The first is a requirement to seek approval to lodge planning permission, and the second is a requirement to seek approval to place a contract for construction.  These additional interactions with the ETBs provide additional oversight and assurance that individual projects are delivered in accordance with the project brief.  Further strengthening of these procedures took place from January 2018 with the submission of tender reports for smaller-scale projects together with itemised pricing documents.</p><p> The Department carries out an annual programme of compliance checks among schools and ETBs of around 120 devolved projects.  This involves visits to schools and ETBs and the checking of supporting documentation.  While these checks can identify issues with individual projects, the overall feedback on compliance is positive.  The outcome from this is made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p> Change is ongoing and will take a number of years to embed; the new ETBs continue to develop as single entities, adapting organisational structures and practices accordingly and developing their response to their new responsibility for training.  There is a demanding reform programme that is bringing measurable benefits to the sector and at the end of which we expect to have robust structures that will enable ETBs and SOLAS to benefit from the economies of scale generated by the reform programme and to deliver top-class education and training services to the public.</p><p> We also have a robust governance regime, which helps to support ETBs to embed good governance practice in the sector.  However, we are conscious that, notwithstanding having codes, policies and tools to support good governance, both the Thorn and  Comptroller and Auditor General reports provide broader lessons for the sector and the Department, particularly in areas of procurement and governance.  We remain open and willing to learn from these issues and to adapt and enhance our existing reform and governance measures.</p><p> I am happy to answer any questions from the committee on matters arising.</p></speech>

Some of the issues to which we referred have been dealt with in the opening statement, so it is good to get the feedback on the broader issue.</p> <p>  At this stage I call Dr. Keyes to make her opening statement.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-21a.221" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Deirdre Keyes" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022100002#N00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee.  Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board was established in 2013 under the provisions of the Education and Training Boards Act.  Its primary function under this Act is the better co-ordination and delivery of education and training in counties Kildare and Wicklow.  Equally, of no less importance is the regulation of that co-ordination and delivery in line with the statutory requirements of Government, in particular the Department of Education and Skills, SOLAS and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The ETB Act of 2013, the code of practice for the governance of ETBs, formerly of 2015 but replaced by the current circular of January 2019, Department circulars and ministerial directions that apply from time to time provide the regulatory framework under which we are obliged to operate.</p> <p>  Regarding the co-ordination and delivery of our education and training services, KWETB in 2015 was in receipt of circa &euro;111 million.  In 2016 and 2017 the allocation to KWETB grew to &euro;115 million and &euro;130 million, respectively.  In 2018 the total budget was &euro;135 million.  Almost 70% is allocated to salaries, with KWETB employing 2,572 staff, the majority of whom are teachers, tutors and support persons to our services and schools.  Our learners are the centre of our work.  We currently have 12,453 primary and post-primary students and circa 10,000 learners in further education and training.  KWETB has been a leading and innovative provider of education and training and is integral to the fabric of the communities in Kildare and Wicklow, both rural and urban, through the presence of our 25 schools - primary and post-primary - and one institute of further education.  Our further education and training is delivered in 25 centres and through various contracted training programmes, including apprenticeships.  We are responsible for the provision of youth services and social inclusion projects in both counties, in addition to supporting many other initiatives and services - for example, music generation, school completion and outdoor education.</p><p>We also provide a range of services to our schools and centres in the areas of human resources, corporate services and finance.  We manage 70 buildings and premises both for ourselves and other patrons.  Our capital programme in 2015 was is in excess of &euro;14.2 million and in 2018 this has increased to &euro;15.7 million.  </p><p> What we do is important and it is incumbent on us to take the responsibilities we have been given very seriously to ensure quality of delivery, support and progression for all our learners and importantly, value for money through propriety in our financial matters.  It is therefore of regret that the Comptroller and Auditor General and Thorn reports which are before the committee today point to serious lapses and gaps in terms of our required regulatory, financial and propriety responsibilities.  While the reports note there were arrangements and documented procedures to manage procurement and conflicts of interest in place, their findings highlight serious concerns and shortcomings on an operative basis in the implementation of procurement and other processes during the period of the investigation.  We accept these findings. </p><p> I am here today as the Accounting Officer of KWETB to give account to the committee of its general administration, in particular to respond to the Comptroller and Auditor General 2015 audited accounts and supplementary report, and indeed any other matters the committee may wish to raise. </p><p> While it is my intention to fully engage with the committee, there are a number of matters that have been referred to the National Economic Crime Bureau.  A criminal investigation of these matters is currently under way and as such, there might be topics that I and the other representatives from KWETB are not in a position to discuss.  I can confirm that we are co-operating in full with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that this investigation can reach its conclusion in as efficient and timely a manner as possible. Considerable resources and time have had to be diverted to this investigation.  Despite this, our core work has continued and I am indebted to our teachers, tutors, leaders and support staff who are committed to the service of teaching and learning in our ETB. </p><p> While acknowledging and accepting the seriousness of the findings of both reports, I hope that I can provide assurances to the committee that KWETB has set out to build a robust culture of corporate governance, building on the policies and controls that had previously been in place but strengthening them in areas of oversight and internal control in, but not limited to, the key areas as identified in both reports.  Our current corporate governance programme reflects the requirements of ETBs with regard to our internal practices and reporting to our board, our external oversight and reporting requirements to Government, committees of the Oireachtas, respective Departments, and the Minister, as well as other agencies and funders.  Particular attention has been paid to procurement processes and oversight, document retention and control, risk management, management of conflicts of interest, and other matters of propriety.  This programme now needs to be advanced in line with the additional requirements as set out in the new code of corporate governance for ETBs as issued in January 2019 by the Department of Education and Skills. </p><p> We are also working closely with the other statutory reporting and auditing authorities of the state as relevant to ETBs.  The office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is currently conducting the 2016 audit.  The ETB internal audit unit, IAU, has concluded its ICT and youthreach audit work.  The ICT opinion report has been sent to the Department and we are currently working on the management response to the youthreach audit.  The IAU have commenced a full internal audit of KWETB's procurement processes, procedures and internal controls.  This audit is both timely and welcome.  In line with any findings and recommendations of the IAU audit work and related reports we are committed to adapting our corporate governance programme, internal controls and risk registers.</p><p> The corrective and immediate actions that have taken place in the light of both the Thorn and Comptroller and Auditor General reports are of particular importance.  While the final Thorn report, "Investigation into Certain Matters in Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board", was not issued for the attention of the board and executive of KWETB until 12 September, it was noted by Dr. Thorn that the response of KWETB had been both comprehensive and constructive in the manner in which the executive and board committed to dealing with its recommendations and findings.  On the issuing of the report, the Minister, in accordance with section 41(3) of The Education and Training Board Act 2013, gave a number of directions to the board on the performance of its functions.  The board accepted the directions in full.  In addition to these directions, the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills also directed the chief executive, that is, myself, on a number of matters. Those matters related to a range of actions to which KWETB had committed as part of the recommendations made by Dr. Thorn, the expectations of the Department in terms of the delivery of these actions and the reporting and oversight arrangements that were to be put in place. </p><p> During the period from September to November 2018, the executive worked on its action plan for presentation and agreement of the board at its December meeting.  A final corporate governance programme was presented and approved by the board on 13 December 2018.  A full report was issued to the Department in January 2019.  An updated report has been prepared for the Committee of Public Accounts by way of a briefing paper.  A steering group comprising the chairperson, vice chairperson and members of the executive has been constituted to have oversight of this programme and to report to the board on its progress. </p><p> During what has been a very difficult period for KWETB, it is important to assure the committee that both the board and executive have worked hard to ensure that we continue to deliver on our legislative responsibilities.  We achieve this by delivering a quality service for all our learners; this at all times remains at the core of what we do.  All of our actions under our corporate governance programme are to ensure the best quality of experience for our learners, proper learning environments, physical spaces, adequate resources, both financial and human and ultimately value for money for the Exchequer.  We are fully committed to this and are fully mindful of the governance responsibilities that go with that. </p><p> As chief executive of KWETB, I wish to formally confirm my commitment to the highest standards of propriety and good practice to the learners, staff, communities of Kildare and Wicklow, Minister for Education and Skills and the members of the Committee of Public Accounts. </p></speech>

I have some brief questions for the Comptroller and Auditor general to begin.  First, he issued a supplementary report.  Is that very unusual?  Second, on the ETB structure, are they registered for PAYE?  For what taxes are they registered?  Do they have charitable status?  The third question relates to properties that may have been on the register for ETBs.  What work, if any, is undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General to ascertain value for money in relation to rental income to the ETBs and whether it stacks up with normal valuation standards for the annual rent roll in terms of what the property cost, and so on?</p></speech>

From memory, there have only been three or four in more than 20 years.</p><p>A point worth drawing to the attention of the committee is that there was a previous supplementary report in relation to Kildare Vocational Education Committee, again picking up on points in relation to difficulties with substantiating the procurement, the development of a school and the sale of property.

We pay the VAT over and then we pay the contractor tax at the relevant rate.  When the contract is first signed, we register it on the Revenue Online Service site.  When the payment is made, that is registered on the site as well.  Then we pay over the tax at the end of each month, or bimonthly in some cases.</p></speech>

We have analysed those subsistence claims for 2016 and 2017.  I assure the committee of that.  We are pursuing those subsistence claims which were outside the subsistence bands as prescribed.  We have prescribed travel and subsistence rates from the Department of Education and Skills in line with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regulations for all public servants.  Our travel and subsistence log is presented to the line manager.  There are internal controls over that and internal checks are made by finance.  They are only paid after that process has taken place.</p></speech>

If the moneys cannot be recouped, there may be a liability on the part of the organisation.  As I recall it, the difficulty here was that there was no counter-checking and no authorisation was done of the travel and subsistence of the chief executive.  In many organisations, there is a process where the chief executive discusses his or her expenses with the chairman of the board, but that was not happening in this case.</p></speech>

There must be checks along the way and I do not understand how something like this could happen in 2015.</p></speech>

At page 23 of the financial statements at A, B and C, there is a list of the various buildings that are occupied.  The rents on some of them seems very high.  The further education centre in Arklow costs &euro;250,000 in annual rent which seems like a huge sum.  Can I have a bit of background to a sum of that magnitude?

This is a very important question in relation to leases.  Our finance committee is currently reviewing all our leases and the expenditure on them and hopes to present a report to our full board at its next meeting.  It is a very significant area of expenditure and is primarily in the area of adult and further education and training where, unlike schools, we do not have permanent buildings and are in rented property situations.  That is being reviewed by the board and it is a significant cost in rent terms.</p></speech>

I explained the audit of the 2015 financial statements in my opening statement.  There were difficulties with the first sets of financial statements for the ETBs in settling the format of the financial statements for them, and there were a number of other issues.  That caused a knock-on delay so we were starting the audit of this at the beginning of 2017.  The difficulties that were uncovered in the course of the audit obviously delayed the completion of the 2015 financial statements and that has had a knock-on effect for 2016, 2017 and 2018.  We are currently doing the audit of the financial statements for 2016.  I expect we will do 2017 as well this year.  We will have to do 2018 and 2019 next year.  It is very unsatisfactory but the circumstances were quite unusual.</p></speech>

There was complete dysfunction in governance and oversight control.  Everybody was asleep at the wheel.  We cannot talk about what happened as we have been warned it is not allowed, but there are issues and concerns.  Where was everybody when this was happening?  It seems to have been controlled by individuals and executives.  Where was the Department of Education and Skills, the Secretary General, the governing board and the audit committee while all this was happening?  Somebody has to answer questions.  There was the Thorn report and the witnesses are telling us today that everything is hunky-dory, they have learned their lessons and nothing will ever happen again from now on.  How can we assure the public that this is not happening elsewhere?  There are many ETBs around the country.  Can the Secretary General comment on that?  The witnesses used lovely words, referring to robust governance, regime codes, policies and tools to support good governance, but where were those words in the last few years?</p></speech>

That is what they have indicated they have put in place.  We are obviously very concerned about the findings of the reports.  We were concerned when the Comptroller and Auditor General approached us about issues arising in Kildare and Wicklow ETB.  We also had a number of other issues ourselves.  When we put those together we had a concern.  We asked the ETB for responses and we were not satisfied with them.  That is the reason we advised the Minister and the Minister decided to put the statutory review in place.  Obviously the Comptroller and Auditor General paused his audit until that was complete and then took account of it.  Clearly, there are matters of concern, as Dr. Thorn indicated, about the effective operation------</p></speech>

We have sought to update governance arrangements to ensure it does not happen again.  We have put a number of elements in the code of practice, in particular the code of governance, to deal with issues that have come up in this regard and we will continue to do so.  We did that before the Comptroller and Auditor General's review was complete.  We will listen to the views of this committee and we might seek to update the code of governance further.  We have amended procedures on minor, small devolved projects and on big devolved building projects as a result of, among other things, the lessons we have learned in this regard.  We have not seen anything that would cause concerns that there might be similar activities elsewhere in the ETB sector but that does not mean we can take absolute assurance from that.  We are seeking to develop the role of the independent internal audit service for the ETBs further and we have a number of arrangements in the code of governance to examine issues.  We will be considering different types of thematic reviews within the sector to see if we have learned from the lessons.</p> <p>  The biggest lessons for me are: how can we ensure that members of ETBs have an oversight, and how can we ensure that the culture within an ETB, both members and staff, allows for people to look at other people's behaviour and where there are difficulties in that behaviour there are arrangements in place for a culture of challenge?  That is an overall governance challenge, and that is what we must examine.  The training we are putting in place on the code of governance will hopefully assist in that regard.  Obviously, however, the findings are very strong in both the Thorn report and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p></speech>

In the buildings area we carry out compliance checks.  We have an annual programme of compliance checks of 120 devolved projects across schools and ETBs.

The Department was already aware of the issues and was following up with the education and training board on the matter prior to the issue coming to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General as part of the audit.  We explained our position on the matter.</p> <p>  Reference was made to temporary accommodation for Naas community national school.  This was a school in prefabs.  It had demographic needs.  Two additional prefabs were approved to cater for those needs.  Separately, the original, older prefabs in the school incurred some damage in storms.  Emergency approval was granted to make repairs but there were concerns among the parental group about the suitability of the full school to be in operation at that location.  A decision was made at the time to temporarily locate the school at a vacant permanent building that the Department had built in Craddockstown.  We had earmarked that as an advance building for Naas community college.  That was a temporary move.  The prefabs were provided in the original location for Naas community national school but because of parental concerns the school did not go back to the original prefabs.  Those prefabs were then vacant and the education and training board had a demographic need for two prefabs in Maynooth.  They were relocated there.</p> <p>  The overall context when looking at this issue is the scale and extent of demographic growth in the Kildare area at the time.  During the past decade primary enrolments in Kildare have grown by approximately 20% while post-primary enrolments have grown by close enough to 35% or 40%.  There were extraordinary demographic pressures and it was not easy to manage and cater for these at the time.  That is the context.</p> <p>  The question of most pertinence in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General was the procurement process for the removal of the prefabs from Naas to Maynooth.</p></speech>

Obviously, we are working closely with the board.  Clearly, a matter as big as this has an impact on KWETB as a whole and on the head office in particular.  The board has to manage through all these issues and deal with the Thorn report and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General as well as supplying information for the Garda investigation.  That has an impact on the capacity of the organisation.  We have supported the organisation by allowing for additional staff at head office to engage with that.  That is a challenging issue for any organisation to work its way through.</p> <p>  From our point of view it is a question of devolving projects to the education and training board or advancing with the currently devolved projects that have proceeded.</p></speech>

There are particular decisions that can only be made by the board and that have to be referred to the board.  Moreover, the code of governance and oversight arrangements of the board and the respective committees of the board are set out.  The audit and finance committees are of particular importance but all the other committees are relevant too, including boards of management of schools and youth committees, etc.  These are the structures in place to allow the board to have oversight.  Perhaps I might talk to the chairperson about it.</p></speech>

A given number of meetings is required.  Again, that is set out in the Education and Training Boards Act.  The required number of meetings is set out for the finance committee and the audit committee.  Each of the committees has terms of reference.  The finance committee reports to the board.  The audit committee reports to the board.  That reporting arrangement is set out.</p><p>I know that in our case the finance committee reports more regularly to our board.

I know that since I came in, the board has met its statutory requirements by way of meeting, in addition to which it has had a number of special meetings.

Part of information gathering is that the information should be tested.  There should be a very strict internal control and then that goes to the audit committee to be checked and the audit committee reports to the main board.  The finance committee has done its work on the finances.  I do not think the Comptroller and Auditor General has found any want in the actual finances, as distinct from the procurement procedures and all of these matters.  As well as that, there is an internal audit unit, IAU.  My best information is that the audit committee did ask the internal audit unit to test the procurement procedures back as far as 2016 or 2017, but the IAU had other needs at that stage and that did not happen.  It is happening now.</p></speech>

When I see that sentence or hear about reassurance it does not help me in any way because what really jumps out from all of the reports was the confirmation in the Secretary General's opening statement that Dr. Thorn found that governance procedures were adequate and that adequate arrangements were in place.  That is deeply troubling.  Much of the opening statements from the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board and the Department are about the recent changes.  While these are very welcome, they were in place and this happened.  I have never seen this in the almost two and a half years I have been a member of the committee.  Page 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's supplementary report sets out key audit concerns.  I will not read them out but I counted 11.  It refers to incomplete documentation, documentation being held off site, inadequate information being provided to the audit team when it asked questions, including when it returned with further questions.  Before I ask my questions, the Comptroller and Auditor General said this is one of four special reports in the past 20 years.</p></speech>

That is what we are here for so this is a very practical application of it.  If Mr. Merrick does not have the information, I ask him to revert to me before the end of the meeting with the details of how many times the board has met in hotels, the reasons therefor and what notice was given to members.  Are the minutes being published online and how many sets of minutes have been published online?</p></speech>

We are here as a result of a special report which followed a previous special report, as well as Dr. Thorn's report and a current Garda investigation.  The scope of our questions has been limited and I am just asking practical questions on governance.  I am a great admirer of what I still call the vocational education committees.  I served ten years on one of them and they do wonderful work.  The whole principle and ethos behind them is wonderful.  I place them right up there with the universities.  They do tremendous work and I know many people, including in my family, who have benefitted from the VEC system.  Today is about governance, how something so shocking could happen and how it will be prevented in the future.  How many times have meetings been held in hotels?</p></speech>

I have looked at all of this and the lovely language but it does not take away from the fact that that language was in place at the time and all of this still happened.  One thing that jumps out is that the board was passive.  I am not sure if I agree with that but that is what Dr. Thorn said.  How does Mr. Merrick feel about that as chair of the board?  He was a member of the board at the time.  Can he help us with that conclusion and finding from Dr. Thorn?</p></speech>

It is very difficult for ordinary members on a board.  They are there voluntarily.  There is no backup or training.  I agree with all of that.  That is a failure on the part of the system and the Department of Education and Skills in not ensuring that.  I appreciate that the amalgamation went through too quickly, without any backup.  I know the shared services, which I probably will not have time to get to, are probably not up to scratch yet.  It has been brought to our attention that in Athenry, in Galway, it is extremely difficult and the staff are working under significant pressure.  I want to get back to the board because I cannot get away from the fact that everything was in place to stop this from happening and it did not stop it.  That is the kernel of it for me.</p> <p>  The board got legal advice.  Was it clear to Mr. Merrick as an ordinary member, and is it clear to him now, how legal advice works?  Who gets that?  I understand the chairperson got the legal advice.  Was that brought to the board's attention?  Did the board sanction that?  What would happen now if the board needed legal advice?</p></speech>

That brings me to Mr. Merrick who sat on the finance committee for a time.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General contacted the chair of board.  Mr. Merrick said he first became aware of this in July or August 2017 and all of this was a surprise.  How was it a surprise?  It strikes me that the external State auditor identified the weaknesses and not the internal controls within Kildare-Wicklow ETB.  The audit committee was surprised, the finance committee and the board were surprised and knew nothing, and yet the Comptroller and Auditor General's office identified these weaknesses.  How did that happen?</p></speech>

The Kildare-Wicklow ETB incurred significant expenditure with certain hotels without a competitive procurement process and subsistence claims by the then chief executive did not comply with regulations.

I would say that this is a complex process.  In any situation where there is discussion of taking an action against an official it has to be done with legal advice.  It is a very tricky situation.</p> <p>  Audit committees and internal audit capacity in an organisation are absolutely vital to the effective control of the organisation.  It is something that many of the boards have now, if one likes, come to see that for 2017 they were insufficiently supported in terms of internal audit and capacity.</p></speech>

To be fair to the board, a board can only work, as far as I can see, on information that it is given.  If information is withheld from or not given to a board or any of its subcommittees, the board does not work.  Was it the case that the board was not able to do its job sufficiently because it was not given sufficient information on many of the issues that the Comptroller and Auditor General dealt with in his report?</p></speech>

Obviously, there is an expectation that boards can ask questions.  Boards have an obligation to identify what information they need and to specifically seek information.  The fact that there had been difficulties throughout the years in respect of internal audit and, if one likes, the functioning of audit committees is systemically important and something that we must increasingly have an eye to.</p></speech>

Because we saw the settlement and the arbitration agreement resulting in additional expenditure, we wanted an explanation for the additional expenditure on that specific project.  It is worth making the point that, according to the board minutes, there was discussion of the speeding up but there is no evidence that anyone considered that this could result in additional cost.  That is an example of where, if information was not forthcoming that speeding it up will result in an additional cost, it would be perfectly reasonable for a board member to ask the board before agreeing to it whether the speeding up would have a cost implication.  There are learning points on both sides.</p></speech>

My final question is to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and relates to the Act, which underpins the work of the ETBs.  I imagine he would agree with the observations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General and me in this matter.  There were two supplementary reports, one of which related to the VECs, although there was some crossover with the issues that emerged at the Kildare and Wicklow ETB in 2015.  Dr. Thorn, who was appointed by the Department, published a report that made findings that were of considerable concern to the Department and the Committee of Public Accounts.  There was also the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report and a criminal investigation, which we obviously cannot discuss.  Through all of that process, how did an individual get redeployed and why were the powers of suspension and removal never acted on?  Notwithstanding the criminal investigation that is ongoing, is that a reasonable question to ask given that the Act was designed to ensure that power was available?</p></speech>

It was a matter for the VEC at the time to consider any disciplinary process for the CEO.  I am not aware that a disciplinary process was considered and the Department certainly did not raise a disciplinary process with the VEC at the time.</p> <p>  There are some parallels between the issues but it is not an exact continuation.  It is important to note that there was follow-up after 2012.  There was an internal audit review of procurement in the VEC that was subsequently given to the ETB when it was established.  That was one of the reasons the ETB's internal audit service decided not to have a further procurement audit.  It had effectively just done a procurement audit.  There were management findings which would be considered by the audit committee in terms of their effective implementation.  The Department did not conclude a view on this matter until the Thorn report was completed.  That report was completed and published after the former CEO had retired.  There was no necessity for the ETB or the Department to consider, nor would it have been possible, to consider.  I do not think there was enough of an outcome.  I think it was only after the Thorn report and the follow-on Comptroller and Auditor General report that the issue could possibly have been considered, whatever that consideration might have been but that is a matter for the ETB. </p></speech>

I have not met the new CEO.  We have been in correspondence but we have not formally met.  I wish him well.  I realise he is accounting for things that happened before his time.  I acknowledge the huge demographic pressures in both Kildare and Wicklow.  A very sizeable staff is employed by the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, and the education value of what it does is not in question.  In fact some exemplary work is being done and I acknowledge that.</p> <p>  The witnesses are essentially answering for the previous board and previous chairpersons.  Would Mr. Merrick accept that when any inkling of these issues came to light, there was a circling of the wagons with respect to how they were handled?

We were very shocked by it.  It all happened very quickly.  By October 2017 Dr. Thorn had been formally appointed to his position, so an investigation was ongoing very quickly.

Being very open to criticism of the organisation itself is part of that.  It certainly seemed that there were efforts by some members of the board to raise issues.

There was &euro;1.9 million of expenditure on ICT equipment.  Somebody who had previously worked on the VEC on a short-term basis got that contract.  A second issue I want to pick up comes under the report's statement of the views of the Department of Education and Skills.  The report stated that the Department would continue to insist on adherence to proper procurement practices in VECs.  It went on to remind the VECs of this.</p> <p>  There was a code of governance and an understanding that proper procurement practices would have to be in place.  Special attention was to be given to Kildare VEC.  Some of the same points and some of the same language appeared in the 2012 report as appears in the report that has just recently been issued.  How does Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; account for that?  Where is this code of governance?  It is only as good as its implementation.</p></speech>

That went into detail on the initial establishment of the ETB and the procurement arrangements in place.  There was a management response.  We encouraged the internal audit unit to undertake that follow-up review.  It was very important.  There was a management response to that.  I assume that was considered by the internal audit committee of the ETB.  That is where the most disappointment has arisen.  We have also undertaken a follow-up audit of devolved programmes, which we also talked about.  We put a code of governance in place, which was not in place in 2010, and we have updated the code of governance in 2019.</p></speech>

Practice has developed significantly in the sector as a whole as a result of the various elements we have put in place, including working under procurement with Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, and so on.  However, there are clearly severe shortcomings in this particular ETB, which have given rise to the Thorn report and that of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

I will answer it in steps, if that is all right.  The Department is supported by an internal audit service that has had challenges.  It has engaged staff, but staff have moved on to other careers in the buoyant labour market for accountants.  It is engaging external supports at the moment and seeking to recruit further.  It is supported by the role of ETBI in procurement and training.  Should that be an absolute assurance?  I do not think so.  As the Accounting Officer I am equally concerned.</p><p>I have to work further to ensure that the governance is in place and is tested appropriately and we are still looking at ways of doing that.  I have talked through, in the background statement and the opening statement, a range of additional changes we put in place.  The question is, when we do all of those, are they still going to add to it.</p><p> The internal audit service is, again, following up on procurement in the ETB.  Would I have absolute confidence?</p></speech>

The ETBI is the body recognised in the legislation which has a role in supporting the sector.  They are really a critical piece of infrastructure in the sector to support the 16 ETBs.</p> <p>  There are two other points the Deputy had raised that I might just assist on.  The first relates to the roll-out of the training.  There is training available on the new code through ETBI which will be in existence for the existing boards in the knowledge that the boards will be refreshed following the local elections later on this year and there will be further, more robust, training rolled out in the autumn in relation to board chairs, audit committees, executives.  This is part of the lessons learned and the additional supports that we are making available.</p> <p>  The other issue which might assist the Deputy is on the internal audit unit.  The Secretary General has already explained regarding the resourcing issue but, separately, since 2015, of 75 audit opinions from the internal audit unit, only nine indicated inadequacies in controls, and of those, many related to the ICT issues.</p></speech>

I would have thought that was almost top of the agenda.  In 2010, the accounts led to a special report on what I accept is a different organisation, but a constituent part of this.  There is now a special report on the 2015 accounts.  We are talking about 2015 accounts in 2019 and we do not know what has happened and how the organisation has functioned in the interim.  The last thing this ETB can sustain is yet another shortcoming in the accounts and the running of the board.  In terms of risk, I would have thought that would be something both the Department and the ETB would have as top of the agenda.  Is it something that appears on the agenda every month?  Is it something for a special meeting?  How is it handled?</p></speech>

What I can help the Deputy with is that one of the 21 projects that we have as part of the KWETB corporate governance programme is the new code of governance, and that is very much part and parcel of that governance programme that we are trying to drive within the organisation itself.</p></speech>

We have prioritised the area of procurement in terms of our responses to the Thorn report and also as part of, as the director of schools has referred to, our corporate governance programme.<br/><br/>On our procurement process, we have adopted, since 2018, the ETB sectoral policy on procurement which is very, very robust.  Within that there are internal controls about a number of things that relate to procurement.  There would be procurement authority, financial authority, etc., and then the conflict of interest management is integral to the internal control around the procurement process and other processes.<br/><br/>We have our conflict of interest management procedure and I suppose that is in line with the ethics of public office where people declare.  We are very mindful of the fact that, in the context of the history and in the context of creating a culture of corporate governance, we must have a system for emerging conflicts of interest.  Therefore, that is inserted at various stages of the procurement process, and also the opportunity to disclose.  Staff are mindful of that.</p></speech>

We have 21 particular areas and a roadmap.  There are timeframes and deliverables.  We provide that report to the board on a regular basis, as one will see in the submission I gave to the committee.  While the code of governance is operational, it is equally important that it is embedded in the organisation, that there is an understanding of what is good practice and that there is a support programme for all staff at all levels, not just in head office but in schools and centres, etc.  There are still objectives to be met within our code of governance programme but we have commenced considerable work and achieved a lot underneath it to date, particularly in the nine or ten areas of concern that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report highlighted.  We have prioritised those actions.  We are monitoring it.  The project very much focuses on deliverables.  Mr. Kelly might confirm if that is correct.</p></speech>

We are determined not to just tick boxes and do things for the sake of it.  We are focused on the things that have real impact.  We have started by trying to identify what exactly we are trying to achieve and we work backwards from that on the plan itself.  There are a number of important items that are relevant to project governance to try to ensure that we deliver on the plan and that it is not just something nice that we put forward in front of people.  The first thing is that we have a steering group that is made up of executives, the chair and the vice chair of the board.  They will provide leadership, direction and project management governance for us.  We are working closely in collaboration with the Department to develop the programme in the first place and we will have quarterly review meetings with it in respect of progress.  We will also appear before the audit and risk committee for regular reviews of where we are and seek some input and value-add on areas on which the committee believes we might need to focus.  The board itself will be given regular updates and will have been very much involved in the creation and development of the programme.  We also use best project management methodology, which includes an internal project manager within our team, we have a sponsor from the executive team, we have weekly project meetings and we have a process that is important to manage the core and secondary project deliverables.  We also have a sign-off process to ensure we do what we said we would.</p></speech>

If an issue that emerges in an ETB does not emerge across the board, there does not seem to be a mechanism for that to be identified.  We need to examine these three issues nationally but there might be specific issues in an ETB that are not captured by the national audit.  If the group does an internal audit in an ETB, there could be a significant problem but it might not be subject to the audit.  When the audit committee makes a suggestion at local level, that is based on the flow of information.  The committee is discussing the matter, however, because there was not a flow of information into the audit committee.  I do not know how the Department can know if the audit committee does not receive the information about what it should be auditing.</p></speech>

The issues included the adequacy of the internal audit service, in respect of, for example, ICT and procurement.  Those are examples where the centralised internal audit unit has the capacity, because the issues were common across the ETBs, to bring that sectoral learning to ensure that what is learned in one ETB is carried across for other ETBs.  The terms of reference of the internal audit unit allow it to do specific audits of ETBs where specific issues have arisen.  To date, one of the potential challenges has been capacity, as we have spoken about.  At the moment, however, the audit committee with the five additional external auditors has nine members of staff between audit and support staff.  Even when its recruitment process has finished, it will have nine.  The challenges with capacity that were faced in the previous years will, hopefully, see an improvement following the recruitment process of the additional auditors.  Notwithstanding parts of the issues and the reason that it had to seek external support was the challenging environment of securing auditors, the internal audit unit has identified the recruitment difficulties, including the length of time it has had to advertise without getting responses.  The Department has given over &euro;300,000 to the internal audit unit in support.</p></speech>

The problem, however, is the issue that may emerge in an individual ETB due to something going wrong.  If the audit committee does not receive the flow of information from an ETB, how does it know something is going on?  If it spots something for which it would like internal support, I am sure it would take two years before somebody has the opportunity to address it.  If the internal audit committee believes there is an issue with an aspect of what is happening in an ETB, is there a facility for it to inform the chief executive or the board and commission its own external audit at whatever cost on an area of activity within the organisation?  If not, the Department has taken the ETBs' ability to respond to local programmes entirely out of their hands.  Does that facility exist and has such a situation ever happened in an ETB?</p></speech>

A particular company was employed to provide ongoing legal advice at the time.  The Dr. Thorn investigation then commenced.  That piece of legal advice ended at that stage and the firm was stood down.  The ETB was then entitled to seek another set of legal advice because an investigation had been started and under its insurance policy, the board was entitled to draw down the advice of a different company.  It took a while before all of the advice was available.  We asked for it early on and it was subsequently released in six or seven big folders.</p></speech>

With regard to the legal advice the former chairman obtained, I am going to say it was in a personal capacity, even though in his opinion he was seeking it on behalf of the board but without its approval.  When I say "in a personal capacity," I am not suggesting he went off and just obtained legal advice for himself.</p></speech>

The initial advice had been that the board be informed and that the best way forward was to set up a sub-committee of the board to investigate on behalf of the board.</p></speech>

Dr. Keyes has no knowledge of it.  Does anybody in the room have knowledge of any conflict of interest between the company that holds the lease for the &euro;7 million and anybody else involved with this?  No.</p> <p>  Following on from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's questions on the legal standing of the lease if the procedure was breached, if a contract was signed for this amount of money without board approval, what would the result be?  This is a very difficult situation to be in.  Taxpayer moneys have been committed without due process, as far as I can see.  We have heard Ms Mannion refer to lessons learned, which is a new term that must have arisen from a think tank or focus group somewhere.  I have looked at a lot of retrospective governance at this committee recently.  Mr. Kelly mentioned that he was very focused on ensuring that this did not become a box-ticking exercise.  Is it his opinion that most of our corporate governance structures until now have been box-ticking exercises?  For all the governance structures, rules and boards in place, at the end of the day we have a problem in front of us.  I take from Mr. Kelly's commentary that it would be his opinion that up to now most things have been box-ticking exercises and that he is trying to change things.</p></speech>

We are working very hard to try to fix those weaknesses and enhance some of the processes, procedures and practices we have had in the past.

The reason for governance structures is so that there can be accountability, but if the structures are in place and nobody is adhering to them, then to my mind they are box-ticking exercises.</p></speech>

There can be many practices, procedures and policies, but it has to be ensured that they are embedded within the organisation and become part and parcel of how we do business.  It is fair to say, from what we have heard today and previously, some of those areas have not been as strong as we would like them to be.  The cultural piece is very important to us, and it is at the top of our list in terms of our governance programme.</p></speech>

I was referring to confidence in the Department in relation to the 2010 accounts and the 2012 special report.  The Thorn report after that repeated some of the failures and shortcomings from the 2010 report.  I was asking about confidence in the Department's role regarding this.  It is not a disinterested party.  There is a lot of money channelled through the Department.  It issues codes of governance.  It issues circulars to say how things should be done.  It would be a great difficulty for me to say that I have confidence in the Department in the context of that sequence of events.  It should not have repeated itself.  The meeting has heard some additional information.  We have not had sight of the 2016, 2017 or 2018 accounts.  We are still in trouble on this as a consequence of that.</p></speech>

Can Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; say that he can express confidence in his role as Accounting Officer?  Is he confident that he did everything that he could possibly have done to avoid this?  Is he confident that the special observation that was happening did occur and, if so, and it was the case that a special eye was being kept on an area where there had been failings in the past, how did the events which transpired occur?</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that there was not a fully functioning expanded internal audit unit for the sector.  It is unfortunate that the governance of the ETB did not manage the work of the ETB, notwithstanding the likes of the internal audit follow-up report on the 2012 audit be completed.  We have a series of detailed follow ups with the ETB on major projects and minor projects.  We followed up on the major projects and we spotted a number of the things that arose here before they were brought to the attention of Comptroller and Auditor General and brought them to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

The meeting will resume on the housing issue at 3.30 p.m. rather than 2.30 p.m. </p> <p>  I have one question.  There were various issues including the Comptroller and Auditor General being unable to complete the 2015 audit.  We had the Thorn report.  I have a simple question that this committee asks.  Has anyone quantified the loss or potential loss to the taxpayer as a result of all these issues?  It is one of the first meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts where no one has tossed out a figure for a potential loss.  Has it been quantified?  I will ask the three witnesses individually.</p></speech>

It will be so historic.  From the perspective of a Chairman of a Committee of Public Accounts, justice delayed is justice denied.  The taxpayer will be denied if there is a loss.  It has already taken six years and nobody has been able to put a figure on the loss, if there is a figure.  In another few years, we might have a figure, or we might not.  I believe there is something wrong with the whole process if, six years after an issue arises, we do not even know if there is a loss.  The witnesses can understand my position.  They do not have an answer.  I suppose they will say to me it is a rhetorical question but they get where I am coming from.  I am surprised at the position we are in if these issues were so serious as to take up so much time.  Even when Mr. Thorn was sent in, why did somebody not try to deal with this?  Why did the finance committee not check whether we were out of pocket?  If the organisation is out of pocket, it is the front-line services, including the youth services and all the other great services provided, that are affected.  If there was less money in the organisation and something else got cut, that is what we are here to know about.  Six years after some of these issues arising, people are just beginning to ask the question.  The answer is that we will wait until the Garda completes its work and look at it at that stage.  I find that delay-----</p></speech>

It is frustrating but not good enough that it has taken so long.  I am not even talking about the old VEC, just this one.  I will leave it at that.  I thank the witnesses for attending.  It is a difficult kind of meeting when there is a report that has gone to the Garda but I am satisfied the meeting was conducted properly.  Nothing was said there that could compromise any investigation by the Garda or any case, if it arises in due course.  That was the important concern I had.  We have probably asked questions to which we have not got answers so we ask that the information sought be sent on to the committee as soon as possible.  We look forward to receiving the accounts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 in due course.  That is a little bit away yet but we will wait and see.</p></speech>
