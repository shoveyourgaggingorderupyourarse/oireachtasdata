We have received apologies from Deputy Harkin.  Before we start business today, I would like to read some formal notices and the Covid-19 code of conduct.  All those present in the committee room are requested to exercise personal responsibility to protect ourselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  On privilege, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  For the information of the witnesses, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Today's meeting is with representatives of the HSE, and will conclude around 2 p.m..  The Working Group of Committee Cathaoirligh has requested that committees finish their business on time, if possible, as otherwise the committee rooms may not be ready in time for the next committee meetings.</p><p>I propose that we take a five-minute break halfway through the session, at 12.30 p.m. approximately.  We will be sticking to five minutes for that break.  The meeting will recommence after five minutes exactly.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> I propose that the following arrangements will apply.  We will first hear the opening statements of the witnesses and then have questions and answers with members.  Witnesses will have approximately five minutes for their statements.  Each member will have five minutes for questions and replies.  Members may speak more than once.  They will be called in accordance with the lists of speaking slots that was circulated.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The first item on the agenda is the minutes of our previous meetings.  Are the minutes of the public meetings held on 22 and 29 September and 4 October agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022101800002#B00175"><p> The second item on the agenda is our consideration of autism policy.  Today, we are paying particular attention to health and related matters.  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to the representatives of the HSE.  We are joined by: Mr. Bernard O'Regan, head of operations, disability services; Professor Malcolm MacLachlan, clinical lead for the national clinical programme for people with disability; Mr. Brian Higgins, head of change, planning and delivery, disability and mental health services; Ms Mary O&rsquo;Kelly, chief officer in community healthcare for Dublin south, Kildare and west Wicklow; and Dr. Graham Connon, principal clinical psychologist, community healthcare office for Dublin north, north-central and north-west.  We are grateful to the witnesses for taking time to contribute to this public session of the committee.</p> <p>  Health is a central issue for the autistic community, even as we move to adopt a less medical-side model of understanding autism.  The committee is interested in discussing a range of issues with the representatives, such as assessments of need, staffing and other issues relating to children's disability network teams, staffing issues in general, diagnosis of children and adults, and delays in accessing therapies.  We would also like to hear an update on the implementation of the recommendations of the review of the health services for individuals with autism spectrum disorder, ASD.  Without access to assessment of needs, autistic children and adults struggle to access the necessary school places, therapies and supports that would allow them to thrive in society.  The committee is aware that autistic people face significant barriers in accessing adequate health services and we are committed to addressing these issues and developing a roadmap towards a resolution in our final report, which will be laid before both Houses next March.</p> <p>  To date, the committee has focused on the area of education and we are very interested in hearing from the representatives of the HSE regarding how the health service can better support autistic children in primary and secondary schools and in third level institutions.  We will later turn our attention to autistic people in employment.  The committee is also interested in how we can make buildings more autism-friendly.  That applies to us in Leinster House as it applies to every facet of society.</p> <p>  I thank the HSE for the written statement and comprehensive briefing note that have been supplied.  Before we hear from the HSE, I propose that we publish the opening statement and briefing note to the committee website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. O'Regan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard O'Regan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022101800002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend to discuss services and supports for autistic children and adults.  The HSE is responsible for developing, providing and funding health and social care services for autistic children and adults.  It does this in the context of legislation, national policy, the UN convention and other international conventions, and the funding provided by the State.</p> <p>  The HSE established the service improvement board for the autistic community to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the review of the Irish health services for individuals with autism spectrum disorder, which was completed in November 2017.  The board consists of senior operational and clinical decision-makers, independent professional and academic support and, importantly, representation of persons with lived experience of autism, participating as equal members of this important collaborative team effort.  This is reflected in the membership of each of the two working groups.  Its work will shape how services can be delivered to autistic people and create greater awareness of autism to promote inclusion and fostering positive attitudes.  The agreed set of priorities are to implement a programme of awareness-raising and engagement with the public, and to build professional capacity and competence among key professionals working with autistic people, including the implementation of a tiered model of assessment.</p> <p>  As regards the awareness working group, information available to the autistic community, family members and service providers was limited and inconsistent and did not always reflect current understanding and approaches.  The HSE has taken a comprehensive approach to addressing this and is reviewing existing content, seeking the views of all stakeholders on said content, reviewing what is available in other jurisdictions and working to ensure it can be made accessible online and in print.  This quality process has been progressing and will continue into next year.  The awareness stream of the programme is designed to respond to the call for greater clarity in respect of autism and the supports available to autistic people, looking at the availability of comprehensive, accessible information for autistic people, families and staff and the public, and supporting AsIAm to provide a national phone line to provide the autistic community with access to useful information.  It involves the development of an online information and knowledge hub combined with a helpline aimed at providing contemporary information in respect of services, resources and signposting to other essential community and statutory-based supports and services.</p> <p>  The assessment and pathways working group aims to develop a standardised assessment approach for use in all services dealing with the assessment of those with autism to ensure that every assessment is of an agreed standard.  It also seeks to agree a standardised service journey and the implementation of a consistent core service offering across those providing services to people with autism.  The working group has consulted widely with key stakeholders in the development of the project and this was particularly important in the context of the implementation of a tiered approach to assessment.  Its main focus is to develop an operational model for a tiered approach to autism assessment through developing clear and functioning pathways to services.  This will contribute to the national clinical programme for people with disability, NCPPD, producing a model of service, including initial and ongoing assessment.  There will be an implementation plan to include training which takes cognisance of existing policies of the HSE, along with the development of processes or supporting protocols.  The draft protocol is currently being piloted in two community healthcare organisations and its next phase will bring that up to four community healthcare organisations, CHOs.  By way of update, a third CHO has now committed to piloting it and we are engaging with the fourth CHO at the moment.</p> <p>  As regards services to children and families, the HSE is committed to providing high-quality health and social care services to all service users, including those with disabilities and their families.  The HSE fully accepts that there are significant challenges in current service provision, the level of unmet need and engagement and communications with service users and families.  The HSE, in collaboration with Department officials, is working to develop an overarching roadmap to progress the next phase of implementation of Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People.  The document will broadly address the key areas of: communications and engagement with families and service users; activity data and their collation and sharing pending the roll-out of the new integrated management system for the teams; workforce planning to support increased recruitment of required skilled staff; family-centred practice and supports to teams as they transition to an interdisciplinary and family-centred model of service; education sector engagement, including the establishment of local education and health forums in all CHO areas; a process for review of the implementation of the progressing disability service, PDS, model; and assessments of need, AON, and the challenges presented by the legislative requirements of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, including HSE proposals to address the ongoing requirements for assessments of need and associated waiting lists.  The document will include prioritisation, timelines and dependencies. </p> <p>  The HSE has developed a waiting list initiative to address the AON waiting list, in addition to a commitment put in place earlier this year to provide 1,000 assessments for autistic children.</p><p>The HSE's children&rsquo;s disability services have been reorganised under the progressing disability services, PDS, programme.  The aim at the heart of PDS is to achieve fair access to services for all children with disabilities, based on need.  Making that happen is one of the most complex change programmes undertaken within our health and social service, and while we have made progress, we have a lot more to do before it is complete.  Services are moving from being professionally-centred to being family- and person-centred.  When services are family and person centred the team of professionals and the family are equal partners, co-designing services to meet individual needs.  The family brings knowledge of their child and the team brings its expertise.  Together they agree on goals and how they will be achieved.</p><p> The HSE is facing some specific challenges in children&rsquo;s services, including a high level of staff vacancies on our children&rsquo;s disability network teams, CDNTs, a limited employment market and meeting the concerns and needs of children and families.  We also need to strengthen adult disability services.  Waiting lists and caseloads are a challenge and we must ensure we can prioritise children or adults by their need for specialist or more routine services.  It is not acceptable for an individual to have to wait an extended time for either an assessment of their needs, or for supports and therapies needed by people with autism.  We recognise that difficulties accessing services create additional stress for families.  Our programme of reform is intended to ensure that children have timely access to services based on need.  The HSE regrets the negative experience of individuals and families where the current service may fall short of what is needed to meet their needs.  We are fully committed to addressing these problems and always welcome suggestions about improving our approach to doing so.  This concludes my opening statement and together with my colleagues we will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1452" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022101800002#C00200"><p>I have been going through Mr. O'Regan's opening statement and there are three points that I want to pick out.  I welcome the development of the online knowledge hub and "providing contemporary information in relation to services, resources, and signposting to other essential community and statutory based supports and services".  It is grand to be told where to go but the biggest problem we have is accessing the services.  The big bugbear I hear about is the AON, which is a huge one.  The waiting lists for this are growing every day.  I spoke to a family yesterday, including a 14-year-old boy who is in school.  The school has been extremely supportive.  The boy has a lot of issues and learning difficulties and he finds it successful when he is using the laptop but he is on a two-year waiting list to get the assessment.  While the school is supporting him with a laptop, because he cannot get the AON to say he needs it, the HSE and the Department of Education cannot approve the laptop and, therefore, that laptop will be taken off that child before he goes to do his exam in June.  That is causing immense stress for the individual and the family because that child's mother is now the teacher.  I have had numerous cases like this, and I have been lucky that the individual who helps me with this goes to the High Court to push for the AONs.  We are in 2022 and this should not be happening.  The statement says the services should be family- and person-centred and that if there are specific cases they should be dealt with but is there any other avenue where the likes of I and others can go when there is an urgency?  They are probably all urgent cases and that is where the crux of the issue is.  What can we do and what do you say to a family in this situation?  This is probably one of the least complicated cases I have come across when it comes to autism.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard O'Regan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022101800002#C00300"><p>I will comment on that and my colleagues may want to comment as well.  The starting point is that the example the Deputy gave is not an acceptable situation and not one that anybody coming in to provide supports and services wants to see happen.  People are working to improve that.</p> <p>  I will comment on the statutory AON side first.  We have to work within the legislation and the requirements of the Act.  We had developed a standard operating procedure on AON, which was found in March of this year to not be compliant with the Act.  That has had an impact at a time we had almost cleared the backlog and were beginning to get on top of the issue of recreating delays in the service again.  We are also finding ourselves in a challenging situation whereby the same staff who we need to do interventions, which is ultimately the goal of the services, are generally the same staff who are required to undertake AON as well.  We have a waiting list initiative and we have been resourced to progress it.  That will lead to us endeavouring to procure, including internationally, anything we can to address the formal AON process.  Professor MacLachlan might want to comment on the following point as well.  We have progressed some work on clinical guidance on how clinicians might undertake the assessments themselves.  That is something we are addressing through the HSE structures and under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  We are engaging with the unions to progress that and we hope to bring it to a conclusion in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  An AON is not required under the Disability Act 2005 to access the service.  A referral to the service can be made based on need.  In that context, any clinician working with a child should be able to determine what a child's needs are and make recommendations with the family.  The case the Deputy has used is a good example of how that might be progressed.  The challenge is the availability of staffing.  Teams are severely depleted and they have significant caseloads so the capacity of the teams to be able to meet the needs of children is challenged.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Malcolm MacLachlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022101800002#C00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  Following Justice Phelan's finding that the previous standard operating procedure was non-compliant with the Act, the national clinical programme for people with disabilities had a large-scale consultation involving over 80 people, including service users.  We developed new interim clinical guidance to support clinicians in how to go about doing an AON.  We were able to do all of that and have it signed off within the clinical system within six weeks.  We are now waiting for legal advice to confirm its appropriateness and as Mr. O'Regan was saying, we are addressing it through the WRC.</p> <p>  On another element of what the Deputy is mentioning, a particular challenge in the Irish system is whether one needs an AON or not.  As Mr. O'Regan said, there is a right to access services but it is not a requirement.  What has happened in our school system - and I am sure the Deputy will be aware that the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004 is under revision - is that a practice developed where schools would ask for a diagnosis because they would feel that would enhance their chances of getting an SNA or additional technology, whereas neither in the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act or the Disability Act is a diagnosis required to access these supports.</p><p>That is a custom that has developed but the latest research strongly suggests we should be addressing our people's needs rather than focusing more narrowly on their diagnoses.  Disability services are needs-led and it is a bit confusing because assessment of needs is a legal entitlement but, when assessing a child or adult, you would be trying to find out their needs, rather than simply their diagnosis.  While recognising the importance of diagnosis for people's identity and sense of empowerment etc., from a clinical point of view it is not the most critical thing in ensuring that person gets the services they need to support them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1452" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022101800002#D00200"><p>When Professor MacLachlan says it is clinician-led, does he mean even a GP or does it have to be an occupational therapist?  The professor works on the clinical side but, unfortunately,  we do not have in this country a bit of empathy or a common-sense approach.  In the majority of these schools, SNAs, teachers and principals go above and beyond because they are with them nearly as long as the parents, so they know the children.  If I go back to that family and tell them to go to their GP, can the GP assist them and write a recommendation letter in order they can go to the Department of Education, outline the situation and ask for it to be sorted?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022101800002#D00300"><p>I thank Deputy Buckley for the question.  We are trying to differentiate between a legislative piece and a local operational piece.  I am not very familiar with that case but that family may already be linked in with the service.  If not, their local primary care centre is a huge point of contact and should be able to signpost them.  Notwithstanding the fact that we have a dearth of clinicians, within primary care and disabilities there are occupational therapists who assess children with regard to technology for the school environment.  They do not need to go through the legislative assessment of need process to gain that.  Also, in many areas of the country, they are able to self-refer and do not need to go through a GP.  The first question for a family is to ask whether they are already known to a service.  It is likely that they may be.</p></speech>

They are still waiting.  The hospital has not acknowledged that she is even on the waiting list.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1617" speakername="Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022101800002#D01000"><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>I thank Mr. O'Regan for the presentation.  To be honest, I am not sure I exited it a great deal wiser than I entered it.</p> <p>  I often talk about how I used to be a primary teacher.  I was often the first person a parent met who tried to put a name to what they knew about their child.  They knew there was something there but I might be the person to say it was possibly autism, dyslexia or dyspraxia.  That is a big thing for a parent to deal with.  I used to always try to emphasise that a label does not limit or disable a child; it should enable him or her and be a toolkit giving access to the tools needed to make sure a child reaches his or her full potential.  If it is a toolkit, it remains locked until the assessment.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding what Ms O'Kelly said, if we are taking about assessment and standardised pathways, we cannot have that fragmented approach whereby a Teachta D&aacute;la such as Deputy Buckley does not know where to begin with a family.  I cannot point him to the pathways because it is too fragmented.  Ms O'Kelly spoke about referral to a CDNT, but in many areas they are extremely understaffed and struggling to get to the people they already have with outstanding assessments.  I do not see how speaking about approaching them informally makes sense, if we are trying to standardise assessment pathways and, after that, pathways to services.  </p> <p>  The incidence rate of autism across a population is relatively predictable, whatever figure we take for that.  One in 68 is one figure.  I would not like to stand over that and do not have the level of expertise to do so.  The witnesses will know better.  That means in any given cohort of young people moving through school, we should have a clear idea of how many of them are likely to require an assessment.  What modelling are we using?  What are the best estimates on current need?  If we get there, let us work backwards.  If we know on a population level how many people in a cohort are likely to need an assessment, how many hours do we need to provide the assessment for that number of people?  If we know how many hours we need in order to provide assessment, we know how many staff we need.  We have to unlock that toolkit for parents.</p> <p>  Practitioners and GPs up and down the country are meeting parents in that stressed space of knowing something is happening, maybe putting a name to it for the first time and then saying to a parent "I think it might be this but I'm not sure when we're going to get an assessment for you".  There may only be two assessments available in that school this year, for example.  Then are we telling parents they can go private?  Not every parent has the means to go private. </p> <p> Will the witnesses talk to me about that?   We should be able to model across the population how many people are likely to be autistic and, from that, to infer how many hours we need for assessment.  From there, we should be able to infer how many posts we need to fill.  Will the witnesses give me an answer on some of that please?</p></speech>

It is instructive to look at some of the statistics.  We have about one third of children on waiting lists to receive services and we also have about one third of posts on CDNTs vacant.  I do not suggest it is an exact match but if we had those CDNTs fully resourced, then we would probably be able to provide services to everybody who needs them.</p> <p>  In developing the protocol, we do not want an approach whereby every child gets the same number of hours of assessment.  It is important that the assessments are tailored to the complexity of the presentation.  A challenge we had before was that we had assessments that took 60, 70 or, in some cases, over 100 hours and clinicians would feel a thorough assessment required that level of detail.  The protocol we have been developing involves a tiered approach where some children could be assessed in as little as three hours and others may well take over 100 hours.  It is not simply a matter of drawing the average.  We are trialling the protocol that has been developed.  For the 19 people who have gone through the protocol at the moment, 11 have been assessed at tier 1.  That is within a five-hour timeframe, maximum.  Those people might have taken ten times that long to be assessed had we not developed that protocol.  </p></speech>

On a population-wide level, we should be able to model this.  We should have an understanding of how many people in a given cohort are likely to have autism.</p><p>Whatever knowledge we have about the different tiered structures and the level of assessment that is needed, we should be able to infer and model on a population-wide basis how many people we understand to require tier 1 and tier 2 services, and the total number of man and woman hours we are going to need in order to provide the level of assessment we need.  Do we have that kind of modelling?</p></speech>

If we assume a 1.8% occurrence level for autism, we can certainly infer the number of kids who are likely to present with autism.  The whole point of developing the protocol is to ask how many of that cohort from whom there is a demand for services can be assessed at tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3.  Once we have those data, we will be able to translate that knowledge directly from the hours of assessment to the number of professionals required to fulfil that demand.</p></speech>

We have an interim report that will be publicly available in a couple of weeks.  I am sure it will be shared with this committee.  That is the first part of the assessment process for the protocol.</p> <p>  The second part of that assessment process should be complete in March.  That will be the second egg.  The data available at that stage will allow us to convert the number requiring assessments to the different types of assessments liable to be required.  We can then project that directly into the clinical hours involved.</p></speech>

I appreciate Mr. O'Regan's comments conveying regret to families.  Many families who are at their wits' end are watching proceedings.  They feel helpless because they have not been able to get services for their children.  They do not know to where to turn.  They are turning to us politicians and we do not have the answers either.  Our guests have the answers.  I am not sure whether any of our guests are the architects of the CDNT model but that is the system within which they are working.  It is not a system that is working very well.  I am glad that it is being reviewed and that changes are being made.</p> <p>  We know anecdotally that 55,000 children are waiting for an assessment of needs.  Our guests might update that figure and tell me where we are and how many children nationwide are waiting for assessments of need.</p> <p>  It is great that Professor MacLachlan is bringing in a new system and protocol around the assessment of need but it is ridiculous that it was not done previously.  It is clear that assessment does not take 100 hours for every child.  What the professor said is welcome, and it was great to hear.  That type of practical vision is needed across the HSE.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Buckley, reported on a constituent of his.  It is definitely cheaper to supply a laptop in such a situation than to pay professionals to carry out an assessment of need.  Some parents are told to go to the High Court and their children will then get an assessment of need within a month because the HSE moves to a different budget to respond in such cases.  There must be more practical ways to look at these issues.</p> <p>  If I were to look at the CDNT model from the perspective a cost-benefit analysis, as someone such as Michael O'Leary would, I would say of course we should have people working from community centres.  We could have therapists working 12 months of the year.  They would not be in school settings.  That could be considered the way to get the most out of them.  However, we also must consider the journey for parents.  Many working parents have children with autism and other disabilities and it is very difficult for them to take time out of work to bring their children to all the different appointments necessary.  I know many parents who tell me their places of work have given up on them and they are unable to take any more days off.  Those parents then have their own journeys whereby they are almost being bullied by their employers because they are taking time off and perhaps are working less hard than they were previously.  It is difficult.</p> <p>  I am glad that Professor MacLachlan mentioned educational engagement, which is crucial.  That is the missing link here.  The CDNT network is there but it must be redirected towards schools around the country.  Therapists must be in the schools because parents cannot be dragging their kids to therapy appointments.  Many parents do not have the means or wherewithal to do so.  It is unfair.  For a child from a family at a social disadvantage, it is not going to be a priority to bring that child to an appointment with an occupational therapist or a speech and language therapist.  We have a super education system.  It is ingrained in us that people need to bring their children to school.  Therapies must be delivered in a school setting.  Our guests much push for that delivery.</p> <p>  There is a one third vacancy rate.  I asked a few occupational therapists and speech and language therapists why they do not want to work in the HSE or the CDNTs.  They told me they do not like it and they do not like the politics involved.  They said they do not get much interaction with children because there is a concentration on family engagement and teaching the parents.  Those young therapists want to be working directly with kids.  They like the idea of working in a school-type environment.  These are young women who are not motivated by money and are not going to be whipped into providing an enormous amount of hours.  They would love to work in a school-type environment where they know their children and environment.  The children are happier because they are not being dragged to appointments.  We must consider the ethos within the CDNTs.  Why do people, the majority of whom are women, not want to work in the CDNTs?  The education piece is the answer to that.  We need to push therapists back into the schools via the CDNTs, because that is the structure in place.  It would allow therapists to have a school they know and attend.  They could build up a rapport with other staff members.  That is crucial.</p> <p>  I agree with much of what my colleagues have said about AON, but that is a monster in itself.  My message today, which our guests might pass on, is that we should redirect our resources, or as much as possible, towards the schools.  We are always going to have children who are not in school settings and who will have to be given therapies in the community.  However, for the majority of children, especially considering the increase in ASD classes and early intervention classes, the key is delivering therapies in a school setting.</p> <p>  Professor MacLachlan referred to a diagnosis and, unfortunately, a diagnosis is crucial in Ireland because a child cannot get into an early intervention class or an ASD class without a diagnosis.  Nobody needs a diagnosis.  The only reason a diagnosis is necessary, as my colleague said, is to access the necessary tools because no matter what, those tools cannot be accessed without a diagnosis.  The education piece is key.  Diagnoses are required for early intervention, home tuition and level 7 support under the access and inclusion model, AIM.  That is key.  The diagnosis cannot be downgraded.</p></speech>

I apologise if there are some aspects I do not cover.  Perhaps my colleagues will come in on a few matters.  On the assessments of need, linked to the Disability Act, in general we get approximately 6,000 applications per annum for assessments of need.  In 2022, we are also mindful that the ruling by Ms Justice Phelan has created an additional 8,000 cases which had been dealt with under the previous guidance but need now to be revisited.  However, in a typical year, there are approximately 6,000 applications.</p></speech>

I will send that report on to the committee.</p> <p>  As for the engagement with schools, we are currently working on implementing a proposal that has been agreed with the Government to reinstate some supports in some special schools.  In 2021 we were allocated 85 additional posts to put resources into special schools and we now have sanction for an additional 136 posts to put into special schools.  We are working on that at the moment.  I think that the challenge with putting services into schools is as follows.  I understand the benefits of this but there are also some gaps that are still there.  Special schools are only one part of the educational domain that is there.  We also have, as was mentioned, special classes.  We also have many children, including autistic children, who are in mainstream schools and who need supports.  One cannot put something into every school.  It is a question of how this is managed.  I think the design and the thinking behind the CDNT is that there is a service in a local community that is for the population of children in that community, regardless of their location, but we are looking to do something in the special schools.</p></speech>

Again, I would have to get them for the Senator.  I do not disagree with her in principle.  The point is more that children are in lots of different environments and that the service needs to work with families, teaching staff and whoever else in order to support children in all their environments, and the model of service needs to reflect that.  Nowhere in the model does it say that staff should not or cannot work in schools.  If they are working with children, they should be looking at what the needs of the children are regardless of the environment and then figuring out what the right intervention is.  There is no issue with staff going in and working in schools, but it is important also that we have a way of working with families in order that we are also mindful of the other environments a child is in and we are providing wholesome and full support that is targeted not just on the educational needs of the child but on their broader needs as well.</p> <p>  Was there something Ms O'Kelly wanted to come in on?</p></speech>

I absolutely understand what Senator Ardagh says, but there is the matter of inclusion in the school and the curriculum.  Then, as Mr. O'Regan said, there is the whole life of the child, that is, the 24-hour piece.  There is also huge evidence to show that it is not even what happens in the session.  It is a little like having homework from school.  It is the learning in the home environment after the session and that translation of what was learnt in the session to all the other aspects of one's home life.  We really want to engage with parents and families on that because an awful lot of that learning happens in the home environment.  The advice and support and the programme might be set in an intervention session but the learning and the building of the capacity then happens between sessions, in the home environment, out and about, in the community, in sports and things like that.</p></speech>

The point I was trying to make was that it is important within the Irish system, almost for the wrong reasons, that a diagnosis is needed to access supports and services, whereas that should not be the case.  I have here a quote from the top journal in this area, which is called <i>The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry</i>.  Each year it does a sort of annual review whereby people put together a huge amount of information.  Last year the review was published on the transdiagnostic revolution in neurodevelopmental disorders.  The authors' conclusion at the end of a very long paper synthesising a lot of evidence is that &quot;an overreliance on ill-fitting diagnostic criteria is impeding progress towards identifying the barriers that children encounter, understanding underpinning mechanisms and finding the best route to supporting them&quot;.  I absolutely agree that within our system this is important.  It has too much importance and, as I said, that is, I think, one of the reasons the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act is being reviewed.  From the perspective of people with autism, I think it would also be important to review the Disability Act in order that we have those two interlocking Acts evolving at the same time.</p></speech>

They are helpful.  I want to try to get a better understanding of where the school inclusion model pilot is.  When it was initially set up in 2018 by, I think, the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, was looking at employing two co-ordinators and then the assumption was that the specialists and the therapists would come from the HSE.  I am checking out information going back to 2021, when 31 speech and language and occupational therapist, OTs, were to be recruited by the NCSE.  Has there been a shift?  I am listening to some of the witnesses' language and I hope I am not quoting Mr. O'Regan incorrectly by saying that he said that one cannot put something into every school.  I totally understand the challenges around this, but where are we with that pilot?  We are four years into it.  I know there is an independent evaluation being carried out at the moment by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  Maybe that is finished.  Is that evaluation finished or is it ongoing?</p></speech>

When we started the pilot, as the Deputy will know, it was a cross-government initiative.  My CHO region, encompassing Dublin south, Kildare and west Wicklow, was the pilot site.  As the Deputy will know, the pilot comprehended a number of primary schools and secondary schools.  We then employed a team comprising some of our own staff via expression of interest and other staff from national recruitment panels.  The key stakeholders in the pilot were the NCSE, the local HSE team in the CHO region and what is now the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  When we hired the staff there was not a model for the school inclusion, so the first year was what I would call almost the preplanning stage, whereby this team of occupational therapists and speech and language therapists has to look at international evidence and build a model, with the NCSE really leading in respect of the schools and engagement with the schools, the principals and the board of management.  They developed a three-tier model.  The committee may have heard a little about that in other sessions.  The model was a universal model, which should be applied to everybody regardless of complexity, recognising that, with children with complex needs, the teachers still need a universal level of knowledge and understanding and capacity-building for the classroom.  Tier 2 was a more targeted response to children in the classroom.</p><p> Tier 3 was for the children who were more complex and that was almost a treatment intervention in a classroom setting.  The whole model was based on school inclusion rather than build capacity in the whole of the child's life.  That is really appropriate as children spend most of their young lives in school but from a health point of view, such as participation in community scouts, sports, GAA or whatever.  How to ride a bike was not included in any of that.  The first year was spent in the pre-planning stage, developing the model, getting it into schools and building tier 1.  Then tiers 2 and 3 were being introduced.  The core of the model was school inclusion, so the NCSE looked to take on the project.  We were to exit the project in summer 2020 but Covid hit in March and schools were closed.  The model was within the walls of a school.  It was not during the summer, during holidays or at Christmas, which is new for clinicians in health because they work all year round.  When Covid hit, staff were redeployed as part of the Covid response and then the NCSE took over.  So the CHO and the HSE do not participate in the school inclusion model now.  The NCSE has built tiers in terms of its own people around the country.</p></speech>

I understand what was said about the culture, the three months and the lifestyle of students outside of school.  Will the ESRI evaluation show the value of the people that the HSE had deployed in 2018 and 2019 before Covid-19 hit?  Surely the evaluation will see the value in having speech and language therapists in schools.  The difference is just a building.  If a parent has to bring a child from school to go and meet the speech and language therapist in a different building, is there not value from a HSE point of view in providing in-school therapy in schools?</p></speech>

Supports can be provided to a child across all of their environments, including in school.  As a result, it is not binary and it is not an either-or situation.  We must await the evaluation of the school inclusion model.  As Ms O'Kelly has said, the evaluation, I suspect, will point to positives for two reasons.  First, it was a project that focused on supporting children to access the school curriculum.  That was its primary focus, so it was not looking to assess what happens to a child in other environments.  In terms of what it set out to do then it will demonstrate a positive outcome.  Our role is to look across the totality of a child's life not just the school part.  Like everything, it depends on what one sets out to do and then what are the questions being asked in terms of evaluating afterwards but there will be benefits.</p> <p>  The purpose of the work we are trying to do and the discussions we have with colleagues in the Department of Education, the NCSE and so on is to build capacity, under the governance of the CDNT, in order that we have a service designed that takes account of the child wherever he or she may be, including in school.  It is unfortunate that there is a perception and, in some cases, the reality has developed whereby staff, for whatever reason, were not working with children in schools.  There is no reason that cannot happen.  It was never the intention of the policy.</p></speech>

For what it is worth, I am not looking for a response.  My own county and constituency are not included in the pilot scheme.

In rural locations like Ardara in County Donegal, there is little or no support for autistic children.  Parents have resorted to setting up groups in these areas so that all special needs children can meet once a week.  It is very tough to secure supports in rural communities.  The people seated around this table are not to blame.  I understand that in this job we talk a lot about funding, etc.  As a public representative, however, I believe that there are two parts to this issue.  One is being diagnosed and two is to meet the needs of each child.  What is the solution for people in rural Ireland?  Can the HSE delegation tell us what we can be done to better the lives of children in rural Ireland?  Not only have these counties been forgotten about but, most importantly, rural children have been forgotten about as there are more services and access to services in cities.</p> <p>  I am going to throw a spanner in the works by saying that children from ethnic minority groups can be autistic or have additional needs.  I did not see it or hear that aspect named in any of the sessions this morning.  It is important that children on the margins of society are included and provided with equal access and have their cultural needs met.  I know many Traveller children who are autistic and there are more of them now than in previous years, there have also been a large number of missed diagnoses and families did not know that there were supports.  How do we support these families and children?</p> <p>  How does the HSE ensure that disabled persons' organisations are a priority in its work?  These are groups that need to advocate for our children and parents as well.  I knew about AsIAm, as an organisation, before I was ever a Senator.  I am aware of its work on inclusion.</p> <p>  I have listened to other members.  What solutions can the witnesses from the HSE, as professionals, suggest?  I ask because we are not professionals.  I know people who have autistic children and I know people from within my community who have autistic children or are autistic but I am not a professional.  What solutions can we, as a committee, include in our recommendations?  I ask because we, as members, get only one bite at the cherry because we only have this committee for a short period.</p></speech>

In a previous role, I worked with an organisation that was located in a rural county and that provided services to children and adults with disabilities, including those with autism.  The model we operated comprised a team of clinicians who provided therapy and conducted assessments.  That team predated the CDNTs but, in effect, was one.</p><p>We also had a range of other supports to work in conjunction with the team.  These included autism resource workers, personal assistants, home support and all these kinds of supports.  They were working in conjunction with the team so that direct supports were provided to a child or family where they were.  It helped to enable implementation of the recommendations a therapist might make.  In many respects, apart from providing direct support to the child, some of those staff also played a key worker role and were able to act as a bridge between different components of the service and to support families in navigating the services.  As we develop the services, and we want to develop the clinical services, we must be mindful that other supports and services that people need must also be developed.</p><p> As regards rural communities, these services must be agile enough.  There are examples of where agile services have been developed in rural areas that have been responsive.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  Sometimes this is about investing but it involves parallel investment and growing these kinds of services together.  My colleagues may wish to contribute on other aspects.</p></speech>

I absolutely agree with the Senator.  We wish the other one third of unfilled positions in the teams could be filled.  People go to the High Court because of the waiting lists that result from that.  The fact that the service is not appropriately resourced does not mean the model is wrong.  If one is interested in social equity and having equal access regardless of where people live, how wealthy they are and what sort of school they go to, then a community-based model where specialised services are provided in the community is exactly the right way to go.  Of course, the model must be resourced.</p> <p>  Regarding people's experience of autism, I am sure members are well aware that, for instance, women and men can experience and express autism in different ways.  It is the same with different cultural groups.  If we take on board the idea of neurodiversity and intersectionality, that is, the different ways in which people are oppressed, effectively, influencing how they express their experience of autism, this brings us to the operating model of the CDNTs, which is needs-focused.  It is focused on individuals and their families.  It is they who determine the outcomes they want to achieve.  Again, this is because we cannot put people in a box and tell them they have X and this is how they should be treated.  There must be much more individualisation and this approach takes on board those intersectional experiences people have.</p> <p>  I hear the Senator's frustration.  We have exactly the same frustration and we wish we could provide all the services with all the resources.  We do not have them yet, but I ask the Senator not to question the model.</p></speech>

Several important points have been raised.  The Senator's point about equity is critically important to what we are trying to do.  Under Sl&aacute;intecare, we are trying to create a system that creates equity.  This equity would be for everyone, including factors such as geographic location, culture and identity.  There are challenges in the delivery of this approach.  We are trying to move from a clinically-based model to a socially-based model and from a location-based approach to one that is family-based.  In this regard, Deputy Buckley gave the important example of educators and families being able to identify what interventions are required.  This is a challenge that we are embracing to move forward.  The difficulty, and our regret, concerning the speed of change is that we are doing a great amount and we will continue to do so, but, unfortunately, it is not visible above the water line yet.  That work is under way but I am mindful of the comments that have been made and the examples given because they are a phenomenal guide for us to continue this work we are doing.</p></speech>

An assessment of need is a legal right and it is an avenue that can be pursued, but it is not required to be able to access the services.  I just wanted to clarify that point because it is important.</p></speech>

The assessment of need is the legal piece.  Children can access services and receive a diagnostic assessment without it.  It is worth knowing that.</p> <p>  One of the major measures the HSE is taking through Sl&aacute;intecare at grassroots level is the Healthy Ireland initiative.  This is particularly relevant when we talk about rural communities and cultural diversity and inclusion.  Senator Wall was with us on Friday in Athy, which, historically, has been quite a deprived area.  Grassroots measures we are considering are parenting, healthy eating made easy and inclusion and activities for children.  That is an extremely powerful approach.  It involves grassroots action and communities doing things for themselves with assistance.  The aim is to be very inclusive.  That could be done well at a grassroots level to build capacity.</p></speech>

Ms O'Kelly and Mr. O'Regan referred to an assessment of need not being required.  Many of the families I deal with tell me they are being told they do need an assessment of need.  They are being told by clinicians, day in and day out, they will not be able to access services unless they have that piece of paper in their hands.  Can it be confirmed again that an assessment of need is not required and can that message be conveyed to the other clinicians putting up these obstacles?</p><p>I am sure all Members of these Houses come across this daily.  People are told that unless they have an assessment of need done, they will not get into the services.  The second issue is that more and more families that come to me are told that they have to take part in parent support classes and family forums.  I want to know if this is a change in policy in the HSE.  The families tell me that this deprives them of one-to-one services that their children need.  Many of the people who are going to these classes come out with a lack of understanding of how they should deal with their children when they come out of the classes because the classes are quite complex.  People are left in a situation where they do not know where to go next.  Will the witnesses comment on why the HSE seems to be going down the road of parent support classes and family forums to deal with the issues that are arising?</p><p> I also want to mention respite care, which is important to families.  I want to read a reply that I got about respite care from a constituent last week.  It states that disability services endeavour to sanction as many in-house support requests as possible within their defined home supports allocation, which in 2022 is less than &euro;100,000 for all disability service users.  It states that there are more than 7,000 children for the children's team to address, in addition to a full adult caseload.  It states that in this context, it has to manage the expectations of families who are requesting support.  Will the witnesses comment on where respite care stands?  Respite care is essential for many families that I deal with, but this is the reply they are getting.</p><p> I refer to the launch that Ms O'Kelly said happened in Athy last week.  It was influential and it is good that it happened.  Where does it go next?  I found what was happening at the launch insightful.  We were actually going back into communities, where the HSE does its best work.  For young people, children with autism and indeed autistic adults, what will healthy communities mean?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard O'Regan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022101800002#J00200"><p>I will answer a couple of the questions then ask Dr. Connon to comment on one.  Ms O'Kelly will address the question on Athy.  I will not deal with them in order, if that is okay.</p> <p>  We are provided with funding each year to provide respite.  Respite services were impacted during the couple of years of Covid because of capacity and infection prevention and control, but they are getting back to normal levels of service this year.  We were also provided with funding to increase respite services in 2021 and 2022.  Those services are either in place or are being put in place.  We agreed with the CHOs and service providers that where funding was allocated, for example, as full-year funding for a new development which would not be in place until the second half of the year, it would still get full-year funding to provide alternative respite, including summer schemes and so on.  That would mean the full resource was available to be used.  It would be fair to say that there is a gap in respite services.  It is better in some areas of the country than others for all kinds of historical reasons and due to funding streams at the time.  We are trying to grow the respite capacity for both children and adults across the country.  That takes time.  In 2021, we were allocated funding for nine additional respite services, with one per CHO.  That makes a difference within that CHO, but it is also just one service in a large catchment area.  It takes a number of years to grow those services.</p> <p>  I will deal with the family forum and the group work as two separate issues.  The family forum is the structure for us to engage with families so that they become part of the overall governance of children's services.  We have always seen it as critical that the setting of a child's development goals should be done in partnership between the staff and the family.  That should be replicated at all levels of the structure.  The family forums are intended for us, at children's disability network team level, to engage with families who are connected to that service and to find a way to involve them in the service's governance.</p> <p>  Group work is a different focus.  It is about providing supports to children and families.  That is sometimes well done and sometimes best done in the context of group work.  It is not an alternative to individual work and support that a child might need.  There is not a change in the delivery of policy.  In the absence of full staffing levels, with a depleted service, it looks like we are doing more group work than individual work, but it is not an either-or situation.  Both types of work have merit.  I can provide some feedback that we have received from families, not just direct feedback to the HSE, but also feedback to the lead agencies about how beneficial families have found that work to be.  It is understandably frustrating for families if that is all that is on offer and there is not individual work to complement it.  I acknowledge that.</p> <p>  Dr. Connon might comment on the assessment of need.  A child or family absolutely do not need to have an assessment of need in order to access services.  I communicate this often.  We are happy to reiterate that again with regard to the system.</p></speech>

The criteria relate to people's level and complexity of need, and whether those need to be addressed by an interdisciplinary team or in a unidisciplinary manner in primary care.  Those are the criteria that are assessed when deciding whether someone with a disability, or autism in this case, should access primary care or the children's disability network team.  Services have been consolidated, so everyone should be able to access one of those services, so there should be no cracks to fall through.  There is always a possibility that services will disagree on criteria.  A mechanism called an integrated children's services forum, ICSF, is built into the policy, which will resolve any disputes if services disagree on those criteria.  A decision will be made in that forum and a service will be assigned.  Those forums are in the process of being set up around the country.  We will hear about how they are doing.  Anecdotally, I can tell the Senator that where they have been set up, there has been a much lower than expected level of referral to integrated children's services forums.  Once clinicians understand how the referral process works, there seems to be very little disagreement.  Several forums have been cancelled because no disputes have been referred to them.  We are getting better at that.  It is a positive development.</p></speech>

Much is happening with regard to the review of services as a result of the PDS programme and people who are really working hard to improve services.  Respite is being reviewed.  Two new respite houses are coming into service in our CHO.  One is in the Kildare area.  There are different ways of looking at respite.  We acknowledge that overnight respite is not necessarily the answer for everybody.  We are looking at after-school services, Saturday clubs, and reaching children and families in a different way which is a little more meaningful.</p><p>That is one piece.</p><p> We have had the engagements across CHO 7 covering south of Dublin and Kildare and west Wicklow.  The 11 teams have had the engagement with families.  They have invited the families in for the first engagement around the family forum.  A lot has come up and there is an awful lot of learning for us in that.  That is the idea behind the family forums.  It goes back to the fact that no matter where people live, there should be a local forum for them.  All these forums will help us meet the needs of the local population in a better way because they are telling us what the problem is rather than us making assumptions and having a blanket response, if you like, to health provision.</p><p> Regarding places like Athy, as the Senator said, this is Sl&aacute;intecare at the grassroots and at its best.  As the Senator saw, it is not about high-tech surgeries but the interventions that are happening on the ground to help our whole population, and to promote health rather than intervention.  Where we would like to go with Sl&aacute;intecare is the enhanced community care, ECC, programme.  It has been very much focused on adults and older persons to date.  We now need to look at the children and young persons population, be it under 18 years or under 25 years.  The progressing disabilities configuration has been huge and there is still a long way to go.  There is also the foundation of primary care, where the strategic development for children in primary care has been public health nursing and speech and language therapy.  Other services, especially therapeutic ones, have evolved and are disparate - that is the word.  They are not systematic.  If we are talking about a tiered model in which we want to focus a particular service such as a CDNT on more complex needs, a foundation is needed under that.  That is where we would like to go next with Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

Having listened to my colleagues' contributions and the answers to them, I am a little confused because this dialogue is far removed from the experience parents relate to me.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we hear about every part of the public sector and all the public services.  This area comes up again and again and is by far the most challenging because of its impact on young people.</p> <p>  There are so many different aspects to this.  Let us consider, for example, the effect on a parent of an appointment being cancelled without proper notice being given to the parents.  I am thinking of one of the parents who appeared before the committee a couple of weeks ago.  When parents have an appointment they have to take their child out of school and prepare him or her psychologically.  Then they turn up and are told they were supposed to get a text to say the appointment was cancelled.  That has happened to a number of parents who have appeared before this committee.  We can give the witnesses examples.  It just is not okay.  Can the witnesses imagine how difficult that is from the parents' perspective?  Imagine the co-ordination of services from the parents' perspective.  The witnesses have their jobs but I have parents who are trying to organise school buses to aftercare or weekend or overnight respite care.  All this is very difficult to do and is done while managing their child and trying to communicate with CDNTs, from which parents do not get responses or engagement.  From the parents' perspective, they do not care which arm of the State is dealing with these different things.  They have one child with one set of difficulties that needs resolution and there is no proactive management of that.  Not only is there no proactive management of it but sometimes it can be very difficult to get a response or the appointment is cancelled at the last minute.  I am telling the witnesses, as a public representative dealing with all aspects of the public service, that this service is the least satisfactory because of its inefficiency, how it fails to respond to parents and the impact it has on children.</p> <p>  I heard the witnesses say an assessment of needs is not needed.  That would be a huge relief to parents who have been told - universally in my experience, and other members agree - that an assessment is essential, which has created delays for them.  It is interesting to have that clarity.</p> <p>  I will talk through this as if I were a parent.  I have a concern about my child and take him to the GP.  The GP says I may need to get an assessment for autism or it may be that the child needs speech and language therapy.  Will the witnesses talk me through what can I expect?  CDNT 3 is the team that covers my area and I have cases involving children who have been waiting for therapeutic services for three and four years.  I ask the witnesses to talk to me about the waiting lists now that we are well into the post-Covid period.  What is the timeline from the moment I identify a difficulty with my child to my child getting services on a regular basis?  I noted what was said about recruitment being a challenge.  How many therapists are needed?  By exactly how many are the services short and exactly how many are in the pipeline for 2023 and 2024?  I will break the questions into two.  What is the timeline for me as a parent in CDNT 3's area reaching out to the team for the first time because I need help for my child?</p></speech>

There are also prioritisation schemes, so when a referral is accepted or if new information comes in and a parent contacts the manager of the CDNT in question, certain referrals can be prioritised based on published criteria.  We have prioritisation policies.  If a child is in desperate need and let us say his or her school placement or even home placement may be at risk, there is a mechanism for filtering that case through a prioritisation scheme.</p></speech>

My goal is that we would recruit for all of those.  In reality, all I can tell the Deputy is what we are doing to address it.  It is primarily through two avenues.  First, we have recently gone out to all of the staff on the panels.  These are all of this year&rsquo;s graduates who are still in the process of varying stages of recruitment within the HSE system.  We provided them with information on what working in a children&rsquo;s disability network team, CDNT, is like.  We created a phone line for people to phone us so we can put them in contact with people to talk about the pros and cons of working in CDNTs.  A previous committee member referenced that it is not always attractive.  We think there are many things that can make it attractive for people and we are trying to convey that information.</p> <p>  The second thing we are doing is an ongoing international recruitment campaign.  The children&rsquo;s disability services is one of the priority areas within that.  We are working with colleagues to address issues, including, for example, the registration of those staff.  We can recruit people internationally.  In order for them to meet the CORU requirements, they need supervised placements.  We are working with colleagues to put in place mechanisms to support that.</p></speech>

I would rather the HSE got 200 of them than two.  I would rather that it got 40 of them than four.  However, in any process, there has to be a target and an outcome.  I recognise that it is probably unrealistic to hire 836 people next year.  However, I would like to know what the management target is.  If the HSE does recruitment and has its own paid HR functions, they can surely set a target for what they think they can deliver.  If there are international recruitment consultants involved on the other side, they can surely set a target.  There must be a target.  This is a management process as much as anything else.  What is the realistic target?</p></speech>

When we engage with staff on panels or through recruitment, they often have choices about where they go.  They are often electing to go to a service area that interests them or one that they want to pursue as a career option that suits them geographically or whatever.  In that sense, our experience has been that in any kind of a decent year we can recruit perhaps somewhere in the region of 150 to 200 staff.  However, that is assuming that those candidates, in the face of so many choices that they have, take the choice of working in children&rsquo;s services.

As was said earlier on, in some ways I am probably more confused than I was when I came in.  This probably reflects the frustration and confusion felt by these children and their families.  I do not think that after this meeting, they will feel there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Deputy Carroll MacNeill got to the crux of it, namely, staffing levels.  If we do not have the staffing levels, we do not have the access.  A parent who wants to get his or her child assessed and then referred to therapies and for other things he or she needs because of the effects of the disability, such as nappies and shoes, is looking at anything from 18 to 24 months.  It has not really changed.</p> <p>  When I was elected in 2011, one of the first issues raised with me involved the CHOs.  I would have referred to CHO 7 a lot.  This involved phenomenal early intervention waiting lists that children outgrew.  Many children were involved with St. John of God and other services.  The CDNTs were supposed to be the start of a change in how children were assessed and parents supported.  There was a lacuna for about three months for a lot of parents between the time when they lost their services at St. John of God, or whatever service provider they were with, and the time when they began to deal with the CDNTs.  Many parents reported to me and other Deputies that they did not find those initial CDNT assessments very helpful.  They were being referred to family supports, family forums and parents' support, all involving what parents can do to assist their children, rather than getting the direct service they needed such as speech and language therapy.</p> <p>  Professor MacLachlan said that the WHO has referred to it as a model that other countries should use.  Unless we have the staffing levels, we will not be able to resolve this issue in the CDNTs, in the community or in the schools.  There have been issues with therapists for the past 12 years.  I heard the witnesses say the HSE has an international recruitment campaign but I have seen recruitment campaigns for mental health nurses and nurses in general for the state of Victoria in Australia all around the city.  The whole world seems to be scrapping over staff to fill vacancies in these areas.  I am at a loss and perhaps the witnesses can direct me.  Why can we not have a drive in areas such as this?  I know therapists have a right to go wherever they choose after graduating but we must target these services and open up graduate courses so more people can go into these services.  We also need to keep them in the country through efforts in areas like wages and conditions.  I know that is not the witnesses' duty but there needs to be concentration on getting graduates into these services.  I do not want to sound very pessimistic but we are talking about funding for 830 to 850 vacancies yet we are talking about only being able to recruit 100 or 150 people for CDNTs.  In addition, there is pressure on other areas looking for the same therapists.  Do the witnesses think we should have a plan with targets and a focus on retention in respect of these services?  For families facing the prospect of waiting for 18 to 24 months, it is not a good place to be from the point of view of the children's supports.  </p></speech>

We are working with our HR colleagues at the moment to progress a dedicated recruitment campaign for children's services.  That includes the points I was making earlier on the work with current panels, graduates and the international campaign and we have other measures that we are putting in place to incentivise staff to come and work in the children's services.  It is a priority area for the HSE to focus on.</p> <p>  A difficulty we have, and it is almost the perfect storm, is that there has been significant investment in the HSE in recent years and many aspects of service have been going to the same pool to draw on a similar profile of staff.  The system is not producing enough of the types of staff that we need.  Professor MacLachlan will have some direct experience of this.  We need to be producing more graduates in Ireland to meet our need.  We need more speech and language therapists and so on.  We need more programmes that allow people who have a primary degree in another area to do a short conversion programme that allows them to move into a therapy role and so on.  There is a range of measures that the college systems need to develop to meet the needs of the State.  Moreover, these are needs that are going to increase.  The capacity review report of disability services has a projection of what is needed over a decade.  If the level of funding identified in the capacity review report were to come over the next decade, we have an indication of the type of staffing that we need.  We need the system to produce those staff.  </p> <p> I am in no doubt of the commitment among my colleagues in the HSE, including in HR, that recruitment into the children's network teams is absolutely a priority area and one that we are working to encourage people to go to work in.  However, I say that while needing to acknowledge that we continue to compete with some other service areas that are also in urgent need of a similar profile of staff. </p> <p>  Will Professor MacLachlan comment on colleges? </p></speech>

It is important to say that there definitely is light but the tunnel is way longer than we would like it to be.  I do not think she is at all confused about things.  She articulated how many interdependencies need to be addressed.  Unfortunately, it not one quick fix that will get us to where we want to be in a couple of years' time.  It will take longer than that.  Overall, at HSE level there is an initiative to look at third level and design new approaches to health sector training.  Specifically in the disability sector, for over a year the clinical programme has been advocating that there would be a particular initiative around health and social care professions, as Mr. O'Regan mentioned.  For instance, you can have graduate entry into occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  People can graduate fully in a two-year span on a graduate-entry masters degree.  That is a very short feed-in time in health.  Even investing in those professions would make a significant difference, as well as the other health and social care professions.  Importantly, when I was trained as a clinical psychologist I was trained to work almost independently whereas now we want people to come out ready to work in an interdisciplinary way, for instance, to work on children's disability network teams.  There needs to be a very specific initiative around disability.  We have been advocating for that in the HSE's overall approach to third level to make sure that there is a strong voice around disability.  It is crucial that we put out the message that there is a bright light at the end of the tunnel because if we talk down disability, it will become less attractive for people to come in here.  While we can in no way run away from the huge challenges we have, we need to create a virtuous circle that will attract more people to train and work in this area.</p></speech>

I would preface any observations by saying that it is in no way to be critical of front-line staff in particular.  Like most of us do at constituency level, I have engaged with those people and we realise that they are understaffed and overworked.  Some would complain about the contractual situation they are in and others might have issues with the lack of progression in their own teams.  I am fully aware of that, as are the majority of us here.  My first question is on PDS, which is probably the most contentious issue up for debate.  A simple question: is it working?

The reasons for it not working are some of the issues that we have been discussing, such as staff availability, supervision, career pathways.  All those things become factors.  We also have experience of the service working well for some children and families but it is not working for everybody.</p></speech>

They are not coming saying the HSE is great or that the service they are getting is great.  They are normally coming with an issue.  But at a grassroots level, the majority of interactions we have are very critical of the PDS.  I had a meeting with Mr. O'Regan and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, some months ago where a commitment was given for the reinstatement of CDNTs into the 12 special schools in Cork.  Can we have an update of where that it at?</p></speech>

I think that is into a total of 104 special schools which will benefit.  That is happening in three tranches.  In the first tranche, we agreed that some staff would have that work prioritised as part of their work and that a third of the staff would be arranged that way, that a third of the staff would be recruited off panels and a third of the staff through the general recruitment.  There was progress in September.  About half of what we had hoped to do in September was progressed.  We are currently involved with discussion around some issues with unions under the auspices of the WRC which need to progress and we hope to progress in the coming weeks in order to move on with the rest of it.  But there are some industrial relations issues that we need to resolve.</p></speech>

She is now living independently with the help of two other charities in Cork with which she has engaged.  Those charities receive minimal Government funding.  They receive very little <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>what this provider is receiving, albeit for this one individual, who is one of many.  Mr. Higgins talked earlier about how we are trying to switch from a clinical model to a community and social model.  I mentioned the Rainbow Club during the suspension, and its representatives appeared before the committee a couple of weeks ago to talk about how that model is working.  It is already there, and although it might not be perfect, it can be tweaked.  People are voting with their feet, whether we like it or not.  More than 1,100 people are now engaged with that service in Cork.  Community models such as that are far more efficient than the majority of service providers, at least in Cork, in my experience.  That model needs to be looked at, replicated and perhaps tweaked and tailored to meet local needs.  How progressed is that model?  Are we talking months or years?  Mr. Higgins might comment on that.</p></speech>

The progression of the social model is across everything we are trying to do.  We are moving in various components and personalised budgets are one component of that, as are the CDNTs.  The totality will be a more community-based model but we are progressing various components of that.  Within autism, as part of the awareness working group from the programme improvement piece, we are trying to ascertain all those section 38 and section 39 non-profits that support people with autism, to gauge that and then to make it publicly available.  The pathway is a critical component, but there is the supportive piece whereby we can identify for individuals, in a way that will be publicly available, where the services that are closest to them are.  It will also allow us to identify where those closest partners in the delivery are.</p></speech>

We are in the midst of a fairly significant transformation of how disability services are provided and organised in Ireland.  There is a really good suite of policy to underpin the direction of travel throughout children's services, adult services, day services and so on, although there are probably some areas on which we need some further work from a policy perspective.  The transfer of functions, taking disability services out of the Department of Health and moving them into the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, creates the potential for a whole-of-government approach to supports for disabled people, including children and adults who are autistic.  That is important because, at the moment, the HSE is looked at to be the provider of a lot of services that would be better provided elsewhere.  We provide transport services but we are not the Department of Transport, and we provide housing but we are not the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  A system can be expected to provide only so much and that can be stretched, but we now have an opportunity now to ask whether it would be better to have a whole-of-government approach and a whole-Department approach working collaboratively in the best interests of disabled people, older people or whomever we are focusing on.  That potential is certainly there and those kinds of things are critical in the type of reform and shifts that are needed in order that we will realise the potential of the convention and provide a community and collaborative model of supports that is not just reliant on conventional service delivery systems.</p></speech>

We discussed similar issues then.  Unfortunately, I have not heard anything different today.  The issue of the CDNTs is raised with me continuously.  Is there someone in the HSE who leads on the progressing disability services programme?  None of our guests has that specific role in his or her title.  Does it not warrant something like that?</p> <p>  What measures are being taken to address the shortage of staff?  Our guests rightly mentioned an average shortage of 28%.  They stated that career progression within disability services is an obstacle.  The HSE has implemented the interim recommendation of the career pathway in primary care only.  Why has it not been introduced into disability services?  What other incentives to work in disability are being offered?  I understand that nurses, for example, are incentivised to work in ICUs and are given an additional payment for doing so.  Could something like that be looked at?</p> <p>  Turning to the inclusion of certain therapists on the critical skills list, I understand the HSE has let many staff into the system.  Our guests referred to a shortage of graduates within the various disciplines, and I presume they have informed the Departments of Education and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  In a response to a recent parliamentary question, I was told by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science that 15 additional graduate places were being made available in physiotherapy.  I hope I did not get the full answer and that that is not the sum total of the additional places being created.</p> <p>  Section 39 organisations provide services on the HSE's behalf.  There is a discrepancy in regard to pay and conditions.  Until that is addressed, we are going to continue to lose staff from section 39 organisation to other organisations.  I acknowledge that this might not be our guests' responsibility, but if the HSE is contracting these organisations, there has to be a level playing field if they are to work for children.  On the issue of putting services back into schools, there is a problem there because the therapists are being taken back into the CDNTs, which are already under-resourced.  I do not know how that is going to work.</p> <p>  On assessments of need, a High Court ruling in March found that the preliminary team assessment was not compliant with the Disability Act.  Has new guidance on assessment been circulated to the CDNTs since that?  Just yesterday, the parent of a five-year-old son who is non-verbal came to see me.  He had received an assessment in February and it was deemed to be compliant by the assessment of needs officer but, obviously, that has since changed.  I had a quick read of the assessment and it recommended that he be given a full autism assessment.  I do not think the original preliminary team assessments were addressing the backlog; rather, they were putting people onto more lists to get a proper assessment for autism or to access services, which they have not been able to access, given most people are coming to me telling me there is a two- to four-year waiting list.  If new guidance has issued, what timeframe are looking at to clear those lists?</p> <p>  Professor MacLachlan stated that a diagnosis to access education is not required but, unfortunately, because there are not enough special school settings, schools are insisting on the diagnosis because they want to prioritise those most in need.  Having a diagnosis also provides vital information to schools to help that child.</p><p>From being a teacher and a special educational needs, SEN, co-ordinator in the school, I know that getting information from the then child development team was vital.  It was so good, even in small recommendations on how to assist a child with autism to adapt to a new environment.  It made a considerable difference.  If the CDNTs are working with children and providing input to schools, that is important.</p><p> I have another case where a child who has been diagnosed with ASD and a mild learning difficulty also has a different, quite rare disease.  The two are not connected.  The child requires intense physiotherapy for the other disease.  They have been told that, in being able to access physiotherapy, the child should go on to primary care, but the child would then lose the supports of the CDNT for autism.  Can the two services not work together?  I was told by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, that the CDNTs and child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, would start working together better.  I am sure the whole lot, primary care included, should be working together.</p><p> I have a number of other questions but I will leave them for the moment.  I will leave the officials to address those first.</p></speech>

In terms of the current structure of the leadership around the CDNTs, I am the head of operations.  In that sense, the implementation of the policy is within my remit.  I have a small team of people who support me in that.  We are currently looking at the structure around it and I do not know what the outcome of that will be.  I am very aware of the point implicit in the Deputy's question in terms of the importance of having someone dedicated there.  That is something that I am looking at.</p> <p>  In terms of the impact of the critical skills list, I will follow-up on that with HR colleagues and come back to the Deputy.  I do not have an answer to be able to specify the benefit but I will come back on that to the Deputy.</p> <p>  In relation to section 39 pay, that is an issue, not only in relation to our children services but across other service areas as well.  It is something that has been raised with Government.  The Deputy is correct that it is not something that is within our gift in the HSE to be able to resolve, but certainly it is something the impact of which we experience in terms of engaging with organisations that are really challenged in terms of their staffing.  In different parts of the country, that is having a significant impact.  It is certainly part of the suite of answers or solutions that need to be addressed.</p> <p>  In terms of the options and incentives for staff, we have a number of measures we are finalising with HR both to recruit and retain staff.  We have invested, for example, and communicated in recent weeks a very significant commitment to staff training.  We are looking at sponsorship.  We are looking at different types of contractual arrangements that might allow some flexibility for people.  My HR colleagues might be raising concerns about some of these.  For example, we want to explore the option of somebody coming to work for four years but spreading his or her salary over five years so that he or she has an option of travel.  It costs the HSE four years' worth of salary for four years' worth of work but it gives somebody options in terms of, maybe, travelling with some income and the job security of having a post to come back to.  We are exploring all of those kinds of opportunities and incentives, particularly mindful of a young cohort of people who would be interested in those kinds of things.  It is not only a pipeline issue.  There are other things we are also looking to do.</p> <p>  In terms of the AON guidance, perhaps Professor MacLachlan would like to comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Malcolm MacLachlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022101800002#P00300"><p>In terms of leadership, I am the clinical lead in disability and I guess I am the person responsible in terms of designing clinical programmes.</p> <p>  On what Deputy Tully said about section 39 organisations, I could not agree more.  In fact, I raised this at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  That is something the Joint Committee on Disability Matters could look at because it relates to public sector employment agreements.</p> <p>  In terms of the assessment of needs, that guidance has been developed and signed off by the highest level clinical committee within the HSE.  We are obliged to go through the WRC process where we consult unions and make sure they are okay with it.  It is hoped that will be complete within the next few weeks.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the previous standard operating procedure.  We previously presented evidence that 84% of people who went through the preliminary routine assessment received some sort of intervention.  Some of them needed further assessment as well.  Essentially, that is gone now anyway because Ms Justice Siobh&aacute;n Phelan found it was not compliant with the Act.</p> <p>  In terms of what the Deputy says about diagnosis, we are not in any way against the diagnosis.  What we are saying is that it is not sufficient to identify a person's needs.  For example, in the UK, every year there are 5,000 people who are classified as SWAN, where SWAN stands for syndrome without a name.  If one was to require everyone to have a diagnosis to have access to services, those children would never have access to services.  More importantly, as the recent literature review I cited emphasises, sometimes an overemphasis on diagnosis can detract from the need to address people's needs and can sometimes misalign resources to diagnostic categories rather than to particular needs of children.  However, that is not in any way undermining the importance of diagnosis, both in terms of authenticating people's experience or giving them a sense of identity around their difficulties.</p></speech>

It is not what the design has intended to happen.  It should be the case that those services, whether it is CDNT and CAMHS, CDNT and primary care, combinations of all three or whatever, should be able to work together in support of a child.  Children should not be experiencing the risk of being discharged from one because one is accessing the other.  It should be seamless.</p></speech>

I merely seek clarification of a standardisation across services.  It would make more sense for the support worker to be able to take the child out.</p> <p>  In relation to adult services, I had two parents of autistic adults who have associated mental health issues.  They have both been placed in different residential settings but they are not receiving any supports there.  They are being heavily medicated and it is not addressing their needs at all.  I have written to the Minister and to the HSE but I am not getting any responses.  One young man has been hospitalised three times since January.  On the most recent occasion, which was only in recent weeks, the pharmacist in the hospital reviewing his medication identified two medications that should not be combined and that had been prescribed by the psychiatrist attached to the residential setting.  It is not a HSE setting but he is being paid for by the HSE to go there.  It is a considerable amount of money.  His mother is extremely worried about him.  He is very ill and it could have been much worse if the pharmacist had not identified this.  I merely highlight that residential services should include supports for persons with autism.</p><p>Many of them maybe would not have mental health issues if they got the proper supports and, if possible, in the community rather than in residential settings.</p></speech>

Obviously, I do not know the specifics of the case the Deputy has identified.  If she wants to have a conversation with me after the meeting to follow up on that with her, I am happy to do so.  In general, however, residential services are covered by regulation and are inspected by HIQA.  There are requirements that those in residential services have access to appropriate multidisciplinary supports.  In a way, therefore, there is a legal structure in place to help to drive something.  There may be challenges in respect of availability, but I know that many providers of residential services try to source appropriate supports depending on the profile of the people in their services.  However, it should never be the case that somebody is on medications outside of proper supervision and review of those medications.  Also, the use of medication as an alternative to appropriate services is not acceptable anywhere.  I would be happy to follow up on that matter.</p> <p>  The definitions of home support - and this overlaps a little with definitions of PA services - are something we are working on.  We will convene a group to bring some clarity of definition and consistency in respect of accessing services because we are very aware of the type of issue Deputy Tully raises.  Part of our national service plan commitment for this year is to progress that.</p></speech>

Currently, if someone develops a severe mental health condition or, often, a moderate one, he or she needs to be referred out of services if he or she wants to receive medication.  We are trying to promote a model whereby there would be in-reach, for instance, by psychiatrists into a children's disability network team or an adult disability team.  The reason that is particularly important for people with autism is that sometimes they will have taken longer to build up familiarity and trust with the support team.  Members can imagine that if someone develops mental health problems, perhaps because of the frustrations of living with autism, and is then referred out of a team, it can often make his or her mental health condition much worse.  Furthermore, the teams to which people are referred are often not well resourced.  This also puts psychiatrists in very difficult circumstances in that they may often feel that the best intervention for someone with a severe mental health problem is not necessarily medication, but within their own teams they do not have other health and social care professionals.  I know for a fact that many psychiatrists are very concerned that they are having to prescribe medications in lieu of alternatives.  To me, this highlights the importance of having a model whereby we would have in-reach from psychiatry where medication is potentially beneficial.  That is probably, in my view, in the minority of cases, but it would be great if the committee could highlight that because we have a lot of service user participation in the service improvement programme for people with autism.  Within the protocol - and I have already described the independent evaluation for that - the consistent issue that is raised is the mental health of people with autism.</p></speech>

I am no different from any other Deputy in that I am also inundated with cases relating to parents of children who cannot access or have difficulties accessing necessary services.  I have probably got a greater number of contacts in that regard on the basis that my son is autistic.  The witnesses have dealt with the biggest problem, that is, the fact that when it comes to speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, OTs and psychologists, we have nothing but vacancies.  I met representatives of CHO 8.  They spoke about localised recruitment operations they have put in place that have been somewhat successful but are limited.  They basically said, similar to the witnesses, that they do not foresee the international recruitment drive being as successful as it needs to be.  Then they spoke about the wider issue of workforce planning, which does not relate to them.  They have seen no sign that there will be sufficient throughput.  Whatever about the short term, in four years' time we will not have enough of these positions.  We know there are issues with conditions and so on.  They spoke about the difficulties with CORU.  In the part of the world I am from, a great many people have been trained in the North.  There have been problems there.  The head of disability services said that until we can deal with these capacity issues, we will not be able to offer the service.  There were wider questions brought up about AON.</p> <p>  What can we do?  I know that this may be a restatement of some of what has been said, but what can be done to get the best-case scenario in the short term?  What needs to be done?  What is hampering doing it now?  Then, in the longer term, what conversations have the witnesses had with the Minister, Deputy Harris, or whoever else from the point of view of ensuring we have enough delivery?</p></speech>

Obviously, we have raised this with the Department of Health, which is the Department through which we are currently resourced, and have engaged with officials there and with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on what the need is.  In respect of those discussions, for example, I sat on a working group which is progressing the disability action plan in the context of the capacity review report.  One of the pieces of work there has been engagement between the HSE and the Department of Health and then between that Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on building capacity in the system and the throughput and being able to signal the current and, more importantly, future needs.  In fairness to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, there is no point in talking to it about what the need is today.  It does not have the answer either but it does have the potential to play an important role in respect of future capacity and need and I think-----</p></speech>

One of the challenges in children's disability services is that due to the low levels of staffing within some teams, they are, perversely, not in a position to supervise students because they do not have the bandwidth.

In fairness to the colleagues I work with, people are working very hard to imagine differently, to explore all opportunities and to see what is there in terms of potential.

That is where I was going next.  In fairness, they stated that the assessment of need, as Mr. O'Regan said, is sometimes seen as a panacea whereas it is the same people who provide therapies.  They cannot provide therapies when they are doing other work.  The option of getting private diagnoses and whatever else was open for parents who could afford it, or were facilitated to do so.  As has been said, everyone is being sent in the direction of an assessment of need.  Schools need it in order for them to get the necessary services for a child and parents are being told it is the only way to go.  We will always end up in circumstances whereby services will never be fit to deliver things despite constantly being taken to court.  I get that.  Given the constraints we have, what circumstances, situation or system would actually work in the short and long terms?  The current system is obviously not working for anyone.</p></speech>

Other colleagues might want to come in as well.  We have a Disability Act which confers the right to an assessment, but does not confer any rights to access services.

The preliminary team assessment, PTA, model was used in an assessment of need.  In the documentation, Mr. O'Regan provided a table that shows a reduction in the number of assessments on the waiting list until this year, when we were no longer allowed to use the model.  The numbers increased.</p></speech>

I predict that will increase exponentially.  The new guidance is yet to get traction because of the WRC process.  That is also a tiered approach, but it is not as restrictive as the PTA model.  We believe it will be much more acceptable to clinicians.  The tiered approach means that if we can assess someone relatively quickly, we do not waste clinical time.</p></speech>

Within the new guidance, it could still take 37 hours or more.  That had become the norm.  If somebody is assessed with speech and language difficulties, he or she may need to assessed by a speech and language therapist but not somebody else.</p></speech>

There is a logic to that.  Once the person could access services, I do not think we would hear from him or her again.</p></speech>

In many cases, more than one therapist will need to be involved in an assessment and it will take longer than that.  Where cases have presentations that are relatively less complex, it allows provision to have much shorter assessment.  The idea of universal targeted and specific interventions is that for some people it is sufficient to have universal interventions.  Where that is not sufficient, there are more time-consuming interventions from the point of view of the service.  The tiered approach means trying to get the most out of an insufficient resource.</p></speech>

We need a tiered approach.  Not every child needs 37 hours of assessment.  It helps us to get the most of out of a stressed system, but it is also the way we should be doing business.  We are piloting the tiered approach to ASD assessment in our area and getting good results.  We are only starting off in our implementation.  It is early days and we need more data, but the experience of doing it has been positive because we are using intervention as a form of assessment.  We are getting back to intervention first and using the information from that as a source of observation and diagnosis in some cases.  We have been surprised by how effective that has been in certain cases.  It is not for every child - some children need a more complex tier of assessment.  That is the direction in which we need to be going.  In terms of assessment of need, there is a legislative obligation that we cannot get out of, but if we are giving interventions within six months the number of assessment of need referrals drops off.</p><p>If we are using this tiered approach to get back to intervention first, based on obvious need rather than cumbersome assessment, we will be putting our resources in the right direction and clients will benefit.</p></speech>

As I said at a meeting with representatives of CHO 8 on Friday last, staffing levels within the children's disability network teams, CDNTs, are a disgrace.  We have heard evidence from families of having to pay up to &euro;1,800 for private assessments.  We have also heard stories of people getting assessments that are not being recognised.  It is not acceptable, to be quite honest.</p><p>I like the tiered model.  That is the way forward.  Having listened to the explanation of that model today, I have a better understanding of it and I believe it is the way to go.  There will be two more pilot areas, following on from the two that have already been done.  What CHO areas will those pilots take place in?  I will talk about my experience with the CDNT in Longford.  Last April we met the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte because there were more than 230 children waiting for an assessment of needs and more than 700 waiting for services.  Our team is now worse than it was at that time.  During the summer we had 3.8 whole time equivalents on the team.  There was no social worker, 0.8 in physiotherapy, 0.5 in speech and language therapy, one in occupational therapy and things were just getting worse.  </p><p>A number of members have raised the issue of third level education.  Who is responsible within the HSE for liaising with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science?  Whoever that is has not done his or her job because there is not a sufficient number of graduates coming through the third level system.  There are four colleges that run occupational therapy courses in the country, with around 90 professionals graduating every year.  Statisticians could figure out the number of those graduates that will go into the public system and the number that will go travelling, based on available data.  Somebody has not done his or her job.  The HSE has not engaged with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science across all of the services, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  The therapists are not there so somebody has failed.  Families and children have been failed because this work has not been done.  We have more than 700 vacancies because we do not have enough qualified people coming through the system.  As Deputy Casey said earlier, we should know the numbers and percentages.  We should know how many children are going to need services and we should have front-loaded courses at third level in order to have graduates coming through.  Whoever is responsible for that within the HSE has failed and that is why we are in this situation.</p><p>Reference was made to the Disability Act.  What engagement has the HSE had with the Government with regard to changing that legislation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>assessments and services?  This issue was highlighted a number of times today.  What engagement has taken place and is there resistance to making amendments to the Disability Act?  Reference was also made earlier to family engagement and I have read about autism support workers.  In my experience, it is the professionals who do the family engagement but while that is happening, services are not being provided for children.  The family engagement should be undertaken by non-professionals or by autism support workers.  They should be giving courses to parents.  I have seen that in my own local area, with professionals giving courses even though we have a massive shortage of such professionals and ultimately it results in fewer services being provided to children.</p><p>I invite our guests to comment further on the school inclusion model, which I believe is the way forward but I am a bit worried that there will be no HSE involvement in it.  Do I sense a conflict with regard to the school inclusion model?  As Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, taking children out of a setting in which they are comfortable, namely their school, and bringing them into a clinical setting, with parents having to take time off work, is not ideal.  I have seen the centre in my own local area and I made complaints about it when I first went into it.  It was not even properly painted and was not an appropriate setting for children.  The model involving the school, where they are comfortable, is better.  We have met the teachers' unions recently and discussed the fact that we need to change the training for teachers to enable them to work with children with autism.  We should also be training the SNAs to provide some elements of therapy on a daily basis but that must be backed up by professionals coming into the schools regularly.</p><p>Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan raised the issue of professionals in special schools.  Reference was made to 104 out of 136 special schools.  Why were only 104 schools picked, and not the full 136?  Is that a manpower issue?  There are lots of questions there and I invite Mr. O'Regan to respond.</p></speech>

Please remind me if I miss anything.  Workforce planning is led by our human resources, HR, section but none of us here works in that area.  In fairness, what I would suggest is that HR would send a note to the committee.  As far as I know, they have made representations, although they may not be adequate.  Given that they are not here, I will ask that they send a briefing note to the committee on what has been done.  In that way the committee will at least be aware of what steps have been taken.</p> <p>  We have raised the issue of the Disability Act at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth previously.  The feedback we have received is that any review of that Act where the perception would be that it is being driven by an attempt by the HSE to wriggle out of its current legal responsibilities would be very challenging and contentious.  In fairness to ourselves, that is not what we are suggesting.  What we are suggesting is an enhancement of the Act so that it incorporates a right to services as well as a right to assessment and that will not make it easier for us.  In terms of the kinds of issues that we are already facing, having a legal requirement around them does not make it any easier to implement than where we are at today but it does equalise the importance of intervention and the assessment.  </p> <p>  The school inclusion model, on which Ms O'Kelly might want to comment further, was designed to focus on supporting a child to be able to access the curriculum.  That was its primary focus.  In some respects, it had quite a narrow orientation but we know that many children that we support have needs that go beyond, but also include, accessing the curriculum.  It is not the case that there is any tension between us or a row going on.  Rather, there is a debate to be had about the right direction in which to go.</p><p>Our view is having a model that takes account the child in all its environments is important and that includes access to the curriculum.  That does not take away from the potential for staff to work in special schools.  The 104 schools versus 136 is purely a function of an agreement with Government to address the change that those schools that had access to a service prior to reconfiguration would be addressed first.  I expect that at some point in time, Government will engage on the other schools.  To be honest, adding more today will not make it deliver any faster than we are able to go at the moment but the 104 is directly related to the schools that had access to services being delivered in the school prior to reconfiguration.  It was purely a function of that.  Again, I need to highlight that even since then the increased number of special classes and the number of children who are also accessing mainstream school has also continued to grow, even in the past number of years, and they are not included in that figure either.</p><p> I have probably missed some questions and I am sorry.</p></speech>

The Department of Education and the NCSE could answer this much better but a fundamental piece is their client in all this is the school and the school inclusion model.  The service user or client is the child and the family for the clinicians.  I agree with the Chairman that there should not be silos and separate streams.  We need an integrated programme for children, if you like, be that across services within the HSE and interagency ones between the Departments of Education and Health.  There is a universal level the school inclusion model looked at for building the capacity of teachers.  That could fit so well within the NCSE.  It has huge resources on CPD and education for our staff and for teachers.  If you thought of a child, you would think of bundles of care, so it is absolutely about inclusion in school and education, self-care in the home environment and building the capacity to be able to participate in their local community and transition.  Transitioning is huge for children.  Let us think of the move from the junior phase in senior infants up into first class, from fifth to sixth class and then from sixth class to first year and doing that work.  That is where bundles of care in the form of CDNTs providing transitional work come in. They assist with summer programmes for children to help them transition.  Reaching into the school with those bundles provides a much more enhanced experience for the child.  Does that make sense?</p></speech>

I wrote down a question I was going to ask on the summer programme.  It is an issue we put quite a strong focus on as a committee because of the lack of schools, especially special schools, providing the programme.  In some of our discussions we have spoken about an occupational therapy programme and therapists going in, or perhaps third- or fourth-year students in the colleges being employed for the summer to build up that relationship.  They would get experience of working in the summer programme and give extra services to kids and families when they need it.  What is Ms O'Kelly's view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.229" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022101800002#T00400"><p>From our experience on the school inclusion model, we felt therapists working on the model and in the schools could add value along the way.  Many of our services in primary care and in the disability sector such as the CDNTs provide these summer camps.  One of our big pieces was the hope the therapists who were employed on the school inclusion model would do the thing and work with their primary care and CDNT colleagues, so again to build that integration and robustness around the child.  Then knowledge is being brought to wherever the child is transitioning to next because that leap into secondary school and the leap into the senior cycle is so enormous for children.  I certainly am an advocate of that.  Various agencies have tried it.  The Central Remedial Clinic used to run summer camps.  The HSE, as I said, runs summer camps.  That is what we call them because it is normalised.  Kids are used to going to summer camp but it helps with the continuity.</p></speech>

The Chairman asked which CHOs were involved in the next phase.  Ms O'Kelly's organisation, CHO 7, is one of them and we are just finalising arrangements with CHO 4.</p> <p>  I agree with everything Mr. O'Regan said regarding the Disability Act.  It is also important to point out the Ombudsman has called for revision of the Act, as has the Disability Federation of Ireland.  The basic issue is it does not work for people with disabilities.  It was enacted in 2005, which means it was developed several years before then and, of course, the most significant legislation, that is, the UNCRPD, came into effect in 2006.  The Act predates that and in 2018 Ireland ratified the UNCRPD, which means we are obliged by international law to abide by it and the Disability Act does not allow us to.  It certainly is not a matter of the HSE running away from things, rather we it to be aligned to allow us to better deliver on services.  One of the ways of doing that is to ensure when we are revising the EPSEN Act, we are also revising an interlocking Act because especially around assessment of needs there are obligations from health services and education services and that has not been working.  This is a real opportunity to try to make it work.</p> <p>  On training, one of the things we have previously advocated for, especially with some of the new technological universities that have not been doing professional training in health and social professions, is that there be some exciting opportunities to establish new courses where people could all train together in an interdisciplinary way.  They could be located in geographical areas where it is perhaps more difficult to retain staff, because all the research evidence shows that when people are trained in particular locations, especially rural areas, they are much more likely to stay in those areas.</p></speech>

Maybe an autism support worker could give those family courses rather than the professionals because we are stretched already.  That needs to be examined.  There is one minute left for the Deputy.</p></speech>

On some level we need something universal across all Departments so we can facilitate children and citizens as they operate in society like the rest of us and not as a failing.  Some of the difficulties with the school inclusion model have been thrown up by everybody.  Training for teachers is absolutely necessary but there needs to a particular emphasis on resource teachers and even beyond that, SNAs.  I know from my own experience that probably made up for an awful lot of services that did not necessary happen for our Turlough and I put that on record.</p> <p>  It was said earlier that everyone should work together, such as the CDNTs, the CAMHS and so on.  I have an issue with a young girl being referred by the CDNT into the CAMHS for anxiety and probably issues stemming from Covid, which exacerbated things.  The response was the service does not deal with kids that are autistic.  That is a situation we need to deal with.  I get that these services are under pressure and to a degree they are probably playing a game of ping-pong but it is not good enough.  It needs to be dealt with.</p> <p>  Then there are the adult services.</p></speech>

I am dealing with a case of a family where the father and mother are under pressure.  The fellow was on a social welfare payment, but had let it lapse.  We got that sorted.  He also dropped out of college.  I get the great work that is being done by PAs, and there is another issue there with resourcing PAs in third level.  However, I am speaking about the need to provide supports for adult services.  In some cases we are not talking about huge supports, just a little bit that can help facilitate users.   That needs to be done.  That was probably longer than a minute.</p></speech>

That might help us to get to the crux of the matter.  Many of us are aware of issues with staffing levels.  Perhaps we can arrange that meeting at a later date.

That is a given in terms of the direction of travel and our vision.  I am working with my counterparts in primary care and mental health.  We are working together to try to put those pathways in place.  Dr. Connon mentioned initiatives such as the national access policy and so on.  They are part of the infrastructure to help drive that.  We want to get to the place where there is a seamless experience for service users.  We are aware of examples where supports are required, for example, for people going to college.  It has happened in some cases and not others.  There is that inconsistency.  There is also a role for some of the supports that are provided through the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science as well, which can be part of it.  The Deputy is right that sometimes a very small support can be hugely enabling for a person who is moving into third level education, or who just needs a bit of support to be able to remain there and get a degree.  It is a priority for those people.</p></speech>

This area is an absolute priority for us.  It is complex because of the range of issues.  There is not any one solution, and we need to work on a number of different fronts.  I want to assure the committee, and by extension, the parents, children and adults who want access to better services, that that is what we are working to provide.  We are working to be able to provide that support and to do so on a sustainable basis.  We regret that it has taken so long.  We are bringing as much urgency as we can to this, and we will continue to do so.  We will work to improve things so that the experience is a positive one, and to ensure that the children and those who are now adults can have a life that is meaningful and fulfilling, and can pursue the things that are important to them.</p></speech>

I am seeking the approval of the committee for the Supplementary Estimate allocating a total of &euro;1.362 billion to provide the necessary additional funding of &euro;1.212 billion to subhead B11, electricity credit, and &euro;150 million to subhead B13, emergency generation capacity, both of which are in the energy transformation programme.  I am also requesting approval to reallocate &euro;7 million as follows: &euro;6 million for subhead A7, climate initiatives; and &euro;1 million for subhead B6, other energy programmes, national and international.</p><p>This reallocation is possible due to savings identified within the climate action and environment leadership area under subhead A4, environmental and climate research, where savings of &euro;2.5 million have been identified; subhead A5, carbon fund, where savings of &euro;3.5 million have been identified; and subhead C3, mining and petroleum services, where savings of &euro;1 million have been identified.</p><p> The Government took steps earlier this year to help alleviate the burden on households of the rapidly increasing energy costs when we provided for a credit of &euro;200, including VAT, to be applied to domestic customers' energy bills under the first electricity costs emergency benefits scheme.  However, electricity and gas prices have continued to rise due to international conditions, in particular the current challenges arising from the crisis in Ukraine, and indications are that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future.</p><p> The Government has taken action in budget 2023 to provide further assistance to those who are most vulnerable to the effects of the cost-of-living crisis.  A wide range of measures were introduced, including a &euro;600 electricity credit to be applied in three instalments between November 2022 and April 2023.  Additional social welfare payments totalling &euro;1.2 billion across a number of benefits and schemes will support in the region of 1.5 million people over the coming winter period.  Further measures introduced by the Government involved significant support for commuters and students.  The reduced public transport fares announced previously are to be extended to the end of 2023 and a number of measures have been put in place to help eligible students with academic fees.</p><p> In light of the continued increase in household energy bills, the Government has decided to support domestic customers further through a second electricity benefit scheme for this winter.  The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Act 2022 provided for the electricity credit to be made under the scheme on a once-off basis in 2022.  Therefore, new legislation was required for this scheme to be established.  The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022, which provides the legal basis for the new scheme, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas on 13 October and was signed by the President into law.  The new scheme will be closely modelled on the previous one and an electricity costs emergency benefit payment of &euro;200, including VAT, for an estimated 2.2 million domestic accounts is to be paid in each of the November-December 2022, January-February 2023 and March-April 2023 electricity billing cycles, totalling &euro;600, including VAT, per domestic electricity account.  This scheme will have a ceiling of &euro;1.211 billion and within this, a contingency has been included to ensure there is no shortfall to cover the increase in any new domestic customers during the period of the scheme.  The scheme will be operated by ESB Networks which will make payments to the individual energy supplies.  Those suppliers will, in turn, credit individual domestic electricity accounts.  The Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, will be charged with oversight of the scheme.</p><p> A further &euro;1 million will be allocated for those domestic customers whose households many not have an individual meter point reference number, MPRN.  Upon completion of the previous electricity credit scheme, the need to have an MPRN resulted in certain cohorts not being able to access the payment.  A particular cohort since identified includes some Traveller families in certain local authority accommodations where the MPRN is registered to the local authority and supplies multiple households.  Work is under way to establish an alternative mechanism to ensure the payment reaches these Traveller families.</p><p> VAT must be applied on the electricity bill balance after the credit has been applied.  On that basis, the credit of &euro;183.49 is being applied exclusive of VAT on each account.  Inclusive of VAT, the total reduction on each household electricity bill will be &euro;200.</p><p> Earlier this year, the CRU directed EirGrid, the transmission system operator, to procure some 450 MW of additional temporary generation capacity for winter 2023-24 through to winter 2025-26 to offset a potential capacity shortfall of electricity supply.  The temporary generation capacity may be extended to winter 2026-27, if necessary.  To comply with this direction, EirGrid requires financial support from the Exchequer.  Legislation to ensure EirGrid can carry out this direction, including the legal basis for my Department providing the necessary financial support, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas in July of this year and was signed into law by the President.</p><p> The level of financial support required in 2022 to allow EirGrid place orders on the electricity generation units and to ensure they are delivered and installed in time for winter 2023-24 was estimated at &euro;350 million.  As the final level of financial support required in 2022 was not known earlier this year as the contractual arrangements were still at an early stage at that time, it was agreed that approval of the allocation of funding for the emergency generation capacity would be requested in two tranches.  A previous allocation request of &euro;200 million was granted in July with the indicative funding request for the initial stages of the project, with a further request forecasted to be required in the autumn of &euro;150 million when the contractual details were close to finalisation.  These contracts are now ready to be finalised subject to final terms being agreed and the balance of funding being available.  The &euro;150 million balance of funding represents the final agreed figures required by EirGrid for the purchase of the generation equipment and balance of the plant this year.</p><p> The total cost of the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme is, as I said, estimated at &euro;1.212 billion and the balance of funding for the emergency power generation scheme is &euro;150 million.  As the additional funding of &euro;1.362 billion required is being provided from the Exchequer, the main purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to allocate &euro;1.212 billion to subhead B11 and &euro;150 million to subhead B13 in the energy transformation programme area to fund the two measures.</p><p> In addition to the approval for the Exchequer funding for the two schemes, I am also seeking approval to reallocate &euro;7 million within subheads in my Vote to provide for expenditure for a number of other measures.</p><p> Local authorities have a particularly important role in the delivery of both climate mitigation and adaptation.  This is reflected in the provisions of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act, which requires each local authority to prepare a local authority climate action plan, specifying the mitigation and the adaptation measures to be adopted by the local authority.  These plans will be updated once every five years.  The first of these plans is due to be submitted by each local authority by the end of 2023.  This funding will allow the Department to establish a governance structure with local authorities for the development and reporting of these climate actions plans.  I am seeking approval to provide funding of &euro;3.5 million in 2022 through the allocation of savings identified within the climate action and environment leadership programme area.</p><p> My Department has secured support from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, for a climate-specific round of the sound and vision scheme to address the need to fund programming specific to the climate crisis.  This programming will contribute to an important component of delivering on the national dialogue&rsquo;s objective of improving climate literacy.  Improving climate literacy will enhance the capacity of people to make small changes in their daily lives, engage with climate action at a local level in their communities and at national level in the co-design of policy.  Through the expertise of the BAI and the vision of Ireland&rsquo;s programme makers, we will ensure the delivery of a range of innovative and creative programming to bring climate awareness, literacy and empowerment into homes across the country.  To facilitate this, I am seeking approval to provide funding of &euro;2.5 million in 2022 through allocating savings identified within the climate action and environment leadership programme area.</p><p> The national energy security framework published earlier this year places a significant emphasis on the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy to underpin Ireland's security of supply.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the planning system is fully supportive of the roll-out of renewables, something first expressed in action No. 102 of the climate action plan 2021.</p><p> As part of its ongoing effort to improve the delivery of its service, An Bord Plean&aacute;la recently provided the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with a specific resource plan for the area of maritime development and climate action, including the establishment of the marine and climate directorate.  The total funding requirement for the establishment of the new functions is expected to be in the region of &euro;3.5 million and my Department is committing to provide &euro;1 million in once-off funding in 2022 to support the set-up of this function.  I am seeking approval to provide this contribution under subhead B6, other energy programmes (national and international), in 2022 through allocating savings identified in subhead C3, mining and petroleum services.</p><p> I am happy to take questions from the committee on any aspect of this Supplementary Estimate.</p></speech>

I invite members wishing to contribute to raise their hands and I will make a list.  Can we agree a time limit of five minutes of back-and-forth with the Minister?  Agreed.</p><p>We should have enough time as we are just discussing one Vote.  We will go back for second and third rounds as necessary.</p><p> I refer to the funding for local authorities and the public bodies carrying out their duties and the remit they would have.  This question could probably extend to the funding for An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well.  The local authorities, in a broad level, are responsible for a lot of climate action through transport and housing.  Decisions that local authorities take have an impact on housing and transport emissions.  However, a narrower view is to look at the operational side of a local authority.  Do the local authorities take a broader or narrower view in their climate action plans?  It is one thing for all public buildings in a local authority area to have low energy lighting, but there is a bigger impact of the local authorities in terms of climate.  That question could probably extend to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well, where the line is drawn between its operational remit and its broader remit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022101800002#C00200"><p>This payment is part of a five-year programme that will see significant ramping up, not just this first payment, but further larger payments, so that they can meet the requirements of the Act.  I have been travelling around the country as best as I can talking to different local authorities to encourage them in that work and listening to what they have to say on the resources they need.  This is a response.  I also told them that they should take broad perspective as to what their role is; it is not just about how they manage their own energy use within their buildings, fleets and so on.</p> <p>  I will give an example of wider considerations.  One of the areas where we have huge potential for decarbonisation development and improving our citizens&rsquo; lot is through the development of the likes of district heating.  It can only be the local authority, particularly through its development process, that can look to target and identify, and then facilitate, support and, in many instances, manage the roll-out of such systems.  That then can be applied across a wide variety of different areas, including transport and energy.  It can be applied not only in district heating but also in improvement of their housing stock and the provisions within the development plan around renewable power generation and grid development.  Once one starts looking at it, the list of where local authorities can and should have a key role is significant.</p> <p>  That is connected, in a sense, to the economic development role of local authorities.  This is where a new economy and opportunities will develop.  Those councils and authorities that are ahead of the curve in being part of the decarbonisation programme will see more investment, more jobs and a wider rate base.  To answer the Chair&rsquo;s question, their function should not be seen narrowly as being about the emissions that they are directly responsible for, but rather in that wider remit.</p></speech>

The amount allocated is &euro;3.5 million.  Is that across 40 local authorities for this year?  I am just wondering if enough money is being given.  They would probably come back to us.  Actually, we had them before the joint committee earlier in the year and they asked for more money.  They would ask for more money, of course.  Are we giving them enough money to develop the skills, expertise and teams to understand the broader remit that they have, as I said, as opposed to the narrow one?</p></speech>

The figure is due to be the same next year but then will ramp up.  Our role is very much in the governance of it and theirs is in the implementation.  As I said, it is due to scale up.  If it is not sufficient, we will continue to review and address that.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for coming.  I congratulate him on the measures that he brought in in the budget, which the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, confirmed will protect the estimated 29% who at risk of energy poverty.  They are very welcome.  It is over the winter period and we need to revisit some of these things.  I welcome the new measures the Minister is announcing.  will come back to them.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  In respect of the energy credit going to householders, has the Minister at this stage been able to estimate how much we might recoup from the EU measures that are now in the offing?  That is, the capping of the price of electricity for the non-gas providers and the solidarity tax on the fossil fuel, and perhaps the longer-term market reform that is coming.</p> <p>  On the emergency temporary provision, how is the state aid being structured?  Is this a price commitment in terms of supporting the price that would be paid a capital allocation?  It will be there for just four winters at most, although this sort of equipment, presumably, has a 20-year life span or something of that nature.  What happens after that?  It seems that it would be very expensive and wasteful to take it out of the Irish system.  How is that going to happen?</p> <p>  Does the Minister have line of sight on the features that stalled the last auction &ndash; things such as planning, availability of equipment and compliance with environmental requirements?  Do we have clear line of sight to the effect that none of those things will obstruct this?</p> <p>  My final questions are on the sound and vision initiative.  As the Minister knows, I am strongly advocating for a resilience campaign around our reliance on imports.  I would like to hear that is going beyond just talking about climate and looking at the practical things that can be done.</p> <p>  In the context of local authority planning, no local authority, to my knowledge, has yet put in place a public electric vehicle charger with the grant that the Government makes available to them.  I know that has been changed.  However, it suggests there is a bit of a disconnect between the emergency that people are facing and the attitude of local authorities.  Can the Minister bring a little urgency into this, along with the allocation of the extra money?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022101800002#C00600"><p>The amount of money raised from the measures that we have agreed at European Council, such as the inframarginal pricing and the solidarity contribution of fossil fuels, is hard to estimate exactly because it depends on so many different variables &ndash; the price of gas and, as a consequence, wholesale electricity prices.  The good news is that while they are still historically incredibly high prices, it is a fraction now of what the prices were two or three months ago.  The reduction is welcome, however, it still leaves us in a difficult situation.  It would also depend, to a certain extent, on the timelines that supply whether the measures are extended beyond original provisions and also the rates and levels that apply.  The European Union is recommending that it is beyond &euro;180 per MWh that inframarginal pricing would kick in and this windfall would be gained.  However, we have the capability of lowering that and that is something we are looking at.</p> <p>  Similarly, on the contribution, the European Commission is recommending 35%, or setting that as within the terms, but recognising that it could go higher.  As I said, there is work ongoing with the Department of Finance and my Department to get the details on this.  We have to have it in place before the end of the year.  We want the revenue in quickly.</p> <p>  I expect the inframarginal revenue to go towards reducing electricity bills directly.  That would be the best use of it.  The solidarity contribution may be useful in the context of wider supports.  We are looking at including business supports and so on.  As already stated, I estimate that it will be between &euro;1 billion and &euro;2 billion, but we will have more specifics on that in the coming weeks when we agree the final details, the timelines and so on.</p><p>With regard to the emergency purchasing of aeroderivative jet engines, I thank the Chair and the committee for their involvement.  The timeline and speed of progressing the legislation, along with the waiving of pre-legislative scrutiny for aspects of this, which we have had to do, has been extraordinary.  It is unfortunate and we would prefer not to be in this situation.  We are doing it to make sure that we have sufficient power supply next winter.  The provisions came from the CRU asking that EirGrid would purchase the equipment.  We are supporting that.  It is the last resort.  The timeline potentially goes to the winter of 2026-27, as I said in my opening remarks.  The expectation is that the generators deploying them would have to sell on the relevant equipment.  In my mind, we can probably recoup revenue to recover some of these costs.  We have not provided for this because it is an unknown.  I expect there will be a significant return to Revenue when that is done, and then, as the Deputy said, that equipment can then be used in a range of other operations.  My expectation and preference is that it will be used on the island of Ireland because we will need fast-reacting open-cycle distillate, gas-fired or hydrogen-fired backup generation, which is what the equipment that we will contract in the coming days or weeks will provide.  We are not providing for it in the Estimates because it is an unknown, but I expect there will be a significant return to the State at the end of this emergency process, when it is unwound.</p></speech>

The five minutes are up.  Does the Minister want to answer the other two questions briefly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022101800002#D00300"><p>Deputy Bruton's third question was about what we learned from the auction.  The main reasons were a failure for the supply company to deliver the equipment and the planning system being tight.  The main lesson that we will have to learn, which the Attorney General is applying, is a revision of the 2000 Act.  It is not fit for purpose.  It does not service the people.  It is too complicated and some of its provisions are too contradictory.  That is the first and most urgent lesson that we learned.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy regarding the sound and vision fund.  The definition of how that applies to climate and the reduction of our dependence on fossil fuels is central to our current climate difficulties.  It will be up to the BAI to judge and decide where the funding will apply.  The Deputy made comments about resilience to make us less dependent on fossil fuel imports, which is in the category of projects that we should support.</p></speech>

I have a couple of quick questions.  The first relates to an issue he touched on.  How will those without a meter point reference number, MPRN, get their electricity grant?  It seems from reading his submission that he has not quite figured out how that will be dispensed.  Will he comment on whether that will definitely go to the Traveller community, which did not get to avail of it last time, and how that will be done?  I will raise another matter again, which is a hot political topic at the moment.  How will the Minister guarantee that there are no disconnections of those with prepaid meters or those with hefty bills from district heating systems, where much higher tariffs apply?</p> <p>  The main question that I want to ask is about the emergency generation plans and the &euro;350 million that is being voted.  Some &euro;200 million has been spent and there is &euro;150 million for the autumn.  That is all done and dusted.  It is necessary, but it bothers me that there is no scrutiny of why it is necessary.  We need to revisit that.  The Minister is looking far into the future to 2026, 2027 and 2028, when we may still require this type of plant, yet the State is continuing to connect data centres to the grid when we know that they are soaking up increasingly large volumes of energy.  Should we not, at some point, stop scrambling to purchase extra equipment but instead stop the connection of extra data centres when we know that they are the cause of the increase in our energy use?  The Minister mentioned the war in Ukraine, but the data centre issue is extraneous to that and we have information from the CRU that shows our electricity demand has grown by 9% over the past five years compared with 27 EU countries, which have approximately 0% growth in their energy demand.  Ours is continually growing, which is clearly because of the growth of the data centre industry here.</p> <p>  My last question is about climate research.  Why do we have money back from climate research?  Why did we not spend the funding when we know from the biodiversity report that there is little hard evidence on the decline of many species in this country and that we should research that and spend the funding to examine how and why this is happening so that we can try to redress the problem and protect endangered species.</p></speech>

We know that it works.  Where there were anomalies or communities were left out, such as certain families within the Traveller community, we will work with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and with local authorities to make sure that they get the payment this autumn just like every other household.</p> <p>  Disconnections are a critical issue.  We recognise that it may be a difficult period for a variety of different customers, whether they are on bill pay schemes or not.  Many families with pay-as-you-go services find that it is a useful mechanism.  We should be careful not to depict all the problems as being in just one sector.  Many people with bill pay services also have difficulties and we have to protect them.  The mechanisms to help families on pay-as-you-go services first and foremost involve having a good, close relationship with the supplier and the application of the support mechanisms that it has in place to ensure that households do not have to disconnect themselves in a way that they do not want to.  CRU has developed a range of other measures, including the right to access lower tariffs.  One measure that we will look at from our energy poverty action plan, which will be published in the next few weeks, is a review of gas connections as well as electricity to see if there are measures to take there to improve people's situations, particularly the relatively small number of but still important households which have hardship meters.  How do we get better provisions for them?  We have not finished introducing measures to help those households.  We will continue to review and to make sure that the State helps them through what will be a difficult winter period.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked why we need to switch off the scheme and why we would not keep generators running in 2028 and 2029.  This is an emergency measure.  It is not the only measure in place.  We also have the T-4 and T-3 auctions.  The majority of the 2 GW of backup gas-fired power will come through those auction processes.  We need a significant investment, which we are now seeing, in battery storage and additional renewables, through the renewable energy strategy.  That is working and it is delivering.  The volume of power from renewable power generation has never been as significant as this year.  That is how we will make sure that we do it.</p> <p>  We recognise that we had a problem with having to make sure that any new data centres fit in within our energy security and climate targets.  The Government strategy set out this summer was clear that any new data centre that will be contracted has to provide flexibility and use its backup power supply to help us to stabilise and secure the grid.  We recognise that it was an issue.</p><p>We have acted to change the rules and approach the State takes to contracting new data centres.  It is not saying "No".  There will be no great increase in new data centre connections in the coming years because we are in such a tight situation but that is not to say that, in the coming years, we will not return to seeing new data centres being developed, which will help complement our energy-security-related climate needs.</p></speech>

The expenditure was funded previously under subhead A3.  Savings were identified because expenditure this year is less than projected.  Sometimes when there is a new initiative, the universities or industry and market people take time to ramp up their ability to spend the funds.  There was no lack of desire to see the funding spent.  It was an Estimate of &euro;16.8 million, so the reduction is a smaller part of the overall expenditure.  We will spend &euro;14.5 million.  We did not have control but there was under-expenditure in the other areas or in this area.</p></speech>

On the radio yesterday and again today, the Minister mentioned that contracts will be concluded in a matter of days or shortly.  He indicated a figure of &euro;350 million initially.  Is he confident that this will be enough to deliver on the projects?  It was reported in the <i>Business Post</i>last week or the week before that, with inflation costs, committed projects are potentially at risk.  Could the Minister give us some information, or as much as he can, on the number of sites we are talking about?  Given the 450 MW, what is the breakdown per site?  Is the timeframe for delivery within nine months?  I believe I heard the Minister mention that figure before.</p></speech>

These would involve solar farms, battery storage centres or backup fossil fuel generators.  Those bids would have been made almost a year ago.  I cannot remember the exact date.  There has been a significant increase in inflation in the interim, particularly affecting the cost of energy infrastructure.  Therefore, there is a specific issue in this regard that the CRU and other bodies will have to address.  The emergency purchase of power equipment is slightly different because the contracts have not been concluded.  As I said, we hope that they will be concluded within the next week or two.  Therefore, the price set will be right up to date.</p> <p>  In this process, we could not go out front and say what we thought the assets would cost.  When negotiating on the purchase of assets, one does not name one's expected price.  However, we expect that the likely contract price, subject to contracts being signed in the coming days or two weeks, will be along the lines of what we had budgeted for internally.  The Estimate today reflects that, in that we are pretty much using the exact amount we expected back in July, in the summer.</p></speech>

Deputy Bruton asked earlier whether one can be absolutely certain that projects cleared through an auction process will in the end be delivered.  One cannot be.  There can be a variety of measures.  The emergency purchase and emergency procurement on their own will not be sufficient; we need to see the auctions deliver, along with further auctions to come, because we have a very tight situation with power supply and need to address it.</p></speech>

In talking to various industry providers, one always asks about the position on the various projects and schemes.  There has been a significant inflationary element, particularly concerning the price of steel, which would affect solar farms.  Strangely, solar farms have a significant amount of steel.  There has also been supply disruption because of the war in Ukraine.  I am certain that the CRU and my Department will do everything to ensure we deliver on the additional power capacity.</p></speech>

There has been a significant reduction following the fire.  One has to remember that Tarbert is a very old facility.  It dates back to the 1960s, I believe.  Plants such as Tarbert and Moneypoint, particularly in a market with a very significant renewables element, are not easily ramped up and down.  Therefore, there is a constraint.  We cannot rely on these plants.  We will have to switch away from the use of coal and heavy fuel oil.  We will use these in the interim as part of an emergency backup response but we cannot guarantee the use of the plants in the future.</p></speech>

Will they be compensated only for future credits?</p></speech>

I have been very vocal about the fact that I do not believe this represents good expenditure of taxpayers' money.  There should have been a more targeted approach rather than a universal one.</p><p>Regarding a similar scheme earlier in the year, the Minister said it was not being targeted because there were difficulties with targeting.  We have had much time since then to come up with a better approach.  Why did the Minister decide to make it a universal payment this time?  Has an economic analysis been done of how much money will be given to people who I do not think warrant being paid on foot of an emergency measure such as this?  I refer to people who may have holiday homes.  Equally, has this measure been climate-proofed?  Providing this payment in this untargeted and universal fashion means that these funds will be given to people as an energy subsidy.  This is contrary to our climate action policies and the Government's stated position in this regard.  I would like a comment on these aspects.</p></speech>

There is no reduction in the incentive for people to reduce their energy use.  There are other mechanisms in this regard.  People are arguing for a cap on energy bills, which would, as we have seen in other countries, bring about an increase in the use of gas and energy overall.  Our approach was specifically designed to be climate-proofed and-----</p></speech>

If there was one, it would again not be a targeted measure.  If there were to be a cap, therefore, it would have to be a targeted one.  The main reason people are reducing their energy use now is because of a price mechanism.  A price driver is causing this.  For wealthy people, however, no price driver will make them reduce their energy use.  Not only is this the case, but the Government has now given people in this situation more money, which will mean negating any price drivers which might exist.</p></speech>

I also stand up for targeted supports, and this is why the social welfare provisions I mentioned are critical.  I do not believe, however, that they on their own would provide a sufficient response.  The scale of the price increases has put people right across society in real difficulty.  Often people may be outside the social welfare system and in various circumstances, and I think it is appropriate they get a payment during these difficult times.  Once we start to do that, then, do we agree to undertake provisions through electricity bills?  I ask this because it would not be possible to do it through gas payments, because only 42% of households have gas connections, or any other mechanism.  It was appropriate to take this approach.</p> <p>  The cost to start differentiating, the time delay and the bureaucratic complications involved in trying to change the entire database system, or to try to manipulate it to categorise payments based on income or on whether it is a first or second home, would not have delivered the credit in time.  I spoke to energy supply companies in the past week, and they told me the measure in April came at just the right time, when bills were really starting to hit home.  The payment next month, on 1 November, will come just at the right time.  If we start to complicate this process and, in a sense, let the perfect become the enemy of the good, that would be a mistake.   It is appropriate that we are helping out the vast majority of households, as most other European countries are doing.</p></speech>

It should be people at risk of energy poverty and those finding it difficult to cope.  I do not, though, believe that people with holiday homes will find it difficult in this regard, especially now they will be getting two payments.  I do not think the MPRN approach is the most appropriate either.  A better, quicker and more targeted means of doing this would be through measures similar to the Covid schemes used previously.  This is how we could have got money into people's pockets very quickly.  The MPRN scheme took months the last time before the money hit people's accounts.  I refer to a different approach, but I do not think this is going to be the last time this kind of measure will be needed.  I ask the Minister to undertake some examination of how a measure such as this can be targeted better next time around.</p></speech>

The MPRN is the only way to do this, if the payments are to be automatic and without the need for an application.  As I said, once we start moving away from this approach, where payments would be made based on an application or screening, then we will be getting into a system that will be much more expensive.  A certain amount of money might be saved by excluding a certain number of houses, but it might ultimately be found that it will cost more to undertake this type of differentiated system.</p></speech>

The &euro;7 million was referred to in the Minister statement and I thought this related to active travel.  Perhaps it is related to climate measures instead.  It was actually climate mitigation that was referred to, but I do not have a copy of the Minister's statement.  I ask him to elaborate on what is being done in respect of resources for local authorities.  I am conscious of situations, and using the analogy of active travel, where money is given to local authorities but then some of that money is being returned nearly as fast to the Minister's Department.</p> <p>  Turning to group schemes, where several tenants are on such a group scheme, what is being done to relieve the pressure on them under the current measures?  In addition, and similar to the point made regarding the Traveller community, what can be done for people living in situations where they need assistance and they may be on a shared meter in multi-unit developments?</p></speech>

It took time for the local authorities to get them in place, but they are there now.  In previous years, it was not possible for the monies allocated to be spent.  This will no longer be the case.  There will be more competition for these budgets than there will be funding available.  On that basis, we launched our Pathfinders programme yesterday.  This was to reward, highlight and champion those local authorities that will be quick and get the best value from the funding.</p> <p>  Similarly, the Delivering Effective Climate Action 2030 plan had a local authority strategy.  It was prepared for the research team at the Local Government Management Agency, with the involvement of consultants, the climate action regional offices the County and City Management Association and the environment, climate change and efficiency and emergency planning committee.  This strategy was submitted to us last year.  The authors worked out and identified the supports in this regard.  This Supplementary Estimate is now responding to that endeavour.  It has taken the analysis provided to us regarding what capacity requirements local authorities have and has suggested ways of funding it.  This approach encompasses all 31 local authorities delivering phase 1.  Included is the establishment of internal organisational supports and governance structures, translating the Climate Action Plan 2021 actions into local authority actions and building the evidence base for adaptation and mitigation at a county level.  Stakeholder engagement is also involved.</p> <p>  There are two key specialised resource requirements.  One is a climate action co-ordinator, CAC, who will be responsible for managing the climate action resources and overseeing the implementation of climate action measures, in respect of adaptation and mitigation, together with the local authority climate action steering group.  There will also be a climate action officer, CAO, who will be responsible for managing internal change, building climate action awareness and readiness in each local authority and providing support to the CAC.  The climate action plan has identified 90 actions, with dedicated timeframes for delivering and reporting, for which local authorities have direct responsibility or where they key stakeholders.  There is, therefore, a great deal of project work to be done.  This undertaking will provide some of the key staff resources, including the CAOs and the CACs.  These will work with the other resources we are providing to local authorities, be those in the areas of transport, parks or other elements.</p><p>The local authorities that are good at this will find it benefits their overall operations.

Where a tenant has a difficulty in a group scheme or in a multi-unit development, there was a mechanism for them to go to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to ensure that their landlord was allocating.  Our evidence from the first application of this energy credit was that it got to 99.6% of households.  It is only where people have their own MPRN, but we have provided flexible mechanisms where people have requested the RTB to get a payment if for whatever reason it has not been passed on.</p></speech>

It will deliver.  We are seeing a solar revolution happening.  The companies are seeing a fivefold increase in demand.  It is an absolute explosion that will go further.  From talking to energy companies, I hear that battery storage technology is evolving.  The deployment of that will go way beyond what previously might have been expected.  It is important and we will deliver on the back of gas-fired generation, not just some of these open-cycle plants, but I expect further auctions may look at the potential for combined cycle or other technologies.  That combination of renewables backed up with storage and where necessary with fossil fuel-powered generation in times when there is no wind and no sun will deliver us to a future whereby by 2030 we are using 80% renewable and after that we start switching to things like hydrogen and get to a zero-carbon energy system.  There is a path.</p></speech>

I ask him for his views on prepay meters.  He is leaving much to the CRU.  Many people on these prepay meters are actually paying a higher tariff for their electricity.  They are also paying a higher standing charge.  That seems extremely unfair because the provider is actually guaranteed payment whereas if someone had an ordinary meter, the provider is not guaranteed payment until it is actually paid.  Has the Minister asked the CRU the justification for them having the right to charge a higher rate?  One would think people with a prepay meter should actually get it at a discounted rate.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the extra money allocated to reduce public transport fares for students and commuters.  That is great, but the policy is only as good as it works out in practice and there seems to be a big gap between the policy and the practice particularly in north Kildare.  My home town has Maynooth University.  I am inundated with students who are delighted with the reduced transport charge but they cannot get the buses.  The buses are full or they are not turning up.  Sometimes they are standing up and in the case of an accident they would be like human missiles.  The buses are full.  The policy is great, but more work needs to be done on delivery so that it works in practice.  How does the transport plan work with the living with Covid a plan?  Many drivers are not able to turn up to work because they have Covid.  That is causing the cancellation of many bus services.</p></speech>

What the Deputy said is true; buses are starting to fill up.  The numbers using public transport are rising significantly on the back of the end of the Covid pandemic, but also as a result of lower fares.  Many bus services are not providing the reliable services that we expect.  It is the role of the National Transport Authority and my Department to ensure that they do.  This has included the issuing of fines for companies which have not applied.  Many of the difficulties have related to the ability to get drivers.  We are considering further measures for how we can help to support and facilitate that.  I absolutely accept it is not satisfactory particularly when buses do not turn up on schedule and people are left at the stop which can also lead to buses being over-full.  We need to change that.</p> <p>  The issue of prepay meters is complex.  There are different circumstances for gas and electricity.  Different types of meters are involved.  There are also different types of customers.  Many people are using prepay meters because it provides a very useful service.  It is a very attractive way to manage paying and for many people reducing energy use and their bills.  The complexity of that is that a number of different companies are involved.  Not every company uses prepay meters but those that do have a variety of tariffs, often better and innovative tariffs to support customers.  The standing charge and the per-use charge vary because suppliers try to attract customers with that.  There is an issue with those who are in difficulty.  We need to address that and the CRU has done a lot of work already.</p> <p>  Included in that is the requirement to ensure that those who are in difficulty are not paying the highest charges.  As we go through this winter, we will try to ensure that the discounted tariffs are made available to those most in need of them as well as other supports.  In two weeks' time we will publish an energy action plan which will outline further measures that we may seek to deliver in conjunction with the CRU.  We are doing considerable work monitoring the consumer protection measures.  We will not rest with whatever is there.  It means looking at it and ensuring we adjust if people are left in difficulties.  We do not want anyone disconnected this summer, least of all those at risk of fuel poverty who do not have the heat and the power that they need.</p> <p>  Officials from my Department are meeting both suppliers and the NGOs to understand the issues on the ground.  The CRU is working with the NGO representative group to ensure we apply the best solutions here.  There is no lack of commitment to getting households through a difficult winter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.316" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022101800002#G01000"><p>I return to the issue of capping, solidarity and so on.  Over what period does the Minister's estimate of &euro;1 billion to &euro;2 billion apply?  It could be a significant source of potential funding for activities of all sorts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022101800002#G01100"><p>It will be over the next year.  However, as I said, work needs to be done to decide the rates that will apply and much will depend on what the energy prices are.  There is a real complexity with the inframarginal pricing.  It is clear that the solidarity contribution will only in effect really apply to one company, the Corrib gas field.  With inframarginal it is complex because there are generating companies, such as wind farms, but they may have sold on power through a long-term contract at low rates to a supplier company or supplier-like company.  We are saying we will not just apply inframarginal pricing to the generating companies, but we will also apply it to those suppliers and supplier-like companies if they are gaining a windfall profit from these very high market prices for fossil fuel and gas.</p><p>Then one is into the complexity of each different generator in terms of what its arrangements are.  However, there are many companies which may be purchasing that power and passing on the windfall gain to consumers by reducing their overall bills.  Where that is the case, obviously a windfall charge will not apply.  It will take a lot of detailed analysis.  We can do this through the market mechanisms we have.  The exact amount will only become more clear when we understand how much of those long-term contracts are in place and now much of the savings have been passed on to consumers.  I still come back to a figure of at least &euro;1 billion to &euro;2 billion.  It could be higher depending, more than anything else, on what the price of energy is in the next year.  That price is the unknown.</p></speech>

My question, without the detail in front of us, if we come to that point, is now many companies it will apply to in Ireland?  The jurisdiction is quite small in terms of energy generating companies.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister has put &euro;1 billion to &euro;2 billion as the potential yield from it, how many companies would it apply to?</p></speech>

On the supplier, light and generator side, I would imagine 50 to 100.  I am guessing on that.  It is difficult to know but I would imagine it is of that order.</p></speech>

That is important in the context of the overall discussion.</p> <p>  In general, I welcome the initiative from the Department.  I join my colleague, Deputy Bruton, in thanking the Minister and the Department for the work they have done to achieve the energy credit, which, among many other measures that are being adopted over the course of this winter, is right under the circumstances.</p></speech>

I refer to some of the language around the &euro;200 and its relationship with VAT.  To be clear, households can expect to see a reduction of a total of &euro;200 three times.  It will be one hundred and eighty-whatever euro plus VAT.  It will be a total of &euro;200.  The last time around, there was a switch in relation to VAT in the middle of it and people did not see the reduction that they expected to see.  Now, it is clear.  It will be a total reduction of &euro;200 on three occasions.</p> <p>  In terms of the local authority commitment, we heard from the representative bodies and local authorities.  Is it clear what the funding will be allocated towards?  Is it staff?  Is it the preparation of local authority climate action plans?  Is it boots on the ground to deliver on those plans?  Is it to populate the local authority climate teams?  They had indicated to us that to resource those climate teams might cost in the region of &euro;11 million.  What exactly will the funding go towards and deliver in 2023?</p></speech>

It is primarily staff.  It may include the likes of stakeholder engagement and building evidence of research.  One could bring in contracting expertise and so on but it is primarily, in my mind, their internal resource capability to be able to marshal other elements of the local authority.  Indeed, to go back to the Chair's initial question, to aggregate a wider community response, it is staff resources more than anything else we need.</p></speech>

The Minister has heard me make this point previously.  Some local authorities are for a range of reasons more enthusiastic, but also better placed or better resourced initially, to take advantage of these opportunities.  Will it be evenly spread or how will the funding be allocated?</p></speech>

It will be allocated.  We do not leave any county behind.  One of the guiding principles of the climate response is that every place matters, every person matters and every local authority matters.  Obviously, some, such as Dublin, will have much deeper resource pockets than a smaller county, such as Leitrim or Louth, but we need each of them to play its part.  It will be, I expect, proportionate in terms of the scale of investment.</p></speech>

It is a measure to reduce the cost of electricity bills on households.  It is a measure the Minister brought in in 2010 and that has been in place up until a couple of weeks ago.  According to reports, it involved &euro;600 million on household bills over a decade.  Where is that accounted for?  When was it lifted?  Why was it in place for so long?  Will the Minister give us an update on that?</p></speech>

As I said, that was an independent regulatory decision.  Going back to the original decision in 2010, there may not have been regulated pricing on markets.  However, that was a CRU decision and it applies from 1 October.</p></speech>

There were elements where there was an increased cost on households and other elements where there was a reduction.  There was a net rebalancing, which, if I remember the exact figure correctly, was a reduction of approximately &euro;40.  It was within that decision that the network tariff on large energy users was also considered.</p></speech>

I have written parliamentary questions and they have been referred to the CRU.  The CRU is accountable to the committee.  The detail on this is not entirely clear.  In fairness, Ms Caroline O'Doherty from the <i>Irish Independent</i>has highlighted it.  Nobody has contradicted the point about &euro;600 million over ten years.

There is another &euro;150 million added to subhead B13, which is the energy transformation programme.</p> <p>  On something we spoke about previously, has the Minister explored and engaged with the existing infrastructure to try to keep what we have already, expanding the life span of existing sites around the country to ensure that there is a supply of gas and other materials?  Has that happened in tandem with looking at new sites for energy generation?  The Minister might come back on that and then I will have other questions.</p></speech>

To be honest, people did not expect Tarbert and Moneypoint - the third station this applies to is, if I recall, Aghada, which is an oil-fired generation unit in the ESB plant in Aghada in Cork - to be still running.  They are running but within a relatively short period, we see the likes of Moneypoint switching away from coal, perhaps to fuel oil initially.  One of the three units runs on fuel oil already but we need to switch away from those heavy carbon fossil fuel plants.</p><p>We are running them at present because our situation is tight.  However, I do not believe there are any other plants, none that I can think of immediately, which would be accessible.  We have everything on the bars at the moment.</p></speech>

The lifetime of the field is determined by how much gas is there.  There was talk recently in the newspapers about there being potentially larger reserves than might originally have been expected.  That is a matter for the company.  That is not something we can determine.  There is real potential down the line.  If we look at the facility there, particularly when we will be developing offshore wind power in the north west, there must be potential for the use of some of those offshore or other facilities to help tap into the offshore wind that is available to us.  I expect it will have a role in the future in some way that has not yet been determined.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned a plan for maritime development and climate action, including the establishment of a marine and climate directorate.  He said his Department is committing &euro;1 million.  It is envisaged it will be &euro;3.5 million in a once-off fund for this year to support the setup of that function.  Will the Minister elaborate more on that marine and climate directorate?</p></speech>

There is an independence at An Bord Plean&aacute;la, so line Ministers do not get directly involved.  However, in response to Deputy Bruton, I said earlier it is probably on the planning side that we have the real constraint in our system and that is the biggest constraint in developing offshore renewable energy, and indeed a range of other projects.  Recognising this needs very specific skills and expertise in marine ecology and marine spatial planning, it is right for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to have a special unit.  We are supporting that by part-funding it.  As I understand it An Bord Plean&aacute;la is currently advertising and looking to bring in the skilled personnel it needs.  We have to treat this with urgency, because when it comes to offshore matters, we have to get environmental protection and the planning right.  We are in competition in a sense with most other countries in north-west Europe that are looking for similar investment.  If our planning and permitting are not done in a timely manner, we may see the shipping, cabling, turbines and other supply chain elements going to other markets.  That is why it is critical.</p></speech>

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is making a further contribution.  My understanding in budget discussions and elsewhere is that there is no restriction on the ability of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to draw down resources.  The restriction is in getting the capable people with real skills.  To be honest, one of the things we need to do is start looking at our universities and our marine and other research institutions and see where we can get the people because that is the biggest constraint.

Obviously, that does not apply retrospectively to those who are currently operating or have their permissions granted.  Has the Department looked at what generation capacity is available within those existing data centres and looked at ways to have that made available and distributed to the grid if there is a possibility to use those in any manner?</p></speech>

It is complicated by the fact that many times a data centre may have a certain grid connection but not use it at full capacity.  EirGrid already has detailed working relationships with many large energy users.  They have entered into co-operation.  I hear EirGrid saying it has got a good response.  It is getting a great deal of co-operation in the order of, I believe, 150 MW of flexible capacity that it will turn to in the event of us being very tight and on amber alert.  That is one of the resources to which it might turn to help to manage a difficult situation.  My understanding is that it has had extensive and good negotiations with all large energy users in that regard.</p></speech>

It is surprising the money was not spent, especially in light of the crises in both biodiversity and climate that we face.  There may be some barrier.

In today's meeting, we will resume our scrutiny of the Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2020.  This is a Private Members' Bill sponsored by Deputies Mary Lou McDonald and Louise O'Reilly.  We are joined, from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, by Ms Carol Baxter, assistant secretary, and Ms Jane Ann Duffy, principal officer.  We also joined by representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, Mr. David Joyce, equality officer, and Ms Mandy La Combre, senior industrial relations officer of the Financial Services Union.  From NUI Galway, we have Dr. Nata Duvvury, director at the Centre for Global Women's Studies.  I welcome our witnesses and thank them for attending.  We invited representatives of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC.  However, due to other diary commitments, they were not in a position to attend.</p> <p>  I remind those joining us remotely that the chat function on MS Teams should only be used to make the team on-site aware of any technical issues or urgent matters that may arise and should not be used to make general comments or statements during the meeting.  I also remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate if he or she is not adhering to that constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via MS Teams to confirm, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  In advance of inviting witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I wish to advise them of the following in regard to parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses who are participating from the committee room are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses who are appearing virtually before the committee, there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege applies to their evidence if given outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if directed by me to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting will comprise three opening statements.  Each witness has five minutes and we ask witnesses to adhere to that timeframe in as far as possible.  We will start with Ms Baxter, followed by Mr. Joyce and Dr. Duvvury.</p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, family leaves have undergone significant expansion in recent years.  Since 2019, this has included the introduction of paid parent&rsquo;s leave and its extension to seven weeks for each parent of a child under two years of age and the extension of unpaid parental leave to 26 weeks in respect of a child under 12 years of age.</p> <p>  The Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 includes provisions for leave for medical care purposes and the extension of breastfeeding breaks.  The Government has decided to bring forward, as part of that Bill, legislative proposals which will introduce domestic violence leave.  These proposals are based on recommendations made as part of the domestic violence leave report.</p><p>The programme for Government contains a number of commitments aimed at addressing domestic violence leave, including the commitment to investigate "the provision of paid leave and social protection provision to victims of domestic violence."  In response to this Private Members' Bill, the Government agreed to examine the feasibility of establishing a statutory entitlement to paid domestic violence leave and to provide a report.  Work on the development of the domestic violence leave report began with a consultation process with relevant stakeholders, in particular service providers and victims' representative groups, through the monitoring committee of the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  This consultation had the aim of gathering their views on how best domestic violence leave should operate to address the needs of victims most effectively.</p><p> Consultations also took place with social partners, including employer representative groups and trade unions, to get a better understanding of the needs of employers and employees in terms of introducing such leave.  These consultations explored the current approach taken by businesses to support employees experiencing domestic violence, including where there were existing domestic violence workplace policies in operation and lessons from how those operated.  Submissions were also invited through the national equality strategies and other stakeholders who represented minority and other seldom heard voices, including the national strategy for women and girls, the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, the national LGBTI+ inclusion strategy, and the migrant integration strategy.  Alongside these consultations, research was undertaken into the international experience around the introduction of domestic violence leave.  A number of countries have some form of leave for this purpose, both paid and unpaid and with different criteria.</p><p> The outcome of the consultations and research informed the development of the recommendations in the domestic violence leave report.  Some key considerations were the need for the leave not to operate independently of other supports, that it should be part of a broader workplace awareness and openness around domestic violence, and that it should be available as flexibly as possible, to be taken when and as needed, with no notice period required.</p><p> The report's first recommendation focuses on the need for a broader approach to help victims, but also to help managers understand how best they can support an employee who is a victim.  The Department is tendering for a partner who will help us to develop templates and guidance for employers of all sizes.  The report also recommends that five days of paid domestic violence leave be introduced, to be taken within a 12-month period, with a provision that this measure be reviewed within two years of introduction with the option to extend to ten days.  In order to facilitate uptake as needed, it also recommends that no notice period be required.  Further recommendations include that the leave should be available for a range of purposes, including relocation or to seek legal or other supports, and that employment protections should apply.</p><p> Committee Stage amendments to the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 are being finalised.  These will be based on the detail of the recommendations that I have outlined.</p><p> I thank members for the invitation to meet the committee today.  I am happy to answer whatever questions they may have on the development of the domestic violence leave report or on the legislative proposals.</p></speech>

Congress endorses the introduction of paid domestic violence leave as a vital support for survivors.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Mandy La Combre, who will also participate in our discussion.</p> <p>  Economic independence from an abusive partner is essential for women experiencing domestic abuse and employment can play an important role in supporting abused women in remaining financially independent.  Therefore, we warmly welcome the Bill.  Indeed, we have engaged with Deputy O'Reilly on its contents.  We also note the recent publication by the Government of the domestic violence leave report, which includes recommendations on how best to support employees experiencing domestic abuse.  I will refer to this in our brief opening remarks.</p> <p>  Domestic violence leave has been a priority for the trade union movement, not only here in Ireland but internationally, as evidenced by the negotiation of International Labour Organization, ILO, convention No. 190 on violence and harassment in the world of work and its accompanying recommendation No. 206, which gives further, more detailed guidance on how the convention should be implemented at national level.  One of the most important elements of the convention is that it deals with the issue of domestic violence.  This was a key demand of trade unions.  The convention recognises that domestic violence can impact the world of work - it can affect employment, productivity and health and safety - and that the world of work can be a key point of intervention in mitigating or reducing the impacts of domestic violence.  The convention requires governments to take appropriate measures to recognise the effects of domestic violence and, so far as is reasonably practicable, mitigate its impact in the world of work.</p> <p>  The Bill and the recent announcement by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, are in line with the spirit of the convention and recommendation No. 206, which specifies a range of measures to mitigate the impacts of domestic violence in the world of work, including leave for victims of domestic violence; flexible work arrangements and protection for victims of domestic violence; and the inclusion of domestic violence in workplace risk assessments.  We welcome the Government's stated intention to ratify this important convention before the end of the year.</p> <p>  While welcoming these moves, congress has from the beginning made our position clear on some of the major issues involved.  We believe that the leave should be a minimum of ten days per rolling 12-month period, which is stipulated in the Bill.  This should not be reduced to five.  In certain cases, ten days may not be enough and additional unpaid leave may be necessary.  We also recommend consideration of a process for additional leave to cover exceptional circumstances.  Ideally, this should be paid leave but, at a minimum, it should be some unpaid leave provision that could work similarly to maternity leave provisions.</p> <p>  On the issue of proof, for domestic violence leave to be successful, there should be as few barriers as possible to taking the leave.  Survivors already face an overwhelming number of barriers when reporting or disclosing violence, including sociocultural attitudes and stigma, sexual assault myths and personal repercussions.  Requiring proof for this type of leave reinforces the all-too-common perception that individuals reporting violence are somehow not credible or trustworthy.  Given the stigma that abuse carries and the fact that it is vastly under-reported, there is little reason to believe that any such leave would be widely misused.  In fact, research suggests the opposite.  In Australia, interviews with employers who had had leave in place for several years through enterprise agreements found that the leave was infrequently used even where employers had actively promoted its provision.  Furthermore, since violence thrives in secrecy, there will in many cases be no external way for a service provider to confirm that domestic or sexual violence has occurred.</p> <p>  Regarding workplace agreements, economic insecurity is one of the greatest factors inhibiting victims of domestic violence from escaping violent situations at home.  To address this problem, unions and employers have developed paid domestic violence leave provisions that allow victims to attend legal proceedings, medical appointments or other events or activities related to the violence they have experienced without risk of lost income or employment.  Congress believes that paid leave should be part of a broader domestic violence and work policy that would also support survivors in other ways.  My colleague, Ms La Combre, will be happy to discuss what a workplace policy should cover.  Her union, along with SIPTU, the Communication Workers' Union, CWU, and others, has been leading the way in this regard.</p> <p>  On the issue of costs, claims that the introduction of such leave might somehow undermine our competitiveness are simply not credible.  An Australian study, entitled Economic Aspects of Paid Domestic Violence Leave Provisions, considered the likely impact of domestic violence leave on the payroll costs of employers and found that incremental payments to workers taking the leave would amount to one fiftieth of 1% - 0.02% - of current payrolls.  The report argued that this argument misunderstood the nature of competitiveness in a modern, innovation-driven economy.  Cementing a reputation as a safe, high-quality and inclusive place to live would be beneficial to national competitiveness, and paid leave for victims of domestic violence would be an important symbol of Ireland's commitment in that regard.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to submit our views on this important legislation.  We are happy to respond to whatever questions members may have.</p></speech>

The Bill is a significant milestone, advancing gender equality in Ireland.  It must be appreciated that the Bill is evidence-based legislation.</p><p>It is based on undeniable scientific evidence of the enormous human and financial costs of domestic violence and coercive control to individuals, families, employers, communities and the State.  A recent Safe Ireland and University of Galway study estimated that the annual indicative cost of domestic violence for survivors is about &euro;2.7 billion annually, or the equivalent of &euro;56 billion over a 20-year period, based on the women who we interviewed.  This level of loss is not surprising, given that a KPMG study of Vodafone employees found that 151,000 women employed in Ireland, or about 6% of the workforce, have had a lifetime experience of domestic violence, with 65% saying that domestic violence seriously or considerably affected their career progression, which leads to wage loss and productivity loss.  These social and economic losses have significant macroeconomic implications which could potentially affect overall economic growth and the sustainability of the Irish economy.  In the context of the current housing and cost-of-living crises, the repercussions take on an even greater salience.  Domestic violence represents leakage from the economic system that needs to be stopped.  This Bill goes one step towards that.</p><p> The proposed Bill is ground-breaking in its clear recognition that domestic violence is not a private family matter, but rather a public concern which has serious consequences across society, including in the workplace.  Recognition of the collective effort needed by all stakeholders to prevent domestic violence, as well as to mitigate its consequences, is required.  It is particularly important that the Bill is being introduced as part of the organisation of working time legislation.  It places domestic violence as a central economic issue as well as a human rights violation.  The proposed Bill marks a critical juncture in our recognition of the workplace as an important site of safety for women.  If the legislation is passed, Ireland would join a handful of countries globally which have domestic violence legislation.  It is important, therefore, to seriously consider the Bill and pass it.</p><p> When we consider legislation, we also need to understand whether there are issues that could affect the effectiveness of the proposed Bill.  We need to consider the universality of the application of the law.  While there is no reference to the size of the enterprise, there is concern about the extent to which this law would apply to small entrepreneurs hiring only one or two employees, or employees without contracts, such as volunteers or other informal workers.  When considering domestic violence, it is important to understand that domestic employment or employment in a family enterprise puts more women at risk of experiencing domestic violence.  These employees are outside the ambit of the Organisation of Working Time Act, so there should be special consideration for them.  This applies equally to whether this legislation will be relevant to gig economy workers, who are often mischaracterised as self-employed independent contractors.  Those who experience domestic violence are the least likely to be able to fight against this mischaracterisation.  We need to consider the impact of this law for gig workers.</p><p> The review of legislation across the world has shown that the effectiveness of the law can be limited by the lack of proactive will among employers.  Positive obligations have to be placed on employers to implement the law.  This is done in New Zealand, where there is a financial penalty if the employer does not implement a domestic violence policy or domestic violence leave.  There should be some limitations on employers&rsquo; rights to refuse domestic violence leave.  A significant issue that has been highlighted is that there is sometimes, given that this is between employer and employee, a deference to employers in legislation and to their right to discipline their workforce and fire unproductive employees.  This is not the case for women who are experiencing domestic violence.  There should be adequate consideration of the obligations being placed on employers.</p><p> Leave by itself is insufficient.  There have to be other reasonable accommodations.  As ILO convention No. 190 points out, these accommodations include flexible working time, financial support, supervisory support to manage work performance, support to seek protection orders, and clear safety measures to maintain confidentiality and privacy.</p><p> The terminology in the legislation needs to be clearer, particularly with regard to coercive control.  No clear definition of coercive control is given.  It is a new concept and it is not well understood by policymakers or even by those women who experience coercive control.  There is a lack of a definition of what constitutes serious alarm or distress.  This is particularly important because women experiencing violence tend to minimise the effects of domestic violence.  We must flesh out this term.</p><p> There is no focus on the perpetrator or abuser.  This is important.  As long as domestic violence leave policies only focus on the person experiencing the domestic violence, it indicates that the victim is responsible for addressing domestic violence.  We need to bring the perpetrator into the picture.</p></speech>

How would employers fulfil their statutory obligation to grant that leave?  I note the T&aacute;naiste recently rejected IBEC's suggestion that proof would be required for domestic abuse paid leave.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on IBEC's submission?  Will they provide some insight on the eligibility for leave for women who are subjected to domestic violence?</p> <p>  The Minister recently stated that the role of the Workplace Relations Commission would require close examination and expressed concerns about the privacy of victims.  What considerations in the domestic violence leave report will address the privacy of victims?</p><p>My last question relates to the proposed introduction of five days paid leave for victims of domestic violence to be taken within 12 months, with the provision to be reviewed within two years.  Why not introduce a ten-day option now?  What will the review within a two-year period entail?</p></speech>

I have been negotiating workplace policies around domestic violence for some time within my union.  In our sector, no employer we have dealt with is seeking proof.  We already know the statistics that one in four women in the Republic of Ireland suffers domestic abuse and fewer than one in three actually reports it.  We know even fewer report it when it comes to the workplace.  The idea that we are putting more barriers in place such as seeking proof is, from a trade union perspective, a total non-runner, to be honest.  We are not supportive of that and we do not believe that if people have to do it they will come forward.  We are talking about emergency situations and, as my colleague, Mr. Joyce, said, how people can prove things like coercive control and stuff like that.  The proof issue is a dodgy area to be getting into and an extra barrier to put in place for people.</p> <p>  In terms of five versus ten days' leave, we have workplace policies which have ten days' leave.  It is a floor rather than a ceiling in the policies we have negotiated already.  Employers have told us they do not want to reduce the number of days or never sought to look for fewer days.  In the review process of policies they are not saying there is something that they want to reduce.  The ten-day period is very necessary when we see the kind of things people need that leave for.  Employment is sometimes the only safe space for somebody who is suffering domestic violence.  People might need that leave for childcare, to meet agencies or for court hearings or meetings with garda&iacute;.  This is the time that those who are suffering abuse are hidden from their abuser and can access services.  The number of days leave is very important and five is too few.  Proof is not adequate.  </p> <p>  On the privacy issue, I am a trade union official and a trained HR professional.  I do not believe there should be anybody working in any employment or HR department who is not empathetic or does not have the ability to hold something confidential.</p></speech>

We developed the policy after a review of the experience across different countries.  One of the first things we noticed is that ten days has become the international norm as a minimum, recognising that for some women it might be more.  There has to be flexibility with an employer to figure out what the amount of leave should be.  A period of ten days' leave is now becoming the universal standard.</p> <p>  It is also becoming standard that proof is extremely difficult to provide in this context and that employers undermine the effectiveness of legislation by even talking about a requirement to provide proof.  In the University of Galway policy, we have no requirement for proof.  We have also made possible that if a woman goes to an external agency for support the agency can contact HR in the University of Galway and say it thinks the person may need to avail of the leave.  HR can then be more proactive.  We have a trained person in HR who will work with women and has been trained in confidentiality and maintaining privacy.</p> <p>  Ultimately, employers across the world are beginning to recognise that domestic violence is a serious workplace issue because it has significant consequences for productivity.  It is not just about women taking leave.  If women are less present, there is presenteeism and they are less productive while being at work, the purpose of any kind of profit-making business is defeated.  Employers are recognising this has significant implications for their reputation.  It is part of the movement towards corporate social responsibility.  This is a time to be bold and expand the possibility of addressing domestic violence in a significant way.</p></speech>

This is a groundbreaking and key achievement.  In developing leave we have to be very conscious of practices in other jurisdictions and a range of considerations.  Five days has been put forward because it reflects the practice in a range of jurisdictions.  The introduction of such leave enables a range of purposes to be achieved in terms of going to court, medical appointments and so on.</p> <p>  The reason we are talking about a review is that it is very hard to know at this stage how much leave somebody will need.  This is a relatively untested area.  At the same time, we have to be mindful of the business needs of employers.  That is why it seemed reasonable to start with five days, which achieves quite a lot.  It enables the victim, who is a very important person in this process, to undertake a range of things and protect himself or herself in the context of the experience of domestic violence while, from an employer's point of view, having regard to business needs.  My colleague will speak about the definition of "employee", which was a particular concern of Deputies.</p></speech>

That would entail all of the protections under the Act.  There would be recourse to the WRC in that case.  The definition of &quot;employee&quot;, therefore, would be the definition of employee under the current leave Act.</p></speech>

I thank all of the witnesses for their contribution and coming to Leinster House today to discuss this issue.  It is exciting that we could be one of the first countries to introduce domestic violence leave.  I work with refugees and Women's Aid.  One of the things that has been highlighted to me over the past couple of years is that leave for domestic violence would be a game changer for many women and families because it affects women with children.</p> <p>  Previous contributors touched on the questions I was going to ask around the number of days of leave.</p><p>I understand why we might start off with ten days but should we not just start off with the international norm?  I do not have a question on the concept of domestic violence leave but I have a question for the Department.  We are very serious about introducing this leave in Ireland.  However, if we create something in isolation without the necessary buy-in and understanding of general society, businesses, communities, women and victims of domestic violence, we will fail.  It will not be effective.  What work will be done in parallel to this Bill to support women to take up this leave?  What will be done to help them to understand this is something they can do, that it is non-prejudicial and safe to do and that they will be okay?  From the employers point of view, will there be an onus on them to upskill their staff?  Are we going to support that upskilling so that if someone who needs this leave comes to the door of a HR manager, that manager will be able to work effectively and guide that person in the right direction?  </p><p> My next question is directed at IBEC and NUI Galway.  Is there a body or an organisation that can upskill staff?  What is the best way to do this?  This represents a significant change in our concept of domestic violence and we need societal buy-in and understanding.  Are we ready?  What work do we need to do to make sure we are ready?  </p></speech>

We fully recognise that the leave in a vacuum is not enough and that came through very strongly in the consultations.  Employers need to put in place policies so that there can be openness in the workplace and managers understand what to do when someone comes to them.  That will help to create the confidence for employees.  We have tendered for a partner who will help us to develop templates and provide training and support to employers.</p></speech>

We have said all along that having domestic violence paid leave on its own does not work and that policies have to be in place too.  The Danske Bank policy may be the best example of the training and education roll-outs.  It was developed in conjunction with the police services, Women's Aid, the Rainbow Network and so on.  They not only identified the training that needed to be done, they also rolled out the training with the bank.  The policy is embedded in the culture of the organisation.  When people start working with the bank, they are taught about the policy and the bank is continually assessing the policy and the way it is implemented.  It permeates the organisation and everyone knows about it.  It is really important to have that education piece and to have people in place who will implement the policy.</p> <p>  The Department's role here is to ensure that policies go hand in hand with the leave when it is introduced.</p></speech>

Policies on domestic violence leave are being demanded by women themselves.  Safe Ireland has been to the forefront of talking about this issue since 2018.  Whenever I have spoken on this, women survivors have told me that this leave is so important because it is a recognition of how much domestic violence affects their capabilities as workers and employees.  That recognition has already seeped into the community.</p> <p>  Education policies are essential.  We cannot just leave it up to employers to figure out some policies.  There is an incredible number of templates already out there.  At the international level, Business Fights Poverty has developed excellent toolkits on domestic violence and how to address it in the workplace.  It is not that we do not have the knowledge.  We have the knowledge now.  The question is whether we have the will and the courage to do this.</p></speech>

My own research into discrimination and sexual violence in our armed forces is over 20 years old and as Dr. Duvvury said, we have the knowledge.  We know this.  In that research from 20 years ago, what struck me was that one in four of the female personnel that I interviewed experienced some form of serious sexual assault, up to and including rape.  As an academic I have been involved with the expert advisory group for the Higher Education Authority on ending sexual violence and harassment on our university campuses and that figure comes up again.  One in four of our students at third level can expect to experience sexual violence and harassment while on campus, in a place of safety, in a learning environment.  </p> <p>  Ms La Combre said that one in four people experiences domestic violence.  The majority are female but some men also experience it.  We have heard some really interesting contributions from LGBTIQ and gay men's groups who talked about the additional stigma and barriers to reporting for men.  It is absolutely clear, as Dr. Duvvury said, that we have the knowledge.  We have a crisis.  This affects one in four in this room, outside waiting to go into the other committee rooms and in these Houses of the Oireachtas.  Those of us in Ireland who have experienced or witnessed domestic violence in the home or in our relatives' homes know that this is a crisis.  There is a dynamic at play in Irish society and culture.  The language for it is extensive.  We have a very extensive vocabulary for it.  My own personal bias, based on my life experience and research, is that we live in a predominantly patriarchal and toxic culture that reinforces these behaviours.</p> <p>  In that context, I have a number of questions.  First, if a high profile organisation demands proof, when we know what we know, which is that this is a crisis, should that organisation and its spokespersons and leaders not be very robustly and publicly challenged for holding those views or even asking that question?  Second, given the nature of domestic violence, should we not have more ambition?  Five days is the absolute minimum and under any ethical test, whether Platonic or Aristotelian, that lacks courage, temperance and does not serve a wider justice.  Should we not have more ambition?  Rather than taking a minimum of five days, should we not take a more ambitious approach based on the evidence and the knowledge we have?  We should not be bound, necessarily, by what is happening in other jurisdictions, if we know from the research that five is the bare minimum and is not enough, frankly.</p><p> Dr. Duvvury raised the issue of coercive control.  Is there research to which she, Ms La Combre or any of the other witnesses can point us that might provide a useful working definition of "coercive control" that would assist us in modifying the legislation?  We all know what it is, but it is emerging into the wider public discourse and is being recognised in the political narrative.  It would be useful if there was a working definition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.388" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022101800002#F00200"><p>Regarding the Senator's first two questions, any organisation that espouses a position regarding proof has to be able to stand up to any robust questioning of that.  I agree that taking this step in itself is an important one for our country, but let us be ambitious and make it a step that will make the rest of the world stand up and see that we have done something serious - not a minimal step, but something that will make a significant difference in the lives of women predominantly, but also some men, who are the victims of domestic violence.</p> <p>  I do not have an answer to the Senator's third question.  The departmental officials or someone else might.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.389" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Nata Duvvury" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022101800002#F00300"><p>There is some significant academic writing on coercive control.  Dr. Lindsay Stark is one of the main authors who first expanded our understanding of domestic violence to consider coercive control, which can include a range of behaviours from purely control behaviours, for example, wanting to know where someone is, asking who someone is speaking with and so on, to forms of emotional, physical and psychological violence.  It is a pattern of behaviour that occurs over a lifetime; it is not one incident, but a repeated behaviour.  It does not have to be physical violence.  Ireland's coercive control legislation is important and we can take from it.  In its implementation, though, it seems that an element of physical violence is what we are recognising as violence in the cases that are coming forward.  We rarely recognise asking over and over again who someone spoke to, where did someone go, why is someone not at home by 12 a.m. or 1 a.m. or where did someone drive, yet these are as insidious and harmful as physical violence.  We have to bring to the fore the importance of controlling behaviours, which are the hallmark of coercive control.</p></speech>

Five days for all employees is significant.</p> <p>  Regarding the definition of "coercive control", our understanding is an evolution, as Dr. Duvvury said.  Generally, where a term is under development, we tend not to define it when working on legislation because the definition will become outdated quickly.  If we do not define it, then it allows new understandings to be attached to it.  We recommend that it not be defined at this point, but there may be different views on that.</p></speech>

I welcome the Bill.  Labour supports it and notes the observations made on it.</p><p>I understand that IBEC was invited to attend this meeting but is not present.  It would have been instructive for IBEC to attend because that would have broadened the discussion and we would have heard the employer's perspective.  In my humble opinion, that IBEC is not present creates the perception that this is not a matter that it wants to engage on constructively with the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Maybe it is waiting for further discussions with departmental officials and the Minister on the Government's Bill.  Fair enough if that is the case, but it is rare that we have discussions of this nature where we have the trade union position and the academic position.  These are good days in that respect, even though we are tackling a subject matter that is horrific.</p><p>I do not want to offend Dr. Nata by mispronouncing her surname, so I will call her &quot;Dr. Nata&quot;, if that is okay.  I wish to ask her about the key issues to consider to improve the effectiveness of the Bill.  She referred to assessing &quot;the universality of the application of the law.&quot;  I have not fully internalised what she means by what she stated next:</p> <blockquote> 	While there is no reference to the size of the enterprise, there is concern about the extent to which this law would apply to small entrepreneurs hiring only one or two employees, or employees without contracts, such as volunteers or other informal workers.  When considering domestic violence, it is important to understand that domestic employment or employment in a family enterprise [her written submission refers here to farms and households, which were the key words for me] puts more women at risk of experiencing domestic violence.  These employees are outside the ambit of the Organisation of Working Time Act... </blockquote> <p>According to her, it was not clear that this group of workers come under the remit of the Bill.  I have no doubt that Deputy O'Reilly will comprehensively address this point, but is there a potential wording that could be offered up by way of amendment or suggestion to the proposer of the Bill that would strengthen it, having regard to, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, the Deputy's answer?  If this provision could be buttressed, doing so would be vital.</p><p>There is not only Deputy O'Reilly's Bill, but also the Government's Bill, and we are dealing with both.  In the interventions that all of the witnesses have made today, we have a set of tools to strengthen both Bills or one or the other, depending on which is before us first.  I welcome this Bill.  If it could be strengthened, particularly in respect of farm holdings and domestic situations, I would welcome that.</p></speech>

This is important.  I would have to reflect on the precise wording that needs to be introduced.  I can send suggestions.</p> <p>  I raised the issue of farm and household enterprise because that is still one of the issues for women's employment in Ireland.  Many of the social protection and welfare schemes have failed women who are in this type of employment, given that they are not seen as working, and, therefore, we need to consider this matter and bring it under the Bill's ambit.</p><p>I will not tell members the wording right now but I will send a suggestion.</p></speech>

To be clear, we are not here to discuss the Government legislation.  I have not seen the amendments yet, in any event.  We are here to discuss what is substantially the only piece of legislation that exists that will achieve the aim.  I do not think there is any disagreement from anyone at this committee, or indeed any Member of the Oireachtas, about the granting of this leave.  There may be some dispute over whether we should be brave and ambitious in what we do or whether we should try to lag behind others but I think we broadly agree on the need for this legislation.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  The first is for Ms La Combre and Dr. Duvvury.  Victims believing they will not be believed is an absolutely huge issue.  While it is welcome the Government and the Minister have been pushed sufficiently to remove the requirement for proof, it is not totally gone.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, said "if issues arise with respect to misuse of this leave, changes may be made to permit employers to ask for supporting evidence, should they so require it".  The removal of the proof is welcome but to leave the door open like that is very disappointing.  It sends a very clear message from the 1950s to women to the effect that we are starting to trust them but we might not and we are going to keep an eye on them.  It is very regrettable but from Ms La Combre and Dr. Duvvury's experience, do they imagine that even the threat of this might have a chilling effect on a worker coming forward to access this leave?</p></speech>

During the course of negotiations even the potential or possibility of abuse of the leave was never discussed.  It is something I was flabbergasted by when I heard about it last week because it really is not an issue with the employers we have been dealing with.  There are maybe only ten companies in the country, so far, that have domestic violence workplace leave policies and as far as I am aware none of them has sought this, so it seems ludicrous.  We need to believe people and to trust them and employers need to trust their workers on this.</p></speech>

Thus, Australia requires proof whereas New Zealand moved from proof but then expanded the right of the employer to refuse the leave.  Domestic violence is about power.  A person who experiences violence is often extremely powerless and is not able to articulate and fight for what is their due because they believe they deserve it, due to the patriarchal notions that fuel violence.  Even the threat you might have to give evidence or proof will have a chilling effect on people coming forward to apply for leave.  This has been one of the big criticisms in academic literature about domestic violence leave policies in other jurisdictions.  It has been documented and we have all come to the conclusion proof is just not possible in this case.</p></speech>

To be fair, I think most of the Government Members agree with us but leaving the door open or even slightly ajar is an issue, and one I wish to see dealt with.</p> <p>  We are talking about slashing the ten days to five because of an announcement made by Government but the three parties in government, from my reading of it, all support ten days.  I understand that where it is in existence in this jurisdiction it is ten days.  Fianna F&aacute;il first committed to this leave in 2018, supplied a figure of ten days and has spoken about ten days since.  The Green Party in the North brought forward legislation that provided for ten days.  I think it was about a year and a half ago that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science launched a policy in NUIG and it also provided for ten days.  Do our guests from NUIG and ICTU see the ten days as representative of what is rapidly becoming the norm in the public and private sectors and that such an allocation would fit in broadly with what is being negotiated?  The Department officials referenced looking at other jurisdictions, etc., when they came up with the five days, and I am sure they did.  Where in the civil or public service is it established practice that that would be dealt with?  Is the proposal, say in the example of NUIG, to take back five days from those people or is the proposal that there are two tiers of public servants with some who benefit from the ten days and others who do not?  That is confusing to me and if you do any work at all with victims and survivors of domestic abuse, they will tell you the mixed messages that sometimes come from the establishment are deeply hurtful.  On the one hand you might say you support something but on the other it does not actually manifest.  We all support refuge places but they must be resourced so everyone can access them.  Those mixed messages are deeply hurtful to victims and survivors.  If we are going to establish a minimum threshold it should be set at ten, which is why we are here to debate legislation that provides for ten, but I am interested in the officials' views on how we should start with this, how we should build on it and indeed what is the norm in the private sector.  We have heard Ms La Combre's experience and Dr. Duvvury has experience of the public service.</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned, ten days appears to be the norm.  I have said before it is the floor rather than the ceiling.  We have policies in place where we know when an employer is supporting somebody, if they have exceeded the ten days, the supports will not be stopped and those days will still become available to them.  The policies say ten days in 12 months or whatever but they are not prescriptively sticking to that so it is, as I said, the floor rather than the ceiling.  We should not  be legislating for something that is less than the norm.  We also should not be looking at the lowest common denominator or less than what we already have.  We have these examples in the Republic of Ireland and we have them in Northern Ireland.  This is where we should be looking at what is happening.  These ones are working and employers are keen to get these in place now.  They were not so keen for a very long time.  The unions have been talking about domestic violence as a workplace issue since 2014-----</p></speech>

I am talking about it since 2014.  It took a long time for us to get domestic violence on the workplace agenda.</p><p>Now that it is, and it is now probably more heightened through Covid and hybrid working, etc., employers are more keen to do these policies.  Since we have been able to open the door on them, nobody is saying that ten days is too much.  Nobody is saying that they will not give more than ten days or that we should reduce them when we review them.  That would be my honest opinion on it.</p></speech>

The Department said that it is five days in other jurisdictions.  Australia was the one that had five days, which were unpaid at first.  It has now amended its legislation to ten days.  Canada and New Zealand have ten days.  The Philippines, which was the first country in the world in to do this in 2004, had ten days.  This is the norm.  Italy has three months.  That is where ambition could go.  I contest five days as being the norm.  If the committee would like me to bring more evidence about the ten days as a basic norm, I would be happy to do that.</p></speech>

That would have no impact on what might be available in any individual employer.  This is the statutory leave, but an employer is always free to offer additional leave.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022101800002#H00500"><p>The Department would see that as applying to the civil and public service as equally as to the private sector.  I understand how it works as I have a small amount of experience with it.  If the statutory minimum &ndash; I understand what that is and how that works &ndash; comes in at five days, there is slightly more than a convention within the civil and public service that there would not be a hierarchy when it comes to the implementation of statutory forms of leave and that they would actually have something that is the norm right across the sector.  It just strikes me that we are here debating legislation that I have sponsored, which provides for ten.  However, in the event that is rolled back on by the Government or indeed cut in half down to five, that will cause a problem within the civil and public service.  As a former representative for public sector workers, I do not think they would tolerate having a hierarchy or some kind of a tiered arrangement just simply because some organisations chose to be proactive.  I would hope that the Department would reflect on the message that it sends, that ten days is the norm in the private sector where it is negotiated and it is the norm in the public service where it exists, yet the proposal will be to cut that in half.  That is not a great place to start from.  I completely understand that our witnesses are not here to defend the thought process behind it and I am not asking them to do that.  However, some thought will have to be given by the Department to how this will be implemented.  The colleagues of the people who will implement this in the civil and public service will be part of that two-tier arrangement.  That does not send out a very good signal at all.</p> <p>  With the Chair&rsquo;s indulgence, I reference the definition of an employee, which was referred to by Deputy Sherlock.  I take Deputy Sherlock&rsquo;s point.  That is why I use the Organisation of Working Time Act, because I believe that contains within it sufficient definition.  However, there is a broader piece of work that needs to be done and it is most likely done at the committee of which I am a permanent member &ndash; the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We should look at that definition of what a worker is, because it is not what it would have been when our parents were heading off to work.  It is different when we are heading off to work, definitely different when our kids will go to work and when our grandkids will go to work it will be different again.  That needs to be updated to reflect all types of employment.  I fully take on board the point made by Deputy Sherlock.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.411" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022101800002#H00600"><p>I thank everyone for sharing their insights today.  We are grateful to Deputies O&rsquo;Reilly and McDonald for developing this legislation.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, in contrast to last week, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth tabled the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill without any provisions for domestic violence leave.  He said he will bring those in on Committee Stage, but that would not allow us to discuss them properly or propose the inevitable improvements required.  I do not agree that the Bill reflects the seriousness of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to support people experiencing domestic violence.  In fact, I think it reveals the opposite and the domestic violence leave component is an afterthought.  It is just not being professionally handled in that sense.  </p> <p>  Nonetheless, this Bill is the focus for today.  I think we are all in agreement that victims and survivors of domestic violence are especially vulnerable and leave specifically for this reason is important.  It recognises the realities involved and helps people in desperate need. </p> <p>  The issue around IBEC has come up in nearly every contribution.  Needless to say, it was embarrassing and a disgrace for it to come out with those comments.  We are all kind of in agreement that it is not relevant to the discussion that we are having here today.  We are not going to introduce anything along those lines.  However, it speaks to a kind of broader issue that is relevant to today, in that people do not seem to have an understanding of domestic violence for that suggestion to come out.  People were wondering what it meant by &ldquo;prove it&rdquo;.  Imagine - does one turn up with visual injuries?  It is important to highlight as well some of the things that the witnesses said today, such as &ldquo;private matter&rdquo;.  We still see it as a private matter and not a public concern.  That is very true.  The focus is on the victim and not the perpetrator.  Despite the fact that domestic violence affects so many people, there just does not seem to be that awareness, as shown when we had IBEC coming out and saying that.  </p> <p>  The discussion around the five days speaks to that problem as well.  It is as if we still do not seem to quite grasp the reality of what it is like for somebody leaving domestic violence.  I have encountered it, for example, when people are fleeing domestic violence and going to the local authority in need of emergency accommodation and then being asked to prove that they are homeless.  If a person has just left a violent situation and has their children, bags, potentially their pets and whatever with them, it is not possible to prove that.  Being met with that kind of hostility very often results in people returning to those violent situations because they feel that they have nowhere else to go.  We have had witnesses before this committee and one of the ones that I just want to rewind to for a moment is Marie Mulholland, who came to speak to us from the West Cork Women Against Violence Project.  She highlighted the unique barriers that women face in rural areas when they are fleeing domestic violence and the court days, trying to get the safety orders and all the different things.  It is not a neat five days and the five days do not necessarily come one after the other.  We also have to take into consideration that people are often making the transition into single parenting and doing things such as managing school runs and other extra-curricular activities.  Five days is just not going to cut it in all reality.  I just wanted to start with that.</p> <p>  My first questions are for Dr. Duvvury.  She outlined the role of other reasonable accommodations, such as flexible working, a support to seek protection orders and clear safety measures to maintain confidentiality and privacy as being key comprehensive domestic violence leave legislation.  Can she elaborate on the importance of the suite of measures that we might need to look at?  In her briefing document, she outlined larger issues that surround this type of leave, such as lack of awareness or survivors perhaps not being able to take leave because of a feeling of insecurity around losing their job.  Can she share some more insights from her research or other jurisdictions that could help address those issues?  Her briefing paper also referred to protection for workers from their abusers while they are in the workplace.  Can she outline what that would involve?  Are there examples from other jurisdictions that we might be able to look at?</p> <p>  We know that know that the labour market traditionally has been a hostile place for women, with many ingrained malpractices and cultures that still remain.  It is not that long ago that women had to leave work when they simply got married.  In what material ways does Ms La Combre think domestic violence holds working women back today?  She rightly highlighted how leave should be part of a broader domestic violence and work policy that would also support survivors in other ways.  Can she expand on that point and give examples of those supports?</p></speech>

We will start with Dr. Duvvury, who will be followed by Ms La Combre and anyone else who wants to come in.</p></speech>

New Zealand has flexible working arrangements.  It is also articulated that if a woman experiencing domestic violence requests flexible working arrangements, the employer must try to facilitate this.  Interestingly, this is also an element in many state-level policies in the United States.  As Deputy Cairns knows, the US has no federal legislation on domestic violence.  Everything in the US is under the Family and Medical Leave Act.  At the state level, many states have specific domestic violence leave measures.  They have articulated the importance of ensuring that flexible working arrangements are possible for a domestic violence survivor to request and that this request must be seriously considered by the employer.</p><p> Financial support is also important.  This has been well-articulated in Vodafone's policy and by some of the businesses that have domestic violence leave policies.  They have either given loans for accommodation or to meet the costs of moving.  It can be a loan, a grant or any kind of financial assistance.</p><p> The third idea comes from the US.  It involves employers supporting women to get safety orders to address harassment by the perpetrator at the workplace.  We know that for a majority of women who experience domestic violence, the act of violence does not stop at the home.  It travels to work and to the office.  Employers have seen their employees be killed at the workplace.  It has created a great concern.  Employers can play a role in seeking protection orders for employees.  It may involve support for the woman to seek an employment protection order or the employer reaching out to services to help the woman to get a protection order.  Employers also need to interact with and have a vast referral network to other services.  These are some of the accommodations.</p><p> I am sorry.  What was Deputy Cairns's other question?</p></speech>

Studies have been done in Australia and Canada that showed that women did not apply for leave because there is some fear.  We are talking about culture and Deputy Cairns referred to it, wherein some think that the women are at fault, that it is not that serious, and that they are slackers who want leave, so the supervisor or employer is then more likely to question why they are taking the leave.  That has acted as an impediment to women requesting leave.  This has to be addressed by having proper education, training and policies to support women to ask for leave.  Just passing legislation about leave is not sufficient.</p></speech>

Much research shows that women lose their jobs as a result of suffering domestic violence.  In ICTU's research a number of years ago, there was much commentary about how women lost their jobs.  In cases where managers are unaware of or unsympathetic to the reasons for persistent lateness, unexplained absence or poor performance, employees can find themselves disciplined or even dismissed.  Losing a job and an independent source of income is a disastrous outcome for anybody suffering from domestic violence.  We know there is documentation correlating vulnerability and loss of income.  People suffering domestic violence are more at risk of this because of the disrupted nature of their employment.  If they are consistently losing jobs and in precarious work, the chances of them being able to get away from their abuser or to get themselves out of the situation are lowered since the financial part is so important.  The employer supporting them with policies and paid leave is a significant issue.  Keeping a job is keeping a path to freedom.</p> <p>  Regarding domestic violence workplace policies and practical supports, I refer to everything that Dr. Duvvury said.  I have plenty of examples of practical supports where no negative actions would be taken for poor performance, excessive absence or anything like that.  That is in keeping with looking after people.  Supports include making flexible working arrangements available and offering temporary or permanent changes in locations in work roles if they are front-facing.  A significant matter arising in the ICTU survey was that 80% of people surveyed were abused at work on their phone or email, so another support might involve diverting phone calls and emails.  We have salary advances in our workplace policies too.  Some are financial institutions, so if there is coercive control because people's partners are financially controlling them, the institutions can set up separate accounts for them.  There are different things that some employers can do.  We have seen three or four nights in a hotel being paid for by employers.  That is in my own policy at work and possibly in the Vodafone policy and supports people who are escaping violent situations, possibly at a minute's notice.  It is about ensuring that they never work alone, safety planning and so on.  All of this has to be in tandem with the leave.</p> <p>  I know I am a big promoter of workplace policies.  I think they are an important part of this.  In the absence of good, robust workplace policies where the organisation understands the issue, it is talked about and the stigma is broken, I cannot see people taking up paid leave.  I cannot see situations where people will go to human resource managers to ask if it is not spoken about in the workplace, not signposted or not something that other colleagues can talk about.  Much research shows that people disclose this to a colleague rather than to a manager or to someone in HR.  Everybody in the workplace knows that it is happening.  That is why policies are so important.</p></speech>

I thank everyone from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Department.  Many of my questions have been asked.  One thing that we have all learned is that this is about the victims and getting legislation through as quickly as possible.  I have worked with the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  Previous speakers spoke about women's refuges.</p><p>I am a Carlow Deputy.  I have had several meetings with the Minister and her Department.  We are focused on a refuge for Carlow.  The biggest issue is the wraparound supports, which are absolutely crucial.  The Government is committed.  I know it has not been easy.  Covid really highlighted many things to us.</p><p> What Ms La Combre said about work policies being talked about is very important.  None of us want anyone to be in a situation in the workplace where he or she cannot talk, or is afraid something will happen.  That is what we want to do.  We have to get this legislation passed as soon as possible.</p><p> Dr. Duvvury's opening statement was very powerful.  I firmly believe this legislation is a significant milestone.  All of us want it.  We need to progress this and get it through as quickly as possible.  I read the officials' statement which said that within two years, there would be an option of ten days' leave.  This is part of their remit.  It is doable.  All of us have learnt today that this is about making the right choices as soon as possible.</p><p> I work with victims in my own area.  Financial support is very important.  I am probably repeating myself.  Anyone who is a victim should be able to talk and go into a workplace to look for help.  That is what we have to do today.  I very much welcome this legislation.</p><p> Officials from the Department spoke about tendering for a partner to help to develop templates and guidance for employers of all sizes.  What does that entail?</p><p> I am very glad to be part of what will be a considerable change.  I will say to all parties across the board that this is not about us here today.  It is about the victims.  It is about getting the legislation through as quickly as we can.  I am committed to it.  I have been very touched by the statements about working with and representing victims in the workplace.  It is very important.</p></speech>

We are seeking a partner to develop templates that will help all different types of employers, from very small SMEs to larger employers, to develop training and supports to build their domestic violence policies and to provide advice for a period of time.  Issues may arise with the policy that is developed, in which case the partner would provide expertise.  The reason we are going out to tender for a partner is that we look at family leave.  We do not really have expertise on workplace and HR policy.  That is why we are looking for someone to develop such policy with us.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.428" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022101800002#K00400"><p>I was very much taken by Dr. Duvvury's contributions.  I could listen to her all day.  We do not hear very much about the point she made in her statement about the tendency among people who have experienced domestic violence to minimise it.  They tend to feel that it was not that bad, that they had a lucky escape or that it was worse for a previous person.  We do not talk about that part of domestic violence enough.  It comes back to ensuring people are believed and supported.</p> <p>  I am conscious that before we had legislation in place on coercive control, people associated domestic violence with physical violence and did not look at other forms of violence, such as emotional abuse and coercive control, and all of the negative impacts they have.  The legislation has been positive in two respects.  Obviously, perpetrators can be brought to justice when there is legislation in place.  In addition, this legislation has changed the conversation in society.  There are even advertisements about it.  One often hears Safe Ireland talking about somebody being on the phone saying he or she is sick, has a headache or cannot make it.  We all seen such situations in some way, shape or form.</p> <p>  The ten days' leave is important because it is not just about the days; it is also about having the conversation, over and again, until people in society realise that domestic violence is a real situation and a real problem.  We have to figure out how to tackle it from way beyond getting to the fact that ten days' leave is needed.  We have to tackle it from an early part of life by letting children know what a healthy relationship is and what red flags to look out for.  The more we have legislation, conversations and support, the more the conversation is widened.</p> <p>  All of the members left in the room are female.  I know men experience domestic violence, but it is primarily women who experience it.  These women might be more likely to come to us more than to a male Deputy.  The conversation has moved on a great deal, even from when I was first elected in 2016.  We can often dwell on how long it takes to make changes, especially in this institution.  Even though the change can be small, at least it is progress.  I always hope that one or two women tuning in will ask whether they are in that situation and look at what has been happening to them for years, which they have been accepting and seeing as the norm.  Perhaps all the gaslighting and conditioning makes them think it is normal when, in fact, it is not.</p> <p>  It is not just about the ten days.  They are crucial, but having legislation for ten days will show that people will be believed and allow them to have the confidence to come forward, even if they never actually need the ten days and are able to work around it.  From a practical point of view, if somebody in an abusive relationship seeks a protection order, that is at least one full day in court.  The case will obviously be heard during Monday-to-Friday hours.  The person then has to apply for a safety order, which may take more than one day.  Deputy Cairns touched on this with regard to a lady from west Cork.</p> <p>  Safety and protection orders fall under the family courts.  It might be different in the cities from in rural areas, but in Kilkenny we have one family court sitting per month.  If a person is on the court's list, it may get to him or her, but the person has to be in court for the entire day and may have to come back on a different day.  Three days are gone straight away before the person ever contacts the Garda.  It could take hours, days or weeks to give a statement to the Garda.</p> <p>  When one looks at all that, it is not surprising that only one in three women report, which I did not realise was the statistic until today.  That is why.  It is overwhelming and the person has to keep trying to prove domestic violence in various ways, even if proof is not sought.  The ten days are absolutely vital not just from a practical point of view, but also from the point of view of us changing as a society.  We may be getting into difficulties in that it may be unfair of us to legislate for five days when some very good private sector employers such as Danske Bank and Vodafone and others are already providing ten days and are, in fairness, leading the way.  Where does that leave people?  Will those employers go back to five days?</p> <p>  I understand I have not asked any questions.  I sought to make the point to the Department that it should look at those ten days in the Bill and see how important they are.  I acknowledge the work that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has done, and especially the work of Dr. Duvvury.  I acknowledge the work she has done, in general, but the points she has made today are very important.  We need to speak about those points much more often.</p><p>Does anyone want to make any closing remarks?</p></speech>

I do not think I could put it any better than the Chair has in terms of the upheaval caused to the lives of people trying to deal with this and the importance of creating a safe space where they can withdraw from work for a period and get the support they need.  For us, ten days is key in that regard.</p> <p>  Another point we touched on was trying to ensure this has as broad a scope as possible in respect of employees.  You might say that as a trade union official, I would say that, but it is really important in this context because it is women who are more likely to be in part-time, less secure employment.  For women with a history of experiencing domestic violence, their work history will be impacted by this also.  The narrower you make the definition of "employee", the likelihood is you will miss many people who really need this and they will, therefore, not be able to avail of it.</p></speech>

It is very meaningful to be able to bring research that informs policy making.  I want to end with one very important point, which is that in most economic policies of governments, violence against women is seen as a cultural and, at most, a human rights violation.  It is not seen as an economic issue.  In times of crisis, the first things that are cut are services for survivors of violence.  Domestic violence-led policy is very important because it provides the recognition that this has economic consequences and that is it a working woman's issue, which is very important.  That is the first thing to acknowledge.</p> <p>  Second, the policy will be ineffective if it is not connected to a fight against cutting back on resources for services.  We need the wraparound services.  A cost-of-living crisis is coming around the corner.  There will be austerity and budget cuts, because most governments do not see that the inflation we are experiencing today is not caused by workers' wage demands.  It is because of excessive profits, mark-ups and windfalls in the corporate sector.  The first policy the Government will introduce is austerity, and austerity means cutting services to survivors of violence.  This must be connected to the broader argument.</p></speech>

It is clear that these problems have escalated considerably since the pandemic.</p> <p>  My staff and myself, the vast majority of whom are parents, do our utmost to care for and help these children but we are not experts; we are not psychologists and we are not mental health professionals, and that is the type of help many of our pupils need.  The services providing mental health support to children, while excellent when we can access them, are completely inadequate and understaffed.  Children are suffering and getting worse the longer they must wait for expert help.  This must change.  The way I see it, a number of key areas must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The first is the provision of supports to help children to access learning.  The second is the reduction in long waiting lists and waiting times to access external support services.  The third is to increase capacity for early intervention.  Above all, there needs to be joined-up thinking.</p><p> I am a member of the Irish Primary Principals' Network and I am representing it today.  I echo the calls in the IPPN submission for a seamless, integrated approach across health and education and for teams of health and education professionals to work with school clusters and individual schools to support children directly in the schools where they learn.  Sufficient capacity and timely access to supports for children are key, while training and support to develop a culture of well-being in schools are also needed. </p><p> While the pandemic has made things worse, it is not as though things were great before March 2020.  We have children who are bereaved or whose family unit has fallen apart due to addiction, mental ill health or divorce and separation.  There are children who are homeless, who are living in direct provision or who have fled war-torn countries.  My school has supported children in all of these scenarios.  Some of those children have experienced several of these adverse childhood experiences and traumas simultaneously.</p><p> However, there are times when the needs of these children lie far beyond that which schools alone can provide.  This is the point where external support is needed and, too often, it is the point where children are failed.  We know that for children who are experiencing mental health issues, early and appropriate intervention works.  Delays in service provision have a very damaging effect on those experiencing mental health difficulties, their families, communities, schools and other State services.  Children with mental health difficulties cannot afford to wait.  Invariably, the longer the wait, the more entrenched the problem becomes.</p><p> Why is this happening?  First, there are acute recruitment challenges across a range of services, including the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, children's disability network teams, CDNTs, and Tusla.  The longer it takes to fully staff these services, the worse the outcomes for these vulnerable children will be.  This is urgent and the system needs to do better.   </p><p> Waiting lists are another issue.  Our understanding is that waiting lists for services such as CAMHS, which were already overstretched in 2020, have increased by almost half.  In fact, in our experience, a significant proportion of referrals to CAMHS do not even meet the criteria to be placed on a waiting list so many children are left with nothing.</p><p> In schools, there can be issues regarding what we call "behaviours of concern" in classrooms and school yards and these behaviours can be severe for the children in question and those around them.  Schools struggle to manage cases of extreme behaviour due in part to a lack of relevant training as well as capacity issues in the support services such as the National Behaviour Support Service, NBSS.  Managing the behaviour becomes the focus and the cause of the behaviour is not addressed as schools and parents do not have access to the professional supports or guidance needed for the child.  Early intervention is essential.  It is our assertion that the services provided under the Departments of Health and Education are completely separate, disjointed and without linkage between the services provided by either Department and with little or no communication about the children accessing the services.</p><p> The IPPN has made five recommendations, which are detailed in the submission.  Let us develop a culture of well-being, ensure seamless support from health and education, form teams of health and education professionals, provide appropriate and timely training and pilot approaches to support children's mental health.  The IPPN believes these recommendations would go a long way to addressing the current shortcomings and alleviate the suffering of children and we urge the committee to consider them.</p></speech>

I am the director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals.  The NAPD is the professional association for post-primary school leaders in Ireland and provides a united voice for principals and deputy principals on issues of common concern across all three post-primary education sectors.  I will speak from a practical perspective to identify current practice and to outline some of the challenges facing schools as they endeavour to support students with mental health difficulties.</p> <p>  Outside of the family, post-primary schools play one of the most significant roles in the lives of young adults.  Schools recognise this and, as such, create the structures to support all students to try to help them to reach their full potential.  Schools acknowledge that their role is to meet the needs of their students academically, socially, holistically and pastorally.  This means that schools are recognising the person at the centre of the learning, which is the student, and the significance of the relationship between the student and the teacher in order to achieve successful outcomes in learning.  Students learn better in a positive and supportive environment and the creation of this positive learning environment is at the core of the culture in every school.</p> <p>  The majority of students will engage with their learning without any major or persistent issues.  However, an increasing number of students are encountering difficulties, which impacts on their ability to engage positively with their learning.  Schools recognise this and endeavour to respond to support their students.  Most schools have a student support team in operation.  This team involves all of the significant school personnel to support the student, for example, the principal and-or deputy, the career guidance counsellor, the year head, the special needs co-ordinator and other qualified and interested teachers.  The student support team will meet regularly and implement school-based interventions to support the engagement of the student with his or her learning in school.  There are, however, limits to what the student support team can do to support students.  Schools are only available to students during their opening hours from Monday to Friday and for 166 school days in the year.  In addition, it is particularly concerning if a student is not attending school, which is a common consequence for students who are impacted by mental health difficulties.</p> <p>  Students who are experiencing mental health difficulties and have withdrawn from attending school very often fall between the cracks.  It is fair to say that the majority of schools do not have access to a home school community liaison, HSCL, teacher and this presents particular difficulties for schools connecting with the home to positively collaborate in the best interest of the student.</p> <p>  Schools get significant support from NEPS and it is very interesting to hear from its director in her forward to the Department of Education publication, Student Supports in Post-Primary Schools, published in 2021.  In this document, she writes "many factors that influence a young person&rsquo;s wellbeing are beyond the reach of schools".  Schools acknowledge this and they continue to work to support their students in the best way they can.  She continues by stating that "a strong support system in a school can be a vital first step in addressing difficulties, whether through providing inschool interventions and/or through involving specialist services".  Therein lies a significant issue for schools - linking with and working with the professional services in the best interest of the student.  Schools can only do so much and then require the support from professional services for the student.  Schools do not have the expertise, facilities and qualified staff to deliver mental health supports to their students.  Schools are not medical establishments, treatment centres or counselling clinics.  They are in fact schools whose primary responsibility is the delivery and support of learning.  </p> <p>  This does not, however, undermine the responsibility that schools have to support their students to engage them with their learning and schools generally do this well.  The NAPD would support a call for stronger links for schools with the professional mental health support services, the medical professionals and therapeutic services in a collaborative way to help students to participate fully in their learning and to reach their full potential in their school.</p> <p>  Finally, I reiterate a message in my written submission.  There is a need to expedite senior cycle reform to ensure it is more student-centred in its content delivery and assessment practices.  This must be coupled with a reimagined procedure for the selection of students for places in higher education.  The terminal assessment and the higher education selection process, in my opinion, are significant factors that contribute negatively to student mental health.  I thank the committee for listening and I am very happy to answer any questions that it may have. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.444" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Craig Petrie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101800002#C00300"><p>On behalf of the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, ACCS, I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  In the past number of years, we have become aware that mental health impacts have been significant in our adolescents.  Access to guidance counselling and pastoral care or student support teams within schools remains the first port of call for many of our young people.  In the absence of readily available mental health supports within the community or in clinical settings, schools act as a de facto emergency department for mental health and well-being difficulties.</p> <p>  The guidance allocation for schools is set out by the Department of Education.  The role of our guidance counsellors has changed and evolved enormously in the past decade.  With the introduction of the new junior cycle, the whole school guidance plan now covers just that - the whole school - in which the guidance allocation forms part of student support and is a pillar of well-being, both as a curricular item and as a tangible for our students&rsquo; lives.  That is a lot.  The ACCS would also note that our community and comprehensive schools with further education programmes do not get a career guidance teacher allocation for those programmes.</p><p>Providing schools in our sector with this allowance is essential if our learners are to benefit from the SOLAS national further education and training, FET, strategy.</p><p> Many mental health difficulties manifest in adolescence.  In addition, we can now see a measurable increase in mental health difficulties.  That increase is to crisis levels.  In our submission, we have cited a study that lays out "a growing need to implement policies that will help children and adolescents cope with the short-term and long-term psychological effects of the pandemic".  Schools see these issues every day, and every day we have to triage our time and attention based on what we know about those we already support educationally and pastorally and what we may need to do for the broken child in front of us now or for the terrified parent on the phone.</p><p> The physical activity and well-being study, PAWS, showed an increase in depressive symptoms across adolescents during school closures.  This is borne out in our schools too.  It is a significant challenge.  We are finding that, even outside the overwhelmed guidance counselling support we can offer and that can only be spread so thin, our special education teaching, SET, allocation remains stretched beyond breaking point by the surge in academic and well-being needs brought about by multiple school closures.</p><p> We look for help outside our walls, and we acknowledge the work of organisations and agencies that listen to us and try to help.  Formally, links between schools and NEPS continue to be good on an individual basis, but schools observe that the level of day-to-day support is compromised by the small number of referrals that schools can make to a psychologist in a given year.  The current focus of NEPS on emotionally based school avoidance is necessary and welcome and it is working, but the service's time is finite and its resources are meagre, which means that other areas are not being addressed at the level they were before 2020.</p><p> Links between the education sector and health services through local CDNTs are inconsistent and the provision of CAHMS remains different from region to region.  In both cases, staffing means that waiting lists vary but are always prohibitively long and students in senior years can age out of services before they reach the front of the queue.  It should never be the advice of any principal or education professional that bringing a self-harming child to an emergency department is the quickest way to access significant services.  On foot of these issues, the response of schools will continue to be individual and often based not necessarily on best practice, but on the practical availability of care for the students in our respective geographical areas.  A large amount still remains reliant on the relationships that school staff have with individuals in local services rather than on developed and established pathways.</p><p> Schools are fortunate.  Every year, we get an allocation of teachers based on our enrolment numbers and, in general, schools can appoint teachers to fill those posts.  We know how strongly that contrasts with therapist roles in the HSE across all geographical areas, which are both under-resourced and underfilled.  Unless and until mental health services are brought to a level that matches the increasing needs of our young people, schools will continue to bear the brunt of this.</p><p> When we train our new teachers, it could be that basic training in mental health would be of benefit to our students.  It makes sense for this training to be given through initial teacher education or through the Droichead qualification process.  Our teachers of social, personal and health education, SPHE, and relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and our student support teams are conversant in this and have experience working with adolescents who might suffer from poor mental health.  It could be a good thing that all of our classroom teachers would know that this is something for them to understand and assist with, in the same way that education for students with additional needs has moved into the wheelhouse of the classroom teacher rather than just being the job of the support teacher.  However, in doing this, we might normalise the idea that schools are the place for this intervention.</p><p> Student voice initiatives in schools are important and can help the development of student-centred and student-led solutions, but we are the adults in the room and it is important that we deal with issues around poor mental health.  Schools cannot keep carrying this.  We do not have the professional expertise.  We are juggling with students' health and we are terrified of dropping a ball.  We do not have the time.  As long as we continue to act in place of proper services, students will continue to fall between the cracks and schools will continue to have to choose whether we support a child in mental health crisis at the cost of the child with a specific learning difficulty.  Some of these choices will have a cost.  In our submission, we have pointed to a need for policy, for pathways and for adequate people to be in place across services, of which education is just one.  We all need a co-ordinated approach to this if we are to help our children.</p></speech>

My opening statement will be a summation of a more comprehensive submission that we have made to the committee.</p> <p>  No one in this room needs any lecture on the reality that there exist high levels of damage to young people's mental health due to the isolating and anxiety-inducing effects of the Covid-19 lockdowns and school closures, the impact of technologies on teenagers in particular, the relentless pace of change, and the shortage of community-based services and supports.  Recent reports of dramatic increases in cases of online bullying, the vast majority of which occur outside school settings, demand urgent action.  The social and emotional effects of these anxieties are reflected back into our schools through the attitudes and behaviours of students.  It must be accepted by policymakers that seeking to site both the problem and the solution solely at the door of our schools and colleges represents neither a realistic nor an honest solution to this challenge.</p> <p>  While the challenges and solutions are multifaceted, I wish in this brief statement to argue that one of the most effective and, indeed, cost-effective measures the State can provide is to bring our guidance counselling services up to a level where appropriate supports can be given exactly where and when our young people - 1 million of them - are to be found, that is, in our nation's schools.  The JMB's 2023 pre-budget submission is clear about the challenges facing our schools in terms of their guidance counselling provision.  The recent chief inspector's report makes repeated reference to the need for system-level supports to enhance provision for guidance and counselling in our schools, saying: "Continued enhancement of system supports will be required in the area of Guidance and Counselling to address challenges related to recruitment, curriculum and increasing levels of anxiety among students".  This call for enhancement of the service predates the announcements regarding senior cycle and the arrival of students from Ukraine.  As these emerging demands collide with the already inadequate allocation of hours for guidance counselling, which are not yet fully restored from before the financial crash cuts of over a decade ago, the capacity of schools to cope will be unsustainable and cases relating to young people in crisis will spill over into the already overwhelmed CAMHS.</p> <p>  Speaking of such services, one of the greatest challenges facing school management in making provision for students' mental health support is the discontinuity across the health and education systems in terms of access, availability, tracking and interagency communication.  While each service - NEPS, CAMHS, social workers, the HSE and the Garda - is working intensively to provide relevant and timely services, they all suffer not only from capacity challenges and long waiting lists, but also a lack of coherent provision from a school's perspective.  In this respect, the JMB recommends that the Government initiate a review of interagency co-operation, connectivity and communication with a view to supporting schools in their referrals of students in need of mental health supports and interventions.</p> <p>  At school and community service levels, the State must begin to recognise the need to invest in fit-for-purpose interventions to support young people professionally with psychological and psychiatric conditions, those facing LGBT-related mental health challenges, victims of cyberbullying, victims of racism and those engaged in drug abuse, and with tackling the damaging effects of economic disadvantage and social exclusion.</p> <p>  School principals need to be freed from excessive workloads so that they can properly attend to student well-being.  In this respect, the most effective solution lies in the allocation of additional deputy principals, DPs, across schools of all sizes and sectors.  I refer members to the JMB pre-budget submission where the case for additional DP allocation is set out.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for its attention to this issue and we look forward to the report and recommendations that will emerge from this important conversation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.447" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eileen O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101800002#D00300"><p>The NABMSE welcomes the opportunity to speak on this issue.  We represent the boards of management of special schools and mainstream schools with special classes.  Our schools work with and support students with special educational needs, SEN, from four years of age to 18 years of age with mild, moderate, severe and profound disabilities, with autism, with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, SEBD, and also with complex medical needs.  Meaningful access to education and the physical and emotional well-being of our students are always central considerations of our boards of management.</p> <p>  The NABMSE considers that school mental health services are wholly inadequate at post-primary level where students consistently need to be referred to outside agencies for support, where they remain on lengthy waiting lists, even when in crisis.</p><p>This happens because the availability and allocation of qualified counsellors to schools is utterly inadequate given the rise in levels of anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicide ideation, eating disorders, body dysphoria, gender dysphoria and so on among teenagers today.  These are significant issues that, if not addressed early and appropriately, will lead to lifelong difficulties for each of these individuals.</p><p> There is no access to mental health services at primary level or in the special educational context.  Even in a crisis situation, for example, where students talking about suicide and self-harming, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is unable to provide any form of concrete support.  Why do we not have suitably qualified child counsellors in primary schools and special schools as members of school staff?  Many children&rsquo;s difficulties could then be identified and that child could be given early support, thus cutting down on more urgent need for intervention when things have significantly deteriorated for that child.  Sadly, when a critical incident occurs in a school in Ireland, NEPS is only allowed to provide support to the teachers at that school.  Its intervention is designed to assist teachers in counselling and supporting the other children in a school, for example, where their friend has died.  In a special school, staff include teachers, SNAs, care workers, nurses, part-time teachers and bus escorts.   All these staff develop friendships with the pupils and often becoming the first confidante when concerns or difficulties arise.</p><p> In the case of a critical incident, for example, when a child who attends a special school passes away, which happens often in schools where students have complex medical needs, the other pupils and parents understandably become frightened and disorientated.  Their lives are shaken by the enormity of death.  For children, the concept of death - the "never again" - is difficult to comprehend.  SNAs, bus escorts and all the other support staff are not provided with training by the Departments of Education or Health.  The role of trainer and identification of training needs is left to the board of management, principal and teachers in an individual school.</p><p> NABMSE, calls for an immediate review of the critical incident policy in schools in Ireland.  This review must examine how counsellors can be deployed to special schools in emergencies.  We need counsellors with specialised training who can work with children, develop staff skills and assist parents with coping mechanisms.  We need to provide direct training to all the support staff surrounding children in special schools.</p><p> School attendance is an important contributor to the well-being and general mental wellness of our students.  A small percentage of pupils with special educational needs disengage from school for a variety of reasons and others miss substantial time in school due to prolonged illnesses and hospitalisation.  These pupils need to know there is a future for them in further and higher education.  Supports must be put in place early enough to prevent this drop-out or disengagement, which prevents these students with additional needs from ever having the opportunity to engage with further education or training.</p><p> NABMSE also suggests the need to appoint special school liaison teachers who can support families who are often under extreme pressure coping with a child with complex needs.  This teacher would support the children and families in liaising with other agencies, and the positive link with the school could help maintain their child&rsquo;s attendance, positive engagement and achievement in school.  In NABMSE&rsquo;s opinion, the concept of lifelong learning needs to be resourced as early as possible for all pupils presenting with special educational needs in our system.</p><p> Our members' board of management reports that it is difficult to co-ordinate services with the HSE and Department of Education, despite the fact there are established and historical links between them.  We understand that pilot programmes are a way of examining how links can be strengthened.  We are, however, concerned that many pupils in our schools across the country suffer silently without support as they have no interventions for as long as pilot studies takes place elsewhere.  We call for an immediate review of all existing pilot programmes with a view to extending interventions and supports to all pupils with special educational needs.  A strong, consistent, accessible multidisciplinary approach has been severely lacking to date.</p><p> As I said, a small group of children with additional and special needs disengage from school for a number of reasons.  These can be health, family issues, cultural misunderstanding on the part of the school and staff and mental health issues.  We suggest a special school liaison teacher in every special school, continued support for distance learning and the provision of targeted learning to students who cannot attend due to illness, vulnerability, school refusal and mental health issues.  We also call for cultural awareness training for all our staff in our schools as there is a need for emphasis on knowledge, acceptance and celebration of different cultures and blending these cultures into our everyday learning.</p><p> We also need to ensure that students work with other students and look at how groups are formed.  We must develop flexibilities so that students are involved in a wide range of activities and, therefore, in more peer groups.  Children with emotional difficulties currently do not have proper access to psychiatric services.  NABMSE believes this service, along with counselling in schools, needs to be an urgent focus for the Department.</p></speech>

ETBs are currently patrons of 27 community national schools alongside being patrons of schools that cater for one third of all second-level schools, which is 100,000 students in Ireland.</p> <p>  We work in primary, post-primary and tertiary education.  Those schools are welcoming, cater for learners from diverse backgrounds, are learner-centred and attempt to be holistic in everything they do.  We try to support students not just academically but on a range of issues that present, one in particular being mental health issues in the past few years.</p> <p>  Covid-19 has definitely added to that issue although before that, we were severely challenged.  Early intervention is key in preventing children from developing more complex mental health issues later in life.  When schools are adequately resourced, they can play a vital role in the promotion of positive mental health.  We have to recognise that at primary level, however, there are no formal access routes to in-school counselling services and there are no formal structures in all primary schools for supporting students' mental health.  We call for the establishment of student support teams in primary schools to be fully supported.  This could be achieved through a consultation process with the relevant bodies at primary level.</p> <p>  At post-primary level, we are very lucky to have the guidance counsellors who all work hard in this area.  However, we need extended training in more therapeutic counselling rather than career guidance.  Many schools at both primary and post-primary level have significant difficulties accessing supports for students with serious mental health issues.  We heard from other contributors today on the increase in waiting lists to services such as child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Ultimately, however, many of these issues fall to the school to address.  No matter what the level of resources or expertise, parents call on schools first.</p> <p>  Fundamentally, ETBI is of the view that a child-centred approach to mental health services is needed yet currently, various mental health services are working in isolation or in silos.  We have a recent example in County Kerry where a number of agencies including NEPS, the counselling services and Jigsaw came together along with the schools.  They have been brought together to provide training to the student support teams in our post-primary schools in the county.  This multidisciplinary approach to training, which was led by NEPS, has led to significant improvements in the ways that student support teams in the county operate.  We call for this to be looked at and extended.</p> <p>  We also have the challenge of school leaders not being fully sure on who to bring in to support students.  It is the view of ETBI that mental health initiatives should seek approval from a national body such as the Department of Education or NEPS with clear criteria in order that schools can be confident the initiatives and the people they are bringing in are backed and authorised.</p> <p>  ETBs have a proud history of running professional learning networks, PLN.  Teachers and school leaders come together to learn from the best and bring that back to the schools to extend out that learning.  We ask and request that these PLNs be extended into the area of mental health.  Teachers would need to be released to attend the PLNs and paid substitution would be needed for that.  We also see NEPS having a role in providing these PLNs as the resident expert in this area.</p> <p>  We echo the call from previous speakers regarding initial teacher education, and mental health should be part of that.</p><p>However we also believe that all teachers need to be adequately trained on an ongoing basis to enable them to identify students and families who are struggling in terms of mental health and to provide the most appropriate ways to support them.</p><p> What ETBI is calling for is the establishment of student support teams at primary level and the backing of them at post-primary level, which would include an interdisciplinary approach to training those student support teams.  We ask for the establishment of those professional learning networks to ensure that mental health is at the forefront and that this would be supported by NEPS.  We ask that we develop an accredited mental health initiative which is overseen by either the Department or NEPS.  We ask for increased investment in NEPS to allow for further training of school staff and the expansion into counselling services.  We also ask for further exploration into establishing the school-based mental health support teams, which this committee has already started to look at.</p><p> As a former principal who has only been out of the position 14 months, I know the role that schools can play, which we have heard about today.  The key thing for me is that schools are nearly always the first stop for parents when they have an issue with mental health.  They go to schools, which do their best to support that.  However, we need further training and resources in that area.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their important presentations on this issue of great concern.  It is fair to say that the call for resources would be a significant common denominator in all their presentations.  I am sure they would have support from everybody in this room on that.  I will throw a few hot potatoes of varying levels of heat at the witnesses.  There are some issues I am thinking about and some questions I have.  While I support all the calls for resources, I worry that if we only talk about resources there is a danger we will never have enough resources because we will be subject to the ups and downs in the economy and so on.  That is all the more reason that we are able to ask ourselves if there are ways in which the system is failing and if things could be changed that might enhance those resources or prevent the need for them.  For example, I mention the graduate exodus.  Is it a part of the problem that we are not able to get the people we need?  Do we need to think brave thoughts about reserving places for people who commit to staying in the country after they qualify, for example, in the context of the repayment of fees in the future?  Perhaps there could be some way that a debt could be incurred if they do not stay because it seems to me that the brain drain is part of the story.</p><p>I will turn to issues relating to how the system works.  There is an understandable tendency to think in terms of having resources in schools, but that is probably predicated on schools being larger in size.  I question whether that could be a problem.  I mention the concept of Dunbar's number, namely,that people can only relate to 150 other people.  That is an idea that is out there.  Should we be concerned about schools being too big?  Could that be a negative contributor to student mental health?</p><p>In recent days, I was struck by all the talk of the great role that the chaplaincy and spiritual support played in Donegal in the context of the terrible tragedy there.  I am sure the witnesses will have seen various articles on that by various commentators.  In addition to talking about the important role of guidance counsellors should we be saying more about chaplains?  I often think of Victor Frankl's book <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i>and Nietzsche&rsquo;s quote: &quot;He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.&quot;  The Education Act 1998 talks about physical, moral, spiritual and social education.  The SPHE consultation document is much more stripped down and talks about physical and emotional education.  I wonder if we are missing something in the system and if we are, I wonder if we are brave enough to talk about that.  My impression is that what is proposed in SPHE is fairly stripped down and does not talk about much to do with friendship, nor does it mention bereavement at all.  I was interested in what Ms O'Rourke had to say on that subject.  Do we need to start asking questions about the things we discuss and the things we do not discuss?</p><p>I was glad to hear what Mr. Crone had to say about the points system.  The tail of the high points courses is wagging the dog of the whole system.  We have discussed this in this committee before but I refer to preventing student anxiety and mental health problems at whatever level of the scale they are experienced and we have to say that the CAO and the colleges have a responsibility here.  Those are my various potatoes and I would be glad to hear what the witnesses have to say on any or all of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.453" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Curtis" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101800002#F00300"><p>The Senator made some interesting points.  The issue of the graduate exodus troubles us because on one level we are looking for extra provision in the arena of guidance counselling but we know we have a teacher shortage as well so where will we get these guidance counsellors?  It can be planned.  We know the surge in pupil numbers in post-primary education will peak in 2023, so we would imagine that perhaps we should be planning now for the fact that we will have extra teachers on board at that stage.  The graduate exodus is perplexing because we do not know where all the teachers are going.  If you look at the figures we have from the Teaching Council for registered practitioners, there are many more teachers on the books than we have in play.  This year it has not been as acute as it might have been last year, but we need to do a little bit of thinking on where we might get the extra guidance counsellors from.  We would say that some of the training courses we have need to be augmented and we would say the financial assistance for teachers who might want to engage in guidance counselling courses should be put in place.  We would have some solutions that we would be able to suggest in that arena but it is an issue for us.  Even in preparing the submission, the duality we came across was that in talking to the Department, we acknowledged that there is a teacher shortage.  If we bring down the pupil-teacher ratio at this stage in post-primary schools it will cause us difficulties.  We should be planning forward two or three years.  If the Senator looks at our pre-budget submission he will see what our thinking in that arena is.</p> <p>  Schools do not necessarily need to be bigger in the context of giving schools the provision to help students in this sphere.  We made the point on extra help for schools around deputy principal provision.  If the school leader can be freed up as much as possible from some of the administrative duties that the principal will have, the care will trickle down and the principal will be able to spend more time looking after the students in his or her care.  Some kind of change and help for principals around deputy principal provision is hugely important.  When you talk about chaplaincy you are making a point and we have made that point to the Department in a number of engagements.  Schools in our sector do not have chaplains and it would be a fantastic addition to the school system if we could enhance that provision and give it to schools that do not have it.  There would be great value in that.</p> <p>  The SPHE programme will be augmented as we move through it.  The training that will be given to teachers in the SPHE space will allow them to deal with issues such as relationships in a fundamental way.  I am very hopeful that the new SPHE guidelines will help us in this regard.  On the senior cycle, we all hope that the demands on our students might change over the years.  A great deal of work is needed in that space in the coming years but we are all of the view that we need to bring in senior cycle reform to help the mental well-being of our students.</p></speech>

I am struck by Mr. Petrie's presentation because he summed matters up when he stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Schools cannot keep carrying this.  We do not have the professional expertise.  We are juggling with students' health and we are terrified of dropping a ball.  We do not have the time.  As long as we continue to act in place of proper services, students will continue to fall between the cracks and schools will continue to have to choose whether we support a child in mental health crisis at the cost of the child with a specific learning difficulty. </blockquote><p>We are pitting children against one other for resources, which is shameful and has to be stopped.  The idea of us having these hearings and compiling this report is that these issues need to fixed once and for all.  We have been talking for years about what needs to be done.</p><p> My first question relates to the lack of joined-up thinking.  There are NEPS, CAMHS, social workers, the HSE, the Garda and student support teams, all of which work in silos, not in a co-ordinated way, which is what needs to happen.  Who is going to make all these services work together and work with the student support teams?  Why is it not happening?</p></speech>

One thing that unifies them is the child or family in crisis.  These issues are happening within the education sphere but they are health difficulties.  It needs to be between the Departments of Health and Education that we have some oversight of this or someone to tie the issues together.  We need a pathway.  Of course, we need more therapists and psychologists, but we need to tie our groups together better, and that falls within education because health is too distant from us as schools to make that happen.</p> <p>  We schools are the first port of call.  Our chaplains and guidance counsellors are the people to whom these children come.  They graduate to our student support teams and then we look to make a referral, and that is the point where things are breaking down, from where I am sitting as a principal.  We need a dedicated pathway.  Within the children&rsquo;s disability network teams, CDNTs, there are people in charge of looking after assessments of need, AON-----</p></speech>

When a student engages with the professional services, the CAMHS supports will engage with the school at that stage and collect information.  They will send us forms and, potentially, come out and look for information.  Where it breaks down from the school's perspective is that the information does not come back as to what the recommendations are to support it.  When a diagnosis is being looked for, schools readily have that information and provide it, but there is no mechanism in place for that to come back.  No therapeutic supports are available to support schools and that is a call all of us have been making for many years, particularly in regard to the new interventions, the junior cycle, well-being and so on.</p> <p>  The question is whether the therapeutic supports should be hosted in schools and that is a debate that needs to be had.  Principals do not have medical expertise, so there is a supervision issue if it is a medical service.  That is a debate we want to take place but we are not even there yet.   The information is not coming back down to schools.  Once there is a diagnosis letter, the supports are not there to help the student engage with the learning.  I use the word &ldquo;engage&rdquo; specifically because it is the purpose of schools to engage with the learning, not to deliver those therapeutic services-----</p></speech>

It is those interactive, collaborative meetings that do not take place and are very difficult to take place because the creation of time within the system is difficult.</p></speech>

That has changed, and those referrals now have to be made through the GP rather than the school.  The nature of how referrals are made has moved such that they are parent and family centred rather than school centred.  This means it is the parents' responsibility to make the referral, but that assumes parents are agentic and in control and can manoeuvre the web of waiting lists that is out there.  Parents will then ask us whether we can intervene on their behalf, so we need to get written consent from parents for every service under the GDPR and all the other barriers that are put in our way.  There was a time when I could ask for a case conference in respect of a child, where the child was at the centre of the table, and I would speak figuratively before the meeting about the child being at the centre of the table, where I could draw in those services.  That has been diluted to the point where it just does not exist anymore, and that is down to staffing levels and to the cuts that were introduced ten years ago not having been reinstated.  The service has been absolutely skeletised.  We have talked about balkanisation, the need for integration and joined-up thinking and silos.  We have an amazing vocabulary but we have not made the connections we need to make.  I work in a children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s services committee, CYPSC, the young people services committees that try to bring together the health and education services, such as Tusla, CAMHS and primary care.  The Department of Education will not even turn up to discuss these issues.  It tells us it is a matter for the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, or NEPS.  We cannot get it to engage.  I am working on a pilot project in my area, in Dublin 15, to see whether we can get back to doing what we used to do, namely, family-based services.  The one thing we know about almost every child in the country is that they attend school, so let us pull services in around those children in order that we can make a difference.  It comes down to the recruitment and retention issues that the Deputy and other members raised.  Schools can be part of the solution but it is about pulling the services in around the child and putting the child at the centre.</p></speech>

It was great that we had the opportunity to read them before they arrived.  Deputy Conway-Walsh is correct in that a lot of the statements reflected the same kinds of issues and problems, although, obviously, they have had differing experiences.  It struck me that they are calling for teacher training in the area of mental health services, which demonstrates that this is not just about looking for more resources.  It is about a whole-of-education-system approach, so it is reasonable to say we need more resources as well as believing that all teachers should have training.</p> <p>  Mr. Petrie stated that the school is the first port of call.  It is a little bit like a GP; he or she does not necessarily have the expertise to take the matter further but he or she is the first person people come to when they are struggling, and the GP needs to know where the next port of call is.  We hear a lot about the lack of joined-up thinking, and we can look back and say what is not working, but the opportunity that our guests and us in the committee have is that the report will make recommendations, so we should focus on what the positive ones are.  What would each of our guests choose as their top two recommendations in order that we can get this right?</p><p>I do not agree with much of what Senator Mullen said but we do agree on some things.  Not only must we look at mental health services but we must also focus on the difficulties faced in modern life by young people and how we address that in schools, particularly around tolerance.  In some schools I have come across, there is a difficulty with hearing all voices and respecting everyone's opinion.  When that opinion is damaging to another person and the expression of that opinion undermines another person's rights, teachers can feel trapped between two constitutional rights, in some ways.  What can we do before the mental health services get involved?  Are there other things we can do to support teachers in addressing those conflicts, for want of a better word, between students that lead to mental health problems?  I am referring to bullying and so on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.471" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Curtis" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101800002#H00200"><p>A lot of good work has been undertaken in schools in recent years to try to help students who might be having difficulties.  The well-being guidelines produced in conjunction with junior cycle reform are very important.  A review of anti-bullying policies in schools is under way and is also feeding into that.  The document, Looking at Our School, which is a blueprint for best practice in schools, was reviewed this year.  Its initial iteration was in 2016.  Well-being is mentioned 28 times in the document.  We have moved from talking about student voice to student participation.  A lot of good work is taking place in the school communities to try to address some of these issues.  I would like to think that schools are increasingly becoming kinder places because of these kinds of interventions.  We need to that ongoing work at school level to be matched with resources.  While I do not want to come back to resources all the time, it is very important to free up school leaders as much as possible to give them time to reflect.  Augmenting guidance counselling would also be hugely important.</p> <p>  The Senator asked for priorities, and I take her point.  We could do more in initial teacher education.  That is a tick box and a recommendation from this committee would be very important.  The review of services between CAMHS and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not dealing with a simple area.  We know from dealing with social workers and staff in CAMHS that they are, like us, overstretched.  There is no magic solution for this.  We just have to work through it systemically.  We have found that GDPR and confidentiality have closed down certain avenues for us where we used to have informal engagements.  We could reflect on how we can improve on that area.  With some concrete suggestions from the committee, allied to the good work taking place in schools which will continue through measures such as the SPHE guidelines, we will make our schools healthier places for our children.</p></speech>

I take the point that a chaplain can be enormously supportive resource in a school.  However, many of our schools do not serve Catholic populations.  We have a wide range of Educate Together schools, community and national schools and non-designated schools in the ETB system.  I do not mind what an extra support person is called in the school but if we are to be truly inclusive, we need counsellors who are trained to support a wide range of students.  We should perhaps widen our thinking a little.  Do we need to take a teacher out of a school in order that he or she can return as a guidance counsellor or counsellor?  Can we train counsellors who are not necessarily teachers to go directly into schools?  I know staffing is a huge issue at the moment.</p> <p>  Another point that was raised, one to which I referred in my opening statement, was cultural awareness training.  If our schools are to be meaningfully inclusive in the way they operate, we need to address a lot of issues.  Professor Dympna Devine published a study not long ago which showed that over 95% of our teachers are white and Eurocentric in their views.  We have black children and children who are gay or may have a disability who can go through the entire system and never see themselves positively reflected anywhere.  I am doing a small study at the moment.  Students, while they acknowledge black history month and cultural awareness week, say that when they return to the classroom where the important stuff happens the curriculum is white, fully-abled and straight.  There are very practical things we can do around that to help people feel less othered, more included and positively reflected in our system.  Obviously, that will help with students' level of engagement and their self-worth and self-esteem.</p></speech>

Within that, we can start with some good and easy points or the low-hanging fruit.  We have given some examples from the ETBI submission, which has been echoed elsewhere, about initial teacher education.  That needs to be looked at but there is also the ongoing training of staff.  That is very resource light but its impact can be huge.  We spoke about the PLNs where one person is trained in bringing that network back to the staff.  It is not about everyone suddenly being experts but about people being able to pinpoint, address and see where issues are coming from and to support them in that.</p> <p>  We gave the example of what happened in Kerry using an interdisciplinary approach.  I will give the example of the regional education and language teams, REALTs, and the response to the Ukrainian crisis.  I chair the Dublin committee.  Very quickly, we brought together the ETBs representing the schools, the NCSE and NEPS and Tusla was represented through the education welfare services.  They have come together and worked extremely quickly using an interdisciplinary approach.  It is possible.  While we are looking for long-term resources, we also have to look at ways we can do this quickly without adding a huge amount of resources with it.</p></speech>

We are on resources, however.  We will leave it there.</p></speech>

I found them very helpful.  I will start by asking Mr. McGorman a question.  I am conscious that society keeps expanding the role and responsibilities it expects teachers and schools to perform.  Assuming that there is not an issue in respect of resources and taking into account that teachers, in fairness, are not qualified medical practitioners, what role should schools and teachers primarily play when it comes to mental health issues with the students before them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.476" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Enda McGorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101800002#H00700"><p>We very much see our role as tapered.  It is in the support for all.  That is why we are developing whole-school policies and practices where we look at the entire student population.  We have had a huge growth in the number of programmes available.  In fairness to the providers, substantial training has been provided in rolling these out through NEPS and so on.  It is to our despair that notwithstanding all the initiatives we have in school, schools are kinder places and much more student-focused than might have been the case in the past.  However, because of changes in society, which have been mentioned and I do not propose to list again, we find that all the anxiety, mental health issues and difficulties that have been mentioned are on the increase in spite of all those services.  We look at support for all, then support for the many and then support for the few.  Our role in school is to say we need external support and expertise.  Unfortunately, that is the point when we put our hands out and there is nothing there.  We feel like the system is broken all around us and we are the only thing left standing.</p></speech>

The primary function is in the delivery and support of learning.</p><p>Very often schools can identify issues while delivering their primary function.  Schools are very good at supporting all.  Student support teams are good at supporting the sum but the critical part comes with the few and that is where we struggle.  Schools identify when supporting students, engaging with the curriculum and engaging with their learning.  That is when issues can be identified by schools but it is not our primary function.</p></speech>

They have many more difficulties than children who are able to attend mainstream school and maybe not need any extra support.  A child who already knows that they are very differently abled and who may have very complex feelings about that or who may not be able to communicate appropriately then they need somebody very specialised who can actually understand the messages that they are trying to send.  As Mr. McGorman mentioned earlier, these can come out as behaviours of deep concern so highly assaultive and damaging behaviours.  A child who behaves in that way is a child in crisis.  Currently we do not have the personnel, we do not have the time and sometimes we do not have the appropriate physical space to support that child even within the school and classrooms.</p></speech>

Mr. Petrie referred to the PAWS report.  Has other qualitative and quantitative research been done which indicates the extent of mental health issues within schools?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.487" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Craig Petrie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101800002#J00900"><p>Yes.  The ESRI looked at a similar issue and published its report.  Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan and her group compiled a report called A Qualitative Study of Child and Adolescent Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ireland.  The Institute of Public Health has published a blog which is a study on the impact of Covid-19 on the mental health of people living on the island of Ireland.  There is plenty of material for us to back up the numbers if we need to and I think it is more than anecdotal at this stage.  That is important and that is why we quoted those reports because this issue is more than saying, "We think it might be more severe than we had feared."  This really is what we have talked about for the past two or three years and it has landed with our staff now.</p></speech>

What we have found having talked to people who work in schools is that first-year students seem to be socially a little bit behind where they might have been so one will have an exacerbation of problems as we move through the system.  I hope that the situation will settle.  Personnel at school level are marvellous in trying to make up for these deficiencies in the manner in which they engage with the pupils.  Most schools now have care teams comprised of caring individuals from within the school community so a lot is being done.  Certainly this has highlighted the importance of schools in the first instance.</p></speech>

In my ETB, for example, we are doing psychological first aid.  First, we are training a group of teachers in youth reach and that will go out then to primary and post-primary schools.  It means a small network of people but maybe one from every school gets good training in psychological first aid.  As Mr. Crone has said, it is not about replacing expertise but to give some ideas to staff such as how to identify, how to see it and what can be done from there.  Training can be done very simply at a schools level, regional level or county level.</p></speech>

The change is probably an indication that this is an issue that needs attention and that students are not getting to school.  That would be across schools rather than just those with home-school liaison officers.</p></speech>

So unlike clinical and, potentially soon, counselling psychology, the educational psychologists who are predominantly hired by the public education have received no support yet are required to pay extremely high fees of more than &euro;11,000 but they are not reimbursed for their work.  By comparison, in the HSE clinical psychiatrists who study to the same doctoral level get 60% fee cover and a modest salary.  Would the delegation see a similar approach to education and counselling psychologists being trained to work in the education system?  Why is there a difference?</p></speech>

It was not initially at PhD level but at masters level but funding was set aside with pay to pursue the course.  Unfortunately, this scheme is another victim of the cuts and it was never restored.  We have forgotten to look back at things that worked well pre the guillotine at the time.  The scheme did work.  The routes into educational psychology are challenging.  We cannot get teachers to stay in this country to teach, therefore, it stands to reason that the same applies to asking them to stay yet give up pay and pay exorbitant fees for the privilege of becoming an educational psychologist and then the challenges of staying within the system because of the demands that are placed on them.  We need a root-and-branch review of all entry-level programmes for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, psychology and right across the board.</p></speech>

We also made very strong submissions on mid-career conversion courses where people may have expertise.  I have a degree in psychology as well as being a school principal.  There are many people with multiple qualifications who could do a conversion course.  We need to be very creative with all of the entry routes, including speech and language, educational psychology, occupational therapy and right across the system, if we are to tackle this issue right now because the vacancies are right across the system.

I thank the schools, school communities and boards of management around the country.  I have no doubt this is a complex and far-reaching issue on which so much needs to be done.  I know all involved are doing their best to try to grapple with where we are.  There is no doubt that pupils are experiencing emotional distress, trauma and bereavement, as was highlighted during the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is fair to say that there is no one size to fit every situation.  We need supports in place for students and teachers.  There is no doubt we also need to look after the mental health of teachers.</p> <p>  It is important that we acknowledge that there has been a shift.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, sought and received funding of &euro;5 million for a pilot scheme for a programme of counselling supports for children.  That is ground-breaking in the development of school counselling.  Those supports offer an opportunity for early intervention, which is of great importance.  More important, this also brings recognition that mental health in schools is an educational issue.</p> <p>  Mr. McGorman stated that in his experience education has not come to the table.  That concerns me and it is important that we try to do something about it because the particular link that was made indicated a divergence from the opinion that this is a health issue and not an educational one.  I hope that will herald change.  I acknowledge Se&aacute;na Brady who did a of work in my party on that issue.</p> <p>  We should have preventative measures in place to ensure positive mental health as opposed to dealing with crises when they arrive.  I have some experience of restorative justice.  My understanding had been that this was a process that teachers and principals could bring in to schools when negative behaviour arose and that it could provide support in that way.  It was a very good system.  I was in a school recently in Newbridge where the teacher uses different forms of this throughout a school lesson and I was greatly impressed.  This was to check in where students were and they could give a number.  I am sure many of the witnesses are familiar with this.  It was excellent and gave every pupil an opportunity to be heard with respect to where he or she was at that particular time point in time.  I ask the witnesses to respond on that.</p> <p>  I agree that the whole-school, community-based approach is important, with stakeholders coming together.  I am from Rathangan, which is a small town, and we had a very difficult situation approximately 12 years ago, which I will not go into now.  We had a fantastic response from all the State services.  They came together and formed a circle with the school and community.  It very much worked in preventing further suicides and trying to ensure the young people felt heard, whether they needed to have positive mental health examples in their life or were in crisis themselves.  I agree with the importance of home school liaison teachers and I am conscious of schools that do not have such a teacher.  I completely agree with NABMSE on having a special school liaison teacher appointed to support families.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to comment, including on preventative measures and supporting positive mental health if they so wish.  We need to support teachers the whole way along on this.</p></speech>

In recent years, we have become more acutely aware of the need to help students in this area.  The Senator mentioned looking after school communities and teachers.  As a pilot project, we brought in a mindfulness programme this year for some of our principals whereby they could engage regularly with a number of expert practitioners online to work things out themselves.  We will pilot the programme in schools to see if we can get some teachers to take part in the course and perhaps they can then bring it to their pupils.  We are all learning in this space.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned restorative justice.  That has been very useful in many of our schools.  We are all in learning mode and it is important that we share best practice.</p> <p>  I will come back to one issue on resources, if I may.  I have been appearing before this committee for many years, including when it was chaired by the Senator.  I have great faith in the practitioners around this table and the officials in the Department of Education.  The Senator mentioned the Minister.  We find that the officials and the Minister will advocate for funding on our behalf.  I know that talking about resources is not the be-all and end-all but it is still frustrating for us that even the latest OECD figures show Ireland is so far down the table in the context of overall investment in education.  That has nothing to do with the people in this room.  I know how invested in education everybody here, departmental officials and the Minister are.  However, I refer to the proportion of the national pie available to education because I may not appear at this committee many more times.  Unless politicians look at the proportion of the national pie that goes into education in the first instance, we are all going to struggle.  That is my personal plea at this juncture.</p></speech>

These are becoming the central issue in schools in regard to well-being and mindfulness.  The Senator also mentioned restorative practice.  Having been a principal of a school that dealt with restorative practice, it is all about relationships and how we relate to each other.  Teachers will say it is also about how they relate to their partners and children when they go home.  It extends into all part of school life and life in general, and that is very beneficial.</p> <p>  The student voice, especially in the past couple of years, is very much being pushed in schools and is taking on great momentum.  </p> <p>  We have curricular supports for well-being but extracurricular ones also.  We mostly have well-being committees which are run by students and now many schools have a post of responsibility around well-being co-ordinators.  As Mr. Curtis said, mindfulness does not just concern students but teachers and leaders also.</p> <p>  There is a huge amount being done and I have only given a whistle-stop tour of them.  While I do not wish to finish on a negative note, support has to given around this.  Without these developments, what would be the position?  Thankfully, we have them and the area of well-being and supports for young people is a great passion among educators.</p></speech>

I note as well that the Sub-Committee on Mental Health met this morning.  Balkanisation was mentioned.  It is interesting that even in the Houses of the Oireachtas this morning, three different committees met to discuss more or less the same issue.</p> <p>  As a former primary school teacher, I share some of the frustration I have heard from members that teachers are often the last to hear and the last to be listened to, despite the fact that they spend 25 or more hours a week in the company of these children and often, apart from their parents, are the people who know these children best.  Yet there does not seem to be a way to make those teaching professionals heard in respect of provision of mental health services, and that is a huge opportunity missed.</p> <p>  The thing that jumped out at me from the IPPN presentation was that we should have teams of education and health professionals to work with school clusters and individual schools to support children directly in the schools where they learn.  To give a concrete, real-world example of that, I know of an inner-city Waterford school where there are three different CDNTs represented within that school community.  One of them is based out of Dungarvan for those in Waterford west, so some of the children there are supposed to access their services in Dungarvan.  That is an hour from the school each way, plus the appointment time.  That is a full day for the parents.  For God's sake.  The school is open to this and has talked to me about it.  Why on earth would we not host the services in the school building?  I know that creates the issue of competency and who is in charge of that, and there is already a heavy load on school principals without having to become health professionals as well as everything else they are supposed to do, but there are opportunities there as well.</p> <p>  I think Mr. Crone said that schools are really good at supporting the many and that it is the few we need the specific help with.  Mr. McGorman said we see the role tapered.  That really is the case.  We have a huge resource in respect of our teaching profession, notwithstanding that we are losing teachers and they are going abroad or moving to other areas.  One of the strengths of education in Ireland, however, is that we have continued to attract really good candidates into the profession and that our education system is built on the quality of the teachers we have rather than other things.  We are making progress on the pupil-teacher ratio and issues like that, but the fact that we have good-quality people in the sector is the foundation stone of our education system.</p> <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh referred to career progression and allowing and enabling people to move into something like educational psychology or provision of other services.  Other than that, when someone enters a teaching career, he or she will either do 40 years in the classroom or take a principalship.  Many teachers I know are not interested in a principalship because those who take them stop teaching.  For a walking principle, that is the end of it.  The day teachers enter a principalship, they become administrators and can forget about teaching.  They will occasionally get to interact with classes, but most of the time they are giving out to bold people, which is probably not why they got into teaching in the first place.  We have a huge resource there and people who need other progression pathways.  It seems clear as day to me that we should be pointing them in directions where they can support, interact with and teach children in a different way in our school systems.</p> <p>  As for educational psychologists, it would be such a huge resource, even while people are training, if they could provide, for want of a better word, that triage service of looking at people's needs and just making sense of them.  Then, by the time the children are sitting in front of the educational psychologist, they are making best use of that time and not engaging in form-filling.</p> <p>  I do not know if anything I have said has amounted to a question in terms of punctuation marks.  I do not know if I quite got to a question mark at the end of that.  It was mainly observations.  Perhaps the witnesses feel that some of them merit comment.</p></speech>

As for the CDNTs, it is exactly as the Deputy said.  That is a massive frustration for us.  If I may give an example, we have one special school in our area, Dublin 15, that has five CDNTs working with it, so I can talk about one child with speech and language difficulties but not another child.  The other child does not have a speech and language therapist in his service, and there is one principal dealing with all of five different services.  We said at the start, when CDNTs were being reconfigured, that this was the wrong way to do it.  We are proactively working on that.  We have convinced the HSE to come on board and put in place one service for the school in question, see how it works and put all the resources into that in one case.  Then, if we can show that it works successfully there, let us move it out beyond that.</p> <p>  As for the notion of teacher career progression, we have to grow up about this.  We have to be mature about it.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has hit the nail on the head in respect of teacher progression.  Not everybody wants to be sitting in sixth, fifth, fourth or third class for 40 years.  We have different routes.  It is a question of having that talent and availability there and the need to match them up.  There is also the idea of getting people in training - and we have said this to speech and language therapists as well as psychologists in training - out and working in schools to assist and to do some of the lifting along the way.  That that would be really welcome as well.</p> <p>  In response to Senator O'Loughlin, I emphasise again the huge amount of work going on in schools.  The Senator is absolutely right.  I had in my school a tragedy when we had five deaths in one year, one by suicide.  Every single time people looked to the school community for leadership.  Every single time they asked, "Where is the principal in this?" and "What can we bring to the table?"  Schools are more than willing to bring that expertise, compassion and, dare I say it, love with them, but when we put our hands out for the supports, that is when the support has been found lacking.</p> <p>  I hope that answers some of the issues Senator O'Loughlin and Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh have raised.</p></speech>

They will identify people who might be good in a caring capacity and they may like to get those people trained up as guidance counsellors, for instance, but to do that they have to take, say, an 18-month course.  There are financial implications to that.  There are release implications at school level.  I think we could do a little work to allow the kind of fluidity Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh mentioned because it is very important for the profession.</p></speech>

Again, prior to the cutbacks around 2010, there were more opportunities for people to get money back, if you like, in the system.  We could look at it because the Deputy is right that there are people in the system who would be brilliant in the areas of mental health and looking after the students.  At school level we would know who they are, but perhaps we could get those people to do a training course whereby they are not disadvantaged financially and the school has some kind of means of release.  We have huge problems at the moment, especially in the area of guidance counselling.  We just do not have enough people out there.  I absolutely take the point about fluidity.  It is hugely important.</p></speech>

The richness that that brought to the experience of our school support team and pastoral care was extraordinary.  It would have been a brilliant jumping off point for us to be able to encourage one or two of those staff to pursue that sort of area, whether simply as a counsellor or as a psychologist, but that avenue just is not open to them.  We lose because of that.  Our whole school community loses because of that.</p></speech>

At primary level the roles of administrative deputy principal, counsellor or chaplain do not exist.  With the moratorium in school leadership teams for the past decade, the supports we have are minuscule.  The only service we have available to us are special education teachers, who are run ragged at the moment dealing with all the other educational issues they have to deal with.  I know resources are finite, but the idea that we could have any of those supports at primary level would be a dream to us.  We do not have access to any of them, unfortunately.  I know Ms O'Rourke mentioned that in her submission, but it is a matter of getting that support.  I think the need for it is well demonstrated at this stage at primary level, particularly senior primary level, because the problems children experience at post-primary level are right there at senior and even mid-primary level as well.</p></speech>

I just came from the Joint Committee on Autism where we discussed mental health and other services for people who are autistic.  It is important people come to the committee with some solutions.</p> <p>  I apologise that I did not get to hear everyone's input but I read the submissions.  I have done some work on the ground with ethnic minority groups and marginalised communities who really struggle with their mental health and wellbeing and of course there are pressures on young women and equally on young men.  The Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, published a programme of four simple asks.  One of those was to have psychologists in every school.  I think that is possible.  Obviously I am not the Minister for Education but it is possible to have those supports in our schools for young people to access.  In the other committee we were talking about how having services in school can help our children.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee and for some of the solutions they proposed.  I will not take up much of their time.  It makes our job much easier when solutions are proposed.</p></speech>

We are all here because we care.  I entered the teaching profession to be a teacher and to teach and, as the Deputy said, I was sucked into management, but my passion is for the children in our schools.  That applies across the board to everyone here.  The Senator talks about access to services and that is what we are craving, that when we put our hands out, when support for the many becomes support for the few and we realise we need external support, that is the point where children are being failed.  As we said earlier, they are being placed on waiting lists that are getting longer.  We must ensure people are in those roles.  Unfortunately the children's disability network teams, CDNTs, that are set up are understaffed.  The Senator will know this from the autism committee that has also met about this.  The three CDNTs in my area, Blanchardstown, Blakestown and Balbriggan are 40% staffed.  That means they are 60% down on what they should have.  Not only is it impossible for the teams to do the work but people are leaving those teams because they cannot cope with the demands being made of them.  We need to address access to all of these professional services and some of the ideas-----</p></speech>

We cannot expect too much of our teachers.  We need to work hand in hand with and listen to the teachers as that is important.  However, our young people from all walks of life are crying out for mental health supports.  It is an investment.  How does the Department invest in our children going forward?  It was one of the asks of the INTO before budget 2023 and I will do all in my power to provide support and make it possible.  I most definitely would, but we cannot expect too much from teachers.</p> <p>  One of witnesses is a qualified psychologist, but how can they do two jobs?  It is about having the services as well.</p></speech>

In any new system or in any way they are asked to support students, schools will not be found wanting.  They want to be involved and to support their students.  We will certainly be at the table and our voice will be heard loud and clear.</p></speech>

Did he say they are not happening at the moment?  Back in my day, when we could openly discuss a child, now with the general data protection regulation, GDPR, we have to be more careful and a principal is now cautious in coming to a public representative to talk about a specific child.  It was easier six or seven years ago for a Deputy to go to the different agencies but now it cannot be done or it is difficult.  We have to talk in coded language.  Did Mr. McGorman say that these team meetings are no longer taking place or are the less common?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.532" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Enda McGorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101800002#M01100"><p>Perhaps I was harking back to when things were functioning and we had multidisciplinary teams that were staffed and resourced and everyone was able to do the work.  The first problem is getting access for children.  I am principal of a senior primary school so children are only with me for third, fourth, fifth and sixth class and then they move on.  They could be in my school for the full four years without getting access to any therapeutic service, so the availability of people to work with the children is one issue.  Communication is also an issue, as the Deputy said, and we have contact with local representatives when they hold clinics and families go in despair to them or they talk to them on the doorsteps or somewhere else.  However, the problem is moving the piece on.  I go back to the point I made earlier.  The new assumption, especially under the HSE model, is that the parents are agents who are able to command all the services are their child and draw the services in.  That is not the reality and parents experience massive difficulties in trying to negotiate their way around these services.  It is similar for GPs.  For me to talk to the GP of a child, I have to get the signed consent from the parent and email it to the receptionist to pass on the GP before the GP will take a phone call from me.  We have to ask ourselves why.  What is the risk?  We are very conscious of GDPR and for the right reasons but sometimes that becomes a barrier to providing support to the child at the centre of this.</p> <p>  I keep coming back to the point that school is the one place that nearly every single child attends, so we have to refocus----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.533" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101800002#M01200"><p>I will interrupt Mr. McGorman to say that the GDPR issue comes in handy for people who provide the service.  It is very difficult for parents to navigate.  That is why they come to the Deputy.  The Deputy or other public representative approaches the services but the services say they cannot discuss Mary Murphy because of GDPR issues.  They ask whether we have the permission of the parent and when we respond that we have, they ask whether we have it in writing and even if we do have it in writing they still will not discuss the needs of the child.  These people who are being paid very high salaries are using GDPR to move away from the case and to stop me or any other public representative annoying them.  I am sure other public representatives have the same experience I have.  What happens is that I get fed up of doing it and just tell the constituent there is nothing I can do or I have tried my best.  Ten years ago I was able pick up the phone and talk to someone without any problems.</p></speech>

We have a massive issue around homelessness and trying to get families rehoused.  I spend a lot of my time with Fingal County Council housing department.  The Chairman talked about brick walls in other areas, so the first thing I do is get consent.  When the parent comes into me, we write it out and that is the first thing I send because it is used too often.</p> <p>  When we discuss this in our collaborative groups, we work hard to try to get around that from the get-go, so that the school can be at the centre of conversations around that.</p><p>Too often it is used as a lame excuse or a barrier; I hope not as much now.

We still have case conferences around individual children, but not nearly as often as we would like.  They are the most effective way of getting support for a child; everyone is around the table, a plan gets thrashed out and we can implement the plan at all of the different stages with all of the different agencies.  It does not happen as often as we would like and I am acutely conscious that when therapists from our local services are in with us for that hour, that means another student in our school is an hour further down the waiting list, about which we have been talking, in terms of actually being seen.  We are in a catch-22 situation.  We want the best for all of them, but we are robbing Peter to pay Paul a lot of the time.</p></speech>

It was solved.  I solved many of them in my day.</p></speech>

The problem is getting to that case conference stage; that is where the complications are and there is a lack of personnel and resources.  The conferences themselves are marvellous.</p></speech>

I am not sure whether it is in primary and post-primary, or generally.  I saw a report in one of the weekend newspapers.  I did not read the article, but I intend to do so because it might be beneficial to this committee.  Is it a problem?  Is it holding children with disabilities back, to Ms O'Rourke's knowledge?</p></speech>

Certainly, Covid-19 has had a detrimental effect on children with additional needs and teachers in our member schools have reported school refusal, severe social regression and withdrawal resulting in a refusal to come to school.  I was in a hospital school last week; some of the children are there for seven to eight months.  While the hospital schools do their best, what they are able to offer is maybe half an hour fitting around all of the medical needs the child has at the time.  It is very difficult for children coming out of a hospital school to go 100% back into their regular school and classes without feeling lost or inadequate or that they have lost out on so much.  That is very anxiety-inducing.  Can I make another point?</p></speech>

She mentioned that we were coming with solutions.  I will talk about special and primary schools together because, as the committee knows, special schools are seen as a subset of primary schools, which I do not always think is appropriate but I will go with it for this comment.  We all know that our children are given phones at earlier and earlier.  That means they are open to a toxic and destructive habit, which brings them down rabbit holes of conspiracy theories, items on the dark web, all sorts of websites encouraging eating disorders and very harmful and destructive behaviours.  That, combined with Covid-19, means there is a crisis brewing in our primary schools.</p> <p>  In special education, one of the two practical solutions we could put in place very quickly is administrative deputy principals for special schools.  Our special schools do not really meet the numbers border for any of the general allocations given out to mainstream primary schools.  This is because in special schools, it is about need rather than numbers.  The other thing that would be incredibly helpful to special is the reintroduction of something along the lines of class hours.  That was incredibly beneficial because of the flexibility built into it.  We do not have substitution now for the first day of absenteeism, which is enormously problematic in special education where you cannot divide classes out among other teachers.  It was mentioned earlier that we know who the caring person is in our schools and who can be there when a child needs someone that minute, when they are incredibly anxious or they are having a crisis or an anxiety or panic attack or whatever it is.  You need the flexibility to have somebody there at that moment.  Something along the lines of the class hours would give schools that flexibility.</p></speech>

Mr. McGorman, you spoke about the supports in primary schools compared to secondary.  That is something I have raised with the Minister here on numerous occasions.  I will give the example of the primary school where my own children go, St. Aidan's Primary School in Enniscorthy, where there are up to 1,000 pupils.  They have a principal and the vice principals are kind of teaching; there is no walking vice principal in that size of a school.  When you go to a secondary school, where there could be 350 students, there is a principal and a walking vice principal.  What is needed to get the larger primary schools the same services as the secondary schools?  I mean no disrespect to the secondary schools, they need them and deserve them, but so do primary schools.  As you said, specifically in the senior cycle in primary schools, they are now having similar issues and problems that secondary schools had a number of years ago, in that children are now having anxiety problems and are facing issues in life, whether it involves mobile phones or whatever.  They are having these problems at a younger age.</p></speech>

It is a real question for us as school leaders at primary level.  There are two priorities for school leaders at primary level, from a leadership development point of view.  The point about the role of the teaching principal has to made as well.  Up to 40% of our schools have teaching principals, meaning that the principal in those schools has teaching duties, as well as the deputy principal.  It would be remiss of me to address this issue without addressing that as well.  It is not just large schools that need the support of an administrative deputy principal.  If you are a teaching principal in-role as a teacher, you have all of the responsibilities is that have been laid out here as well.  Chaos and stress do not choose when they arrive on a particular day.  All human life is represented in our schools.  Our teaching principals are right at the coalface concerning this issue.</p> <p>  On administrative status for deputy principals, again, our post-primary cousins have been very successful in raising that and having that addressed as an issue.  We have had to balance between a call for administrative deputy principals and support for our teaching principals, who get one administrative day a week now.  That is something for which we were fighting for years.  As a result of the pandemic, it was given and we have retained it.  However, that does not diminish the call for administrative deputy principals.  If we were to ask the why of it here at this committee, it is about supporting the co-ordination of special education needs because it has become so complex at primary level.  It has become the catch-all for everything.  Special education needs has been used to cover every single thing we have talked about here, as well as the cognitive developmental issues that children have in mainstream education and their educational needs.  If we were to make a recommendation around this, it would be to support the co-ordination of special education needs.  That would be one massive area which could encompass or include or allow for the management of special education needs as part of the role of an administrative deputy principal.</p> <p>  It is down to economics, resources and priorities at the end of the day.  The Department will consider an administrative deputy principal in very large schools, but we would be anxious for that to be pulled down.  If there are schools where there are more than two special classes or a class for children with autism, those schools also get administrative deputy principals.  The principle has been conceded and it is down to budget and priorities, ultimately, as to how it is allocated on a year-to-year basis.  Certainly, every year the IPPN makes submissions as part of the budgetary submission in relation to our teaching principals and administrative status for larger schools as well.</p></speech>

It has a special needs unit.  It is a mainstream school with a staff of 60 or 70.  If that was a company, it would have two or three bosses at the top, whereas it does not have that with 1,000 pupils.</p><p>It is absolutely mad that this has not been addressed.  There is a huge expectation on principals and vice principals.  There is more responsibility being heaped on them, not on a weekly, but almost on a daily basis.  There are more expectations from parents regarding the way children are taught and that goes back to the principal as well.  This is something that the Department of Education has to address quickly.  Unfortunately, it has fallen on deaf ears when I have raised it here for the last two and a half years.  Covid has really highlighted the issue.  I have nothing against post-primary.  It deserves this, but that model has to be looked at in the context of primary education.</p></speech>

School principals and deputy principals are only allocated on the number of whole-time teaching positions.  It is completely blind to all the other work that schools have to do.  A special school could have a staff of 40 SNAs and 50 bus escorts and all of this has to be managed.  No recognition is given, either in the staffing allocation or, indeed, in pay.  The pay scale of principals in these schools does not reflect the number of staff on roll; it just reflects the number of mainstream teachers.  This is always very low because the number of pupils in these schools is low but the staff need is massively high.  That has not been recognised by the system and it is a massive issue.  It would be the same issue in our special schools as in mainstream schools with high numbers of children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD.</p></speech>

We have compared it to a healthy working population in Denmark and to the school leaders in New Zealand.  That data in relation to the health, wellbeing and workload of school leaders are from a 2022 survey.  It has been shared with the Department of Education.  I am prepared to share our data with the committee, if it would like us to do so.  The data show that, on average, school leaders are spending 30 hours per week on administration and 40% of them are working in excess of 60 hours per week.  It is a huge piece of work, with internationally compared data.  It is available and I am prepared to share it.</p></speech>

The turnover would be fairly similar.  If you have that assistance at primary school, it tends to transfer, although not automatically.</p> <p>  I want to come back to a point Mr. McGorman made in the context of the SNAs and extra staff principals have to deal with now.  It is a very important issue.  It is only really coming into play in the last ten years during which time the number of SNAs in schools has increased.  The extra staffing that principals have to manage is not reflected in any way, shape or form in the context of allocation to the schools or the salary earned by a principal.  This is something that will have to be looked at.  Fundamentally, what has been said about deputy principals is correct.  In our submission, we made three fundamental points.  One was around provision of guidance counsellors, one was around inter-agency co-operation and the final one around trying to give time to principals, as leaders in the school, to deal with the problem kids and the students in their care.  Any way we can augment the provision of deputy principalships in our schools, we think that is huge.</p> <p>  We are very concerned about burnout among principals at the moment.  During Covid things settled a little at school level because things quietened down to some extent but we are becoming more concerned now that there is burnout.  Principals put up with a lot during Covid, they did an awful lot and they gave a lot of themselves.  We think the best supports for schools come in at the deputy principal level, whether at primary level or post primary level.</p></speech>

However, they had no interest in them because of the commitment required and the fact they would not be adequately rewarded for doing it.  I know a principal who has stepped back because the number in the school and the workload have increased as have the pressures.  The assistance is not forthcoming.</p></speech>

The survey shows that 80% of principals and deputy principals are experiencing moderate to severe burnout and 60% of them are experiencing moderate to severe stress.  It is all in the report and it is very clear.  We need to relieve school leaders of the administrative burden.</p></speech>

I would agree with what Mr. Curtis said about the need for more deputy principals in our system.  I happen to come from a smaller school and because we have fewer than 400 pupils, we get 0.75 of a deputy principal.  We actually have two deputy principals because she is that good.  However, that is what we are relying on.  As part of the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, ACCS, we would also advocate for a mandatory second deputy principal in all DEIS schools because of the additional burden that comes with home-school liaison and with the DEIS planning.  It is an area where we desperately need more help.</p></speech>

The first item on this afternoon's agenda is our meeting with representatives of Justice for Colombia.  This is not the first occasion on which we have had an opportunity to engage with this group.  I am pleased to welcome Mr. Hasan Dodwell, director, and Mr. Niall Finn, parliamentary officer.  The format of our meeting is in the usual manner whereby we will hear the witnesses' opening statement followed by a question-and-answer session with members of the committee.  I ask members to be concise in their questions to allow everybody an opportunity to participate.</p><p>Witnesses and members are reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person in any way identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and any such direction must be complied with.</p><p> Members are reminded that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  I remind representatives of Justice for Colombia, Mr. Dodwell and Mr. Finn, that we are operating a hybrid format, in that some members are present in the committee room, while others are participating in the meeting from within the Leinster House complex, such as Deputy Stanton who is in his office.</p><p> I thank Mr. Dodwell and call him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.567" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hasan Dodwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022101800002#B00200"><p>I am director of Justice for Colombia.  I am sure most committee members met my predecessor when she came before the committee previously.  We are an Irish and British organisation founded in 2002.  We have been supported by the Irish and British trade union movements to work in support of peace, human rights and social justice in Colombia.  The organisation was founded in response to the high levels of violence against trade unionists, human rights activists and community activists more generally in Colombia.  As we all know, there has been an historically problematic situation in Colombia in terms of human rights and security, which continues to this day and often goes under the radar, although I am sure committee members work on this issue more than others do.  That is where we see the importance of our organisation and campaign.</p> <p>  Let us look at the figures that have come out over the 50 years of civil war, between the 1960s and 2016 when the recent peace agreement was signed between the Colombian state and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC.  These figures, which pertain in particular between the 1980s to 2016, come from the recent truth commission report that was released.  Of a population of 40 million, approximately 8 million people were forcibly displaced from their lands, more than 120,000 people disappeared, with that figure potentially being as high as 210,000, and 440,000 people were killed.  We know that 6,400 civilians were killed by the army during the so-called false positives scandal particularly in the early 2000s, and we have recently seen from the findings of the transitional justice courts that more than 5,000 members and supporters of the Patriotic Union political party, which was formed after the peace process in 1980s, were killed.  In addition, more than 3,200 trade unionists were killed in the 1970s; over a period of five decades, that amounts to five every month on average.  Figures often take away the human side of it but they are important to emphasise the catastrophic scale of the violence, insecurity, and human rights problems in Colombia.  That is why, as I am sure everyone here was positive about, there was a lot of hope around the peace process and peace agreement that was signed in 2016.</p> <p>  Justice for Colombia works closely with human rights and peace groups as well as pro-peace politicians in Colombia.  We were very positive about the agreement that was eventually signed, particularly because it looked at some of the social and political issues that lay behind the conflict and violence.  It contained chapters that looked at land issues, how to tackle the drugs issues not only with a militarised approach but with consideration of the social and economic reasons behind the farmers growing coca leaf, looking at increasing political participation, as well as re-incorporation of former combatants, and ensuring the rights of victims are respected.</p> <p>  Following the signing of the agreement, there have been some key advances to date, and it is important that we emphasise those and continue to show the positives brought by the agreement.  Let us not forget the importance of ending an armed conflict that existed for 50 years between the FARC, which had between 13,000 and 14,000 combatants, and the state.  Many thousands of lives were saved as a result of the cease-fires and the eventual laying down of weapons.  There was the formation of the FARC as a political party, entering into a democratic sphere, and the creation of these transitional justice mechanisms, which have been successful in getting to the truth and moving towards some form of respect for the victims, much more than had previously been the case in the normal justice system.  There was also the recent report from the truth commission.  We should celebrate all these things and support these institutions that were created as part of the peace agreement.  It is important for Justice for Colombia to carry on supporting it internationally.</p> <p>  Sadly, there is the other side.  People with whom we work in Colombia continue to have concerns about the slow advance of the implementation process.  In Colombia, we have heard there are big question marks around the commitment of the previous government to the implementation process, particularly in areas of rural reform, such a key area in the conflict, on which we saw minimal advancement.  In terms of the land needed for sustainable, long-term economic projects for former combatants, there has been little advancement in that regard and in giving access to lands.  On the importance of alternative economic projects for former coca growers who were agreeing to the manual substitution programmes, few of them have been given access to long-term economic alternatives, which is fundamental to that part of the agreement being sustainable.  There are also the ongoing security issues, which I will talk about later, that affect former combatants in respect of the peace agreement, and that has been concerning.  During a recent delegation visit, we met with many former combatants and spoke to some who were living in tents because the lack of security meant they had to move from where they had been previously living.  This is a concerning situation and occurred in an area called El Doncello.</p> <p>  There have been some advances but big concerns remain but the peace process continues to survive in spite of those difficulties over recent years.  That is a strength and it shows that there was something solid in what was created and agreed in 2016.  International support has been important.  The Irish Embassy in Colombia has been an important actor in maintaining international diplomatic support for the peace process and will, no doubt, continue to have an important role to play in that regard.</p> <p>  Where are we at today?  As well as the difficulty with the peace process over recent years, we have also seen an increase in violence and insecurity for rural communities.  Illegal armed groups have been forming in areas formally controlled by the FARC, which has provided a platform for increased violence against community activists.  I am sure members of the committee will know some of the horrifying figures of recent years.  From 2016, when the deal was signed, to today, more than 1,300 community activists have been killed according to Instituto de Estudios para el Desarrollo y la Paz, INDEPAZ, an organisation in Colombia.  Some 137 community activists were killed this year and, as I said earlier, more than 340 former combatants have been killed, 34 of whom were killed this year.</p> <p>  This year, we have seen some serious human rights abuses by state actors, not least of which occurred in the southern department of Putumayo.  During Justice for Colombia's latest delegation visit, we met with family members of victims.  They told us there were attacked by the army and 11 people were killed.  This incident was awaiting investigation by the authorities under the then Colombian Government.  The government completely defended the army's action, which went against what the local community said had happened.</p> <p>  I am sure we all saw the protests in April and May of last year.  There was a huge mobilisation on the street against tax reform as well as against the lack of implementation of the peace agreement, the problems of violence in the countryside and the response from the police.  Human rights organisations reported on the horrifying things that were happening on the streets.  We all saw the videos of police shooting at protestors in the streets.  According to human rights organisations, 44 people were killed by the police.  More than 100 people were shot in the face, mostly with gas canisters, and many of whom lost their vision.  They were mostly young kids protesting on the streets.  There were also reports of 26 sexual assaults by the security forces.</p> <p>  This has been happening in recent years and is of huge concern to us.  The peace process and some of the issues coming up on the streets were part of the context that led to a change in electoral results.  From our analysis, it may be what led to the shift in opinion in Colombian society and the election of a government representing voices that may not have been represented by those in power previously.</p><p>I think everyone accepts this is probably the first so-called progressive government in Colombia.  It is certainly a government that talks openly and determinedly about supporting peace and human rights.  There is a coalition in the Congress of Colombia that brings together this progressive coalition with some of the traditional parties, including the Conservative Party and Liberal Party, both of which have ministerial posts in the government.</p><p> To bring us up to date, for us as an organisation campaigning on peace and human rights, one of the policies giving us a great deal of hope is the new Colombian Government's flagship policy, which it is calling the policy towards total peace.  This is its effort to bring an end to or take great strides towards ending the armed violence that has existed in Colombia for so long.  This is focused first on the full commitment to implementation of the 2016 peace agreement and then on opening talks with all the remaining armed groups.  These can be grouped into three main organisations.  The first is the Ej&eacute;rcito de Liberaci&oacute;n Nacional, ELN, which is the largest remaining guerrilla organisation.  The second consists of the so-called FARC dissident groups.  These are made up of those who did not join the peace talks at the beginning or former FARC members who then created groups.  It must be remembered that only a small percentage of combatants left the peace process.  Some 95% of the combatants that entered the peace agreement are still in that process.  The third group consists of neo-paramilitary organisations and those engaging in organised crime, including perhaps drug trafficking.</p><p> Efforts are ongoing to open talks with all these armed groups.  Unilateral ceasefires have already been announced by ten armed groups, and more than 20 armed groups have declared their interest in forming part of these talks.  Some very positive strides have already been taken.  The high commissioner for peace, Danilo Rueda, a long-time human rights defender, is doing a great deal of work on this.  This is an important opportunity for all of us to get behind something that could achieve great steps in the years ahead.</p><p> The passage of different social and political reforms through the Colombian Congress is also being sought.  These include measures on police reform and increasing the state's civilian presence in rural areas.  The determination to focus on the rural chapter of the peace agreement of 2016 will be extremely important.  Hopefully, big strides can be made in this area.  Transforming social conditions in the countryside is fundamental for everything else.  A recent agreement was reached between the Colombian Government and the cattle ranchers federation, Fedegan, which traditionally was more allied to the right-wing parties in Colombia.  Having this current administration strike an agreement with Fedegan for the purchase of 3 million ha of land to go into a land fund to give to peasant and small-scale farmers, as promised in the peace agreement, is another positive step.</p><p> This is where things stand.  The international community's continuing interest in Colombia, and some of the key issues we will be working on, will focus on the 2016 peace agreement, support for the efforts to bring all armed actors to the table and support for the reforms to tackle historical human rights abuses within state institutions.  For us, it will also be important to continue to work with and to highlight issues affecting local communities because we know the security situation is not going to improve from one day to the next.  The policy of total peace is at the top of all of this and, hopefully, the international community can get behind it and find ways to support it.</p></speech>

I assume because it is early days for this new regime that it is probably too early to form any firm conclusions.  Mr. Dodwell appears to be reasonably positive in his disposition and I am sure we can explore that further by way of questions.  Mr. Finn is not minded to contribute at this point.  I call Deputy Brady.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  I was part of the delegation that Justice for Colombia organised in May 2022.  It was an insightful experience, particularly as the timing of the delegation's travel coincided with the first round of the presidential elections in Colombia.  We were able to get a bird's eye view of the entire process.  We got to see how security was provided and the electoral process was overseen.  It was fascinating to see inside one of the largest polling stations in Bogota, to say the least.  Given all the concerns expressed at the time regarding allegations of fraud and security issues, it was great to get those insights.  It was also great to see the hope that many people had concerning the election.  It transpired that Gustavo Petro won the second round and became the new President of Colombia.</p> <p>  The overall experience of the delegation was fascinating and very useful.  We met human rights activists, trade unionists and people in Putumayo, where a massacre had been carried out by the military some months previously.  We got to speak to many of the family members, survivors and people who had been seriously injured.  It was insightful to see the attempts that were made to cover up that massacre and how this all fitted into the policy of the false positives that we had, unfortunately, seen existing for many years.  I would like to try to get an understanding of how things have changed for the better, albeit only 100-odd days after the new government has been in place in Colombia.  It would be good to learn what kind of inroads have been made.  I know some new key ministers have been appointed.  Some respectable and reputable people have taken these posts, including Gloria In&eacute;s Ram&iacute;rez, a women's rights activist, who has taken over as the new Minister of Labour, and the new high commissioner for peace.  I would like to get a little insight into what new legislation is being considered.  Does Mr. Dodwell or Mr. Finn have any information on the legislative work done so far?</p> <p>  Returning to the massacre at Putumayo, I made a commitment to the families and survivors to raise this matter at every opportunity I got.  Are there any updates on the investigation?  Shortly after the massacre, then President Duque congratulated the army and stood over the military operation before any investigation had been carried out.  I would like to know if there are any further insights or updates concerning the massacre.</p> <p>  The total peace policy is instrumental and key.  I welcome some of the most recent progress made in restarting the faltered peace talks with the ELN.  I ask Mr. Dodwell or Mr. Finn for a little more insight in this regard.  Mr. Dodwell said ten other armed groups have announced ceasefires to date.  Perhaps he might give a little background concerning the international backers, the pen holders, involved in those processes.  What international support is there for them?  How crucial is international support in ensuring the momentum behind this process does not falter as it did following the 2016 process?  What role can Ireland play in this process, especially given that we have a seat on the UN Security Council, even only for a short time?  What can Ireland and the Government do to support the transition to a new peaceful era in Colombia?  What can we do to support the peace process?</p><p> I will make a final point.  I hope this committee will send a delegation to Colombia in the near future.  That would be really useful.  Some committee members such as Deputy Gannon and I have been very vocal on the abuses and violations going on at the Cerrej&oacute;n mine, and on the fact that Ireland is importing coal again from that particular mine.  Can Mr. Dodwell recommend any useful organisations, groups or meetings that this committee or a delegation from this committee might find useful in our travels to Colombia?  I think that is it for now, although I might have some supplementary questions later if we have time.</p></speech>

I will get down to the brass tacks of the issues impacting Colombia.  President Petro has made some recent statements in relation to the drugs trade and its impact on Colombia.  Can Mr. Dodwell go into some of the international complicity in terms of the drugs trade?   When you are in Colombia, you cannot help but notice that many of Colombia's problems are ones that are forced on them by the international community.  Will Mr. Dodwell talk to the committee about the new Colombian President, the international drug trade and its responsibility for what is happening in Colombia?</p> <p>  Deputy Brady mentioned the Cerrej&oacute;n mine which we have all taken an interest in, although there are other mines in Colombia as well.  Colombia's climate action plans for 2030 are very ambitions.  What types of climate transitions has Mr. Dodwell noticed are in place?  I am very conscious of what will replace these mines when they close as they should.  The mine I am familiar with, the Cerrej&oacute;n mine, is a big gaping hole in the middle of the ground that has engulfed the communities around it and caused child malnutrition for their inhabitants.  What sort of transitional justice and reparations should those communities expect?  What are the international obligations on those of us who have taken from that mine, in terms of putting something back after it is gone, be it resources or any sort of support?</p> <p>  When the peace plan come in six years ago, I noticed that groups like FARC could choose settlements which involved getting a form of stipend that I believe was approximately &euro;800 per person.  It was never really factored in that once the peace happened, those groups would start having children, as people tend to do.  They have not been given any other form of payment to compensate for the fact that they now have families that are growing.  There is a level of enforced poverty happening there that threatens the peace.  Can we take a bit more of an interest in that?  What can we do in terms of encouraging the peace process and those agreements made six years ago, which probably have to be built on due to unforeseen things?  What can we learn from the truth and justice programmes that are happening in Colombia?  It is a country of 70 million people.  It has a very ambitious peace programme and has just released the truth commission report.  I am very conscious we have not done anything to that scale for our own conflict.  What lessons can we learn from Colombia in relation to how they have undertaken their peace programmes? </p> <p>  I would like to comment on the gender-related aspects of the peace process.  There is much talk about restorative justice in relation to murder.  Are sexual assault crimes against women factored into the peace process?  The indigenous courts are hugely important in Colombia and should be protected at all costs, but some members of the indigenous community feel that the gendered nature of the courts acts against women there.  Can Mr. Dodwell comment on that, especially in relation to sexual abuse crimes?</p> <p>  Following on from Deputy Brady's comment, there may be a delegation from this committee going to Colombia.  I do not want anyone from this committee going on a trip to beautiful Colombia like something from a sunny brochure.  There are so many parts of it.  If a delegation goes to Colombia, what does Mr. Dodwell think we should see?</p></speech>

The first thing to say is that it has literally been two and a half months.  Some things have already started to move through the Colombian Congress.  It is a presidential system.  The Colombian Government can present items but then they have to pass through the Colombian Congress.  As we highlighted in the briefing we sent out, they have a large majority at the moment.  One thing has gone through in terms of environmental issues.  As well as focusing on promoting peace, the other big headline for the new Colombian Government is a focus on environmental protection.  A regional agreement, the Escaz&uacute; Agreement, which provides environmental protections and has been promoted by environmental groups for a long time, had stalled in recent years in Colombia but has been immediately passed in the new Colombian Congress.  That is something to celebrate in terms of environmental issues.</p> <p>  Police and political reforms are being presented and will go through several stages in the Colombian Congress.  Women's issues, which were mentioned by Deputy Gannon, are among the various issues being considered as part of political reform.  An effort is being made to find ways to enshrine in Colombian legislation a 50:50 representation of men and women in the Colombian Parliament.</p> <p>  I have not seen the actual details of the proposed political reform which has been presented by Senator Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; Pizarro, who visited Dublin a couple of weeks ago.  There is certainly talk of moving the police away from the jurisdiction of the Colombian ministry of defence to a civilian ministry.  This is important and has been long-demanded by the human rights community.  There was talk previously of involving the interior ministry, although this has not happened yet so there must still be discussion around it.  There was also talk of creating a new ministry which the police would fit into.  This is a significant aspect of police and political reform.</p> <p>  I mentioned the Escaz&uacute; Agreement on the environmental side.  The first important political reform action to be taken by the Colombian Government through the minister of defence was the removal of 15 generals who had links to human rights abuses.  This was part of shifting the army to make it ready to be an army for peace and to follow through on the total peace plan of the Colombian Government.  That was a significant move.  The Colombian Government suspended aerial bombardments of camps of armed groups where they had intelligence that there were minors there.  In one specific case during the period of Iv&aacute;n Duque - I cannot remember who the minister of defence was at the time - a camp was bombed and several children were killed.  That led to a big debate in Colombia on whether those children were legitimate targets because they were in a military group, or victims of forced recruitment.  Many people felt that if the Colombian state had intelligence that minors were present, they should not be carrying out bombing exercises but should be reaching out to try to get in touch with kids who are forcibly recruited.  That was another significant win for some of the human rights organisations which had been calling for that.</p> <p>  The riot police, which are called ESMAD in Columbia, have been the police force most responsible for some of the human rights abuses on the streets particularly, but not only, during protests.  Although the Colombian Government is still looking at broader police reform, a new code of conduct has already been put out which says that the riot police will now only be used as an absolute last resort rather than a first resort during protests.  These are all significant material changes to go beyond the words we have heard in support of human rights and peace.</p> <p>  I do not have any further information on the investigation into the massacre in de Manso in Putumayo, but I will follow up on it, try to find out and get back in touch.</p><p>It is good for us to know but also, having visited, we owe it to that community to do that.</p><p> On the Ej&eacute;rcito de Liberaci&oacute;n Nacional, ELN, peace talks, there are not details about what will happen in terms of those talks apart from that they will start in November.  In early November, we are due to have the official opening of those talks.  The Colombian Government recently said it is continuing from what had already been negotiated and spoken about thus far.  The negotiations started under President Santos, went into the beginnings of the period of Duque, then were suspended and have been suspended since then.  The first point is that they are continuing with what had already been achieved so far but we all are awaiting further details to come.  There have been a lot of initial conversations in Havana, which is where the talks are taking place.  Venezuela, Cuba and Norway are the guarantor countries, but Maduro certainly with a guarantor role, for those talks.</p><p> In terms of the broader negotiations, or broader talks and spaces for openings of peace with different armed groups, the High Commissioner for Peace has had several meetings with these armed groups.  When we talk about 22 armed groups, that is 22 groups that have put out statements saying that they are open to this proposal of total peace.  They themselves have put out these statements with ten of those also calling a unilateral ceasefire.  It is early days but initial indications from what I am reading and information I am receiving is that they are being respected.  We cannot really go around talking about this because it is only significant over a longer period of time but there are words coming out of some initial indications of reduced levels of violence in these areas.  We need to wait a little longer to review that.</p><p> Significantly, in terms of the organisations that have said that they are open to this process and looking at ceasefires, the biggest ones are there.  Obviously, we have the ELN in talks, but also the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC, dissident groups or, as some people say in Colombia, the so-called "FARC" dissident groups.  They have said that they are open to the talks.  The largest so-called neo-paramilitary group - people call it by different names - or criminal structure, the Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia, AGC, probably the group with the broadest presence across Colombia, has also said that it is open to talks.  This is extremely positive.</p><p> In terms of roles of the international community, for example, the meeting recently with one of the FARC dissident groups was accompanied by the UN mission, by Cuba and Norway on the request of the Colombian Government.</p><p> If we look at Ireland, no doubt there is an important role to be had.  As I said before, it was mentioned on many occasions to me by people working around the peace process the important role the Irish Embassy had in keeping diplomatic attention on the implementation of the 2016 peace agreement.  I would say this needs to continue.</p><p> What might be in danger now is that attention gets lost with these new peace processes but it is really important that we keep focus as well on the 2016 agreement.  That has a broad set of chapters that need to be implemented and that would provide massive transformation to Colombia.  Keeping that focus on the 2016 is important, as well as looking at ways to support these new talks because there will be difficult moments.  Talks to go through with a guerrilla force bring all their complications and having to sell that then to Colombian society is obviously a big piece of work that happens with any peace process.  With other armed groups that maybe did not enter into the process or left the peace process, that brings other conversations that needed to be had and other sensibilities.  No doubt these are issues that the Irish diplomatic community can have an important role in.  Equally, some people might not like the idea of talks with what they might consider less political groups and more criminal groups.  What I have heard about talks with the latter so far is that they should be understood differently.  They will be looked at not as political negotiations as such but rather as talks about how to consider the concerns that they might articulate in political form but also look at a negotiation around some form of alternative justice if they lay down their weapons.  All of these different moments will have considerable pressures inside Colombia of people who might not be favourable to that.  All the work and support that the diplomatic community in Ireland and the Government can do is extremely welcome.</p><p> Something that might be helpful as well, particularly thinking about the UN Security Council, is the role of the UN mission.  Obviously, the UN mission was created at different stages.  The mandate was changed at different stages, most recently to also cover some of the monitoring of the sentences that might be given out now by the transitional justice courts.  It could be interesting to look at what role a UN mission might have in this new era of total peace or efforts towards total peace in these new peace processes.  Anyone involved in the peace process of 2016 knows how important the UN mission has been.  It would be really interesting to look at whether there is pressure for or a voice needing to be given to amplifying the role of a UN mission for these future talks.</p><p> That hopefully covers Deputy Brady's questions.  I will move on to the other questions.</p><p> The speech in the UN General Assembly was very interesting and certainly seemed like it was communicating a message that the new Government wanted to give out, particularly around the environment and drugs.  He spoke about the failure of the war on drugs and how, in spite of the decades of war on drugs, there is growing consumption in consumption countries and ongoing and growing production in production countries, such as Colombia.  This was a message that was repeated by Senator Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; Pizarro, who we had with us on a visit very recently.  The message they are wanting to put out is this drugs policy is causing violence, war and death in their country and they are providing the bodies in this war on drugs without any results, in terms of the actual stated objectives, as well as the environmental degradation, which is often a missed effect.  As far as I understood, the message was: one, it is not being successful; two, it is causing them a lot of violence and death; and three, it is also causing environmental destruction in their country.  There is seemingly a push coming from the Government for an international conversation around drugs and the approach to drugs internationally.  While our analysis would not be that the drugs issue has been the cause of the conflict or the violence in Colombia, it has certainly been a fuel that has allowed it to continue and perhaps be more bloody than it might otherwise have been.</p><p> At the root, there is the coca farmer-grower.  On a personal level, I have spent a lot of time in communities where coca farmers live.  I am sure everyone here is aware of this, but these are not the people making the money out of this trade.  These are incredibly poor people.  If we look at a global perspective, these are very poor farmers who used to grow other crops, due to a lack of infrastructure and certain complaints about imports coming in from countries with farming subsidised, being unable to sell what they used to sell.  If they grow coca, they get a guaranteed income.  They can live a very basic life but they can have food on the table.  It is obvious, as the peace agreement of 2016 concludes with its proposals, that there has to be a social economic answer to the growing of coca in Colombia.  I and our organisation, Justice for Colombia, keep pointing to the 2016 agreement because it asks for those things to happen.  Although we have had 99,000 families signed up for mutually-agreed substitution, 97% of families do not have a long-term economic alternative project.  That should be happening.  Hopefully, we can provide pressure to make that happen.</p></speech>

It is not my area of expertise to follow the trail of money, but it is certainly not the grower making the money.  The money is made in the trafficking and the stages beyond that.  People often say money infiltrates all levels of society.  In the case of Colombia we probably all agree that it infiltrates many levels of society across the world.  However, it is not my area of expertise to comment on that, I am afraid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.581" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1560" speakername="Gary Gannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022101800002#F00200"><p>It is the responsibility of all of us, though, to highlight the trail of money that leads to the devastation, be it in Colombia or in working-class communities here, from the drugs trade.  It is not the people, either growers in Colombia or people who are suffering from drugs in Ireland or elsewhere, who are making the money from the trade but they certainly experience the devastation.  We need a mature conversation about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.582" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hasan Dodwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022101800002#F00300"><p>Absolutely.  In answer to the question, I think that is exactly what this new Colombian Government is trying to take a lead on.<br/><br/>As for environmental transition, there are big objectives.  In campaigning the government has spoken about wanting to get to zero reliance on export of fossil fuels.  That is the biggest part of Colombian exports and GDP at the moment, so it is a huge intention.  What will replace fossil fuels?  What I have heard spoken about is a desire to reinvigorate Colombia's agricultural production.  The details of that I have not seen, but that is certainly at the headline level what the government wants to do.  It wants to turn Colombia back into a producer of food, that is, a producing country using its agricultural potential.  Again, and this was also in the UN speech, I think, if the government is to be able to respond to the environmental issue, as a country with big sections of the Amazon rainforest, there will be a lot of attention and pressure on Colombia.  It will not be possible to respond to that need of Colombians and of the world without international conversations or without an international shift in energy consumption.  That is the message going out.  It will be interesting to see how that develops over the coming years.<br/><br/>There was mention of the peace process and maybe a need for increased stipends.  I will just emphasise that continued attention on the peace agreement.  That is certainly what we are focused on doing, and all the support we can get for that is extremely welcome.<br/><br/>As for the transitional justice programme, I do not feel comfortable or in a position to speak about what can be learned here from Colombia.  What I can say, however, is that, while of course we have many challenges, positives have come through having the many recognitions of responsibility that former FARC commanders have made on multiple occasions, and the protests have led to several members of the military taking responsibility for their actions in the false positives killings I spoke about earlier.  I spoke to some of the victims, and that process is really important to them.  Those might be just anecdotal things, but we know that is important on a broader scale as well.  What is important now in that sense is that we will start to see sentences for different crimes come out for the FARC and for the state, so internationally it is important we are ready to respond in the way we want to respond.  It is to be hoped it will continue in the way that seems correct for the peace process and for the advancement of Colombia to respond in a way to support these decisions and how transitional justice is operating.  It will probably face a big backlash in Colombia, where the decisions go more one way or more another way.  It is important that our attention is on these decisions as they come out over the next few months.<br/><br/>Deputy Gannon mentioned women's issues and indigenous issues inside the peace process.  As with many elements of the peace process, recent years have been pretty tragic in terms of the potential and the hope that was there and how much it has advanced.  Among the issues that did not advance are what are called the <i>instantes</i>, the specific committees that were supposed to be set up to follow the implementation to make sure that it was keeping a focus on indigenous communities, Afro-Colombian communities and women communities.  Now those committees are being reinitiated and given a new lease of life.  It is early days, but we are, I think, in a position where we can be more hopeful.<br/><br/>To respond to the Chairman's comment about my optimism in this way, let us see what happens.  However, as for the proposals that are coming out and the language being used, these are the same as the things that human rights organisations and peace organisations have been asking for in recent years, so that is a good reason for us to be hopeful but also to keep our attention and maintain our pressure.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.585" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hasan Dodwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022101800002#F00600"><p>I have no doubt the organisers will be organising very important meetings.  From a Justice for Colombia perspective, and thinking about peace and human rights, maybe the committee might see things it would not otherwise see.  It is very important to meet with the newly appointed high commissioner for peace, Danilo Rueda.  There is also a peace commission in the Colombian House and Senate, so it would be good to get the view of what is happening with that total peace policy, what is the plan and how far it has advanced.  Those would be key groups and people to meet with.<br/><br/>As for the 2016 agreement and the need to continue to focus on that, lest we forget about it as an international community, it would be important to meet with the representatives of what is called the CSIVI, the committee for oversight of implementation.  It had really run dry over recent years.  Again, that has been reinitiated in recent weeks and will start meeting again.  There are representatives on that body from the FARC, or what is now called the Comunes political party, and the Colombian Government.  It would be really important to meet with representatives of the Comunes.  I am sure the committee will meet with representatives of the government in other guises as well, but it would definitely be important to meet with members of Comunes as one of the two sides to that peace process.<br/><br/>More broadly, as to where to go and not wanting to see only the nice parts and hotels of Bogot&aacute;, there are two aspects to this.  One is the importance, if possible and if time allows, for the committee to try to get to a reincorporation zone or FARC reincorporation camp.  These have two forms.  There are the official ones that were created under the peace agreement and then a number have been created in an <i>ad hoc</i>way.  There are 75 in total.  The vast majority, 10,000, of the more than 13,000 former combatants live outside of the official zones now, many in those newly created areas.  Whether one of the official zones or the newly created areas, it would be really important, if possible, to go and see how the rank-and-file former combatants are existing at the moment and what their needs are in respect of the successful implementation of the agreement.<br/><br/>The other side to the rural areas is to go and see areas where there are particular problems with human rights issues and security issues.  These killings are taking place in very specific regions in the countryside.  For example, the committee could go to Putumayo or to Cauca and meet with human rights organisations there.  A good organisation I would recommend meeting in those areas, one that has local groups, is the agricultural workers' union, FENSUAGRO.  Maybe the committee could make a visit to Putumayo and have some follow-up on what is happening with the families of Remanso.  That could be very interesting for the committee.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the issue of human rights and the protests.  It is important to follow up on that from what happened in 2021.  One organisation in that regard that would be key is the human rights network, Francisco Isa&iacute;as Cifuentes, in Cali, which is doing a lot of work with some of the young people who have been in prison since then.  It has a campaign to try to accompany them and make sure that any illegalities in their arrests and imprisonment do not continue to keep them in prison.<br/><br/>The committee will probably meet some of those groups at any rate, for example, the peace commissioner, the House and Senate and, I hope, the Comunes.  If Justice for Colombia can assist with anything, particularly in respect of the rural areas, the FARC former combatant camps, the human rights organisations in Cali or the agricultural workers' union in Putumayo, we would be very happy to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.586" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1692" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022101800002#G00100"><p>I welcome our two guests from Justice for Colombia.  On a personal level I appreciate the interaction with Mr. Finn over recent months with us.  He is very helpful and informative.  I had occasion to speak with him several times as I have a real interest in this issue, which I think is shared by everyone in the room.  I appreciate his interaction and his willingness to help and to inform, and his courtesy.</p> <p>  I am pleased that Ireland has a high profile here and that Colombia is high on the committee&rsquo;s agenda.  It is a priority for the Chair.  I am pleased that delegates from this committee will travel to Colombia.  That is important in order to keep the link.  I am pleased that our Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Teagasc have a role.  There are many forms of co-operation.  It is wonderful that since 2016 as a country we have contributed roughly &euro;17 million to support the peace process.  </p> <p>  I am also proud that a distinguished predecessor of the Chair as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Eamon Gilmore, who has been a friend of mine since my youth and indeed a friend of our Chair&rsquo;s since his youth, which is not that long ago, had a pivotal role in Colombia and I am proud of that as a fellow Member of the Oireachtas.  He did great work on this issue that the witnesses will acknowledge.  </p> <p>  I will make some comments and ask some questions.  There is inevitably an overlap because, unfortunately, the themes are similar.  In the briefing material and the documentation from the witnesses there is a great deal to be hopeful about on a number of fronts.  It is interesting that the president has admitted the failure of the war on drugs.  How do the witnesses see that?  What do they anticipate the learning from that failure will be?  What will be done there in future?  To admit failure is a start.  </p> <p>  In regard to the effort by the Colombian Government to be inclusive and to have what it calls a total peace, as it is described here, will the witnesses comment on the progress on that?  It is important that it is going to be inclusive.  I would be interested in the groupings being brought in, if the witnesses will elaborate on that.  Related to that, on the negative side, the number of killings this year was 144 and 13,071 since the signing of the peace agreement.  These are stark figures.  What do the witnesses think about the total peace initiative and what might come out of the talks?  Again, I would be interested in the widening of the groups.  A total of 22 illegal armed groups have said they are willing to enter the peace process as well as the FARC dissident group, which is hugely significant.  I am sure the witnesses would agree but do they see that actually succeeding?  What do they envisage happening?  The UN Secretary General's response to the new government seems positive. </p> <p>  The land reform is interesting along with the new pledge on rural reform and crop substitution.  Will Mr. Dodwell elaborate on rural reform?  That was always part of the Irish independence story as well.  Will he also comment on the efforts to locate disappeared people as part of the evolution of the truth commission.  What is the affect of that?  How successful is it?  My interpretation of the briefing material and documentation is that there is a mixture of hope and a certain level of a stark background.  I appreciate that is the case, from the committee's point of view, and feel this should remain a high priority issue on our agenda this term. </p></speech>

It is an interesting contribution.  Many of the questions I was going to put have been asked so I will not cover those again, except one or two.  Mr. Dodwell mentioned 8 million internally displaced persons, IDPs.  Will he comment on that and tell us more about the situation?  There are also 1.8 million refugees or displaced persons from Venezuela in Colombia.  Will he tell us about the impact that is having?  Relations between the two countries have resumed again.  Will he give his thoughts on that?  I would also be interested to know the impact of Covid-19 and the ongoing impact of it in Colombia.  Economics plays a huge part in everything we do all over the world.  What is the employment rate, especially for young people?  Has he any views on that?  He mentioned the human rights protests, and that health formed a big part.  Are there any movements to improve the situation in the health service?  Deforestation and the economic future of farmers have been covered.  He said 97% do not have a long-term economic alternative project, which is quite worrying.</p></speech>

It was succinct and up to date.  I welcome the fact that when mentioning those initiatives that remain outstanding, untouched or unmoved in the peace agreement and the commitments that have been made but have not yet been responded to in the way one would have expected, it is good to hear that the new administration is making the right soundings.  Whether that can translate into the right impact and the right initiatives remains to be seen.  The witnesses have responded to a fair number of detailed questions, which is appreciated.  We in this committee look forward to visiting Colombia, building on they have said and seeking responses from relevant authorities on the outstanding items that have not been progressed in the manner wished for.  It is important to know and to see what exactly is contained the programme for government of the new administration in regard to how it plans to deal with those outstanding items referred to.  It is great and yet grave at the same time.  We are proud of the committee, the Government and other Oireachtas Members to whom Senator O'Reilly referred who have built on the experience we have in this country regarding conflict resolution, notwithstanding the fact that items are outstanding there but not to the same grave extent as remains the case in Colombia.  I hope we can both learn from our experiences and assist one another in ensuring that progress is made in both jurisdictions.  We look forward to that and to the engagement of the committee.  We can touch base again upon the committee's return to share information in order to see what can be done to progress matters in the future.</p></speech>

Before calling Mr. Dodwell to reply to the number of questions and indeed not to be repetitive, I would like to underline what Senator O'Reilly said about the priority that the committee has placed over several years on the Colombian peace process.  The opening of an Irish Embassy in Bogota in 2019 and the resident Colombian ambassadorial office in Dublin since 2018 have been important in intensifying and deepening the bilateral relationship.</p><p>I acknowledge the work of the ambassador, H.E. Patricia Cort&eacute;s Ortiz here in Dublin.  At every level, she ensures this committee is fully briefed and that civil society in Ireland is engaged in what is an important peace process for us.  This is not something new, as Senator Joe O'Reilly has said.  This committee prioritised relations between Ireland and Colombia during the administration of President Santos.  That continued under the regime of President Duque and it will continue under the new administration of President Petro.  In fact, reading the speech given by the President at his inauguration, he seemed to be very strong on what he described as a "second opportunity" for Colombia.  He said people have earned this and he was going to prioritise it.  </p><p> Is the level of optimism contained in the President's inauguration day speech still evident in Colombia now?  He spoke of a new hope.  Mr. Dodwell said the peace process has survived, as though that in itself was an important aspect of current deliberations in Colombia.  In his speech, President Petro referred to the importance of social dialogue in every corner of the country.  He stressed that he was to be the President of all of Colombia.  He also said that the absence of the state hurts in many parts of Colombia.  Is there evidence to endorse what he said in his address?  What steps have been taken so far to ensure Colombia does not have no-go areas?  This aspect seems to be suggested in the contents of President Petro's early speech.</p><p> Turning to what Senator Joe O'Reilly mentioned regarding the search unit for missing persons and victims of enforced disappearances, is there evidence of engagement by victims and victims' groups to ensure confidence in the institutions set up?  Some of these have existed for some time.  I was pleased to note that over the years, and the last five or six years in particular, Ireland has been closely associated with EU initiatives regarding assistance and support for Colombia, with particular reference to the trust fund.  Ireland has contributed some &euro;17 million to it.  Does Mr. Dodwell still have confidence in the continuation of that level of EU support that we saw some years ago?  Deputy Stanton referred to refugees.  Perhaps Mr. Dodwell might give us a brief outline of the impact of the refugee situation, especially regarding those from Venezuela.  I refer to the impact this situation has had on the challenge of economic development or economic confidence in the context of the new regime.</p><p> I thank Mr. Dodwell not only for his engagement with us but for his broader engagement here across civil society and in Britain.  He is raising awareness and ensuring that we are not only apprised of the situation in Colombia but are in a position to act in the manner he described earlier while replying to Deputy Brady.  I thank Mr. Dodwell and Mr. Finn for being here.  I will leave them with those few questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hasan Dodwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022101800002#H00200"><p>I thank the Chair.  I recognise and respect the work done here to support peace and human rights in Colombia.  I follow this closely and I am aware of how many of the members are focused and committed to the issue.  This is obviously felt in Colombia.  Certainly, the people we work with know about this aspect.  Mention was also made of the embassies.  We have worked closely and regularly with the Colombian Embassy here, as well as the Irish Embassy in Bogot&aacute;.  This is an important relationship for us.</p> <p>  Regarding optimism and whether this is evident in Colombia, this is a broad question.  One aspect is that the election of President Petro is a shift from normal electoral culture in Colombia and a sign that people wanted to try something new.  The existence now of such a broad coalition also shows this shift may extend beyond just the voting base of President Petro and that there is a coming together behind his vision, and not just his vision but that of his government, including Vice President Francia M&aacute;rquez, and many others.  It indicates that this is a time to put a big effort into trying something serious in achieving peace.  Many people on the Colombian congressional level, certainly, are behind this effort.  It also seems to be attracting much support on a societal level now.  Undoubtedly, the effort being made is also recognised within the human rights and peace organisations.  It is early days and let us see what happens but I think this optimism is present now.  No one, however, is ignorant of the challenges.  Many parts of the country - one third is a rough estimate - have no or very little state presence.  The state is almost absent and these are the areas where the violence is most predominantly taking place.  I am trying to take the queries in order.</p> <p>  Senator Joe O'Reilly referred to there still being hope and worry.  No one is unaware of this.  Everything being done takes this into consideration.  Killings of community activists are still continuing.  This is tragic.  Justice for Colombia continually raises the voices of those communities to try to increase their protection.  We know things are not going to change from one day to the next.  We must be aware and prepared for this situation, therefore, while supporting the positive steps being taken.</p> <p>  Moving to the war on drugs, this was also mentioned earlier and I referred to some of the points in this regard a moment ago when responding to Deputy Gannon.  On what happens now, as I said, many of the steps needed were contained in the 2016 peace agreement in a chapter on drugs and illicit crops.  It has not been implemented as much as it might have been.  This does not mean, however, that there is not plenty there to work with.  The key element to this, in broad terms, was ending the militarised approach to coca farmers and the growing of the coca crop.  I refer to the plant itself.  The key initiative here is ending the militarised and criminalised approach towards the coca farmers and recognising the socioeconomic factors at work.  This is the core of an alternative and more successful policy on drugs.  It would be one which would listen to and follow what the communities themselves are saying, as well as what those working on Colombia concerning these issues are saying.  </p> <p>  There is, though, a big "but" here, and this is partly what the Colombian Government is trying to communicate.  Changing the policy in Colombia alone is not going to be enough.  The question of "what now", therefore, is also about what happens now in the international community and its approach towards the war on drugs and drugs policies.  In this context, the question is what changes might be made to assist producer countries to ensure the relationship between drugs and violence comes to an end.</p> <p>  On total peace, some of the information is in the briefing.  Mention was already made of the initial talks the high commissioner for peace has been having with different armed groups.  A process has been initiated with the ELN, the largest guerrilla group and talks will start at the beginning of November.  These will continue from what had previously been negotiated under the Santos Government and during the initial stages of the Duque Government.</p><p>The idea of how these talks will continue and exactly what they will look like is still very much to be defined.  However, so far, the Government has put out a call to say this is what it wants to do.  Many of the armed groups have responded to say they are open to it, they are listening and suggest talking.  As I said previously, several ceasefires have already been declared and let us measure this over the next couple of months.  There is an initial indication, however, that we may already be starting to see something positive from that.  Again, that is not to underplay the ongoing killings that are still happening and the tragedy of that.  That is where we are at.  We are in very early days, the feelers have been put out, there has been a positive response and the work is ongoing in that realm.</p><p> It is important to add that what is now happening at the same time, this is part of the vision of what I am seeing from the new Government, is the holding of mass regional meetings with local communities, particularly in the areas that are most affected by conflict.  That is to feed into any peace talks with armed groups in order that they are also directly involved in those talks and in what comes out of them.  It is also more broadly part of the production and writing of what is called in Colombia the national development plan, which is the overall framework for the four years of the government and of what they will do.  They are having mass consultations across the country to feed into that.  That is something that Senator Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; Pizarro Rodr&iacute;guez spoke about when she was over recently.  That is part of what is happening in terms of the total peace plan.  What is happening more broadly touches on the point the Chair raised about the reaching out to these no-go zones and areas and hidden corners in order that there is social dialogue in every corner.  This is starting to materialise in practice.  These meetings are starting to be set up with different state authorities there and with local groups.  Of course, as I keep saying, we are in an initial moment and let us see what happens.  </p><p> The Senator mentioned possible collaborations and support.  Certainly, what we would like to work on after this is to look at proposing and trying to get adhesion to a big statement in support of some of the positive elements that we are seeing around peace and the total peace plan.  If that is something that might be agreeable to members here that would be fantastic.  Hopefully, we can try to promote actions that show international support for any positive steps that come.  Hopefully, Mr. Finn and I will be in touch about that.  </p><p> On the subject of rural reform, one issue is the declaration from the government that that is its absolute priority in terms of its focus on the implementation of the 2016 agreement and recognising that this is the front and centre issue that has to be advanced.  The agreement to purchase 3 million ha of land from the cattle ranchers' federation is a positive step.  It has already started making moves to set up the agrarian jurisdiction or to reinvigorate that.  It has announced that it will continue with some of the things that had already been developing in terms of what are called the Programas de Desarrollo con Enfoque Territorial, PDETs, that is, the specialised rural development plans for the most problematic regions.  There are therefore new words and now we are starting to see some actions to focus on that rural reform issue. </p><p> The search for the disappeared unit is a part of the transitional justice mechanisms that may be less spoken about than the other two but as members will have hopefully seen in our briefing, it has made some really important material advances to connect families with stories and the bodies of their loved ones and even with connecting people with loved ones who were still alive.  Their work has uncovered some mass graves.  The task is mammoth in Colombia.  As we said, there are 120,000, according to the truth commission, or maybe up to 210,000 people who have been disappeared.  At the current rate, it would be approximately another 78 years for them to be able to have had some sort of a lead on all of the different cases.  That is a huge task but it does not undermine what has already been achieved there. </p><p> In terms of displacement, obviously in terms of the historic displacement in Colombia, for a long time it was the highest and second-highest country for internal displacement in the world.  It still continues, sadly.  I do not have the figures to hand but I can send them over after this meeting.  There are, however, still thousands of people and many families who are forced to flee from their homes every single year in Colombia as a result of this lack of security and lack of civilian state presence in the rural areas.  That is tragic and that is why the focus on getting security and civilian state presence and negotiating with these armed groups is so fundamental. </p><p> A couple of members mentioned the influx of refugees from Venezuela.  Many people came over recent years into Colombia.  It is now seeming to be positive, certainly on a practical level, to have diplomatic relations reopened in order that there can be conversations between the two countries and governments, when that had previously completely broken down.  This is first on the question of the refugees but also on the question of insecurity because some of the armed groups are operating in those border areas and it is obviously very hard to respond to that if the governments have no relations.  That was a big motivation for them both to reinitiate that diplomatic relationship.  Hopefully, we can see some positive results from that in terms both of the migrants and refugees from Venezuela and of the security situation in that region.  </p><p> On the issue of Covid-19 and unemployment, I am afraid that I do not have the latest figures on Covid-19.  Yet, when I was following it back in the day when Covid-19 was front and centre in my mind on a day-to-day basis, it felt very similar to here in terms of numbers and impact.  Hopefully, we will know all of that unless I am completely off, but it was at some point when I was looking at it.  I think that is generally how it was.  I think what was interesting about Covid-19 and unemployment, and those two were mentioned together probably not by chance, is that is much of the discontent, certainly of what was reported from Colombia in terms of the analyses there, concerned the shock to the system and people&rsquo;s immediate lives because so many people work in the informal sector in Colombia who then could not go and work.  As there was not the apparatus or the subsidies for them to have something to replace that work, poverty levels became highly problematic for people.  Many people said that this is what led to the huge protests in 2021.  It was that combination of Covid-19 worsening the situation and rising poverty levels.  In the brief that went round, I noted the latest poverty levels that were quoted from the Colombian institution that measures them.  There are sadly still very high figures.  Those two issues combined to contribute to where we are at today in Colombia.  </p><p> On the issue of how to respond, mention was made of elements of the peace agreement that have not been advanced as much as we might have hoped and how to respond to those.  Obviously, there is the statement of intent.  Two key things that have happened so far, although we could probably mention others, are the relaunching of two of the bodies that were key to the implementation of the peace agreement.  The first of these is the oversight body, which is called the CSIVI in Colombia.  I will not translate that because it will be meaningless in a direct translation but it is the implementation oversight body on which there are representatives from the FARC and from the government.  That has now been relaunched and that is a great signal of intent.  Materially, it will hopefully help with the implementation, as well as with the National Commission on Security Guarantees, which was set up as part of the peace agreement specifically to look at the insecurity in rural areas and in other parts of the country.  It had been instructed to try to generate a policy to respond to the presence of illegal armed groups.  It is supposed to develop a policy towards the dismantling of illegal armed groups, including paramilitary successor groups or neo-paramilitary groups.</p><p>A big demand of human rights organisations mentioned repeatedly in the UN mission report was that this had not advanced sufficiently and that it was not meeting enough.  This was the place we were supposed to see a policy developed to confront these illegal armed groups that are causing such chaos in Colombia, but it has not happened.  If there was a seriousness to tackle this insecurity issue, why has this not developed?  It is positive that this body has also been relaunched.</p><p> There is a mention of touching base after the trip, which would be fantastic and we would love to hear what the committee members see and their conclusions from that trip.  That brings me back to the Chair's comment.  I tried to answer at the beginning whether that optimism is shared and, of course, many people will still need to be convinced.  The election result was almost 50-50 between Gustavo Petro and Rodolfo Hern&aacute;ndez.  Many others did not vote.  There is a lot of convincing to do.  We want to see material change.  We want to see people no longer being killed.  Hopefully, we can see something along those lines that might bring more people on board.  However, there is a certain level of optimism.</p><p> Regarding victims' groups gaining confidence in the institutions, the groups we work with support the peace process.  They have known decades of impunity in the normal court systems towards the crimes that have been committed against them.  For them, the transitional justice system offers an alternative.  Despite all its imperfections, the transitional justice system is offering far more to victims than was being offered before now.  There is definitely considerable trust and confidence.  There will always be shortcomings, but there is certainly recognition that this is a positive step to getting victims' rights respected in Colombia.  I think that responds to all the questions asked.  I reiterate my thanks for the invitation to appear before the committee.</p></speech>

I am Chair of the Psychological Society of Ireland&rsquo;s special interest group in perinatal and infant mental health, SIGPIMH.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Dr. Jillian Doyle, and she is a committee member of the special interest group.<br/><br/>Perinatal services are where the earliest interventions begin for mothers, care givers, and infants.  These are the interventions that set the foundation for the mother-child relationship and, indeed, provide the blueprint for much of a child&rsquo;s later emotional development.  We know that investing early and smartly by supporting parents and family systems is likely one of the more cost-effective ways to promote mental health.<br/><br/>The focus on mothers, infants and relationships in the context of the broader family.  Today, we will advocate for a broadening of the model of perinatal health in the following ways: to invite the infant into the perinatal services and the services into the world of the infant; to include those who have been largely excluded; to provide a continuum of care between perinatal and community services; and enable perinatal services to become trauma informed.  <br/><br/>As the perinatal model of care takes root, psychologists increasingly recognise the need to provide services that cater to the needs of the mother-child dyad.  Perinatal teams are at capacity in meeting the mental health needs of pregnant and postpartum people.  We know that the first 1,000 days are the most significant in a child&rsquo;s development and, therefore, we believe that each of the perinatal teams would benefit from an infant mental health practitioner.  We also strongly advocate for the provision of mother and baby units that cater comprehensively for the needs of the mother, child and family.<br/><br/>We must move towards a model of combined care that alleviates the mental health burden on parents and encourages the global development of children.  The current iteration of the perinatal services is not equipped to carry out work with babies.  Services are in portacabins and in shared office spaces.  We need to expand perinatal services so that both mothers and babies are supported, and clinicians have the appropriate tools to do the therapeutic work.  <br/><br/>To date, no service has been developed for partners in the perinatal period.  Evidence suggests an unmet treatment need for paternal depression and anxiety.  Lack of support from the partner is one of the strongest predictors of postnatal depression in women.  This is a service gap.<br/><br/>Teenagers are at high risk of developing perinatal mental health disorders.  Due to their age this cohort cannot access perinatal services thus denying them access to timely and appropriate care.  We advocate for the provision of psychological care to this cohort and believe that a working group could be formed to explore how best to provide this care.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, parents of premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU, are at high risk for depression, anxiety and acute traumatic stress with negative implications for parenting and infant development.  Researchers recommend ongoing assessment of the perinatal mental health needs of parents as part of the network of services available in NICU.  Adequate staff resourcing of the health and social care professionals team, as highlighted in the neonatal model of care, would help actualise perinatal and infant mental health across NICUs and paediatric intensive care units or PICUs in Ireland.<br/><br/>Primary care psychology services are ideally placed to meet the unique experiences of the perinatal period.  The perinatal model of care advocates for primary care psychologists to prioritise pregnant women.  Prioritisation has been impacted by restrictions on public health nurse screenings, which limits referrals, and by long waiting lists.  We believe that investment in primary care psychology will ensure a continuity of care for women and families.<br/><br/>Finally, best practice tells us that care offered to women should be trauma informed.  Trauma-informed care prioritises safety, choice, decision-making and control.  Healthcare professionals also need to be supported via the provision of adequate staff, regular training and supervision about how to communicate with and care for women.</p><p>The Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI, recognises that operating from this value base will require significant systemic change.  However, we believe that the benefits to women, infants, partners, healthcare staff and society will ultimately greatly outweigh the cost of change.</p><p> According to the eminent psychologist John Bowlby, &ldquo;If a community values its children, it must cherish their parents&rdquo;.  In the PSI and our special interest group, we strongly believe that perinatal and infant mental health services offer a unique opportunity to cherish both parents and children in Ireland.  We urge you, the leaders of our country, to invite in the infant, the mother and the family.  As a State, we have birthed these perinatal services; now it is time to parent them and help them to reach their full potential.</p></speech>

My colleague, Dr. Margo Wrigley, the national lead for the specialist perinatal mental health programme, and I are here on behalf of the HSE.</p> <p>  In my role as national clinical adviser and group lead in mental health, I work with national leads and programme managers on the design and implementation of the clinical programmes in mental health.  The specialist perinatal mental health programme is one of these.  Other programmes we look after include programmes on: self-harm in emergency departments; early intervention in psychosis; eating disorders in adults and children; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, in adults; and dual diagnosis, which is where addiction issues and mental health issues present together.  We also support service improvement programmes such as those on mental health services for those with intellectual disability and older persons.  </p> <p>  All of these clinical programmes and service improvements have certain things in common.  One is that they address unmet clinical need.  Most of the mental health services are delivered by primary and secondary care services but there are certain cohorts of patients that need bespoke specialised services.  Clinical programmes and service improvement programmes plug that gap.  We have an overarching aim of standardising quality, evidence-based practice across mental health services.  This means that the service provided in Dublin should be the same as that provided in Cork, in Donegal or anywhere else in the country.  We try to step in early.  Early intervention is key.  Community orientation is one of our focuses.  Rather than bringing people into acute units, we try to manage them in the community as much as possible.  Most of our models of care and initiatives involve work with training bodies and voluntary organisations.  We take a holistic approach with all of these programmes.</p> <p>  As I mentioned, most mental health services are delivered by primary and secondary care services.  Only those patients who require a bespoke specialist response to ensure their needs are met promptly by skilled mental health professionals are referred to these clinical programmes.  The specialist perinatal mental health programme specifically meets the mental health needs of women during pregnancy and up to a year post delivery.  This programme was launched in 2017 and implementation started in 2018.  Dr. Wrigley will brief the committee on the services now available for women.  We have prepared a few slides that give an overview of the service.  We are happy to take any questions at the end to help members understand our programme.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.608" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Margo Wrigley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022101800002#C00500"><p>I also thank the committee for the invitation to talk about the specialist perinatal mental health service and specifically about its design and national implementation.  The next slide aims to put the programme in context.  On the numbers side of the slide, we see the number of women likely to develop mental health problems each year.  These figures are based on an annual birth rate of approximately 60,000.  To give on example, approximately 2,000 women might be expected to develop a severe depressive disorder.  The other point to be made is that women may suffer from a whole range of mental health problems.</p><p>My colleague, Professor McCarthy, will give members a bit more of a feel for that.</p><p> When we started this programme, there were just four whole-time equivalent staff working in the area of perinatal mental health, all based in Dublin.  There were three part-time psychiatrists.  One was working with a mental health clinical nurse specialist, the second was working with two perinatal mental health midwives and the third was working alone in the Coombe hospital.</p><p> It is really important to identify these problems not only because of the impact on the mother, which is substantial, but also because of the impact on the infant, which can be lifelong, causing a range of emotional, behavioural and cognitive problems.  Naturally, of course, there is an impact on the wider family.  There is a very strong economic argument for providing services.  A very reputable study carried out by the London School of Economics showed that for each birth in the UK, there was a cost of &pound;10,000 in terms of perinatal mental health problems.  This was for each woman, irrespective of whether she had such a problem.  It was found that the cost to remedy the problem would be just &pound;600.  In that context, there is an enormously strong economic argument for dealing with the problem.</p><p> The seminal event in developing this programme was the publication of the Government's national maternity strategy in 2016.  At that time, we had a mental health division within the HSE and considered the strategy.  That then national director decided it would be appropriate for us, as the providers of secondary care mental health services, to consider how we might meet the requirements associated with the seven mental health points outlined in the strategy.  As Dr. Niazi has already said, we worked on the strategy and it was published at the end of 2017.</p><p> The working group was multidisciplinary, as one would expect with any mental health strategy, but, crucially, we had service-user input provided by the Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services - Ireland, AIMSI, through Dr. Krysia Lynch.  While we had been asked to look at the specialist perinatal mental health response to women with moderate to severe problems, on foot of the strong advocacy of AIMSI we expanded that to ensure there would also be a response provided to women with mild to moderate problems.  We covered those two areas.  The aim was to have both responses integrated with the maternity services because it is in those services that pregnant women and women whose babies are to be delivered present.</p><p> The next slide is to show members exactly what we have developed.  We had two challenges to start off with.  One was that there are actually 19 maternity services in Ireland.  The second was that the number of births ranged from a high in the Rotunda last year of over 9,000 to a low of 950 in the south Tipperary maternity service.  A number of the services have a high number of births, a couple have an intermediate number, and most have about 1,500.  Therefore, in order to provide a national service, we recommended the development of the service according to a hub-and-spoke model in line with the maternity networks recommended in the national maternity strategy, which are modelled on the hospital groups.  The idea was that the hub hospital maternity service would host the multidisciplinary specialist perinatal mental health team, led by a perinatal psychiatrist.  I have listed in the slide where the six services are based.  In the spokes, the psychiatry service is provided by liaison psychiatry.  We recommended that both elements have perinatal mental health midwives working within the 19 services.  The map shows the hub-and-spoke model.  In Galway, for instance, the team is based in Galway University Hospital maternity service and it is working with four spokes: Portiuncula, Mayo, Sligo and Letterkenny.</p><p> The only point I would like to make on this clinical pathway is that when a woman arrives at a maternity service for the first time for her book-in clinic, she meets a midwife.  The midwife asks her not only about her physical health but also about her mental health.</p><p>The two specific questions asked are if she has in the past month been feeling low, depressed or down in herself; and if she has in the past month lost interest or pleasure in doing things.  If the woman says "Yes", she is asked if this is something she would like help with and can then be referred on to the service.  Other questions are also asked about current and past mental health history and family history.  Who the woman is seen by depends on the severity of the problem.</p><p> The responsibility of the hub team is to provide advice to the spokes - specifically the perinatal mental health midwives and the liaison service - offer second opinions on women attending those spoke services where this is clinically indicated, organise monthly network meetings and organise relevant education for the staff in both hub and spoke services and the maternity service as a whole.</p><p> We are almost five years on from the implementation of the programme.  I, as clinical lead, and Ms Fiona O'Riordan, as programme manager, were asked by the national director of the mental health division to stay on and oversee the implementation of the programme.  We were very fortunate in that, right from the start, there was some funding allocated to implement the model of care.  The division allocated &euro;1 million.  A further &euro;2 million was allocated by the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health at the time.  Subsequently, &euro;1.2 million was allocated to us by the national women and infants health programme.  That was specifically for the perinatal mental health midwife posts.  Last year we got another &euro;0.6 million from the national women's task force.  We have a total of &euro;5.8 million to implement part of the programme.  What we worked on in the early days was recruitment, training and induction of new staff.  We were very lucky that though we only had four people working in the area, they were all very highly skilled and very supportive of the programme, particularly Professor McCarthy.  They were involved in providing induction and people came to visit the services and stayed with them for periods of time.  When the first two full-time perinatal psychiatrists were in post in April 2018, we set up a national group.  That has expanded to encompass all six hubs and ensures spoke representation and representation from each discipline.  For instance, we have Dr. Niamh O'Dwyer from Limerick representing psychology.  We developed a data set to capture clinical activity and we have worked on advancing the development of a mother and baby unit.</p><p> To give the committee an idea of the staffing that is in place, we now have a full staffing of all the multidisciplinary staff we recommended for each of the hub teams.  We have included the administrator in the hub team because they are the first point of contact for women and their families so it is important to have them working with us as part of our team.  In addition to the recruitment for the hub teams, we also recruited perinatal mental health midwives for each of the spoke sites, with 13 in total.  They are all in place, as well as perinatal mental health midwives for the hub sites.  I have listed the sites on the slides.</p><p> As to how we were able to implement all of this, we had an implementation mechanism that was put in place by the division.  Ms O'Riordan and I have done that.  We also had funding allocated because we would have gotten nowhere without funding, to be quite honest.  We had the existing highly-trained staff, as I have already mentioned.  We were able to work collaboratively with the national women and infants health programme, so that is very much in line with Sl&aacute;intecare principles of integrated care.  A key part of this was developing the perinatal mental health midwife role.  That started in the Rotunda but is now available at all 19 sites.</p><p>We also have good working relationships with hub and spoke sites and the HSE national recruitment service.  We have provided two tranches of bespoke training.  We had a link with Maudsley Hospital in London, which was very helpful in that regard, but now have our own very highly trained staff.  We have developed a map for all staff who are in contact with women in this period.  In a recent development, we now have six full-time higher training posts in perinatal psychiatry which means that we can provide our own psychiatrists who are trained in this specialist area to work with women during the perinatal period.</p><p> Moving to the next slide and without wishing to paraphrase a very famous man who was previously in these Houses, we have done a lot but there is a lot more to do.  I will mention our key priorities.  We are still not happy with the clinic accommodation for the three hub teams provided on HSE sites in Galway, Cork and Limerick.  To give the committee an idea of the situation, we have eight clinical staff in Galway.  From Monday to Thursday, inclusive, they have just one clinic room for eight staff, which obviously does not compute.  On Fridays, they have three rooms.  That is a big problem.  We have introduced video-enabled care but that does not meet the needs.  That is a major issue.</p><p> A national mother and baby unit is absolutely key because now, if a woman develops a severe mental health problem, a postpartum psychosis for example, and requires in-patient care in a mental health unit, she has to be separated from her baby.  That is very traumatic for the mother and I cannot even begin to describe the effects on the baby, which Dr. N&iacute; Longphuirt has already touched on.  The effects are not just immediate.  For the infant, they are lifelong and have an impact into adulthood.  We would like to develop support from perinatal psychiatrists through the spoke links by providing a ring-fenced perinatal psychiatry session for each spoke link.  With the funding we got from the national women and infants health programme, we are going to be able to do that in the Galway spokes.  Each of those four spokes will have a ring-fenced session.  The perinatal psychiatrist will be linked in to the liaison service, the perinatal mental health midwife, to provide supervision and advice to the psychiatrist, where necessary.  The psychiatrist will also provide a virtual second opinion for women attending the spoke sites.</p><p> The next slide brings us back to what this programme is all about, women and their infants.  We would like women to be aware that mental health problems are common during this period.  They affect up to one in five women during pregnancy or in the year after delivery.  They are not the women's fault and are not nothing to be ashamed of.  We would like women to be compassionate towards themselves and to seek help.  We have tried to reform the system but it is only part of the system.  As Dr. N&iacute; Longphuirt said, there are other parts that need to be developed, for example, primary care psychology.  However, we have tried to reform the system to meet the needs of women and their infants and to ensure that the services we provide are recovery-focused, imbued with hope, accessible to women and provided by skilled staff.  We hope the outcome will be an enhancement of resilience in women and the development of resilience in infants.  The mother-infant bond is the focus of the interventions we provide within the specialist perinatal mental health services.  That, in itself, will be of lifelong benefit for infants into childhood and, eventually, adulthood.  </p><p> The picture at the top of this slide shows a World Mental Health Day event the Limerick hub team organised in Castletroy Park Hotel last Monday.  Approximately 70 women who attend the service came along and 23 or so brought their babies along.  They had a great day.  That is just to give the committee an idea of who we are talking about.</p><p>Some of them prioritised attending on the day when they had their appointments with Dr. Mas Mahady Mohamad, who is the consultant perinatal psychiatrist in Limerick.</p><p> The final gives the committee the link into the programme if the members are interested in having a closer look at it.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I have been a consultant psychiatrist in perinatal psychiatry at the National Maternity Hospital for more than 26 years.  During this time, I have seen and been responsible for the care of more than 15,000 women, including those in health difficulties in pregnancy or in the postpartum period.  I previously addressed Oireachtas committees on the subject of perinatal mental health.  I addressed the citizens' assembly on the protection on life in pregnancy legislation.  I am an associate professor of psychiatry at UCD.  I am also an expert psychiatric assessor for the confidential inquiries into maternal deaths in Great Britain and Ireland.  I thank the committee for inviting all of us to address the members today.  Trying to fit my contribution into five minutes will be very difficult.  I completely agree with everything that has been said by the previous contributors.  I will try not to repeat was has already been stated.</p> <p>  The specialist perinatal mental health services are a vitally important component of our mental health services.  Why are they so important and necessary?  First, pregnancy, birth and the demands of new motherhood can be seriously challenging for any woman's mental health.  Second, a mother's mental health difficulties can have very significant negative impacts on obstetric outcomes and on the baby.  It works in both ways.</p> <p>  I will outline the challenges of pregnancy for women's mental health.  A mother is 19 times more likely to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the first six weeks after the birth of a baby than in any other six-week period in her whole life.  It is a particular window, but it does not stop there.  Post-natal depression affects 11% of all new mothers - which in one in nine - and is the commonest complication of pregnancy.  It is more common than infections, trauma or bleeding.  A psychotic illness post-delivery occurs in one in 500 mothers.  Although the image of mothers in pregnancy is often of women glowing and contented, in reality pregnancy is frequently an extremely challenging time for women's mental health.  Normal pregnancy can be very physically and emotionally demanding.  Any women in the room who have had babies will know all of this.  While having a child is joyful and meaningful too, many women may have to deal with miscarriage, still birth, haemorrhage or pre-eclampsia, not to mention complicated deliveries, traumatic deliveries, hormone changes, the demands of breast feeding and other complications and demands.  That is the physical side.</p> <p>  The psychological and social challenges of pregnancy are considerable for so many.  There are unplanned pregnancies, unwanted pregnancies, or the discovery of major abnormalities.  There are previous difficult pregnancy experiences and the woman is pregnant again or there have been pregnancy losses before.  There may be complications in relationships due to pregnancy or the massively significant increase in domestic violence associated with pregnancy: men are much more likely to be violent or have affairs when their partners are pregnant.  Previous psychological or psychiatric issues are frequently exacerbated by pregnancy, and very often new and seriously challenging issues, as listed above, present for the first time.  Previous mental health difficulties, such as anxiety, depression, bipolar illness, and post-traumatic stress disorder do not disappear in pregnancy and are often complicated by it and frequently worsen after it unless addressed and appropriately treated.  All of these pose considerable risks to the well-being and sometimes the safety of the mother, her baby, and her whole family.</p> <p>  The other side of it is that mental health difficulties affect pregnancy outcomes.  Mothers with significant mental health disorders frequently present differently to antenatal clinics, post-natal clinics and emergency rooms.  For example, those with depression, psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, etc., are less likely to attend for appointments or scans and will therefore have issues missed.  Others with major anxiety disorders may present over-regularly and obsessively and may exhibit risky behaviours as a result.  I will list the latter afterwards.</p> <p>  Those with major mental health issues can struggle with adherence to advice regarding medication, whether it is for medical conditions such as diabetes in pregnancy, eating disorders in pregnancy, or hypertension in pregnancy, and they are less likely to take vaccines or psychotropic medication for their mental health disorders.  Similarly, advice around diet, baby care, and safety are sometimes more likely to be ignored, misunderstood or misinterpreted.</p> <p>  Women with mental health difficulties are also more likely to be victims of domestic violence and abuse.</p><p>There are increased rates of termination of pregnancy among women with mental health issues.  They are also more likely to have premature deliveries and instrumental deliveries, such as deliveries requiring forceps.  Caesarean sections and traumatic births are more likely.  It works in both ways: traumatic births can affect women's mental health and women with mental health difficulties are more likely to have traumatic births.  Again, it is circular and we must always address both sides.</p><p> At-risk behaviours are more common in women with mental health difficulties.  I refer to increased rates of smoking, drinking and drug abuse during pregnancy, possibly resulting in withdrawal syndromes among babies or foetal alcohol syndrome.  Women with eating disorders may have a very poor diet, be vomiting or use purgatives.  Those with anxiety may physically over-check their babies.  Women who are highly anxious about their babies not moving may press on their stomachs to check for movement, maybe at 3 a.m., 4 a.m. and 5 a.m.  After a baby is born, an anxious mother may wake it up constantly to check on it because she fears it will suffer a cot death.  Such mothers cannot deal with their anxiety or obsessional worries.  All of these issues are associated not just with obstetric complications but also with subsequent developmental and attachment issues, to which my psychology colleagues have been referring.</p><p> There are also the serious mental health issues leading to suicide and infanticide.  Suicide is the second most common cause of maternal death in the country, although it is still uncommon.  Despite many of the advances in obstetric care, it is still a huge issue.  Infanticide, while fortunately rare, is always a tragedy, and the rate is probably underestimated.</p><p> The other major mental illnesses that can present at this difficult, key time, including psychosis and depression, have all been shown on the slides.  Frequently, these can have lifelong effects, not just on the mother's mental health but also on that of the infants.  There can also be lifelong effects on the mother's relationship, her relationship with her baby and sometimes her relationship with other children.  She may never quite recover.</p><p> What are the functions of the perinatal mental service?  Dr. Wrigley has listed these already but I wish to flesh the subject out a little.  One function is to assess and advise women referred to the specialist mental health teams with mental health difficulties through pregnancy and the first year after birth.  Another function is to assess, diagnose and treat effectively those mothers with moderate to severe mental health problems through pregnancy and the first year after birth, and also to carry out expert risk assessments because the risks are huge.</p><p> Treatments may include psychological interventions, social interventions, psycho-education, parenting supports and skills training.  Also included are safe prescribing and advice on the safe prescribing of medication in pregnancy and after birth.  We do not stop treating people with major mental illnesses with their medication during pregnancy or if they are breast-feeding because the balance of risks is huge in such circumstances.  We must proceed safely and be able to give expert advice to mothers and psychiatry services throughout the country, certainly those in our spoke hospitals.</p><p> Treatments also include referring for psychiatric admission those mothers who are most at risk and in need of inpatient treatment.  As mentioned, the absence of a mother and baby unit for mothers who require admission is the single biggest deficit in our services.  We also make referrals to key community services, whether these involve primary care psychology, services in the voluntary sector, Barnardos, mothering skills supports and supports for mothers in the community.  We have to be experts.  Our social work team is very good at knowing who to refer to outside the hospital.</p><p> Assessment of risk also includes assessment of the mother&ndash;infant interaction.  That has been listed.  The team also gives pre-conceptual advice to those mothers with serious mental illness who are considering pregnancy.  That may be advice on mediation, or it might be advice for those who have had a traumatic experience or eating disorder.  We also provide specialist assessment and advice as per the requirements under the Termination of Pregnancy Act 2018.</p><p> I hope the importance of these issues is understood and appreciated.  We certainly understand and appreciate them.  The development of the specialist teams and services has represented a considerable advance in care.  We are so grateful to the HSE and the Department of Health for supporting all that.  Obviously, we need a mother and baby unit and would like to develop more support for smaller maternity units.  Obviously, we would also like to develop all the services my psychology colleagues referred to, including supports for infants, fathers and families, and to keep growing them.  The need is great.  The perinatal period is vital.  If it starts off well between mothers and babies, and families and babies, and if babies are securely attached at the beginning and their mothers are well, it is such an investment in the lifelong well-being of the children, their families and our society.</p></speech>

This is an area in which I am very interested and one I hope has been improving in the past couple of years.  I have a lot of questions, which I will try to organise into groups.</p> <p>  I start with the questions that are about the interaction of this issue with other issues.  For example, reference was made to eating disorders and how they interact with perinatal mental health.  For everybody here, one of our questions would be about how good we are at identifying two intersecting issues and providing the right kind of care in such instances.  As well as eating disorders, there is the question of how the issue we are discussing may affect particular cohorts, such as Travellers, who might have particular mental health issues.  Another example is people living in consistent poverty, who may have particular requirements, as well as members of new communities in Ireland.  There was also reference to people with ADHD and those kinds of issues.  How do we deal with that?  What about issues around disability?  I refer not just to women who have disabilities themselves and obviously have tonnes of challenges and mental requirements of their own, but also women who give birth and it becomes obvious immediately, as is my own experience, that a serious disability is in play for the child.</p> <p>  I have included a lot in that question, for which I apologise.  It concerns what might be referred to as the co-identification of issues.</p></speech>

With regard to poverty, there are medical social workers.</p></speech>

I have been reading some of the research on this and it seems to be very common that people would not necessarily hide their illness but they may underplay it during a pregnancy because they are worried they might be identified as problematic.  I am trying to get a sense of when such people are identified.  Is it at the 20-week scan?  Are people being encouraged to talk about having an eating disorder, say, or something else that is happening in the woman's life, such as disability or ADHD?  Are we encouraging a moment where women could say to their caregivers, "This is an issue for me and I need support"?</p></speech>

People can be referred at five weeks into their pregnancy.  Some women who come to the antenatal clinic are asked some woolly questions, which may be an opportunity to raise such issues.  Their weight will be taken.  Many women with eating disorders have excessive vomiting during pregnancy.  Unfortunately, vomiting is a very normal part of pregnancy for lots of women and they often have different patterns of vomiting.  When somebody presents with vomiting, people are thinking about weight issues.  It sometimes depends on the woman coming forth with the issue and, very often, women with eating disorders have recovered to become pregnant.  Many will have recovered to a certain extent, which is how they are able to get pregnant.  Those with severe anorexia cannot get pregnant because ovarian function switches off.</p> <p>  For many, there is an opportunity for such issues to be raised and they start to worry about that.  They may admit they are taking laxatives.  They might begin to talk about it or sometimes we or the dieticians pick it up.  We cannot say we always pick it up but we often do.  The women are then referred to us.  We have a number of patients we are seeing who are also, for instance, seeing eating disorder teams elsewhere.  It comes up in all sorts of different ways.  The Deputy raised a question as to whether there is a direct pathway for that.  The system certainly could be improved but the issues involved present the same difficulties as with every issue.  The Deputy mentioned a lot in her contribution.  As she was describing all the different issues, whether disability, poverty or eating disorders, it came to my mind that we are constantly dealing with the tapestry of everybody's life.</p><p>Pregnancy brings up everything.  It is a key moment when one's personal, body and relationship history and personal, mental health, physical and social difficulties all come together and coalesce.  It is up to us as a service to be as good as we can at picking that up and then channelling the person towards medical social workers if it is a poverty or housing issue or towards the dieticians, whatever it might be, with all of us working together, I hope.</p></speech>

We have heard before at this committee that we have nothing near the kind of supports needed for eating disorders.  I am using eating disorders as an example.  Are there any systemic barriers such that there would be concern around admitting somebody who is also pregnant into a particular service?  No.  Okay; that is not happening.  I would like to ask whether-----</p></speech>

The fact we have the services in place in 19 sites means there is earlier identification of problems so they do not escalate to being more severe.</p></speech>

At the Psychological Society of Ireland, we are really concerned about public health nurse, PHN, universal screenings and the reduction in those.  For the perinatal teams and in particular for primary care psychology, public health nurses are the main source of referrals.

I know the staff involved are very over-run and I accept all of that.  Is there sufficient training for those particular staff members, especially around things like ADHD or issues around disability in the early stages of a baby's life, which is very hard to diagnose sometimes?  It is not that they would need to know everything but to identify where there is an issue and refer them on.</p></speech>

One of the things we did do through the programme last year was work with one of public health nursing units to develop guidelines on how public health nurses, like midwives in the maternity services, would routinely ask women about their mental health when they see them for the routine visits.  There are not enough visits, as the Deputy said, but they would ask about their mental health and it is important-----</p></speech>

Does she mean people are given a checklist to tell them to make sure they ask about women's mental health, or are they being given training to approach women in a certain way?  It would seem, if people are hiding it, particularly in certain cohorts, that they are not so much defensive but very wary of institutional life in Ireland and they might not necessarily offer up if there is an issue.</p></speech>

There is a way of asking questions that encourages women to come forth.  All of us who work in this area are very conscious of the fact there are groups of women who are afraid to say too much in case the baby is removed from them.</p><p>Questions can be asked in a particular way to engage with the woman to try to get that information.  The public health nurses need to know how to elicit the information, but equally if they elicit information they are concerned about, what they should do about it.  That sort of information is provided in the guideline.  That only started last year and, as I said, we have done so much but there is more to do.</p></speech>

We are all aware our disability services are understaffed and it depends on the service and the team whether it has the space, training or opportunity to pick up on parental wellbeing.  Sometimes the disability services look to primary care psychology to pick up that piece.  Primary care psychology may receive a referral to support parents who have come into the disability service with a child who is seriously unwell and has significant disabilities and to help them through that.  It depends on the teams, the relationship between primary care psychology and disability teams and sometimes the disability team will feel it has the resources to do that, but less and less often.  However, no formal way or path to support those parents exists.  We really depend on local teams and relationships to provide that support.</p></speech>

We are contextualising this as medical issue for a small baby, but for the parents it is also a human rights issue and certainly my experience of how a disability was contextualised was negative.  A number of services, for example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are being encouraged to undertake training on the person-centred, UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, idea of people with different abilities, not necessarily a highly medicalised approach.  Anyway, I am not sure how helpful that is.</p> <p>  Professor McCarthy wanted to say something.</p></speech>

Many mental health and other issues have been hidden for so long and the effect of the opening up of the services, but also a change in society, is that we are getting more referrals.  Our issue is people are hiding things less than before.  People are much more open about coming forward.  It is not universal, but while the number of births in our hospital decreased from 9,600 three years ago to 8,500 this year, our referrals to the mental health service in the hospital increased from 950 three years ago to 1,340 so far this year.</p></speech>

How does that interact with the witnesses' services and do they take a view on the home birth issue, for example?</p></speech>

It was also after the baby was delivered.  Their closest support, which might have been a mother, may have lived more than 2 km away.  What we found was, and Professor McCarthy can qualify this if he wishes, that there was a huge number of women who found themselves in big trouble during Covid-19 because of this perceived and actual isolation and who ran into problems with depression and anxiety.  For our part, there was obviously an impact on the services because of Covid-19 and how you could see women.  We were very lucky that our programme manager was asked to lend some support to rolling out video-enabled care during Covid-19 and the early introducers of that in the mental health services were the perinatal mental health services.  We were able to see some women face-to-face where necessary but video-enabled care was provided as well.</p></speech>

We do not take a view on the safety or not of home births.  We certainly see women who have traumatic birth experiences, and we are always happy to see them.  Sometimes that will be because of their image of what that birth would be before it, whether a home birth or a natural delivery, and imagining natural as safe rather than summer and winter, natural as beautiful cuddly bunnies rather than rats and tarantulas and natural as doing pregnancy yoga and thinking it is all going to go perfectly well rather than trauma, third degree tears, bleeding and barely living through it.  We see women who have had experiences that subjectively and often objectively have been very traumatic, whatever the circumstances.  We are not in a position to advise.  Sometimes we see women and will recommend to obstetric colleagues on next deliveries.  However, we have no role in advising in advance our obstetric colleagues on issues that we have no expertise in but we will always refer to the mental health side.</p></speech>

Oftentimes if I am talking to a woman about the kind of birth she wants to have, we try to explore why she wants that type of birth.  Often a women will go in wanting one type of birth and will end up having a very different sort of experience.  It is to try to explore how she feels in control, how we can help her to have the best experience she can have and be as supportive as possible in doing that and how we can help staff guide her through that.  There is a really important piece around helping staff move towards trauma-informed care and making sure women understand what is happening, making sure women can give consent and that it is not rushed and making sure there is time and support and that afterwards there is time to reflect on what happened and to integrate it.</p></speech>

No unit of the HSE would come to the committee and say it does not have a recruitment issue.  There are challenges everywhere, but due to the hard work of Dr. Wrigley and the team, every person required for the programme has been recruited and is providing services on the ground.  I also want to acknowledge the hard work my team has done.</p> <p>  All options are being looked at for the mother and baby unit.  For example, when the Minister of State, Deputy Butler visited The Coombe earlier this year, she was told a unit was being closed and she asked us whether we wanted to develop the mother and baby unit there.  The problem was that a mother and baby unit, which is a national unit, has specific requirements.  It must be on a site where mental health doctors are on duty 27-7; near an approved centre; and where maternity services are available on the ground.  Services for mother and baby must both be available on the ground, so we thanked her but told her it was not ideal or not where we want it to be.  Options have been looked at.  St. Vincent's University Hospital, Elm Park is a site we have recommended as it has an acute mental health unit, maternity services and all of that.  The challenge with that site is there are two options.  One is to build on a third floor site along with an eating disorder unit in that facility.  The second option is to build it on a green field site in the unit and now people are discussing the possibility of putting the new maternity hospital on the same site.</p> <p>  We are between those, but we are engaging with the estates department in the HSE to see what will fulfil our needs because this is a once-off opportunity and we want ensure we can stand over what we develop and say this is delivering exactly what we are looking for.</p></speech>

It is now October, which is six months later and the issue seems to be ongoing.  I am concerned it could go on indefinitely.  Dr. Niazi mentioned the third floor site and a green field site.  Is there a preference?  Can we as legislators do anything to apply pressure and get that moving?  That is what I am interested in.</p></speech>

Professor McCarthy from the National Maternity Hospital is in that group also.  We have an agreed business case and that includes a description of how the unit should be structured.  For instance as it is the mother and baby unit, a nursery is needed as well as the single en suite rooms.  Bigger bedrooms are needed for the women as they need to accommodate a cot.  Staff are required who will look after babies.</p><p>All of that is agreed, but the nub point is to get the unit prioritised so that it becomes a bit like the national paediatric hospital - not totally, I hasten to add.  It needs to be a priority outside the HSE, a Government priority, that we have a national mother and baby unit to stop what is happening at the moment, which is mothers being admitted without their babies.  If it was prioritised at Government level, it would make a huge difference to our progress.  As Dr. Niazi said, within the campus of St. Vincent's University Hospital, we have the option of a third-floor extension.  That is not going to work, to be honest.</p></speech>

It will be a new-build.  The land is available on the St. Vincent's University Hospital campus.  From our point of view, with the mother and baby unit, the absolute priority is that it must be part of, but distinct from, an acute mental health unit.  These are the most unwell mothers in the country at any one time and they have to have mental health expertise.  That is our priority.  The support of the sub-committee for the development of a national mother and baby unit would be a huge support to us.  I thank the Deputy for his interest.</p></speech>

We had some early on when Northern Ireland was developing its service model.  This year, we have had a couple of meetings to look at what we might do in a whole-island context, with a view to perhaps looking for funding for the whole island and any other funding we can get, to be quite honest with the Deputy.  We were looking specifically at how we might work together in terms of having the same operations, but also whether there would be synergies.  I am thinking in particular of women in County Donegal, for instance, who may need inpatient care having access to a unit in Northern Ireland if it suited them.  They could be given the choice.  That sort of provision might be of huge advantage.  There are already models in operation such as children's cardiac surgery with children from the North coming to Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, to have those interventions.  There is no reason we could not look at it in terms of providing care for mothers.</p></speech>

They are available every day to see women who are pregnant or who have delivered babies and who have mental health problems.  The problem in Galway is that there only one clinical room available Monday to Friday on-site.  Women are obviously seen on a one-to-one basis.  There is only one member of staff who can use that room and there are seven who cannot.  They are trying to see women through video-enabled care, which is good in some situations but not good as being the only was you can see women.  On Fridays, there are three rooms available.</p> <p>  The situation in Cork is that they have a base for the team and that includes three kiosks for private video-enabled care.  In terms of the clinic space, because there are a higher number of deliveries in Cork, they have nine clinical staff.  They have access to one room between Mondays and Thursdays, inclusive, and two on Fridays.  We have worked very closely with Limerick.  They have access to one room on-site Monday to Friday.  The consultant there does a joint clinic with one of the obstetricians for women who have complex physical and mental health issues.  It is a lovely clinic to have up and running.  However, there is only one room on-site in the maternity hospital.  They have hired rooms off-site in order to provide space.  From our point of view, it is good that at least they can see the women and it is within walking distance of the maternity hospital.  If you are a woman-----</p></speech>

Because these sites are located on the campuses of acute hospitals, we have to work with those hospitals.  As my colleague said, the challenge is that if they offer us a building in an industrial park or somewhere outside, it does not fulfil the needs of what we want to provide.  They have to be on-site where the action is happening.  The maternity clinic is on-site.  The challenge I have seen - not in my current role but in the previous one - is that HSE estates wants to explore all other options before opting for those kind of modular buildings.  Those involved want to have proper buildings looked at.  If we wait for that, it will be a long time for anything to happen.  We are working with acute hospitals to see if modular buildings, such as those used in voluntary hospitals in Dublin, could be looked at.</p><p>My colleague has gone to those hospitals and even taken photographs to support our claim that on this green site we could have a modular building that provide supports and service.

Modular builds should be an option moving forward and they would not have the same stigma as in the past.  In here we usually ask for ways to get around recruitment and retention problems but there seems to be an efficiency in the way that the HSE recruits and retain staff in this area.

We started with just four whole-time equivalents and we now have 74 staff in place.  With the passage of time, staff leave and we are able to fill posts as well.  The person to explain this is my colleague, Ms Fiona O'Riordan, but she is not here.  The voluntary hospitals do their own recruitment so we cannot take any credit for that.  Ms O'Riordan is a master at working with the national recruitment service to recruit staff.  We have been able to develop bespoke competitions say, for instance, for mental health nurses, psychology, occupational therapy and social work.  We have developed those panels.  The staff then know that they are not applying for one massive situation where any job can come up but are applying for posts in perinatal mental health.  That initiative has been helpful.</p> <p>  We have had to work on things like having job descriptions that are clear so once staff come they know that not only are they working in an area that is lovely to work in but it is also a workplace where there is a lot of training and support provided for them.  For instance, with the psychologist that came on board, we provided supervision from the UK because we do not have that expertise within the country although we are nearly there.  We provided monthly supervision for a period of a year for our own six senior psychologists working for perinatal mental health.  When one wraps it all up together as a package, it encourages recruitment.</p> <p>  The clinical programmes are attractive areas for staff to work in because they know that they will get a wraparound support when they come in to a clinical programme.  That helps recruitment in mental health in general because, for those who work in the generality of services, it is nice to know that there are other opportunities to work in different areas and they are promotional opportunities.  We do help recruitment as a whole.</p></speech>

One of the key things is early in life so early attachment and, therefore, any of the drug or alcohol problems are to do with security of family attachment, involvement of fathers, the care of babies right from the very beginning and the security of that.  Dr. Wrigley said that this is a lovely area to work in.  It is a lovely area to work in but it is a stressful one, and sometimes it is risky and highly demanding.  There is a real feeling that if one can get in early then that is a valuable lifelong service, which is an aspect that helps to retain staff as well.</p></speech>

In my area, parents were getting letters from the HSE to state that the public health nurse service could not deliver child services for their children's development assessment at three, nine, 11, 21 to 24 and 46 to 48 months.  I was one of the people who highlighted this issue at the time.  We focused more on children's developmental checks being missed.  Basically, we focused on the child.  Listening to the witnesses, however, it is clear that public health nurses play a role in the health, including mental health, of parents and that is being missed in this regard as well.   I ask the witnesses to address this issue of children not getting developmental checks and public health nurses not visiting parents up to 48 months after the child is born in my area, including in Clondalkin, Lucan and Palmerstown.</p></speech>

While the focus might be on the baby, public health nurses have a holistic view of life and they will also see what is going on with the mother and inquire about that.  If public health nurses are being cut, that is a major deficit.  They are key.</p></speech>

The woman is not given a manual.  She has to try to figure out how to manage this new person.  It is incredibly stressful.  The public health nurse coming in is a point of contact and support.  Even if the public health nurse only visits once or twice, that can support the mental health of the woman, especially for many women who are quite isolated.  We spoke about Covid, which has been so isolating.  There are many women who do not have family here and the public health nurse is a key person for linking them in with community supports.</p> <p>  They also support women with breast-feeding.  For many women, breast-feeding is a difficult journey.  The rate of breast-feeding drops off a cliff after women leave hospital and that is due to a lack of lactation support.  The public health nurse can provide that support, at least initially, to women.  That contact, support and linking in with other community supports is vital, particularly for women who are isolated.  It could be as simple as the nurse asking them why not contact their mental health service.  Some women might have gone through their pregnancy without realising there is a perinatal mental health service.  It could be the public health nurse who links them back in to that service.  It is important.</p></speech>

It allows them to come back and consult in respect of what they can do regarding a mother who has a particular issue.  As primary care psychology begins to learn more about how to provide a good service for mothers and infants together, we can work with public health nurses in that regard.  They come to us to consult in respect of relationships - not just the mother or the baby, but how those two are getting on together.  That is vital.  Reference was made to the first 1,000 days, but the first 100 days are so important for the trajectory of an infant and have a significant implication for all health services in the future.  If we can get that right, it will have significant benefits for people and for the economy.</p></speech>

As a father, I got support by being able to ask a question because I was not sure and did not know what to do and all that.  It still sticks with me that I was able to use that support and it helped me at the time.  The gap in services in my area at the moment is just not good enough and that issue needs to be prioritised for women and their partners.</p></speech>

The person might be reluctant or have had difficult experiences.</p><p>Those are the people who we are really missing and who are really going to lose out.  Those are the most vulnerable.</p></speech>

I will make some comments because many of the questions have been answered.  If there is something the witnesses want to take up in that regard, I am happy to hear it.  I found both presentations had different emphases and were quite evocative.  Sometimes you think you have processed losses and suddenly you get ambushed when people start discussing some of the issues.  I found myself very moved and touched by that.</p> <p>  A point I have made at meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health is that I am very struck by the difference in approaches in Scotland and in Ireland to healthcare generally.  The Scots seem to adopt, ever since the foundation of the National Health Service, this concept of having an embracing health service.  We have a health service that to some degree likes to keep things at arm's length, which is a pity and that is a necessary step change.  I am thinking about immigrants, towards whom Dr. Doyle gestured, who do not have granny and grandad or the aunts and uncles and that support network that translates into childcare, and it translates into so many aspects of their lives.  For example, it translates, as we know, into the ability to go back into study or to take on work etc.  In this particular area, it is an especially acute loss.</p> <p>  I am a psychotherapist by training and some of my favourite clients were pregnant women or women who had lost their pregnancies or miscarried.  One of the things that would have caused me to reflect was the awesomeness of the whole pregnancy piece.  To me, depression, as opposed to clinical depression, is quite understandable and a logical conclusion when a woman has carried by herself a growing baby and the awesome responsibility of that.  Then there is the great birth event, but the baby is no longer part of the mother, and that represents a loss, I imagine.  The idea of being depressed and feeling a sense of loss and dislocation makes an awful lot of sense to me but can be news to a mum.  About 20 years ago I spent two weeks in hospital, and I remember on the journey back home feeling this sense of complete isolation because I had become very used very quickly to the institutionalisation and the care of nurses, and now I was on my own to care for myself and what if something happened?  Multiply that by an infinite amount with a mother who is coming home with such a fragile delicate piece of life.  Perhaps the witnesses would like to comment.  Maybe somebody can note it and come back on that issue of the speed of the turnaround of pregnancy in hospital.  It seems to be really quick in terms of delivery and then home.  I do not know what the witnesses' views are on that.  If I was a mum I think I would find it quite scary being in care and surrounded by professional care, even for a very short period, and then I am back home.  A lot of this comes back to the rights of the child, and maybe that should be the point from which we start, once they are born.  Obviously, there are the rights of the child in the womb in terms of being a caring environment and reflecting that, but it is just that turnaround period I am thinking of.</p> <p>  I am probably one of few politicians who have read John Bowlby's books on attachment, separation and loss.  I know when we talk about attachment, people often think of that clinging behaviour.</p><p>One of my favourite images is of the baby crawling out of the room and exploring, and then going back in to check.  The certainty that the parent and caregiver is there allows the baby to explore further.  It is one of my favourite images of attachment.  I ask the witnesses to address the issue of the turnaround time.</p><p> When I hear our guest use the words "mental health", there is a voice screaming in my head that we would be better to use the term "well-being".  There is still a stigma attached to it.  I would welcome their views in that regard.  </p><p> I was interested in the witnesses' remarks on facilities.  I visited the new children's hospital satellite in Tallaght, which is in my constituency.  The health committee was fortunate enough to go there to see the developments in the new children's hospital.  I was struck by the lengths that have been gone to, even in the satellite hospital, in terms of  things such as the scent.  The place does not have the classic hospital scent.  Quite a bit of work has been done in that regard.  Children had a significant input into the environment, art, colour scheme and all those kinds of things.</p><p> My next point is for Professor McCarthy of the National Maternity Hospital.  Breast-feeding is a significant issue when it is encountered by professionals in terms of the lack of support and the sense of guilt or failure that some women may feel.  They find it quite difficult to overcome that.</p><p> I refer to the mother's environment or the environment in the room.  I ask Professor McCarthy to develop that theme as well.  I refer to housing or the lack thereof.  Anxiety and distress are experienced by women who are living in cramped conditions or on a housing list while pregnant.  In some cases, they are coming home from hospital not to their own home but to a shared home environment.  Some women are not lucky enough to even have that.  I liked the fact that Professor McCarthy outlined that the National Maternity Hospital is clear about the functions of specialist perinatal mental services.  The witnesses will all have a chance to respond when I have finished my questions.</p><p> Moving on to the PSI, I refer to the first year of care.  We know the damage that is caused by separating infants from their primary caregivers.  Do we still not do that well?</p><p> Going back to the needs of the child, the PSI in its written submission states: "We must learn from our history of separation and move towards combined care that supports early relationships between caregiver and baby."  Where are we in that regard?  That sentence arrested me.  It made me wonder whether we are not a million miles away from the awful stuff that we read about.</p><p> There are one or two new primary care centres in my constituency.  I like the idea of it being the model but the staffing issue in that regard is quite tricky, even in terms of GPs, never mind any of the specialist pieces.</p><p> Dads do not get a big mention.  There is a gesture towards dads.  It is like there is a picture of a helpless onlooker.  There could have been more emphasis on moving from that to a really supportive role.  What is the PSI's view in that regard?</p><p> There is the piece in respect of being out of control.   Professor McCarthy made the point that suicide is the highest cause of maternal death.  He referred to maternal death rather than women's death.  I ask him to develop that point as I did not understand it fully.</p><p> I will finish on the point relating to the health system in Scotland.  Dr. N&iacute; Longphuirt urged the committee "to invite in the infant, the mother and the family".  What do our guests think we actually do?  What is the chasm?  That is food for thought.</p></speech>

The Deputy is an unusual politician in that he has read Bowlby.</p><p>I am an unusual psychiatrist in that I trained as a psychoanalytical psychotherapist and a cognitive analytical therapist.  I have read Bowlby as well.</p><p> We could talk all day about the baby being inside or outside, whether is it lonely and that separation issue that was mentioned, but it is especially important that we see an individual mother.  For some mothers, when the baby is inside, they feel that it is safe in there.  When the baby comes out, they are terrified or worried or there is a sense of loss.  For others, they feel completely out of control with the baby inside and want the baby out so they can hold it.  A mother who has lost a baby before from a stillbirth or miscarriage wants that baby out.  Some women are desperately attached to the baby inside.  Some are not because they have three other children and people are telling them they should be attached, but they do not have time.  Those women know that once the baby is born and they have a few weeks of sleep and toast and tea, they will love their baby in the long run.  Everybody is different and it is desperately important to deal with the individual mother and not think that this is traumatic.  It is about what is the issue for this particular woman with her history, circumstances and family, etc.</p><p> The Deputy made a reference to clinical depression to being almost normal.  To be challenged by birth is very normal.  All of the experiences are demanding.  Some 60% of mothers are struggling.  When we use the term "post-natal depression" for 11% of women, that is a very useful label simply to highlight that it is a serious time of struggle for so many women.  Post-natal depression is not a thing.  It is a very useful label that says, "This is a struggling time."  Some women are depressed, anxious, distressed, adjusting, traumatised or have had a very difficult birth experience.  For the majority of those women who are depressed, it is understandable depression, not clinical depression but it triggers clinical depression in some women.  One of our jobs in terms of risk assessment is to ask if it is the normal depression everybody has had at different times in their lives if they are sensate human beings who have any cop on and life experiences versus clinical depression that we need to address.  Understanding the difference is important.</p><p> On speed of delivery and leaving hospital, some women cannot wait to get out.  They did not want to be in there for the birth in the first place and they want to get home, and that is a good place.  Others want to get out because they are terrified and anxious; that is a sign of something else.  For still others, they could benefit from the support in the hospital and, yes, because the wards are very overstretched, they are leaving earlier than they should and things are missed because of that.  Again, it is always about looking at the individual person in front of us.</p><p> We could talk about mental health versus well-being until the cows come home.  It is sometimes a bit like changing the name of the Windscale nuclear reactor.  You can change the names, but at the end of the day, there will be a lifelong issue regarding how to name normal mental distress and difficulty and not stigmatise that versus recognising that sometimes it has moved into a situation where someone's brain is in trouble.  In one person stress gives them an ulcer, in somebody else it makes their eczema or psoriasis come out or their immune system crash, and sometimes stress and challenges get into the brain and create a brain problem.  It is about trying to find labels that are going to catch that accurately without stigmatising or making people react to it.  I would love the time to come when people will recognise that it is not just equivalent to physical health difficulties, but equally important and valuable, and we will not get hung up about the approach to it;, we will just want to make it better, rather than worrying about stigmas. Within the five minutes we had today, I would have loved to talk about dads.  When I first started in the National Maternity Hospital 26 years ago, my wife's first question was, "Will you do anything for dads?" I said, "Oh my God, the services for women are so appalling, I am just starting.  Dads are going to have to wait".  They are a hugely important part.  We see dads frequently and accessing and supporting them is also a key part.  We should have much more resources for them.</p><p> I will finally deal with maternal death.  There is a difference with a death caused by birth.  This classification occurs in the first six weeks after the birth or within the first year - there are different classifications.  The second most common reason a mother died during the first year after birth last year was suicide.  It varies from year to year.  There have been years where in Britain and Ireland suicide was the most common cause, but it is always one of the top two or three causes of maternal death.  That is a death within the first year after the birth of the baby.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.720" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eithne N&iacute; Longphuirt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022101800002#U00200"><p>I agree with everything Professor McCarthy said.  I do not want to repeat anything others have said.</p><p>On the questions about dads, we are seeing LGBT+ people and families who do not look like the traditional family more often in the health service.  The other piece is having a service and training that allows the clinicians working with people to feel competent, able and resourced.  We have Dads, Mums, Moms and many people who go by lots of different labels and it is important we learn how to provide those people with a good service.</p><p> Two issues we were talking about come to mind in respect of the combined care of the mother and the infant.  The perinatal services could do more both structurally and with the staff we have to be accessible to infants and mums.  We are working in portacabins.  We have a lack of spaces and are not able to see all of the different pieces that need to be seen.  In our statement we mentioned the idea of infant mental health practitioners and what we mean is practitioners who can work with the dyad - mums and infants or dads and infants together - to ensure the early relationship is nurtured.</p><p> The other piece relates to when children move from the neonatal intensive care unit, NICU, to the paediatric intensive care unit, PICU, for example from the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street to Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin when they are very sick.  If their mother is still in the maternity hospital, they are separated.  The fact that those resources are in separate hospitals has a major impact on the mother's ability to visit her infant.  That was exacerbated during the Covid-19 pandemic when parents were separated from their infants and were not able to visit them.  That happens within hospitals sometimes because it can be difficult for staff to support parents to visit their child in the NICU and to be present when the child is feeding or at other crucial points so they can realise the role of being a parent from the start, no matter how sick their infant might be.  Again staff training on that subject is required, but the co-location of hospitals also has a major impact on parents when their child is very sick.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.722" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jillian Doyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022101800002#V00200"><p>I will pick up on a few points.</p> <p>  As regards well-being and mental health, when I am working with people, I often think I am initially treating their mental health.  An absence of a mental health difficulty does not necessarily mean people are feeling well or are happy with their quality of life.  I am always trying to think about how to work with both and help people build a life they feel is worth living that gives them joy and contentment.  We need both because that helps them access their threat or "fight or flight" system in a way that helps them live their life in a way that is beneficial.  We do not want to get rid of the ability to detect danger or to respond to threat, but we want people to be able to move out of it when appropriate and to access support and resources that nourish them.</p> <p>  It is important for people from other countries who have come to this country to be able to access supports.  One of the supports we can provide therapeutically is group work.  I feel a bit like Oliver Twist asking for more because we have some clinical space in the Rotunda Hospital, but not enough and none of us has access to group rooms.  Groups are important for mental health.  If I had a magic wand, I would make a nice baby-friendly group-room where we can get down on the floor.  Babies do not like to sit on chairs.  Small babies cannot sit on chairs and it can be hard for a mother to have to keep her baby in a buggy for an hour.  Babies are good communicators and it can impede the mother's communication if her baby is crying.</p> <p>  We also do not have baby changing facilities in our fancy portacabins.  That is a practical issue.  A mother needs to have easy access to a toilet and baby changing facilities.  We were talking about bricks and mortar.  That is what we need to help people access services.</p> <p>  Thinking about becoming a mother, matrescence or the journey towards motherhood, happens throughout pregnancy and in the perinatal period.</p><p>We become mothers throughout the life span of our children.  A woman is learning a new part of this identity of being a mother in each milestone of development.  When Deputy Lahart spoke about that, I thought about teenagers, whom we highlighted in our report.  It can be difficult being a teenage mum.  The people in your social circle are not going through the same experience as you, so who do you have to bounce this developing identity off?  It is an opportunity to bring that to the fore again, that these young women, these mothers, really need our support and our help.</p><p> When Deputy Lahart talked about turnaround speed, I thought about trauma-informed care.  Some women would very much appreciate an extra few nights in hospital, but some women want to get home to their family as soon as possible.  That is one of the things over which we need to give the woman control.  What works best for them, what works best for their family and how do we support that?  Community midwives have such an important role to play where women are maybe leaving hospital faster than would have happened historically, and of course there are the public health nurses for continuity of care.</p><p> It would be amazing to have accommodation that does not smell like a clinic or hospital and that is baby-friendly.  On accommodation, we are seeing people coming into our services who are living in really difficult circumstances.  In the Rotunda we have people coming from direct provision centres where a woman may have come through unspeakable trauma and is now living in a place she feels is not ideal for her and her circumstances and she does not know where she will be going next.  The importance of giving people certainty cannot be overlooked when we are thinking about how to make someone feel safe.  If you do not feel safe, how can you help your baby feel safe?  Something I always think about when someone is referred to me is where they are living.  That is the starting point.  If we go back to the basic hierarchy of needs, we need to make sure someone has somewhere to live where they feel safe.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned people feeling out of control.  Thinking about birth trauma, oftentimes if someone has an experience of birth trauma, they are left feeling very out of control and very disempowered.  It is a very important function of all our services to give a woman back control and to educate her antenatally about what is going to happen.  This involves giving education around babies and what it is like to have a baby, that women might feel depressed and overwhelmed, and where that goes from being normal to abnormal.  It is also helping someone think about the fact there is a point during birth where they are out of control because the body takes over, and in our society we are so in our heads and we want to know and to be in control.  This is probably the most in your body experience a person will go through.  It is a case of trying to explore what it is like for them when they are out of control and how we help them to stay with themselves in that.</p></speech>

One area I would like to mention in the context of the early discharge after a day in hospital is the small but nevertheless very important number of women, probably around 120 per year, who develop postnatal psychosis, which is a very serious mental illness.  I use the word "illness" in this context.  That occurs typically within days or so of birth, and if a woman is out of the hospital within a day, it may be that it does not happen when she is in the maternity service but it may happen when she is at home and she has less support.  Where there has been a previous episode of postnatal psychosis, obviously there is very careful surveillance kept specifically by the perinatal service mental health services to make sure the woman gets the care she needs.</p><p>If it is a first episode of postnatal psychosis, it can be a very worrisome time for women.  It is something I am aware of because women are only staying in hospital for a short time after giving birth.</p><p> There has been some discussion of terminology with regard to mental health problems, including terms like "mental illness", "psychiatric illness" and "well-being".  I will make a general comment on the difficulty we experience in that regard.  Dr. Niazi would experience this more than me in his current role.  While people are much freer about saying they feel unwell mentally and talking about feeling anxious and depressed and so on, when you are talking about people who have severe and enduring mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, there is not as much of an acceptance of that.  The acceptance needs to be there so that it is followed by an impetus to develop services to meet patients' needs.  That needs funding as well.  Does Dr. Niazi want to say anything further on that?</p></speech>

As the public representative for the local area, I am delighted to hear the discussion around the Rotunda and the requirement for more space.  I am aware there is a business case doing the rounds which I have been supporting in terms of getting more space and access to another building.  Having had my kids in the Rotunda, I can see how much more we could be doing.</p> <p>  I have one follow-up question that I ask often, possibly partly because I am a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am sure people are sick of me asking questions around access to data and the availability of data to NGOs and researchers.  I also want to ask about the performance indicators we put in place for the various programmes.  I know every person in clinical care knows about the importance of compiling data on these issues, but compared to other jurisdictions are we doing well in terms of gathering data when, as we have just been discussing, people sometimes will not be forthcoming about their difficulties?  It was mentioned that we might not always record particular deaths or instances correctly.  How good are we at compiling data and making those data transparent and available, even in a disaggregated version, to the people or institutions that might need it?  Do we have the correct performance indicators in place in terms of the Department so we are getting the budgets to the right groups?</p></speech>

What we are working off at the moment are Excel sheets.  Essentially, we are looking at who comes in and who goes out.  It is a completely inadequate system and we have been working on it since we started.  Dr. Niazi has been wonderful in supporting us in trying to get a bespoke data system.  We would like it to have a unique patient identifier number, obviously without knowing the patient's name, so that we could follow the patient's clinical pathway from start to finish.  This would enable us to know how and why they came in, what sort of help was provided for them and by whom, what sort of an outcome they had and, very importantly, what they thought about what they were offered by the service.  We were making some headway with that until the cyberattack happened and then progress went backwards.</p><p>Due to the concern about a further cyberattack, a tight process is in place and we are not allowed to look at a bespoke data system at all.  We are looking at alternatives and most recently, as Dr. Niazi knows, we set up a little subcommittee within our perinatal world to look at the data we are collecting and refine it.  We now have a link in with the National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre in University College Cork.  It already collects data for the national women and infants health programme on things like perinatal deaths, brain cooling and so on and because it is already involved with the HSE, we can use the centre.  We hope to be able to provide better data but we will still not be able to provide the unique patient identifier and, therefore, it is still not enough.  We absolutely need that because unless we have data like that, we do not know whether we are doing the right thing or not.  We hope we are.  We talk to women and we have a project in place where we will get feedback from women.  Parts of the system like the Coombe Women's Hospital did a study looking at feedback from women accessing their perinatal mental health service,  but we need to have a whole-system view of it so we can get exactly that data.  We would welcome the Deputy's support on that.</p></speech>

The data underwrites the budget allocation and links to finance, which is kind of why I was asking about it.</p></speech>

The HSE definitely needs to do a lot of hard work to make progress in this area.  Some of that is under way.   Each of the clinical programmes I mentioned has its own unique needs as to how we collect the data for them.  I liaised with all the national leads to see what their needs were.  The self-harm programme, which works with the National Office of Suicide Prevention, had its own needs as did the perinatal programme working on women's health.  We tried to put all of those needs together and to look for a system that could collect those data.  Money was even allocated for us to go out and buy the software to develop our own data system and then when the cyberattack happened, we were told that the HSE was currently using approximately 2,000 different types of software in different parts of the country on different programmes.  Everything was halted.  We were told that the skeleton system, the integrated community case management system, ICCMS, which will use the unique identifier number, was being developed and when that system was in place, the 2,000 different types of software would have to be looked at as regards speaking to the main skeleton.  Whichever software works with the main system would be the one they take on.</p></speech>

We even know what system we need, but the problem is basically getting it over the line.  The HSE said it wants to make sure the software we are looking at can pass the scrutiny of safety and all of those things.  That is where we are at.  I can give an example, not for the perinatal programme but for another area in the HSE.  We were brought to Copenhagen to be shown how good their systems are but when we looked at the whole system, we felt we had most of the nuts and bolts of it.  The only thing we were missing was talking to each other and bringing the data system together, which can collect that information, share it and use it.  Once we address that area, we can definitely stand over it and say that we are delivering a much more united service.</p></speech>

They are asked about what is troubling them at the time and go into the details of that.  There would always be a question about the use of alcohol, the use of drugs and so on.  That is recorded and dealt with if it is a problem.</p> <p>  On suicidality, that is always asked when the mental state is being examined.  There is this myth that if the question is asked, it will put the idea into someone's mind.  However, that is absolutely not the case.  It is much more likely to find out that people have these ideas.  If we know about them, we can then try to work with them to provide whatever assistance they might need.  Those two areas are always dealt with with every person who presents with problem.</p></speech>

Whether it is a psychologist, psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse or any mental health professional, it is part of our job to do that and, obviously, to take it further than that.</p> <p>  We spoke about facilities and having one office available for eight people.  When we see somebody for the first time, it is for one hour.  A new appointment is for one hour but a lot comes out in an hour if we engage and connect with the person as, I hope, we do in most cases.  Everything comes out.  Again, one of the lovely parts, and privileges, of this job is that it is often a time in women&rsquo;s lives when they are likely to be more open.  They are concerned and worried.  If they are drinking or suicidal and having those thoughts or intentions, it is probably a more likely time in their lives to say than other times are.  However, that is not always the case, of course.  Most of the time, trying to confine it to the hour is the difficulty, rather than things being hidden, truthfully.  Part of our skills is to be able to check if someone is depressed, has any suicidal thoughts - who has not had them at times - suicidal intentions, specific plans and what would stop them.  It is working on that or whatever the issue is.  It is trying to open that up.  Hopefully, with the ongoing training they get, our teams are good at listening and providing the space in which that issue comes up.  At the end of the day, most people who are feeling like that want to talk about.  They just want to know this is a safe place.</p></speech>

We have that for the Saolta Hospital Group, but we also need that for the Rotunda Hospital and the national maternity hospital in University College Cork, UCC.  Limerick does not have spokes.  We also need additional administration staff in at least three of the hub hospitals.  As I said, we see them as very important.</p> <p>  Outside our service, in the model of care itself, we have listed the large number of services that are concerned with perinatal mental health.  We are looking at a particular aspect of it, but there is much more to do.  The areas I would cite would be primary care and psychology, which have been referred to.  We would like the public health nursing workforce to be properly expanded to ensure more visits in the way that we have talked about.  </p> <p>  There is a need for specific mother and infant attachment services.  This is not for the women we see who have significant mental health problems, but there are also women where there may also be attachment problems developing outside that.  For instance, where babies have spent a protracted period of time in neonatal intensive care units, that may be a problem.  There are also women with, shall we say, personality disorder, who may have attachment problems and could also benefit from those sorts of services as well.</p> <p>  There is the whole area of infant mental health, which takes the child up to the age of three, for which we have no services available in Ireland.  They are not developed within our overall child and mental health services.  However, they need to be looked at as well.</p> <p>  I am being very ambitious.  I am just saying that we have that list.  We see ourselves as providing for mild through to severe mental health issues arising in women attending maternity services.  We are developing the training and linkages so that others involved, such as GPs, public health nurses and so on, can link into community mental health teams &ndash; that side of things.  However, there is a huge need for investment in infant mental health.  That needs attention.</p></speech>

I referred previously, albeit in a different context, to a great book written by Dr. Ida Milne on the history of the Spanish flu in Ireland.  One of her conclusions, which she laments, is that the Spanish flu occurred in a period of revolution towards the end of the First World War and people did not want to know or talk too about it much.  As such, we forgot about it as a society and, as Dr. Milne wrote, did not memorialise it.  Memorials take many different manifestations.</p><p>I sense an appetite in Ireland to try to move on from Covid very quickly.  It looks as though we could have more than another pandemic in our lifetime and we are not completely free of this one.</p><p> All Deputies heard heartbreaking, heart-wrenching and awful stories about dads or partners waiting in a car outside the prenatal clinic and not being present at labour.  What have we learned?  Where can we learn about that?  The papers have not been written about this yet.  This is not about looking for headlines to point the finger of blame but, if in ten years' we had another pandemic that necessitated interventions such as those we have just had, what could our prenatal and postnatal care system have learned?  Was the response proportionate in hindsight?  How would we do it again?  Part of that paper, whenever it is written, is about acknowledging the awful trauma experienced by mothers and their partners and, equally, the trauma of the nurses and nurse managers who had to say "We are sorry".  I am sure they put up with considerable abuse and trauma.</p></speech>

There are best practice standards from the UK but I would have to find them.  I do not want to misquote them.  One of the foremost pieces is around training and awareness and upskilling staff with regard to LGBT+, in particular.  That does not just mean the perinatal teams.  All of the staff in maternity hospitals need support and training, because there will be more and more people from that community who need to be supported and to be treated equally, yet differently.  They have had disproportionate amounts of mental health difficulties and suicidality, by comparison with the general population, and all of the research says they have had difficulties accessing health services in general in this country and internationally.  We need to care for that population but the foremost piece is around training and support of staff as a start.</p></speech>

There were very little data from the flu epidemic after the First World War, or the Spanish flu as it was called.  However, there is considerable information on the subsequent SARS pandemic in south-east Asia, in particular.  The paper talks about a tsunami in the later stages of the pandemic.  After getting over the physical aspects, there can be a tsunami of psychological impacts of the pandemic.  This is not well recognised but has certainly been documented in previous pandemics.  There is evidence of such an impact now.  I do not know of any work that was done but we were very keen, within the mental health programmes, to flag it rather than have people say the pandemic is done and dusted and we do not need to worry.  Many people are still suffering.</p><p>We see this business of coronaphobia and being afraid to go out all around us and in our own families.  It is a very real phenomenon.  I cannot speak from a clinical perspective but my clinical colleagues in perinatal might be able to say whether they have seen it in the context of women who have attended their clinics.</p></speech>

My late mother spoke about the revolutionary period but never mentioned the Spanish flu.  There are similarities.  We have a war on the Continent of Europe and a big energy crisis.  It is not that people have forgotten the pandemic.  It is just that other things have preoccupied us.  We must, however, learn from this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.765" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eithne N&iacute; Longphuirt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022101800002#CC00300"><p>We spoke earlier about the importance of control for women and their sense of efficacy when they go into services.  Some of the more qualitative research on the pandemic has talked about uncertainty and the impact that has had on women, that is, uncertainty about what services would be provided for them; whether they would be lucky to see a month where restrictions had been lifted; whether restrictions would be lifted in the hospital they were to be in; and whether their partner would be able to come in and for how long.  Such uncertainty has had a considerable impact on women.</p> <p>  As people who provide a service, we have seen a much higher influx of postnatal women accessing our services, many of whom will say they do not leave their house except to come to the service or that it is their first time and their beginning.  It happens less than it did a year ago but it absolutely happens.</p> <p>  We talked about infant mental health.  There are women who worry about their infants and whether the lack of community involvement in those first few years has had an impact on their two- or three-year-old.  It can be very hard to decipher whether it has had an impact and what we are looking at.  People need support.  There has been a considerable increase in anxiety.  International papers say that the levels of perinatal anxiety have gone up because of Covid.</p></speech>

We are all learning and continue to learn.  The evidence base will keep changing.  We had a recent support meeting in Holles Street hospital about Covid.  Our clinical director was describing how when Covid hit in March 2020, he was having to tell staff they must come into work in our beautiful and old, but cramped, building which was designed for 2,000 pregnancies per year but actually has 9,000, while thinking that if Italian figures were to go through that between 35 and 45 of the staff in the hospital would die.</p> <p>  Medical staff often die in pandemics.  If one looks at pandemics all over the world, medical, nursing and other staff die.  I was past retirement age but I was going into the hospital, as were many others.  We were very aware of the risk to ourselves.  We were also very aware of the risk to the mothers.  We were doing everything possible in our cramped building.  The Deputy mentioned there may be another pandemic within ten years.  I hope the new national maternity hospital is in St. Vincent's hospital within ten years where we will have single rooms at that stage and will be able to allow dads in.</p> <p>  We were very aware of the safety of the mothers.  Can we win?  We did not want to give Covid to mothers and we certainly did not want to give Covid to babies.  It was pre-vaccines.  We were aware of how dangerous it would be in pregnancy for mothers who were not vaccinated.  We did not have vaccines yet.  We were worried about ourselves in that context but, more important, we were worried about the mothers and the babies.  We do not want even more court cases with people suing the hospital for giving Covid to a mother because we did not protect them well enough.</p> <p>  The pandemic has had all sorts of effects.  Many mothers and parents missed out.  Some were thankful that there would not be loads of husbands, partners, grannies and others and that they would have their own space.  Others were delighted to go home and not have family visiting all the time.  One has to see the individual and work around that individual.</p></speech>

Have we any evidence to say it was a proportionate response, or that knowing what we know now, if we were to go through it again in exactly the same way, things would be done differently?  We had representatives of the HSE before the committee and the buildings were highlighted as being a big issue.  I am asking about the proportionality of the response.</p></speech>

There were pros and cons.  We are all learning.  In response to Deputy Ward's question, we are all learning about how to deal with LGBT patients.  We are seeing much more of it.  We we are seeing our very first patients.  We are seeing donor eggs and the complexities around that.  We are dealing with patients who are having their babies elsewhere.  We are even seeing transgender males, who have not had a hysterectomy yet, who are stopping their treatment to have babies.  We have men coming in to have babies.  We are learning all the time.  On the question of whether there are best practices, we will have to work on them.  We are learning all of the time and we are trying to improve our services in that way.</p></speech>

After listening to them all speak today, I feel our perinatal services are in very good hands.  If only the practitioners could get exactly what they are looking for, we could definitely be one of the leading countries in the world in perinatal services, as Deputy Ward said.  I feel our perinatal services are in very safe hands.  I thank the witnesses for their passion in this area in particular.  I wish all our health services staff were as passionate as the witnesses are.  I thank the representatives of the Psychology Society of Ireland, the HSE and the National Maternity Hospital for contributing to this discussion on perinatal mental health.  We will definitely to our best to support the organisations represented going forward.  We will highlight the issues raised as much as we possibly can going forward.</p></speech>

From Cork City Council we are joined in the room by Ms Ann Doherty and Mr. Brian Geaney, and online we are joined by Mr. Fearghal Reidy and Mr. Niall &Oacute; Donnabh&aacute;in.  They are very welcome to the committee.  From Galway City Council we are joined in the room by Mr. Brendan McGrath, Ms Patricia Philbin and Mr. Brian Barrett, and online by Mr. Dermot Mahon.  I thank both councils for their opening statements, which were submitted to us in advance, have been circulated to members and will be published to the website after the meeting.</p> <p>  I will read a brief note on privilege before we commence.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  For witnesses attending in the committee room, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Those who are attending online have limited privilege.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I will begin with Cork City Council and then ask Galway City Council to make its opening statement. The format we follow is a seven-minute segment for each member.  The seven minutes consists of time to ask questions and receive answers.  If members want to direct a particular question to a particular local authority, that would be helpful.  I ask them to keep their questions short in order to allow ample time for witnesses to answer.  We have several substitutions.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Doherty to make her opening statement on behalf of Cork County Council.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Geaney, assistant chief executive, Mr. &Oacute; Donnabh&aacute;in, director of services with responsibility for housing, and Mr. Reidy, director of services with responsibility for strategic and economic development.</p> <p>  As regards social housing delivery and targets, in the three-year period from 2019-21, a total of 3,698 social housing supports were delivered in Cork City Council&rsquo;s administrative area.  Of these, 847 units were provided using the build delivery mechanism, 294 homes were acquired, 218 homes were leased and 2,339 tenancies were created and supported through the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.</p> <p>  In terms of future delivery of social housing, under our housing delivery action plan there is a pipeline to provide 2,399 homes by 2026.  This is made up of 2,134 homes to be delivered by build, including Part V, and 265 homes by lease.  In 2022, a total of 691 homes will be delivered, which will be achieved through a combination of 515 homes by build, 122 homes by leasing, and 54 homes by acquisitions.  Right now, there are 49 projects under construction which will deliver over 957 homes when completed.  A further six projects that will yield 154 homes are due to commence on site before the end of 2022.  The strong pipeline delivery is reached by activating city council-owned sites, the competitive dialogue procurement process, partnership with the approved housing body, AHB, sector, turnkey scheme acquisitions and Part V, with further housing development under way with the Land Development Agency.</p> <p>  As regards right-sizing schemes, in the past three years, Cork City Council built 41 right-sizing homes for older people.  Construction of an additional 89 homes will be completed by the end of the year.  These schemes are spread across five sites, all of which were either derelict or vacant.</p><p> On affordable delivery and targets, under the housing delivery action plan Cork City Council has a target to deliver 1,737 affordable homes of which 378 homes will be provided by the city council.  The balance of 1,359 homes will be developed by the AHB sector and the Land Development Agency.</p><p> Cork City Council currently has four affordable housing schemes under construction that will deliver 215 homes.  Of this, 135 affordable homes will be completed in 2022 and the remaining 80 homes will be completed in 2023.  The AHB sector is delivering an additional 105 cost-rental homes across two schemes in 2022.  Other schemes are at planning and pre-planning stages.</p><p> The delivery of both, via affordable housing, have been affected by well documented externalities.  They are the Covid-19 pandemic, cost inflation, supply chain challenges and general market uncertainty.  Part V housing is also reliant on the private sector delivery.  That stated, Cork City Council remains strongly committed to continuing to deliver a strong programme to achieve our housing targets.</p><p> Vacancy and dereliction are key issues that relate to the fabric of the city.  There is significant public discourse and, indeed, frustration regarding vacancy and dereliction.  I will highlight some key facts in so far as these issues relate to Cork city.</p><p> As the members of this committee are aware, not all vacant houses are derelict.  This is important because the instruments to address dereliction are not the same as those available to address vacancy.  The city council's vacant homes and derelict sites team is working on a portfolio of just over 460 properties, which includes both vacant homes and derelict sites.</p><p> As members will know, the definition of dereliction is set out in the Derelict Sites Act.  A key consideration of Cork City Council, in the first instance, is whether the property is safe and habitable.  Where possible we also seek to determine the specific circumstances of the owners of each property.   This is important as property owners may be facing difficult circumstances which led to the unsightly presentation or dereliction of their property.  The city council engages with property owners who are actively seeking to remove dereliction through the planning process or by disposal of the site.  If this engagement does not yield satisfactory results then we will move to place the property on the derelict sites register although, as one would expect, this is a long process.</p><p> Today, there are 110 sites on the derelict sites register, which is the highest number since the register was established.  Measures to support regeneration and remove dereliction include  repair and lease; buy and renew; and the living city.  In addition, Cork City Council provides grants to support the development of premises in architectural conservation areas.  In the last five years the total amount is &euro;1.23 million and, as of January 2022, there was &euro;4.1 million due from the derelict sites levy.</p><p> Cork City Council compulsorily acquired 22 sites under derelict sites legislation.  It acquires a derelict site in the knowledge that not all sites are suitable for social housing and alternative solutions may be required to remove dereliction.  That stated, over the last five years a total of 619 social and affordable housing homes were delivered or are under construction by the city council on vacant, derelict and regeneration sites.  A further 206 homes are in the pipeline at these sites.  This equates to a total of 825 homes that are spread over 50 such sites.  This points to the relative complexity of bringing regeneration to these difficult sites.  It also highlights the impact that the development of these sites will have across the city in terms of providing homes and regenerating neighbourhoods. </p><p> I shall now focus on vacant properties.  According to the Revenue Commissioners at the end of June 2022 as much as 2.6% of properties in Cork City are vacant, of which in the order of 50% are vacant for fewer than 12 months.  This information correlates with a survey of vacant homes that was conducted by Cork City Council in 2018.  The reasons for vacancy vary.  The new vacant house tax will add to the instruments that are available to address vacancies.</p><p> The work on vacant homes and derelict sites is led by a vacant homes officer who, in turn, is supported by a dedicated team.  There is a cross-directorate working group that is made up of planning, property, law, housing and finance who work on derelict sites in the city.  This team considers the suitability of sites for acquisition or disposal and the use of derelict sites for housing or regeneration purposes, along with other instruments that could address dereliction and vacancy.</p><p> To conclude, while we face a range of challenges there is considerable work under way by Cork City Council and our partners to achieve the targets of our housing action plan to deliver a total of 4,136 social and affordable homes in Cork city by 2026.</p></speech>

I am joined by some colleagues.  On my left is Ms Patricia Philbin who has recently moved from the housing function to a recent directorate that we have established to focus on capital delivery.  On my right is Mr. Brian Barrett who manages the housing function in addition to community and economic functions.  I am joined online by my colleague, Mr. Dermot Mahon, who is the head of unit within the housing unit.</p> <p>  The objective of Galway City Council in implementing the Housing for All policy is to accelerate the delivery of good quality social and affordable housing in an equitable manner, and in appropriate locations, in order to develop sustainable and balanced communities.  The table set out in my statement covers the period 2020 to 2022 and shows a total 1,765 housing interventions have been successfully delivered across the board; 500 of them in the build Part V and turnkey arena; there have been 127 acquisitions, leasing or capital assistance scheme, CAS, delivery; and 1,138 rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and housing assistance payment, HAP, delivery.</p> <p>  There have been significant challenges in the past years which have disrupted delivery.  The construction sector continues to experience these issues.  That is reflected in material price increases, supply chain delays and disruption, and an increasing demand for skilled workers.  These elements all have the potential to impact on our delivery.  However, we remain committed to our targets and we are working with the Department, and all stakeholders, to ensure the optimum delivery of housing units.</p> <p>  As part of Galway City Council's commitment to Housing for All our housing delivery action plan provides for the delivery of 1,435 social homes, which is about 16% greater than the target that was set for us of 1,235.  Our plan also provides 1,005 affordable and cost-rental units that will be delivered in the same period.</p> <p>  The second tabular statement sets out the total estimated delivery covering the period 2022 to 2026 and states an estimated 165 will be delivered through Part V in conjunction with LDA; 403 will be delivered by the local authority and existing landbanks; land that we are currently acquiring will deliver approximately 100; 163 will be delivered through turnkey interventions; 36 by local authority buy and renew; 541 under the approved housing bodies under capital advance leasing facility, CALF; 27 AHBs under CAS; and the total is 1,435.  As the members will understand, the involvement of the private sector is an integral part of our delivery, particularly in the context of Part V and turnkey schemes.</p> <p>  The most recent housing needs demand assessment for the city has categorised 20.4% of households as &ldquo;affordability constrained&rdquo;.  We will work closely, and are working closely, with the AHB and the Land Development Agency in the delivery of affordable and cost-rental units.</p> <p>  In preparation for post the lifecycle of our current housing delivery action plan, we continue to take steps to increase our landbanks to ensure adequate land provision for further delivery action plans.</p> <p>  The provision of age-friendly and universal design homes will also form a significant element of planned delivery in line with the city council's housing action plan for persons with a disability and age-friendly housing objectives.  Of the units outlined in the table in our statement, 20% will be universal design homes and a further 15% will be age-friendly homes.</p> <p>  The city council continues to examine vacant sites and derelict sites as a further measure to support housing delivery.  While there are limited vacant homes in the city given the high demand in the rental market, the city council has recently acquired three properties under the buy and renew scheme.  In an effort to activate other initiatives in the city, the city council recently held a public event to promote the living city, and repair and lease schemes.  We currently have six vacant sites on the register and a further ten derelict sites.</p><p>Quite a few large derelict sites have been removed from the register in recent times as they were rendered non-derelict and ceased to qualify to continue to be on the register.  Recently four derelict sites have been compulsorily provided by the council.  The purchase of two of these sites and an adjoining land bank have yielded a 15-unit development under construction on the combined sites.  Since 2019, we have collected just over &euro;413,000 in levies under the Derelict Sites Act.  All bar &euro;23,000 of what is due has been collected and the balance is being pursued.</p><p> The city council is committed to retrofitting existing properties that are returned to it on an annual basis to ensure that when these tenancies are created, sustainable properties are provided to new tenants in existing stock.  Bringing our stock up to an energy rating of B2 is resource demanding but an essential task to ensure that we meet climate strategy targets.  The average costs for this work are approximately &euro;35,000 per unit.</p><p> This is an overview of our ambitions for the coming years.  We are expanding and recruiting our delivery team to meet this ambition.</p></speech>

I will begin with Galway and I want to focus on the affordability issue.  The housing crisis has two main characteristics, which are supply and affordability.  I am told that affordability in Galway is even worse than in Dublin recently.  House price inflation has exceeded Dublin and has been well into the double digits in recent years.  When was the last time the local authority in Galway city delivered an affordable home?  What was the most recent affordable housing scheme?  I have been told anecdotally it was 2009.  Is this the case?</p> <p>  Over what period will the 1,005 affordable and cost-rental units be delivered?  Is it up to 2026?  What will make up the 1,005?  I hear from my colleagues, Councillor Michael Crowe and Senator Ollie Crowe, that there is real pent-up demand for affordable housing in Galway city and there is great anxiety about seeing some delivery.  Will the witnesses share with the committee how the 1,005 homes will be delivered and within what timeframe?</p></speech>

Some of these were Part V units we got back.   The 1,005 homes will include 477 to be built on our own lands.  We hope to get 204 through turnkey developments and 324 through AHBs and cost-rental units.  We expect the cost-rental units to be delivered between 2023 and 2025.</p></speech>

At present we have a scheme of 85 approved under Part 8.  We are progressing it and we hope to go to tender in the coming months.  Depending on the tender we will have a better idea of when they will be delivered.  We hope to deliver all the affordable homes within the timeframe of the housing delivery action.</p></speech>

We sold the other scheme for the cost of what we built.  For these schemes a formula has to be applied with regard to people's income and how the units will be costed based on the demand for them.  With construction prices it would be impossible to say at this point.  We are at pre-tender on a scheme.  Once we get the tenders we will have a better idea of what prices we will face in terms of construction costs.</p></speech>

We intend to provide 216 age-friendly units in the lifetime of the plan.  This is 15%.  At present we have 15 on-site and a further 63 are being developed with an AHB.  These should be delivered in 2024 or 2025.</p></speech>

Dublin City Council operates a financial contribution scheme for senior citizens who own their own homes and no longer want to stay in them.  They can sell them back to the council and in return for making a financial contribution they are provided with fit-for-purpose senior citizens' housing.  They also get a cash lump sum.  Does Galway City Council operate a financial contribution scheme?  If not, why not?</p></speech>

We amended our scheme of letting priorities a number of years ago to allow for it.  It is not specifically for senior citizens.  It can apply to other persons if the property is derelict or rundown and they need additional supports.  We can provide an option whereby the property can be acquired directly by the local authority at 50% of the market value or the owner can dispose of the property privately and provide us with 50% of the proceeds.  In return we will provide an age-friendly home if it is relevant.  It usually comes with home care supports or HSE supports.  The answer is that we do.</p></speech>

Cork City Council is seen by the Minister as one of the best local authorities for delivering affordable or social housing.  He said it and I have seen great work being done.  My issue is that the Government's housing targets are not ambitious enough.  I was a councillor for 11 years.  As far as I am aware, Cork City Council has hit every Government target.  Last October, there were 7,697 people and families on Cork City Council's housing list or on HAP or RAS.  In August, the figure had risen to 7,875.  This was an increase of 178 people or families.  Cork City Council has done its job.  It has delivered on every target.  This is the proof of what we are saying, which is that the Government targets are not ambitious enough.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.801" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Geaney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022101800002#D02200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  He has acknowledged the significant work under way in the city council.</p><p>The targets are a minimum.  They are also ambitious.  We are going to build 515 units this year.  Next year, our target is 821 units.  With the projects we have on-site and in play now, and with the number of projects to go on-site, we are extremely confident we are going to achieve these targets.  Whether it is affordable or social housing, though, where opportunities arise, and the committee will be well aware of the competitive dialogue process, in respect of 26 Part 8 projects across various brownfield sites in the city, we are active in the market.  Our intention is to exceed these targets where we can in future.</p></speech>

The figures show this.  My issue is that I think Cork City Council should be given more money, resources and staff.  If the council can hit every target, then why not double them?  These figures show that the housing crisis is getting worse in Cork.  This is what they show.  The Minister needs to back Cork City Council more.</p> <p>  We saw extreme weather conditions at the weekend with the rain and over the summer with the heat.  We are now facing into a winter where we are going to probably see cold and snow.  Is a contingency plan in place?  I was told a story last Sunday evening regarding a man who wanted to present for homelessness and, instead, he was out the whole day in torrential rain.  As was said, this was probably the highest rainfall in Cork city for nearly 60 years, but homeless people did not have access to shelter on Sunday afternoon.  Several people died on the streets of Cork city a few years ago.  Is there a contingency plan in place now to deal with extreme weather conditions to ensure there will always be somewhere for homeless people to go?</p></speech>

The contingency plan, the cold weather strategy, has been in place since October.  There is no reason somebody would have been left out in the cold or rain, as the Deputy outlined.  Arrangements were put in place by the Cork Simon Community over the weekend to deal with the severe weather event that hit the city.  There was, therefore, no reason for somebody to be out in the rain or the cold as was outlined.  There was absolutely no reason.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and I recently met with representatives of Cork Simon Community.  The organisation is doing great work.  The issue, though, is that there seems to be a disconnect.  Can we be assured this policy is in place for the winter?</p></speech>

As I said, however, there is no reason what was described would have happened yesterday.</p></speech>

The Minister was on RT&Eacute; last night and he stated that it was possible to buy an affordable house in Fingal for &euro;166,000.  The cheapest house it is possible to buy in Cork city is on the Boherboy Road for &euro;242,000.  I think they are gone now.  Can someone explain to me why a house in Cork is &euro;76,000 dearer than one in Dublin?  From what I can see, affordable houses in Cork are not affordable.</p></speech>

These will be completed this year.  The Deputy is correct to say that in the scheme at Boherboy Road a two-bedroom house costs &euro;217,500, while a three-bedroom house costs &euro;243,000.  It is fair to say, however, that every site is different.  Some sites are more complex than others.  The Boherboy Road scheme will be cheaper than the other schemes under construction because the land was owned by Cork City Council, whereas the council had to acquire the land for the other three schemes under construction.</p></speech>

My issue is that people in Cork are paying more for their homes.  The council is delivering affordable housing.  Good work is going on there and I recognise it.  Why is the Government not supporting Cork City Council to deliver truly affordable homes?  If a two-bedroom home on the Boherboy Road costs &euro;217,500, this is still &euro;51,000 extra.  To let people know, the average three-bedroom house in Dublin is &euro;80,000 to &euro;100,000 more expensive than in Cork city.  In this context, how can Cork city have these affordable homes?  Is the Minister not giving the council the resources?  We all know that after the last financial crash, local authorities, like those in Cork, were left with massive debts due to land.  Is the Government now forcing Cork City Council to force people to pay these debts back, instead of the Government stepping in?</p></speech>

This was to get schemes up and running in Cork.</p></speech>

Starting with Galway, I would like some clarity concerning the figures provided.  The first page of the opening statement refers to, if I combine the build figure with the acquisition one, 174 and 15, a total of 189.  Turning to the second page of that statement, and looking at delivery for 2022, the figure referred to is 265 homes to be delivered.  Turning then to the housing delivery action plan, on the third page there is a reference to 305 houses to be delivered in 2022.  Meanwhile, the fifth page of that same plan cites 265 units to be delivered in 2022.  Which is the figure that represents what will be delivered in 2022?</p></speech>

Regarding the housing delivery action plans, these were completed in December 2021.  Our targets have changed since.  We do not expect to meet our target this year.  We expect we will deliver 154 to 158 units.  We have had one scheme delayed and several of the AHB units we had expected have fallen through as well.</p></speech>

The ground floor of the unit was not suitable for living accommodation but we asked the owner to look at the use of the two floors.  We have not heard back from them since.  There has been very little interest in it.  That is why we held the event earlier this year.  We advertised it publicly.  About 40 people attended.  It was a mix of auctioneers, architects, business owners and builders but there is very little take-up of it in the city.</p></speech>

Has Galway City Council done that with CPOs?  How many properties has it attempted to acquire by CPO to try to bring out the owners of those properties to engage with the council on that scheme?  If they are not willing to engage, the CPO is the obvious option.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the position was vacant for a good part of the year because the person who held it was moved on to another job.  We have done CPOs on the derelict sites.

Why then is it not doing more of it?

I have some concise questions.  I thank the council officials for coming in to engage with the committee.  We appreciate it.  I was listening from my office and have been listening since I came in.  I will ask this question later but I want to flag it so the officials might reflect on it.  Here we are, as people from different groups within the Oireachtas, asking the officials questions about their delivery targets.  That makes me scratch my head and wonder whether the officials have a similar engagement with the people in the Custom House, who are the drivers of the Department and the policy.  I ask the officials to reflect on that because I would like to hear how that critical analysis, oversight and engagement happens between them and the people in the Custom House.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for Ms Doherty and her team.  I will come to Galway City Council if I have time.  The officials have set out how many sites and properties are on the council's derelict sites list so they do not need to repeat it.  How many of them belong to the council?  It is an interesting figure that seems to be coming up all around the place.  Councils themselves have responsibility, and are involved in the ownership of some of these properties.  Are the officials satisfied all the council's properties that are derelict are on its list of sites?  Can the officials advise us of the number of people who are on the council's social housing list?  I will begin with those questions.</p></speech>

I have a question on the 324 cost rental homes to be provided by AHBs.  Can Mr. Geaney give some indication of the timelines around that in terms of delivery?  At the end of the day, this is all about the delivery of homes.  It is not about ideology; rather, it is about getting homes over the line and getting people into them.  Can he tell us about the cost rental homes and synergies with AHBs?  I understand the 324 units will be delivered through AHBs.  What is the timeline for that?</p></speech>

With the AHB sector and the LDA, most units will be cost rental.  Our biggest issue at the moment is getting activation for the planning permissions that are in place in the city.  Some 8,000 units have planning.  There is engagement with some developers, with a view to getting cost rental units to follow on from Lancaster Quay.  However, the interest rate increase by the HFA and hyperinflation in construction are presenting challenges.  We will have a significant opportunity to get some of those planning permissions activated with the LDA.</p></speech>

It is being increased to 45%, but the main challenge is the 1% interest rate increase introduced by the HFA.  I will offer some comparisons.  In Lancaster Quay a two-bedroom apartment is coming in at just under &euro;1,100 and one-bedroom apartment is just under &euro;1,000.  With construction inflation and some of the newer opportunities under consideration, there will be an increase in rents which would make them &euro;1,350 or &euro;1,400 per month.  There are projects that would be difficult to justify as affordable in the current market.  With the increase in the subvention, it is to be hoped we will make some projects more affordable.</p></speech>

It is a significant regeneration project.  We find engagement with the LDA great.  It brings new thinking and different approaches.  From our perspective, it is great to have a partner that we can bounce things off, which has been helpful for us.  As I said, enabling works have started on the St. Kevin's site.

Strangely, the three institutions have their depots and outdoor yards there.  Like Cork, we have had very strong engagement with the LDA from the outset.  We carried out an RIAI - Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland - visioning exercise on Sandy Road early in the process, which showed the residential delivery in terms of the local authority elements is in the region of about 550 to 1,200.  We believe the higher figure, or closer to it, is achievable.  That will be, in effect, a new residential suburb.  A substantial number of the units will be affordable and some will be social units.  It is about 12 to 14 minutes' walk from Eyre Square, to put things in context.  It will be linked to the city centre by sustainable transport.  It will be a mixed-use residential area.  As Ms Philbin has said, the process is moving on.  Part of the challenge is that we have to relocate our depots and people off the site.  Parallel work is taking place in order to enable that.</p></speech>

Obviously, that is a long delay, but we expect to have a contractor in place at the beginning of January.  The Department is very supportive in terms of moving that along.  As regards the turnkey site, the delay was unavoidable.  The builder could not get the supply of fire doors it needed within the required timeframe.  As regards trying to accelerate the delivery on the AHB site, again, time delays are being experienced in the context of supplies.</p></speech>

In order to meet targets, does there need to be headroom so that one would be planning to deliver a larger number of builds than the target and, as such, if there is a delay on a project or two, one would still come in at the target?  Is that a realistic approach that should be taken?  Has the council just been very unlucky this year?</p></speech>

We tried to be ambitious in terms of trying to bring other sites forward but that just has not happened.  It is about trying to accelerate more of our sites to offset.  We expect to over-deliver on the targets set by the Department in certain years but, unfortunately, we will not reach the target this year.</p></speech>

It comes down to resources.  Thankfully, we have six additional capital staff on the administrative side who are being funded by the Department.  This is the first time that has happened.  A further five are due to come in terms of affordable home delivery.  It is extremely challenging to recruit administrative staff, but also technical staff.  It comes down to resources.  It appears that there is insufficient capacity in the private sector in terms of architects and engineers.  Mr. Barrett ran a competition recently and only one architect applied.  It comes down to resources.</p></speech>

The challenge with that within Galway city and why it might be higher is there are probably a lot of short-term lets because of the tourism business.  That may increase the figures that are identified as vacant properties but they are actually active.  That is a challenge that we have.</p> <p>  To come back on another matter, the actual figure for the housing waiting list is 4,321 households.  Regarding the targets, while we are at 60%, we will exceed the delivery next year because a number of the projects are slipping into quarters 1 and 2 of next year.

I acknowledge the enormous work both our guests and their teams in both local authorities do on their housing and homeless brief.  If that can be conveyed to the teams, certainly, on my party's behalf, I would appreciate that.</p> <p>  I will not ask lots of questions about figures because our heads are probably pickled at this stage but I will ask a few to help the committee get our head around the way in which the targets for affordable housing are determined and agreed.  We had a briefing with the departmental officials on the housing need and demand assessment the other day and some of us left the meeting a little more confused about the operation of that tool than when we went into it.</p> <p>  The questions are general and I invite the local authority officials to explain in English as plain as possible how this works.  It is all very well us having discussions around whether targets are being met or not, but how we determine the targets and whether they are sufficient to meet the need is an equally important question.</p> <p>  I am looking at both of the local authorities' housing delivery action plans as submitted to and agreed with the Department at the end of last year.  For example, with respect to Galway, there is a table on page 7 of the plan that sets out the projected housing need and demand assessment, HNDA, need and affordability constraint each year up to 2026, and then the targets.  This is no criticism of anybody in this room but I would say if anybody from Galway was reading that table, he or she would be scratching his or her head to determine that there is no affordability challenge in 2022, only 119 in 2023, etc.</p> <p>  Likewise, for example, the targets themselves are quite low.  The HNDA seems to suggest Galway over the next five years has an affordability challenge of 551 households and there are targets set there for 1,005 units to be delivered between the local authority, LDA and AHBs.  When I look at a similar table in Cork city's housing delivery action plan, given the size of the city and the constraints on cost for people who are renting or buying, there is only an affordability constraint of 1,700 households.  The total target, when adding the local authority's, the LDA's and AHBs, is 1,700.  I was hoping both local authorities could explain how is that figure derived in terms of the affordability test and how do we go from that to the actual targets because it looks like Galway has doubled the target from the need to the delivery whereas it looks like Cork has simply taken the HNDA and mapped that against the targets.  Maybe both local authorities could enlighten us on that.</p></speech>

The number of social housing units equates to 20.4%, with the affordable housing percentage at 12.7%.  That 12.7% equates to 1,737.</p> <p>  With regard to the social housing target as per the HNDA, our number, as set by the Department, would have been 2,996.</p><p>What we have sought to do, in recognition of some of the issues the Deputy has raised, is to seek a higher target and set that as a minimum target of the 3,934.  Yes, the affordable target is a minimum and a significant portion of it will be delivered through the AHB and the LDA, with which we wish to work to set the minimums and drive those numbers.

It generated the affordability-constrained number of 903.  There a slight overlap in times because our development plan runs from 2023 to 2029 and the housing delivery plan runs from 2022 to 2026.  There is a gap in the figure for 2022 because it was not produced as part of the HNDA process.  We tried to match, as closely we could, the affordability-constrained households with our overall delivery notwithstanding that the target issued by the Department of 151 over five years was quite low.  Ms. Philbin mentioned the scheme we have going to procurement shortly which will provide approximately half of that figure and we have a number of other schemes in planning.  We are confident that the target of 151 will be easily achieved.  I think that is it.  Was there another part to the question?</p></speech>

Approximately 40 Traveller families are availing of private emergency accommodation at present.  Principally, the private rental market is not an option for Traveller families anymore.</p></speech>

The number of Traveller families accessing HAP is reducing to a minimal number.  The number of direct local authority allocations or AHB allocations is increasing.  The reliance on the private market with regard to accommodation supports for Travellers is significantly reduced, as it is for the general population, but Travellers find it especially challenging to access private rental accommodation in the current market.  That has subsequently led to an increase in the number of homeless Traveller families that are presenting.  Many of them are young family formations that are not in a position to which we would allocate a standard local authority allocation at this point, given their time on the housing waiting list.  It is a problem.</p> <p>  We are working with Galway County Council and the Department.  I think there was a question earlier on about engagement with the Department.  We will meet with the Department and Galway County Council tomorrow to address this issue.  There have been a number of committee meetings because a number of the families wish to be housed in the Galway county area and we are looking at how we might be able to facilitate that.  However, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is right in that a significant number of the families in homeless services in the city are Traveller families.</p></speech>

Two other schemes are with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  One of them has been with the board for a considerable period of time and the other one has been with it since April of this year.  As soon as we get the green light for planning, we will be on site with those relatively quickly.</p> <p>  We have devised quite a unique proposal on Traveller-specific accommodation, which we call culturally specific Traveller accommodation, which is not a halting site or a group scheme but a combination of both.  A scheme to redevelop the Circular Road halting site will commence in January which will be a good demonstrator model for other schemes throughout the city and the country with regard to a best-practice model for provision of Traveller-specific accommodation.</p> <p>  There are plans in place.  Some of the timelines for planning can be quite frustrating but we have a plan.  We have an active local Traveller accommodation consultative committee, LTACC, and active subcommittees, one of which met earlier today.  We are actively engaged with the local Traveller movement with regard to providing a series of supports for Traveller families but the big challenge is the delivery of those Traveller-specific units in the coming years.</p></speech>

Our allocation to Traveller families last year was up at about 10%.  We afford a significant priority to Traveller allocations.  They can be combined with certain specific properties where there is a disability requirement.  Where we can provide support for Traveller families we are doing so.  It is significantly disproportionate to their actual population across the city.  It raises some challenges, but we deal with those as best we can.</p></speech>

There is an issue with the accuracy of the flood plain maps at the moment.  I had one myself this morning in Limerick where they actually had put in properties on a flood plain.  We went away and we got it researched and found out that the maps were inaccurate.  Many of the flood plain maps are inaccurate at the moment.  Some of them are inaccurate from the levels they are taken.  They are only taken on a basic map system.  I would be interested to know how much money is being put into properties at the moment under flood zone A?  They are actually stopping people building any houses at the moment under flood zone B in other counties.  How many of the Cork City Council houses are under group A?  I would be interested in finding out especially when it is good taxpayers' money going into building these houses.  On the one hand, they are saying that these houses on a flood plain can be done up and on the other hand they are telling us that we cannot even do it in flood zone B which would only flood every 100 years.

I mean it keeps the price of hotel rooms higher than normal for this time of year because of the significant demand for accommodation that would not normally exist.  By contrast, the situation supplies a portion of the labour force to the sector.  There are challenges and I shall outline one major challenge.  Some of the properties that we would have used for our cold weather response during the winter are now being to provide accommodation to Ukrainians.  As a result we have had to find alternative accommodation for our cold winter response.  There are challenges due to the demand for properties in the city and that situation is compounded by a student accommodation issue.</p></speech>

By that I do not mean new build but accommodation that was not in stock.  For example, a hostel that was used to house visitors to the city became vacant so it did displace a tourism market.  Two other properties were vacated by religious orders so they were not in use in the city.  Up to now I can very comfortably say no but the situation may change as time goes on if more displaced people arrive from the Ukraine.</p></speech>

There are other schemes such as the buy and renew scheme, and CPOs.  I shall focus on discussing leasing as a method of delivery.  Cork City Council has a 122 units in 2022 and 80 units in 2023.  I cannot remember if those details were mentioned in its housing delivery action plan or in the documentation supplied to the committee.  Have the city councils found leasing as a useful tool in the delivery of housing units?  Would they like to see leasing re-introduced?</p></speech>

Interestingly, regarding the choice based letting, CBL, system, and certainly not in terms of the first CBL units, we have not found that people have differentiated between new build units by the local authority or an approved housing body.  We still have people waiting ten or 11 years who are bidding on these properties.  Social leasing activated planning permissions in the city.  In my opinion the 135 units that I have mentioned would never have got to construction if the social housing leasing initiative was not in place.</p></speech>

We have one approval of 42 units but that was subsequently withdrawn.  It came back in through an AHB CALF scheme so social units will be delivered.  In 2021, we had 11 units on a long-term lease and they were all individual one-off properties.  This year, there are 3 units.  So there are 14 units that will be allocated using choice based letting.</p> <p>  Is it useful?  Every and all mechanisms that are available are useful.  The plethora of schemes or options available to a developer can sometimes muddy the water because there is too much choice.  We have received a lot of expressions of interest from developers who examined the feasibility of the long-term leasing option.  As they worked through the process they found that it was not feasible and said they preferred to either pursue the turnkey route or partner with an AHB.  We did not get a significant supply from long-term leasing other than one-off units with individual landlords.  If the scheme were to be introduced then anything that increases supply is to be welcomed.</p></speech>

There is an ideological hang-up about leasing, which is unhelpful.  We must welcome any scheme that grants security of tenure to a tenant for between 20 and 25 years versus somebody living in an unsecured HAP property.</p><p>That is perhaps something we can debate as a committee in the context of our recommendations.  I will take that a little bit further and focus on County Cork, given what Mr. Geaney said regarding the leasing element.  He referenced earlier the inactivated private rented sector, PRS.  We spoke with representatives from Dublin City Council about this last week.  My view is that there is a huge opportunity in untapped PRS schemes that have not yet been activated.  Mr. Geaney spoke about the difficulty in cost rental with the ultimate rents and what the calculation is coming out at.  The problem as I see it is that X plus Y often equals market rent, not market rent minus 25% and, therefore, viability is the issue in that regard.  He might comment on that.</p><p> There have been changes in the context of CREL, which are helpful in terms of the 45%.  I appreciate that I am asking him to comment on something that is not in place but our job as a committee is to tease out possible ways of unlocking development.  However, if a subsidy was in place so that X plus Y minus the subsidy equalled a more affordable rent, does he think that would unlock even more of the inactivated sites in Cork city?</p></speech>

We need to be down at that level.  Some might say those rents are still high.  We had 1,800 applications in the city for those 73 units, however.

With regard to the rightsizing scheme, he said approximately 35 units are nearly completed.  Is that solely for existing social tenants to rightsize or is the council taking private houses into stock and allocating secure tenancies?  If the council is doing the latter, how many of the 35 would that account for?</p></speech>

In terms of what Deputy Gould asked, however, from our perspective, 50 properties are currently being assessed that would have originated from HAP or RAS terminations.  We are assessing eligibility on the basis of that being valid.  We are, therefore, going through that process and we will take those on a case-by-case basis.</p></speech>

I have another few questions.  How many staff work full-time in the derelict sites unit in Cork City Council?  To how many properties does the &euro;4.1 million that is outstanding in the derelict sites levy relate?  To be fair, I must give credit to the council.  In the past three years, there has been a huge improvement in derelict sites levies collected.  I believe it went from 7% to above 30%.  I want to get it higher.  What are we going to do to get it higher?  If the witnesses do not have that information, they can come back to us with it.</p></speech>

That team is augmented then by the teams of planners and technicians.  We also have a multidisciplinary team across property, law, finance, housing and planning policy, which regularly meets to go through the derelict sites.  My understanding is that the derelict site levy applies to approximately 65 sites.  That would move from time to time as sites come on and off the register.</p></speech>

I have a huge issue with dereliction in Cork.  Recently, the Good Shepherd Convent was burned down for the third time.  I am talking about major fires.  There have been dozens of fires on the site, which puts fire brigade officers and emergency services people at risk.  There have been fires in the former Sunset Ridge Hotel, the St. Kevin's hospital site and Vita Cortex in the past and these are all derelict sites.  Will the council be more aggressive?  It said a CPO has been placed on 22 properties.  All four of those however - definitely Good Shepherd convent, the Sunset Ridge Hotel and Vita Cortex - should be compulsorily purchased.  There are 110 derelict sites on the council's derelict sites register.  I reckon the figure is at least treble that.  We need to be more aggressive with tackling these landholders who are destroying, and having negative impacts on, communities.  People feel angry when people are homeless or fighting to keep a roof over their heads and then they see buildings that have been derelict for decades.  Some buildings have been on the council's derelict sites register for the 32 years it was set up.  Is the council going to be more aggressive in tackling dereliction?</p></speech>

I assure him that the team and myself have been engaging directly with the owners or representatives of the owners of those sites to see how they are going to advance.  It speaks to an issue of viability across the city, not just on derelict sites but in the delivery of compact growth.  That is just the bigger context.</p> <p>  On being more aggressive, the Deputy will be aware that since 2019, we have been implementing a strategy for dereliction.   That has been robust and has yielded some results in working closely with owners and getting sites off the derelict sites register.</p><p>In 2023, we will bring property owners to court to pursue the derelict sites levies that are due.  It is hard to filter that out, but we now have files we are preparing for court and we will look at business cases-----</p></speech>

I am conscious that my time is running out.</p> <p>  We still have a huge eyesore on North Main Street.  It was a very dangerous building.  We have other such buildings in the centre of Cork city.  I do not understand how landlords let buildings get into that condition.  The buck stops with Cork City Council.  I do not want to see the likes of what has happened on North Main Street happen again.</p> <p>  How many people applied for the 32 properties in the development in Glanmire?</p></speech>

Cork City Council delivered 32 properties in Ballinglanna and 75 on Lancaster Quay, and 1,800 people applied for one development and 900 for another.  This shows that the Government targets are too low.  That 1,800 people applied for 75 properties shows the interest in and the need for housing out there.  This is not a criticism of Cork City Council because it is hitting every target, but the Government needs to give the council more resources to deliver what it is delivering.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Philbin.  I did not want to turn the Oireachtas committee into an area committee, but that information is important.  We are trying to see how local authorities are implementing Housing for All.  Two years ago, much of the legislation, the multi-annual plan, the budget and so on just were not there.  It is impressive to see local authorities respond to that.  It is a significant scale-up of ambition, resources and so on.  I compliment the local authorities on that.</p> <p>  One thing we are starting to see from these meetings with local authorities is the issue of viability.  Could the witnesses talk to us about procurements for both social and affordable housing?  Can they give us a ballpark figure for procuring units from the market?  I am talking about a two-bedroom or a three-bedroom house.</p></speech>

We have another 55 acre site which we will bring forward for planning for a mix of affordable and social housing soon after Christmas.

I will not use the word "interrogation" if the councils are not delivering their targets, given that the funding is clearly coming from the Department.  The witnesses might agree that we have a very centralised local government system.  We effectively have local administration.  We do not really have a local government system with as much autonomy as it should have.  That is only my view.  The witnesses are the practitioners of it and they have a difficult job.  I do not envy them in that regard.  I genuinely think we are blessed with the quality of our chief executives across the 31 local authorities.  I say that because it must be said.  It is not an easy task.  There are many challenges, and they are very diverse.  Ms Doherty might tell me about her targets, how regularly there are reviews with the housing people and how does that go?  Are she and her colleagues pulled up?  She might just share that with the committee.</p></speech>

We have complementary and different roles.  There are definitely two of them.  Therefore, there are checks and balances in our system.  We respect that.  We are very fortunate that there is a very strong team now in the Department.  They have reorganised themselves to work on the different elements of the Housing for All programme.

I thank Ms Doherty.</p><p>In terms of Galway, we know the city council is not going to deliver its targets for 2022.  The numbers are way down.  I am not critical of that.  There are reasons for it and Ms Philbin pointed them out very well.  How was that taken up by the Department with the council directly?  Mr. McGrath is the chief executive of Galway City Council.  The numbers are down and the council is unlikely to deliver them for 2022.  I hope 2023 will be a better year for the council.  How does the Department reconcile all that with him <i>vice versa</i>?</p></speech>

That meets at least four times a year.  That is a combined city and county task force.  We have a full in-depth review once a quarter of delivery, reasons for hold-up, the pipeline and various other issues.  In addition, I echo what Ms Doherty says, our team has a very robust, good, positive relationship with the Department.  There are regular reviews right across the board, whether it is to do with Traveller accommodation, homelessness, the delivery of social and affordable housing.  The new structures in the Department lend themselves very well to that.  Only last week for example, every local authority chief executive, plus my two colleagues here met with the Minister.  We have had ongoing and frequent engagement with Ministers, from the previous Minister, Eoghan Murphy, to the current Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  There is very robust scrutiny.  I assure the Senator that the Department asked why we were behind target.  We explained it but, equally, there is a very robust pipeline there to make up the slack.  I am extremely confident that when we get to the end of 2026, not only will we have met the targets, but we will have exceeded them on both the social and affordable side.</p></speech>

Both chief executives referred to the housing delivery action plan.  Are they fully available on the website?  They are.  That is great.</p> <p>  We did a short briefing last week on the housing needs demand assessment, HNDA.  I am interested to hear from both local authorities their view on how difficult a process this has been and what it has revealed to them.  It seems to be taking a very evidence-based requirement for all types of housing.  Is that the experience of the witnesses of it?  Has it revealed something to them that they were not aware of before in the housing targets?</p></speech>

It is undertaken as part of the development plan process.  We are not directly involved in inputting the data, although we do get the report once it is produced.  In terms of our own affordability targets, we have a figure of 1,000 and the HNDA produced a figure of 900.  So they were fairly close in terms of what our estimation was based on pipeline, our estimated demand against the data that were produced as part of the HNDA process.  I do not think there was any surprise that those numbers were fairly similar.</p> <p>  Regarding the overall need for social housing, it might have underplayed that somewhat in terms of the HNDA figure and what we estimated in terms of the overall demand.  We are not going to provide every solution for every need over the next six years.  This will extend beyond the 2022-26 period.  Supply will be required going forward.  It is not that we are going to meet every single need.  On the affordability-constrained households, there was a fairly good correlation between what we would have estimated and what the report produced ultimately.</p></speech>

The delivery action plan was being produced somewhat in isolation from the HNDA, because they were two separate processes.  It was a case of our 1,000 being an estimate, based on pipeline and estimate of supply with an eye to what we thought the actual demand for affordable was.  The HNDA produced its own figure, but they were fairly close.</p></speech>

The HNDA figure would have been higher.</p><p>That would have been higher.  So that would have produced 1,500 of a demand for social housing.  Our targets from the Department were 1,235, so we increased our anticipated supply up to that 1,400 figure, to bring it closer to the HNDA figure.  If anything, the Department's targets were below the HNDA figure.  Our ultimate figure was to bring it closer to that, if that makes sense.</p></speech>

I am conscious that it is a relatively new process.

When the council enters into those arrangements it frees up other homes so that people can right-size and can be matched to those long-term leases.  When those houses then become voids, because somebody has left them, do the councils try to bring them back?  A figure was given by one of the local authorities for trying to bring the property back to the full A2 rating.  Do the councils try to do that with all of the houses as they become available?  How do the councils decide that?  What is the funding stream available to do that?  I will ask the Galway officials first, and then Cork.</p></speech>

With our own voids we try to do all of the retrofitting once the property is vacant because it is easier to do it then.  The challenge there is the funding that is available for this work.  It does not actually meet the full cost of it, so some of the funding must come from our own operational budgets.</p></speech>

That is the current position.  We have not had that experience in relation to long-term leases. The properties are all still in lease and they have not actually expired yet.  There is a cost on the local authority because once that term is up there will be a requirement to potentially spend some money upgrading the property to hand it back to the landlord, if it is his or her desire to receive the property back.  We must make provision for a sinking fund for repairs to those types of units.  There is an ongoing cost.  We are responsible for the day-to-day repair and maintenance but there is also a sinking fund costs there which we must factor in.</p></speech>

They are currently occupied and there has not been any vacancy issues to date.  Similarly, we will have a sinking fund to carry out any repairs that are necessary when those vacancies arise.</p> <p>  With regard to voids, it is the case that when we have energy retrofitting funding in place obviously we will do the full suite of measures.  We are conscious about getting voids re-let very quickly.  That is some work we might come back to later when the properties are tenanted.</p></speech>

I compliment Cork City Council on the right-sizing approach that the council has taken to deliver on developments.  It is particularly welcome that the council has tried to include those in private stock, and not only the councils own stock.  For the benefit of the committee, and for the record, so it can be shared with the local authorities, will the Mr. Geaney tell us how the council goes about that process?  For the 30 units that the council delivered, it allocated ten of those - which is 33% of that stock - to accommodate from private supply.  I assume that the council went out to do an expression of interest and explained the process and what it entailed for the individuals and for the council.</p></speech>

Previously we had approved by the council, and we still have approved, a downsizing scheme.  In this scheme to date we have gone out into the local community projects and promoted this scheme among private homeowners.  Our councillors were really good and active in promoting the scheme in their own areas.  Ultimately, when the expressions of interest were made, those were worked through.  The right-sizing initiative has allowed us to go into other areas.  Some of the Part 8 developments we had previously taken through the council have been difficult.  We now have social housing in locations where the council would not otherwise have delivered social housing in those locations historically.  We now have 35 units about to be completed in the Blackrock Road in Cork city.  There would never have been social housing on Blackrock Road previously.  There are also 24 units in Bishopstown Road.  Again, these are all high demand areas.</p></speech>

There may have been some people who wanted to bring adult children with them to the developments, for example.  We did not allow that for the scheme.  It was through an interview process.  Some might have said that they were going to wait for another development in the area.  It has proved very successful for us to date and we have a lot of interest in the developments that are under construction at the moment.</p></speech>

I have to compliment the council.  It is very interesting how this has been delivered.  There is a 71-unit development in Waterford city that is specifically geared for older persons.  This is what I am trying to tease out with my council.  What percentage of that development should be made available for those who have private homes versus right-sizing within their own stock, and the new people who are on the list who are above the age of 50?  I will take that information from Mr. Geaney and I would appreciate it if Cork City Council could perhaps liaise with Waterford City and County Council on that.</p><p>We were teasing out the viability of the PRS and the opportunities that were there.  Going back to some of the targets, Mr. Geaney said there would be 135 affordable homes this year.  Are those solely the council's or is the LDA tied into them as well?</p></speech>

Senator Cummins should not compliment the witnesses too much because we need to make sure we keep the pressure on them.  As was alluded to earlier, Cork City Council in particular is meeting what is expected of it and surpassing targets.  I would like the witnesses' opinion on the affordable social mix in the city.  It is something I would speak about regularly.  Do they think we have hit the right mix in the city so far with the ratio of social to affordable?  Should we be increasing or decreasing on one side or the other?  If so, why?</p></speech>

It has obviously taken a while for local authorities to build a pipeline.  We now have a very significant pipeline to deliver on social housing.  We have the affordable housing scheme in place.  As referenced earlier, in 2020 we had a borrowing facility of &euro;40 million available to finance some of the schemes and get them up and running.  We want to be doing more affordable housing and I think we will.  We are going to build that pipeline like we built that social housing pipeline.  There also needs to be a mix of purely private housing in the city that is more affordable because we want to get more mixed tenure into the city.  We want to get some of those planning permissions that are in place activated for people who want to live and work in the city, to provide a long-term home on a stable basis.</p></speech>

We had to apply for planning permission to Cork County Council.  It was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which granted planning permission for 153 houses, 37 of which are social.  Timing was everything.  We got out early.  We used the serviced sites fund, as it was known at the time, that has now been replaced by the affordable housing fund.  We applied to the Department for funding.  We used the competitive dialogue process to engage with the market and we selected a contractor who is now on site.  There are 37 units to be completed this year and 80 units next year, at a price of &euro;217,500 for a two-bed and &euro;243,000 for a three-bed.  We have launched a scheme.  There are expressions of interest and those applications are currently being assessed.</p></speech>

Cork is not unique in that.

It would hold some risk for local authorities if a project went wrong or if the costs increased during the procurement process.  The competitive dialogue process we are using is a two-stage process and we are using that very successfully.  We are engaging with the market and partnering with contractors through the Part 8 system, getting developments approved through our own council and then going to site once the project cost has not changed.  We are able to look at the four-stage process but we have accommodated that down to a two-stage process with the Department and the Department has approved that.</p></speech>

When the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme was initially launched it was for towns and villages and within the curtilage of those towns and villages.

It will assist but given the way construction projects have gone and the cost of construction, we would suggest that it needs to be a higher level of subvention than what is currently in place.  If the scheme is extended to the cities, we will obviously embrace that and promote it.</p></speech>

Apologies, I had to step out for a little bit of work.  I know it is a long meeting but the information they have given us is genuinely valuable so I hope they do not feel we are having them here under sufferance.  I have one request and two questions.  This committee is doing a separate piece of work trying to understand housing need and demand assessment.  If both councils were in a position to give a short note to the committee secretariat explaining the specific local inputs in their two local authority areas, particularly the affordability challenge but also any other specific information about social housing, that would be great.  I only need something very short; I know the witnesses are very busy.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Higgins and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, some figures were given out for the social housing waiting lists.  I suspect Cork might have given us a net list figure and Galway might have given us a gross list figure but I could be wrong.  Generally, the city councils do not do gross housing need.  That is a wonderful thing I discovered when I was in with some smaller local authorities a while back.  It is a brilliant thing.  For clarity, if both councils know their net and gross needs, I ask them to explain the difference for the slow learners on this side of the room.  That would be helpful.</p></speech>

This point is important because it is not common practice for all local authorities to present their elected members with a gross and net need.  Having a gross need figure is a really useful tool.  When the Housing Agency publishes its summary of housing needs assessments, which it will do again later this year, it only gives us the net need, that is, the number of people who are on housing lists.  From the point of view of planning and targeting, particularly when the private rental sector is shrinking, it is helpful to know what the gross need is, which would include people in receipt of HAP and RAS.  Some local authorities even include their transfer lists in their gross need.  It is a very useful tool.</p> <p>  My second question goes back to targets and whether or not they have been missed.  I fully understand that every project is different and there are things that are out of people's control.  I am interested to know what happens when targets are missed.  Under the previous Government's plan, targets were missed for a variety of reasons in 2020 and 2021 and the missed units seem just to have dropped off the picture.  When Ms Philbin was answering the questions from Deputy Higgins, she seemed to suggest that if Galway City Council was not going to meet either the Department's figure or its own target for a given year, the expectation is that the council would try to roll that shortfall in and meet it by the end of the five years.  Is it the case that under the previous Government's plan, missed targets were just missed targets?  Is there a requirement or request now from the Department that if a target is missed in one year or another, the expectation for social housing is that the overall target over the five years will be met?  I am interested in hearing from the representatives of both councils on that.  When we asked people from the Department about it recently, they were not sure of the answer.</p></speech>

The officials clearly said councils would have to make up the shortfall.  I will be very surprised if the witnesses from the councils say otherwise.</p></speech>

Galway City Council will be judged on its delivery at the end of the period.  We are confident we will meet the target and exceed it.  If we miss our target this year, we have to do better next year.  I am old enough and long enough in the system to remember when we had multi-annual housing programmes that were predicated exactly on that basis.  We have carried that on into both Rebuilding Ireland and now Housing for All.</p></speech>

From that plan, 6,000 or so units were missed across the State over the final two years.  Those 6,000 units have not been added into anything else.  The councils have a separate set of targets they have agreed with the Department under the new plan and if those targets are missed, they will be rolled in and carried forward.  However, the missed targets from the past two years are kind of lost.  Does Mr. McGrath agree that is a fair read of the situation?</p></speech>

It is more about wanting to understand the transition from one plan to another and what happened to the very considerable number of units, numbering 6,000 between 2020 and 2021 across a range of local authorities, that were lost.  Where do they go?  Are they subsumed into the new targets, added to the new targets or lost?</p></speech>

If we look at our targets over the five-year period, we have a higher delivery target for 2022, which is the 305 figure.  The number then drops to 219 for next year and it is 224 for the following year and 241 for the next.  It is higher this year to reflect missed targets in the previous years.  Those missed targets in 2020 have been carried forward into our targets for 2022.  They have not been lost as such.  Our projection and anticipated delivery is higher in the first year of Housing for All to make up for lost delivery in the two previous years.</p></speech>

If we take the social housing target in the first year of the Housing for All plan, it is approximately 9,000 units for the new-build programme, whereas Rebuilding Ireland was to end in 2021 with delivery of 10,000 units.  Even though there was a significant loss of units from the targets in 2020 and 2021, the new targets, from 2022 and for a couple of years thereafter, are lower than what was in the Fine Gael-led Government's previous national development plan, which had a figure of 10,000 a year.  The maths does not add up in that way.  It might add up for an individual local authority such as Galway City Council but, nationally, we are dropping down to 9,000 for a couple of years and then building up to the 10,000 social housing units midway through the current plan.  Does that make sense?</p></speech>

We can only comment on our own individual targets.  There is a higher delivery in year one to reflect missed targets in the previous two years and then it levels off in years two to five in the figures that are issued to us.  As Ms Philbin and Mr. McGrath mentioned, we ultimately will be measured on our delivery against those targets.  While the numbers this year will not reach target, the pipeline will exceed the targets for both 2023 and 2024.  We will make up this year's shortfall in the next two years.</p></speech>

It is the same question I asked the witnesses last week.  As my party's spokesperson on addiction recovery and well-being, I was contacted by a person who is in recovery for six months and has been taken off the housing list.  I am not sure whether it is a case of being taken completely off it or suspended.  Is this a policy councils are implementing?  Do the witnesses agree that a person who is in recovery should remain on the housing list?</p></speech>

It could be argued that because people are in recovery, their housing need has changed.  Our argument, however, is that within three or six months, they will be out of recovery and will still need housing.  The witnesses are suggesting this is dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  I am looking for a commitment from all local authorities that people in that situation will be kept on the housing list.  The witnesses are nodding.  That is great.</p> <p>  My other question relates to voids and boarded-up houses.  Having spoken about this issue with people in Cork City Council, I have long advocated that local authorities should be able to turn voids around as quickly as possible without having to send a list up to the Department.  The requirement to do so is only red tape and bureaucracy.  Do the witnesses think they would be able to turn voids around faster and reduce their number more quickly if they had the authority to do so and then to claim the money back from the Department afterwards without having to go through hoops?</p></speech>

In August this year, there were 104 first-time applicants to Cork City Council's housing list.  When I was on the council, going back to 2019 or 2020, there was an average of some 1,200 families per year coming onto the local authority list.  If we look at the amount of social housing being developed, even with Cork City Council doing great work, the number of people coming onto the list means the housing crisis will continue to worsen.  I always advocated that the only way to tackle the housing crisis is by ensuring housing delivery exceeds the number of new applicants.  That should be the minimum target each year.  I am not sure what the figures are for Galway City Council in this regard.  Do the witnesses think this would be a credible target to put in place?</p><p>Does Mr. Geaney think that would be a credible target?</p></speech>

The targets are a minimum and obviously where we can, we will deliver more.  We are engaging with many different sites across the city to get them activated and decided on.  That will continue and we will always try to do more.</p></speech>

Is there a timeline for the completion of the Knocknaheeny west quarter regeneration and can Mr. Geaney supply us with a rough estimate of its completion date?  I went to the first meeting on this project in September 2000 and now 22 years later, it is still ongoing.</p> <p>  The other question relates to vacancy levels in Cork.  Eight of the top ten areas with highest levels of vacancy are on the north side.  Will that be tackled?  Is there a plan in place to tackle vacancy on the north side of the city? I thank everyone for their answers.  It has been a really in-depth discussion and it was great to get the knowledge and to hear about the great work local authorities are doing.  What we want to do here is to help local authorities to deliver housing so anything we can do, we will.  We have differences politically but as a committee, that is our goal. </p></speech>

Just to clarify, there are a number of requests for further information.

There is a question on notices-to-quit, in relation to housing assistance payment, HAP, figures; and a question for Mr. Geaney on the right-sizing scheme.

Timelines are there for strategic housing developments, SHDs, but not for local authority-led developments; which is not just housing incidentally.</p></speech>

I recall our last trip here on 17 October 2018.  Today is 18 October 2022.  It is interesting that some of the same issues such as viability and activation have come up.  One of the things we focused on the last time as well was - and I do not want to get into a constitutional discussion - land ownership.  That is something that may be significant.  We flagged that the last time as well.  It was interesting pulling out the details of our last meeting and having a read of it.</p></speech>

I ask Members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or to switch them to flight mode as they interfere with the sound system, make it difficult for the reporters to cover the meeting and adversely affect television and web streaming.</p> <p>  The purpose of our meeting is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders as part of the committee's scrutiny of the general scheme of the inspection of places of detention Bill 2022.</p> <p>  I welcome the following witnesses: Mr. Mark Kelly, chief inspector, and Dr. Ciara O'Connell, senior inspector, from the Office of the Inspector of Prisons; Dr. Pauline Conroy and Ms Nuala Ryan from the prison visiting committees; Ms Orla Keane, who is the general council for the Mental Health Commission; Dr. Joe Garrihy from Maynooth University; Ms Saoirse Brady and Ms Molly Joyce from the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT; and Mr. Liam Herrick and Mr. Se&aacute;n Beatty from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL.  Our representatives from the Department of Justice are Ms Lisa Doherty and Mr. David Hogan.  They are all very welcome as observers and participants.</p> <p>  Before I invite witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I wish to advise them of the following in respect of parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses and members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I will invite each organisation to make an opening statement to a maximum of three minutes.  Once all the opening statements have been made, I will call on the members of the committee in the order in which they indicate to me to put their questions.  We have a rota system which provides that each member has an initial seven minutes.  That is for questions and answers.  Members are always very succinct in their questioning because of that.  When all the members have indicated that their initial engagements are finished, and time permitting, we will do a second round of three minutes each for questions and answers.  Obviously, the duration of the meeting is limited and, therefore, our time slots are strictly adhered to.  I ask people to be focused in their contributions.</p> <p>  I now call on each organisation to deliver its opening statement in the following order.  Mr. Kelly from the Office of the Inspector of Prisons, who will be followed by Dr. Conroy, Ms Keane, Ms Brady, Mr. Herrick and Dr. Garrihy.</p></speech>

I am the chief inspector of prisons and I am accompanied on my left by Dr. Ciara O'Connell, who is a senior inspector.  Once enacted, the provisions in this general scheme will pave the way for Ireland to ratify the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture, OPCAT, and to designate national preventive mechanisms to monitor conditions of detention.  We welcome the very clear legislative intent to transform our office into an inspectorate of places of detention and to designate it the national preventive mechanism for the criminal justice sector.  That would mean we would have responsibility for monitoring not only prisons but also Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stations and other places of detention.  I emphasise that, in future, all our inspection activity will be carried out in our national preventive mechanism, NPM, capacity.  The approach we have taken in our written submission to the committee is to "benchmark" the proposals in the general scheme against the internationally recognised requirements of OPCAT.</p> <p>  There is much to be welcomed in the general scheme.  Nevertheless, we have shared with the committee our reservations about a number of the heads that do not seem to respect the cardinal principle that bodies designated as national preventive mechanisms must have functional independence from Departments and a full range of appropriate powers.  In our full submission, we emphasise three key areas where we consider that the general scheme may require amendment.  First are the guarantees of functional independence of the inspectorate and other national preventive mechanisms, which, in our view, are deficient.  Second are the proposed functions of the inspectorate.  Third, we think there are certain supplementary provisions that should be included in the legislation but which are not currently to be found in it.</p> <p>  I would be very happy, as would my colleague, Dr. O'Connell, to go into further detail on all these matters in response to questions from committee members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.1329" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Pauline Conroy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022101800002#C00300"><p>The publication of the heads of the general scheme is a very welcome development.  It starts to consolidate some of the human rights to which people deprived of their liberty are entitled.</p> <p>  Visiting committees are a particular kind of structure.  We monitor, not inspect, the activities of prisons and speak directly to the prisoners.  We are in and out of the prisons constantly.  That could be weekly, fortnightly or monthly.  In these interactions with the prisoners we try to be impartial and independent.  We also try to listen very carefully to them because we are possibly the only independent people prisoners will meet on the landings of their prisons or in their cells.  Ours is a very humane but nevertheless rights-based approach.  We represent the views and voices of prisoners and the conditions of the prison estate.</p> <p>  That is why we are concerned about some of the proposals that would have visiting committees dropping into prisons once every three months.  A visit of two or three hours once a month or every three months would not reveal very much.  We would not be able to observe how frequently mattresses are being placed on the floor for prisoners to sleep on.  We would not be able to observe if prisoners are showing signs of enduring mental illness, which is visible when we attempt to talk to them.</p> <p>  Our submission primarily addresses head 13, which goes into some detail on visiting committees and proposes an entirely new structure to that which we have at the moment.</p><p>Prison visiting committees have been in existence for almost 100 years.  It is quite obvious that they need reform, but we are not sure that we should throw out the baby with the bath water.  There are elements of the work of visiting committees which are useful and valuable, and are appreciated by prison governors.  Prison governors, who are not mentioned at all in the proposed Bill, have a significant role to play as managers and under law, but we do not see them in the general scheme.  A visiting committee can provide independent and systematic observations on the prison system and, in particular, unexpected consequences of changes in rules or policy and changes in the composition of the prison population, for example, whether more prisoners are on remand rather than sentenced.  At the moment, about four out ten are on remand.  This poses big questions as to whether opportunities for rehabilitation are going to be made available.  These prisoners do not know if they are going to be sentenced or how.  This disrupts, but it is an unexpected consequence of the judicial system for the prisons.</p></speech>

As members may be aware, the commission is the regulator for mental health services, and it carries out inspections in relation to mental health services.  It also organises tribunals to independently review those who are involuntarily detained.  It is important to note that the inspector has the right to visit any resident at any time as part of an inspection, but also has an obligation to visit any resident who requests a visit.</p> <p>  By way of assistance to the committee we have included a paragraph by way of explanation of how many people are detained under the mental health Acts.  In 2021, for example, 3,759 involuntary detention orders were made.  Each and every one of those is reviewed within 21 days.  They are reviewed by an independent body made up of three people - a chair, a consultant psychiatrist and what is referred to in the legislation as a lay member.  This is a key part of the 2001 legislation in vindicating the rights of persons who are involuntarily detained.  The commission limited its submission to Part 3 of the general scheme.  It welcomes the intent.  It notes that the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, in its report in 2019 stressed the fact that legislation had not been progressed in regard to NPMs.  It is a good thing that we are here today and that that has progressed.</p> <p>  The commission also welcomes the proposal for the national preventive organisations and also the proposal that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, would be the co-ordinating body, given its resources and skills.</p> <p>  The commission has noted that there are some gaps in the legislation.  We have had access to the submission of at least one other party and we noted that it has identified similar gaps.  We accept that this is the early stage and perhaps some of those gaps will be filled during the course of the draft.</p></speech>

The IPRT has been advocating for the ratification of OPCAT, for many years.  We welcome this proposed Bill as a significant step forward in making ratification a reality.  We urge the committee to give the general scheme its full attention over the coming months in order to ensure that momentum is not lost and that the final legislation is robust in meeting international human rights standards and best practice in monitoring and inspecting places of detention.</p> <p>  OPCAT is clear that the State must guarantee the functional independence of NPMs, as well as the independence of their personnel.  The subcommittee on the prevention of torture, SPT, details that this includes financial and operational autonomy.  As it stands, the IPRT is not convinced that the general scheme sufficiently establishes such functional, including financial and operational, independence.  Concerns include the budget of the new inspectorate of places of detention remaining within the remit of the Department of Justice - under head 3, rather than having its own Vote and the restrictions imposed on the chief inspector around questioning or expressing an opinion on the merits of Government policy, which is in head 11.</p> <p>  Resourcing is an overarching consideration in this proposed Bill.  First, there is a need to ensure that the new inspectorate of places of detention has the resources to take on the role of NPM for prisons and Garda stations.  Second, and separately, IHREC must be provided with additional resources to carry out the extensive additional duties assigned to it by this legislation.  It is also important that the general scheme explicitly sets out IHREC's proposed NPM co-ordinating function as distinct from all its other responsibilities, and that designated NPMs, including the inspectorate of places of detention, are enabled to maintain a clear distinction between any investigative functions they might hold and their inspection and monitoring functions as an NPM.  The IPRT would also welcome clarity on whether it is intended that the prison visiting committees will be designated as an NPM.  We believe further discussion is needed on the proposed role of the new inspectorate of places of detention in supervising the visiting committees.</p> <p>  Article 24 of OPCAT makes clear that its ratification is not dependent on the passing of this proposed legislation.  Rather, the Government could ratify OPCAT today and simply make a declaration postponing the implementation of its obligations for a maximum total of five years, with an additional year to designate the NPM after ratification.  Commitments to bring forward legislation and move towards the ratification of OPCAT have been consistently missed since 2018.  While the IPRT welcomes the current progress in respect of the general scheme, we remain of the view that the Government can maintain the necessary impetus and make significant progress by ratifying OPCAT with immediate effect.</p> <p>  International guidance describes the important role that civil society can play in both designating and feeding into the work of NPMs.  A good example of this is the Australia OPCAT Network.  We would be happy to answer more questions on that specific issue.  Given the importance of civil society engagement, the IPRT urges committee members to recommend the establishment of a clear formal role for civil society in the designation and operation of NPMs in the proposed legislation.  I again thank the committee for the invitation to present here today.  We look forward to further discussion of any of the aspects of the submission that we covered in our opening statement or submission.</p></speech>

The ICCL has long called for a proper independent inspection mechanism for all places where people are deprived of their liberty in the State.  When deprived of their liberty, people are more vulnerable to abuse, ill-treatment and torture.  Proper safeguards must be in place.</p> <p>  Ireland ratified the UN Convention against Torture in 2000 and signed the optional protocol in 2007.  We have, therefore, been waiting 15 years for the ratification of OPCAT, despite it being promised by successive Governments.  We believe this is finally an opportunity to put in place a proper independent inspection system in Ireland, which will comply with the highest international standards.</p> <p>  The Bill proposes a framework for a national preventative mechanism to prevent torture and ill-treatment, which is most welcome.  However, we do have some concerns about the general scheme, as presented, when compared with the standards of OPCAT.  We are very eager to work together with the Government at this stage in the legislative process to secure the highest possible outcome.</p> <p>  As our colleagues in the Irish Penal Reform Trust have outlined, the first issue is that the Government has decided against ratifying the optional protocol before the eventual Bill becomes law.  While this does reflect general Government policy regarding international treaties, this treaty is significantly different because it specifically provides for engagement with the expert international body, the sub-committee on torture, in the process of developing national legislation.</p> <p>  We would also urge the Government to expand the NPM and the breadth of the proposed legislation to cover all places where people are deprived of their liberty in Ireland.  We must include social and care settings such as psychiatric hospitals, on which there is very little detail in the general scheme, nursing homes and direct provision centres.  We are happy to answer questions on specific provisions on those non-criminal justice areas of detention.</p> <p>  As the Office of the Inspector of Prisons and others have outlined, of crucial importance is the principle of functional independence of the NPM.  The UN's SPT has set out standards in this regard and there are a number of areas in which the general scheme, as currently drafted, falls short.  In particular, we recommend that the NPM be independent of Departments and be accountable primarily to the Oireachtas.  One specific flaw we identify in the proposals is that there is provision for a prohibition on the new inspector issuing observations on Government policy or legislation.</p><p>A gap in Ireland&rsquo;s inspection regime of particular interest to us is the lack of any statutory-based independent inspections of police custody to date.  It is proposed in the general scheme to address this deficit.  We think it is essential, however, that the eventual legislation be co-ordinated and aligned with the proposals in the draft policing, security and community safety Bill.</p><p> We encourage the Government to enshrine collaboration with civil society in the text of the eventual Bill.  The SPT has set out clear guidelines for how civil society can play a role in the design of the NPM and in its ultimate functioning.  Mr. Beatty and I are happy to take questions on any of these issues.</p></speech>

I am an assistant professor of criminology at Maynooth University's school of law and criminology.  I am a specialist in penology, including national and international frameworks, policies, prison systems and prison literature.  I hold a PhD in criminology from the UCD school of law.  My research generally focuses on diverse areas, including prison officers&rsquo; occupational cultures, "cocooning" in prison and minority ethnic and foreign national prisoners in Ireland.  My collaborative and co-produced work has established relationships with colleagues here, including with those in the IPRT, the Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas, the Pathways Centre, the Irish Prison Service, the probation service, as well as HM Prison and Probation Service in England and Wales.</p> <p>  I welcome the production of the general scheme as a key step towards the ratification of the optional protocol and its associated progression in prison oversight in Ireland.  The development and consistent review of an effective system of prison oversight should not be an aspiration.  It should instead be the minimum standard required of the State, and the general scheme presents an opportunity that must be grasped to ensure that this occurs.  I will briefly mention three key areas, but I am happy to discuss my written submission, and that of Dr. Marder, afterwards.  These areas are: the independence of the proposed inspector of places of detention, IPD; the clarity of roles, obligations and expertise of the proposed IPD; and the implications and opportunities for replacing or reforming prison visiting committees.</p> <p>  The ratification of OPCAT is imperative, but, under article 18 of the protocol, oversight bodies or NPMs must have, in perception and practice, full independence from prison services, including their management and staff, and Government officials and Departments.  This independence must include, but is not limited to, financial affairs and resourcing, publication capacities, staffing and the commissioning of external expertise.  NPMs must be precisely that, preventative rather than reactionary.  The pernicious effects of imprisonment are well rehearsed in the literature and imposing sanctions must be proportionate, while avoiding known collateral harms.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that the general scheme is a draft and that further work will provide additional details and clarifications on several matters.  However, what is proposed will benefit greatly from clarity in many areas, including around language, structure and content on topics such as IPD powers, obligations, expertise and resourcing.  Questions remain about these issues and the opportunities afforded by the spirit of the proposed Bill would be best served by careful, evidence-based decisions in these areas.</p> <p>  What is proposed in the general scheme will have major implications for the reform or replacement of prison visiting committees, while overdue, fundamental questions must be addressed directly about the aims, role and structures of the committees.  To maximise the utility and effectiveness of any future form of prison visiting committees, due regard must be given to issues such as such a committee's role clarity and powers, the appointment of chairs and members, term limits, diversity and representation, training and expertise, publications, visibility and engagement with people in custody.</p> <p>  I appreciate that these comments are necessarily brief, but I am happy to elaborate further upon request and I look forward to the forthcoming discussion. </p></speech>

I am also convinced that the chief inspector should be somebody who has been made independent by statute.  I do not believe in that context that it is necessary to impose on the chief inspector the obligation imposed on senior civil servants testifying before Oireachtas committees that they should not express an opinion on Government policy.  The position would be enhanced by the removal of this aspect.</p> <p>  When I was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I remember finding among the papers of my predecessors, and I will be charitable and not name any names, correspondence from a Deputy in the south of the country asking that a student member of his party be appointed to a prison visiting committees as far north as possible.  I think there was an exclamation mark beside the request, so therefore I think there was a slight element of jocularity about it.  It underlined that prison visiting committees were at that time regarded as a kind of reward for party activists and supporters who could claim expenses.  These visiting committees do extremely valuable work.  The proposal here regarding the appointment of their memberships is welcome.</p> <p>  As far as I am concerned, it is all very well to talk about a rights-based approach to prisoners, but our present prison infrastructure - and I am dealing now with prisons - is so deficient that prisoner-on-prisoner violence is a serious deprivation of human rights.  This requires not simply the appointment of an inspector who will be able to do nothing to stop blades being carried in prisons and retribution being meted out to prisoners in individual cases, but more infrastructure.  We need to build Thornton Hall.  We must have a proper prison.  Good and all as have been the reforms to the governance of Mountjoy Prison undertaken by recent governors since the appalling situation revealed in the Gary Douch report, the prison needs to be closed and replaced.</p> <p>  We cannot have this complacent approach to prisons of the infrastructure being fine and that we are going to look after people's rights and civil liberties and all the rest of it.  We must address what is staring us in the face, which is that prisoners are vulnerable to suffering harm from each other and vulnerable in the context of the whole drugs culture about which little enough is done to address.  The circumstances in the prison, according to the Constitution and the law, are intended to provide for rehabilitation.  The lack of infrastructure means this is greatly compromised.  We must build prisons.  There are people who think that building prisons is a waste of time.  Building a new and proper prison, however, and at least one, and maybe more, to guarantee the rights of prisoners physically, to give them safety from each other and to allow for proper segregation is a human rights' issue that cannot be postponed.</p> <p>  If we do not allow the chief Inspector of Prisons to express views about Government policy when brought before an Oireachtas committee, then, effectively, the role will be neutered in respect of being people's guarantors.  It will not affect the Department of Justice that the Inspector of Prisons feels free to do so.  I remember that the late Mr. Justice Dermot Kinlen had no difficulty, when he was made Inspector of Prisons, taking lumps out of me as the Minister.  It was good that he felt free to do that.  It is greatly important that the independence of the inspectorate is guaranteed by the legislation as it progresses.</p><p>I am not asking questions.  If anyone wants to agree or disagree with me, then please do.  I have outlined my views of this matter.</p></speech>

While we need prison infrastructure the Government policy now is to reduce the number of people in prison overall.  I hope that by doing that we will end up having the space, resources and necessary time to make prisons what they should be to ensure the civil liberties and human rights of the people within them.</p> <p>  On 31 August, the policy options review and action plan was published by the Minister for Justice, which contained the clear direction that people who are sentenced for less than 12 months for minor offences should not be imprisoned.  In 2021, 79% of all sentence committals were for 12 months or under and, in 2022 so far, it has been 78%, which shows there is a trend.  If we can address those issues then there will be no need to build a new prison.  Recently Limerick Prison was improved so I believe that we can renovate and do things to the existing prisons within our resources. </p></speech>

The blight, especially on younger people, of being sentenced to prison, particularly when prisons are drug infested, violent and have no proper system of rehabilitation, and we must bear in mind the figure that we heard for the number of people in prison on remand.  I agree with Ms Brady about that 1,000%.</p> <p>  Let us be frank.  Mountjoy Prison will never be an appropriate place to incarcerate people.  I have been there on a number of occasions and I have seen the improvements that took place in management but the prison is still innately inadequate.</p></speech>

Playing fields, running tracks and things like that need to be provided for people who are genuinely in need of rehabilitation as well as proper facilities.  Rehabilitation is not going to happen in Mounjoy Prison so we must cop on and accept that the institution must be replaced.</p> <p>  We must bear in mind that we have a growing population, which has moved towards 5.5 million and that the prison system served a population of 2.9 million when I was born.  We cannot pretend that the current number of prison spaces is adequate bearing in mind the number of life prisoners and serious sentences for sexual offences and all of the rest that are being handed down by the courts.  I do not want a situation where a revolving door starts again for people with significant sentences.</p> <p>  I reiterate that I agree with Ms Brady regarding short sentences.  At one stage I wanted every district judge who was about to impose a short sentence to write out in his or her own handwriting why no other way of dealing with the prisoner was being contemplated.  I am with Ms Brady on rebalancing the matter in favour of non-incarceration but we still need proper modern prisons.</p></speech>

Can the officials comment on the great concerns about all that?</p> <p>  Does Mr. Kelly think there should be a role for inspecting Garda stations?  A similar body in the Six Counties has the power to inspect PSNI police stations.  I attended a meeting of the criminal law committee of the Law Society where various concerns were expressed about what happens in Garda stations from the point of view of solicitors being there.  Nothing seems to have been done about the concerns.  Has Mr. Kelly an opinion on the matter?</p> <p>  I have heard what has been said about new prisons.  Last week, we had a meeting with the visiting justice committee of the House of Commons.  One of the facts to arise is that we have the lowest number of judges per 100,000 population in the EU, which is a situation that needs to be addressed.  The justice committee visited Cloverhill Prison and the delegation expressed concern that there were a lot of trials taking place where prisoners leave jail and go into what a solicitor in Tralee, County Kerry, used to refer to as the fish tank to have their trial dealt with.  There are an awful lot of sentences.  The number of short sentences was a concern expressed by prison staff and some prisoners when we visited Mountjoy Prison earlier in the year.  Perhaps judges should visit Mountjoy Prison and listen to what prison governors have to say about the uselessness and ineffectiveness of short sentences because when prisoners are released, they go back to being homeless, unemployed and usually to addiction so they do not achieve anything.  When prisoners are sentenced to, say, six or seven months, no educational facilities are put in place during that time.</p> <p>  There has been a drift towards having a larger number of people on remand for the past 20 years and I think that the statistic is 40%.  Since Covid there have been an awful lot more prisoners on remand in jails and, especially for more serious offences, they are being denied bail.  The other options we explored in our meeting with the House of Commons committee were tagging and observing people, thus reducing the need to be in custody for longer sentences.</p> <p>  The average time it takes for serious trials to reach court is two years currently.  Big concerns were expressed about that because that results in jails filling up.  The matter should be addressed.</p> <p>  Recently five new judges were appointed and that news was heralded as a good achievement.  I believe that we must appoint way more judges to cut through the backlog before we ever consider constructing more prisons.</p> <p>  A report has been done on conditions in the women's prison.  The Department has not published it yet.  It has led to the resignation of one of the members of the group that did the report.  Is there any sign of that report being published?</p><p> When prisoners relate their concerns to the members of the visiting committee, in their experience have many governors' decisions been overturned on foot of representations the visiting committee makes on behalf of the prisoners they meet?  What are the witnesses' views on what will happen under head 13 and the new prisoner visiting committees?  What kind of experience, qualifications and resources should their members have?  Should there be legal back-up?  Should they be paid?  </p></speech>

On whether the members should be paid, we are not volunteers.  The prison visiting committees are appointed by the Minister for Justice.  We are the eyes, ears and nose of the Minister in the prisons.  We are not volunteers.  When we meet prisoners and see them regularly, they speak to us and look for appointments to come and see us.  We walk the floors and are in and out of the prisons all the time.  We hear their complaints and concerns.  Many of the concerns could be dealt with, shall we say, in that we go to the governor with them, consult and the governor would take them on board.  I do not remember any cases where a decision was actually overturned.  I do not remember anything like that.   We would go and speak to the governor and the appropriate authorities.  A lot of the matters can be resolved practically.  Issues with post, clothes, missing stuff, appointments and prisoners wanting to get back to making phone calls can be easily resolved and dealt with.  That is what the visiting committees do and we do it very well.  What makes us unique is that we go in and speak to the prisoners themselves.</p></speech>

We welcome the future role of the office in monitoring detention in Garda stations.  For people who end up in prison, very often their detention journey has been a continuum, from the moment they are arrested in the street, transported to a Garda station, placed in a court holding cell, put in a prison van and taken to prison.  As someone who has spent the best part of the past 30 years monitoring both police and prison detention, I believe it is extremely important to be able to monitor the protection of rights at every point in that continuum.  To give a practical example, when we interview people in private in remand prisons, it provides a very good opportunity to gather detailed information about what their experience has been in Garda stations.  It makes sense that with my inspectors and senior inspectors, I have the potential to follow that up.  We will be looking at issues including the protection of procedural rights in Garda custody.  Chief among these will be access to legal advice and effective access to legal advice.  This country has one of the lowest rates in the EU of effective access to solicitors in police custody and I am keen to look at what are the underlying reasons for that.  The safeguard is there in law.  The possibility for solicitors to be present in Garda stations is there in practice but the take-up rate is very low, which means the potential prophylactic impact of that procedural rights' protection is not being maximised.</p> <p>  To pick up on a point made by the Deputy and also Mr. Herrick from the ICCL, it is crucially important that what we do in future, as the office of the inspectorate of places of detention, dovetails effectively with other accountability mechanisms in the policing area.  We are already laying the groundwork for that and consulting the current Policing Authority, GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What we are trying to make sure that we do is to design a future accountability and monitoring mechanism which is complementary to those existing and future mechanisms with policing and-----</p></speech>

Heads of Bill came before the Joint Committee on Justice some months ago in relation to the treatment of prisoners in custody.  They included a section that would give the power to a Garda inspector to remove solicitors from a Garda station if the inspector felt they were obstructive to an investigation and interrogation that was taking place.  That followed from discussions between the Department of Justice and, I believe, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI.  It was with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in any case.  Does Mr. Kelly have a view on that proposal?  Is he familiar with it?</p></speech>

I would have to look at it in more detail.  In a more general sense, that certainly has the potential to impinge on the independence of solicitors providing legal advice.  It would have to be viewed with great caution.  Not all solicitors, of course, are angels.  There has to be some possibility for senior officers to express a view on certain forms of conduct but that must respect the fundamental requirement of the independence of the lawyer.</p></speech>

There is nothing in them that I disagree with.  If anything, I will just further emphasise them.  As this is pre-legislative scrutiny and officials from the Department are here in an observer role, I want to ensure that those key messages are made very clear in any report the committee submits.  I have tried to capture the common themes in the presentations and I would like to put them on the record.  If anyone disagrees with my understanding of what has come across, I ask them to say so.  I want to make sure the message is clear to the observers as regards what needs to be addressed in the heads of Bill.</p> <p>  As regards heads 6 and 8, this matter is supported by the IPRT, IHREC and Dr. Garrihy and comes up in all of the presentations.  The Bill does not ensure financial and operational independence of the IPD and NPMs, including separate financial resources and staff.  That would be necessary.  If anyone disagrees with how I am capturing these points, they should correct me.  There is a need for adequate resourcing to support the development and infrastructure of the IPDs and MPNs.  That the IPD and the MPNs should be accountable to the Oireachtas and not the Department is what I understand from most of the contributions.  Currently, the Minister for Justice has a role in appointing staff to the IPD, which obviously interferes with its independence.  I might return to the question of staffing at the end with a question on the expertise needed by staff.</p><p>Another matter I have picked up on is the conflict in the context of the chief inspector being located within the budget of the Department of Justice.  In addition, there is a need for further clarification within the heads of the powers, obligations, expertise and resources of the IPDs, as well as the privileges, resources, roles and responsibilities granted to the NPMs.  The legal basis is missing.  One of the witnesses may wish to comment on that specifically. </p><p> As regards the functions of the chief inspector under head 8, my understanding is that the legal minimum duration should be stipulated in the context of prisons receiving an inspection.  The chief inspector should be empowered to engage with external experts who could support inspections carried out by the IPD.  Investigative reports into a serious adverse event or death should be laid before the Oireachtas.  The heads of Bill do not clarify how the voices of detainees would be heard during these investigations.</p><p> Those are just some of the issues that concern me; there are many others.  I wanted to pick up on some of the key points so that they do not get lost in the wider conversation in respect of reform, prisons, sentences and all that type of thing.  I want to focus on the heads of Bill and what is needed therein.</p><p> Mr. Kelly referred to the continuum of detention.  I am prone to getting a little bit philosophical sometimes but I make the point that poverty is also a place of detention, so that somehow starts a little earlier.  As regards being able to investigate, there is a bare minimum of human rights, such as being free from torture or inhumane treatment and so on, but does that begin to vary depending on the needs of the person who ends up in prison?  To take the ageing population, for example, or those with undiagnosed autism, ADHD or dyspraxia, there are all these combinations of things that interact with people becoming engaged in the criminal justice situation in the first place but it would not ordinarily be captured.  I want to tie that back into the point on the type of expertise that would be needed in the context of inspections because we have to consider the needs of the individual rather than just the infrastructure and the basic stuff that somebody might be looking for in an inspectorate.</p><p> It is usually better for me to direct my questions to individual witnesses but I have not done so on this occasion because any of our guests could probably contribute equally on each of the matters I have raised.  Do we look at inspection differently when we look at the needs of the individual within the larger system of the prison?  I would love to hear discussion on that.  If any of our guests disagree with my further points, I want to make sure they get into the report in terms of recommending changes.</p></speech>

In particular, I refer to the privileges and immunities set out in Article 35 of the OPCAT.  It refers to privileges relating to arrest, seizure and that kind of thing, but that is not reflected currently in the Bill.  It is important for it to be included.</p> <p>  The Senator made a really good and nuanced point in respect of expertise.  In our submission, we referred at length to the need for the NPM and, in particular, the IPD to be able to draw on expertise .  There should be an expert panel or some other arrangement whereby it can draw on expertise as needed, in particular, perhaps, in the context of a specific visit to a prison.  More generally on the point in respect of expertise, it is useful to think about expertise in a broader sense and the individual needs such as the medical or mental health aspects.  The Senator identified a number of issues in that regard which could be useful.  Obviously, it may not be possible to include all of that within the legislation but certainly putting in place the role of experts will be important, and that is very much emphasised by all the international guidance on this.  It needs to be reflected in the Bill.</p></speech>

We are particularly taken by the recent report on custody that was produced by the Garda Inspectorate.  It addressed many of the issues raised by the Senator, such as the needs of particular groups and the very high level of detention in police custody of people who are there for mental health reasons in the broad sense.  It emphasises the point made earlier in respect of the continuum of detention.  It gets to the heart of the philosophy behind this international treaty.  It covers all places where people are detained, that is, all closed spaces where people need special protection.  At a broad level, that is the difficulty we have with the approach taken in the Bill.  The approach is quite narrow.  It is about prisons plus police detention and, whereas there is an intention to include a wider range of sectors, including mental health and so on, there is very little detail at the moment.  Of course, the Government will have the opportunity to specify much more detail as we progress, but there is no stated intention to cover many of the types of facilities that we think should be encompassed here, such as nursing homes, care homes and other facilities that are in what one might call a category of quasi-detention.  We would include direct provision in that regard as well.  The Senator is absolutely right.  Legal distinctions between different legal categories of detention do not fully capture the fact that many people experience a variety of types of institutional care at different stages in their life.</p></speech>

I will not go down the philosophical route too much but if we look at the demographics and needs of people in prisons, including mental health, poverty, education, deprivation and so on, it begs the fundamental question as to whether we should be sending them to prison in the first place.  That said, when we look at inspection, one thing that has not been mentioned so far in the meeting but is referenced in many submissions is that the expertise of people with lived experience of the criminal justice system is needed.  That is a glaring omission in the current procedures.</p> <p>  Some of the issues raised by the Senator, which she summarised very well, are answered by OPCAT.  Ratifying it and adhering to it will address many of the questions in respect of independence, resources, appointments and so on.</p></speech>

I thank her for the summation of the consensus around independence.  I highlight that also on that list I would have head 6(2), which specifically proposes that the future funds of my office premises, facilities and services would all be provided by the Minister for Justice.  It is quite detailed and prescriptive.</p> <p>  She asked about protections, exemptions and privileges, and what explicitly that would mean.  Flowing from OPCAT, there is a concern to make sure that people carrying out this monitoring function are themselves properly protected, but also that sensitive information we might be gathering is properly protected.  For example, if we are involved in the investigation of deaths in custody, we might have extremely sensitive information.  We always have sensitive information relating to the reason that a person is in prison, for example.  The protections should include immunity from search and seizure of documents, baggage and so on.  It certainly should not be the case that when Dr. O'Connell or I enter or leave a prison, a prison officer can require to inspect papers we have with us.  We provide more detail in that regard in our submission.</p> <p>  On the question of vulnerability, absolutely.  Mr. Herrick referred to the report of the Garda Inspectorate on custody, which is very good.  It is based on the standards developed by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, CPT, for which I have been working in various capacities for the best part of three decades.  In recent years, the committee has been examining the need to take a trauma-informed approach to monitoring, particularly in prisons, and explicitly to take into account trauma that may have been experienced by people before they come into prison.</p><p>When I said I was in the new prison in Limerick, which is an empty building, I should also have said that I was on E wing and I spent time there with the women who are currently detained in very poor conditions.  It is obvious in Limerick Prison, as it is in prisons holding women throughout Europe that many of those people who have ended up in prison have a history in which they have been victims themselves of domestic violence and other forms of trauma.  They carry that with them when they come into prison.  They cannot just be treated in an identical way.  In our monitoring we will bring with us people who have explicit expertise.  We will bring with us psychiatrists and medical doctors and so on-----</p></speech>

I missed the introductions and opening statements and, therefore, some of my questions might have been dealt with.  What I ask could probably be a rehash of what was said but it is important.  With regard to accountability to the Oireachtas rather than to the Department of Justice, have any of the witnesses any first-hand examples of why that is important?  I think it is important.  If it was accountable to the Oireachtas could the budget still be provided by the Department?  Would that make a difference to the operation of the system in the future?  The financial independence of the inspectorate would be important.  For example, if it was made independent and accountable to the Oireachtas, would that be enough without all the other issues being sorted out too?  What is the minimum level that would be required?</p> <p>  Head 14 deals with the inspection of places of detention and direct provision is one area that is important.  Hospitals and nursing homes are inspected by HIQA.  Is there a need for duplication or would that be important?  Will the witnesses elaborate on that and also on the need for direct provision to be included in that and how that could be classed?  The definition of "places of detention" might not be appropriate for that.</p></speech>

We refer to Article 4 of OPCAT, which defines "places of detention" as any place where persons are or may be deprived of their liberty.  In interpreting that, I will quote a short piece that is material to this from the subcommittee on the prevention of torture.  In its annual report of 2013 it stated: "the term &ldquo;places of detention&rdquo;, as found in article 4 of the Optional Protocol, should be given a broad interpretation, to include, inter alia, civil and military prisons, police stations, pretrial detention centres, psychiatric institutions and mental health centres, migrant detention centres, juvenile detention centres and social care institutions".   It goes on to say: "Therefore, an interpretation of &ldquo;places of detention&rdquo; that is limited to such traditional places of deprivation of liberty as prisons would be overly restrictive and, in the view of the Subcommittee, clearly contrary to the Optional Protocol."  It is crucial, therefore, that the committee considers those non-traditional places of detention and considers whether, factually, liberty is being deprived.  As currently constructed. the general scheme of the Bill is clearly contrary to OPCAT.  </p></speech>

Perhaps those concerns relating people in nursing homes and such facilities might be differentiated from those involuntarily detained in approved centres or otherwise, and dealt with under that legislation.  The commission has not particularly thought about that issue.  However, I agree with my colleague that it should not be limited just to prisons.</p> <p>  I will take the opportunity to acknowledge that the issue about Garda stations is important to the commission.  We have been in recent helpful discussions with the Garda about how their staff are operating certain sections of the Mental Health Act because the commission does not believe people who are suspected of having a mental disorder should be going into Garda stations.  However, if they are to continue going in, we would welcome having somebody who would have an oversight of them going in.  It is not an appropriate place.  We would welcome oversight in relation to the Garda stations.</p> <p>  With regard to nursing homes, perhaps that category could be distinguished and might be better dealt with under the forthcoming, what originally was deprivation of liberty safeguards but they have kindly changed it to protection of liberty safeguards which is more appropriate.  That would be our view on it.  </p></speech>

If, for example, you take a Garda van that is moving a prisoner from one place to another, one has an image of something moving through traffic.  However, that is not always what happens.  A van can arrive at an airport or port and then stop with the prisoners inside.  In law those prisoners can be detained there for up to 12 hours.  I would not fancy being in one of those vans for 12 hours.</p> <p>  Second, there is a different type of problem to which the Mental Health Commission has referred, namely when is a detainee a patient, and when is a detainee a detainee?  I have visited many centres for people with a disability where the entire building, contrary to fire regulations, is locked permanently, and any visitor cannot get out.  They have to ask permission to leave.  I have also visited many centres inside hospitals designated for the treatment of people with severe and enduring mental illness.  Unfortunately, those people do not benefit from prison rules.  Prison rules provide a standard that gives prisoners better conditions than those detained on hospital wards.  It gives them a right be out of their environment, a right to fresh air and a right to wear their own clothes.  Many rights in prison rules do not apply to patients held in mental health facilities designated for holding persons against their will. </p></speech>

We also think the perception of independence is extremely important.  Other bodies such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children report directly to the Oireachtas rather than to the Department itself.  That is important.</p> <p>  With regard to the point on duplication, HIQA should be designated as an MPM in its own right.  It inspects Oberstown as well as all the other things that were mentioned.  I believe that is crucial.  We hope that the committee will have HIQA and IHREC before it as well because they are key to this functioning well.</p> <p>  The budget issue is important.  Part of the reason for it to be independent is that at the moment justice agencies have to ask the Department for permission if they are spending more than &euro;25,000 on IT.  That can delay things.  When trying to get a body up and running, as we have seen with the Parole Board, for example, there needs to be that independence and freedom to allocate resources as seen fit within the body.</p></speech>

I would agree with that and underline that point.  Senator McDowell spoke of the possibility of the inspector being neutered.  I think we have seen that already, as Deputy Daly said, in relation to the reports that have been mentioned.  Just to be clear, there are three reports on the D&oacute;chas Centre, a three-day monitoring report from August 2021, a section 31(2) investigation from February 2022 and a supplementary report to that from July 2022, none of which has been published, which raises very serious concerns and questions.  I think we need to underline the essential nature of the independence and transparency in all of this.  Those reforms are very much to be welcomed.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle has pre-empted some of my questions on HIQA.  I totally agree with the point Ms Brady made about HIQA needing to be designated as an NPM, partly because of its role in respect of Trinity House and the Oberstown campus and also the secure care facilities, including Ballydowd Special Care Unit, Coovagh House and Crann&oacute;g Nua.  These are places where young people are detained by order of the High Court.  HIQA currently inspects them, so it is absolutely essential.  I was hoping to get a bit of clarity from Ms Keane on the current role of HIQA, and how HIQA and the Mental Health Commission work, for my own education.  I am unclear on that.  I have one other question.  The IPRT mentioned the Australian situation, and Dr. Garrihy has also made comparisons with other countries that have ratified OPCAT in his studies.  Is there something that we are missing in this legislation?  Is there something that other countries have done that we should be learning from so we do not have to reinvent the wheel?  Finally, I would underline the point made by the ICCL and others around the definitions in the Bill.  For me, it is essential that places like Ballydowd Special Care Unit, Crann&oacute;g Nua and Coovagh House are included in this.  There have been serious questions over these places in the past.  Perhaps that is me putting on my children's committee hat.  Young people are detained in these facilities by an order of the court.  It is essential that those facilities are included in the definition.  </p></speech>

The importance of civil society engagement is that civil society can provide information to an NPM in its relevant area.  It can promote awareness among the people because it may already have built up trust with certain detainees, and it also can provide a role in ensuring external accountability and scrutiny to the NPMs once appointed.  In terms of what the legislation could do, I had a quick check and there is no mention of civil society and non-governmental organisations in the Bill as currently drafted.  I think there is a bit of a discussion to be had and thinking to be done around exactly how that should be framed.  Looking at international models, some take the approach of civil society organisations actually being part of the NPM.  That is not the approach that we would necessarily suggest.  Rather, we would suggest civil society acting in an advisory capacity.  The Deputy mentioned Australia, which we also referenced in our opening statement.  The Australian NPM co-ordinator has been planning to establish a civil society steering group or advisory group that could help inform it.  In terms of the Bill specifically, I do not think we need to go into the full detail of that.  It is about actually recognising that.  It is something that the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, SPT, in particular, has recognised the importance of.  I think there needs to at least be some mention of it so that there is some basis for that to actually happen in the future.  IHREC, as the NPM co-ordinator, already has a role in engaging with civil society, so there is already a model there in that respect .</p></speech>

Last year, we published joint standards in relation to children.  There is a memorandum of understanding between the organisations.  It arises, in particular, in relation to community facilities.  For example, HIQA might identify that most of the people in a community facility are there because of mental health issues and it should probably come within the remit of the commission, and<i>vice versa</i>.  There is a very good relationship there in trying to identify that.  If there is a facility that should be looked after by the Mental Health Commission, then the commission can look at the appropriate resources required and <i>vice versa</i>.  That is important.  I should add that my comment earlier in relation to the protection of liberty safeguards was very much limited to nursing homes.  Obviously, if there is any facility where people are detained on an order from the court, those facilities should come within this legislation.  As the Deputy knows, our inspector is currently preparing a report on CAMHS.  There are a certain limited number of children detained under the Mental Health Act.  Many of those might cross-refer to children detained under the child care legislation.  Again, it is very important that there be more oversight.  We have sought more oversight and input in relation to the area of children in the amendment to the Mental Health Act, because the inspector's role is very limited.  Finally, I should say that the inspector's powers under the Mental Health Act are in fact quite broad, and probably slightly broader than HIQA's.  Interestingly, they are both regulatory regimes under legislation which are not very far apart in terms of years.  There are quite a lot of differences between the regulatory regimes.  We will make no comment on whether that is a good thing or a bad thing.  The lack of similarity between the two regimes is surprising.  I think that is a lesson perhaps.  I pointed out, in our submission, that even in terms of the reference to treatment and so forth, each of the different pieces of legislation define these terms differently, so the question arises of what term is going to be applied and what is going to be used.  In our view, there is quite a bit more homework to be done before this scheme can become a Bill, because there are practical issues that are going to be faced by people on a day today basis.  Apologies for going on a bit.</p></speech>

I think sometimes when we compare between jurisdictions it is better to learn from what they did wrong than what they did right.  New Zealand is an early adopter of OPCAT, and some information is coming out of there.  We have raised some of those issues today, including already being compromised by resourcing arrangements such as a lack of independence, and the inspection capacity being constrained because of the resources available.  They can only do so many inspections because they do not have the resources to do more.  An issue I mentioned already is having no people with lived experience of the criminal justice system involved.  Also, interestingly, in New Zealand there is a prison ombudsman who is the NPM for prisons and does inspections and so on.  I note that the Bill lacks any dealing with compliance mechanisms in prisons, and what the new rviesed compliance system will look like.  The question of whether a prison ombudsman should be established in Ireland is a key point that needs to be addressed.  I should also add that if OPCAT is ratified immediately, there is a period of two to three years, but in that time the expertise of the SPT can be availed of.  We can use that resource iron out as many of these details.</p></speech>

What is his view on the level of complaint it should address?  I note he has studied Australia and New Zealand comparatively.

Do they have experience of having dealt with police or prisons, or some sort of inspection in their professional careers before going into this type of work?</p></speech>

Again, how we define expertise is quite broad.  I think a better approach would be having a diverse representation, rather than putting restrictions on entry.</p><p>The other way around it could be to make it clear that people without expertise &ndash; lay people, for want of a better word &ndash; or people with lived experience are welcome to join these committees, thereby making the combination of types of expertise much more fruitful and beneficial in respect of inspection and outcomes.  However, certain resources require administrative capacity, such as report writing and interviewing or engaging in dialogue with people.  "Interviewing" may not be the right word for inspection mechanisms.  We need to be careful to ensure that we have wide representation and do not fall into the trap of narrowing it by having a prescriptive list of types of expertise needed.  To speak about the literature on this, people with experience working in the criminal justice system can become the default option.  That can mean you get retired police officers and prison officers.  That is not ideal.  It is not that these individuals are not welcome but it can be a pitfall.</p></speech>

I believe the public appointments part of this is key.  As that is in the Bill, it is accepted at this point.</p> <p>  With regard to an ombudsman, the complaints procedures are under review, so it is hard to know what the arrangement will look like.  However, the current format, which involves having five or six categories of complaints, is cumbersome and problematic, especially for people who are in prison and who do not have the resources and, often, the information on making complaints.  Not least among them are those for whom English is a second language and those who have reduced capacity in English.</p> <p>  With regard to what an ombudsman should take on, I suggest what are called category-A and category-B complaints in the Irish Prison Service.  These are serious complaints about violence, discrimination, the abuse of rights and so on.  These two categories would be the first port of call but deciding how the other complaints should be dealt with is as important as deciding what a prison ombudsman would deal with.</p></speech>

In that sense, it is policing itself.  The category of a complaint, such as an assault of a prisoner by another prisoner or gross racism directed by one prisoner at another, should not be determined inside the system from which it emanates.  The category should be decided independently &ndash; for example, by the Office of the Inspector of Prisons.</p></speech>

In our current role, we have oversight of complaints.  We can investigate circumstances around complaints but we do not investigate complaints.  We noted in our written statement that we see no role for the office of the inspectorate of places of detention in the complaints mechanism.  However, those who read our annual reports for the past five years will see that we have been saying the system is unfit for purpose, for many of the reasons referred to.  The Irish Prison Service will state there is a backlog of complaints and that having them investigated is an issue.  We have noted long delays.  We, too, take this opportunity to call for a prisons ombudsman to consider complaints, which are currently categorised by the governor even though they are independently investigated.  After an independent investigator reaches a determination, the governor has the power to overturn the decision.  It is a bit messy, so the matter is definitely worth considering.</p></speech>

We have what looks like an oversight role but all it really means is that we are informed of the more serious complaints.

I am referring to the activities of prison guards.  When I bring up the complaints system within the prison system, many prisoners turn around and say "No".  I am surprised there is a backlog because I cannot imagine what the resulting backlog would be if prisoners were empowered to make complaints.  There is a culture in which people believe there is no point in making complaints.  There is also a culture of fear with regard to making a complaint about one&rsquo;s progression.  Given the dynamic between prisoners and particular prison guards, a prisoner might feel that if he raises an issue concerning his treatment, bullying or the goading of prisoners, a certain guard will get in the way and act as an obstacle to his progression.  What oversight is there of conduct?  Beyond the structures of the Irish Prison Service, is there a role for the inspectorate regarding the conduct of the prison guards?  The prison guards are heavily unionised, and rightly so, but since the union is quite strong, the prison guards seem to comprise a protected bunch within the system in that their role has never been examined aggressively in the context of human rights abuses within the prison system.</p></speech>

Even with the very limited data we have on the oversight of the category-A complaints, there are certain patterns observable, and names of certain prison officers arise with a certain frequency.  I have been the Chief Inspector for only two months but one of my top priorities is to work with what we currently have to determine what can be done to engage effectively regarding the pattern I have described.  I will meet Ms Caron McCaffrey, the Director General of the Irish Prison Service, tomorrow to discuss that, among other matters.  The Senator is right to highlight the issue.</p></speech>

I spent four years researching prison officers in Ireland.  This is something I said when the framework for the Office of the Inspector of Prisons was being drawn up a number of years ago, but we get a lot of statistics on assaults by people in prison on each other and on staff but there are never any statistics on staff assaults on people in prison.  There is very little in the way of oversight or sanctions.  The default option appears to be to delay increments and hit people in the pocket, as officers call it.  What disciplinary measures have been taken is something that needs to be addressed but also needs to be laid out in annual reports and so on.  That is not just for abuse of people in prison but for officers sanctioned for being drunk on duty, late, absent for months on end and all these things that do not get any scrutiny whatsoever.</p></speech>

I want to try to capture their experience of day-to-day visiting because there are a number of different prison visiting committees around the country that feed into the witnesses and Dr. Conroy and Ms Ryan are representing them.  Anybody watching would benefit from hearing from them about what they do and see on visits.  I would like them to describe that to the committee.  We have covered a number of different measures here within prisons and questions around violence and so on but I would like to hear the prison visiting committees' perspective on this.</p></speech>

One of the pieces of information perhaps missing from the Bill is what standard would be used to measure, inspect and monitor a scenario or situation.  For us it is clear as we are using the prison rules, which are a statutory instrument.  The prison rules guide us as to what to look for and even to ask prisoners whether they are aware of their entitlements to certain information, special diets, particular clothes or the reasons for the stopping of a visit from a family member.  Most of what the prisoners ask for is very small.  They ask for so little.</p></speech>

If those are lost they seriously want them back.  They ask for very little.  It is only occasionally they ask for more serious things like opportunities for workshops, time out of their cell or opportunities for the whole family to visit them, which is not possible at the moment because the most important prison rules have been suspended since July 2020.</p> <p>  The suspension of the prison rules means neither the prison staff nor the governor have the right to offer prisoners the opportunities to which they are entitled.  This is quickly visible to visiting committee members.  Sometimes the governor will signal there are issues with A, B, C and D and that he or she would like us to look into them, or a prison officer will say he or she is worried about prisoner X and would we mind calling by to see where he is at.  We are not social workers but we can give a report on whether that prisoner needs extra attention or maybe should not be in the prison at all.  Maybe he should be in the Central Mental Hospital with a severe difficulty that cannot be resolved inside the prison.  He cannot receive the medication in a prison that he would be given in the Central Mental Hospital.  Those prisoners often remain hallucinating, unable to communicate, their speech is impaired and they can barely tell you what is wrong with them, yet they are in the prison.  When meeting those prisoners one knows what the job of a prison visiting committee is, which is to signal they should not be there and they must have special attention.  The idea of this Bill, under which prison visiting committee members would not be paid, would not have their reports published and would not visit too often, is quite unacceptable.</p></speech>

I visited Cloverhill with Ms Ryan a little while ago and I visited Limerick, though without the prison visiting committee.  On the communication between the governor, the people who are in prison and the staff, some of the issues Dr. Conroy is describing, such as where somebody has a mental illness that kicks off in some way, can become difficult issues to manage from a staff perspective in lots of different ways.  The role of the prison visiting committees seems to be nuanced, in the centre somewhere and in providing a good communication tool across the different structures of the prison.  It is sometimes very hard to capture that in legislation.  I ask the IPRT, Dr. Conroy and Ms Ryan and Dr. O'Connell and Mr. Kelly how should that interaction work best so we do not lose something in a new structure that captures something very nuanced in a difficult environment, while updating and improving the structures overall.</p></speech>

The visiting committee is a very unique, distinctive and effective vehicle to monitor.</p> <p>  An awful lot of what the visiting committee does depends very much on its independence.  We must retain that independence, which is what we will be talking about in the other part of the Bill.  It is vital that independence is kept because it allows us to go around and go in any time to any area of the prison.  We can walk in.  We are there weekly, fortnightly, monthly or if it is needed.  We go for celebrations, we go to the workshops, we can visit the kitchens and all the important parts.  An awful lot of bodies just do not have the time or opportunity to see the prisoners as frequently as we do and we build up trust.  Trust is built up from time and experience going in.  We function very well because we have built up trust with the governor, senior staff, with the assistant chief officers, ACOs, and perhaps with the chiefs.  We are known around the prison and have a good relationship, which is very important because what we mainly do is listen.  We listen, we observe, we have respect and we speak freely.  If you ask a prisoner how she or he is doing they will tell you.  It is absolutely no bother to them.  When they come to see us on the visiting committee they could come with a whole complex of questions or just one.  It is only through listening, experience and delving into that you find out there is actually much more they are concerned about.  Some of things, as was said earlier, are simple such as the runners, or a prisoner missing their clothes, their post or they have not spoken to their girlfriend, partner or whatever it is.  Sometimes there are reasons they do not want to engage and we must be careful with stuff like that but we walk the landings and see them face to face.  That is the uniqueness of the visiting committee.</p></speech>

Should that not have informed the direction of the legislation?  There is a real value in prison visiting committees but what we really want to see this legislation do is that reform piece, to have consistency across the board and to have transparency around them.</p><p>I have spoken to a number of people who have been appointed to prison visiting committees.  They were not even aware of what the process was because there is not necessarily a clear appointments process.  That is something that needs to be looked at.  Also, we would question whether  prison visiting committees should fall under the remit of the new inspectorate of places of detention, because that will require extra resources and extra expertise.  It will be quite resource intensive and I think we will probably lose something in terms of the independence when it comes between the two. </p><p> I have another point on that piece.  Currently, as it as it drafted, there will be a composite report for all the prison visiting committee reports that go into the inspectorate.  We would lose a lot from that because no prison is the same.  We might see some trends but we would lose the current issues that are coming up within a particular prison. </p></speech>

We can take the appointments piece as agreed, essentially because that is dealt within the Bill and because we know where that is going.  It is a matter of what it does, of independence and of interaction.  I agree with Ms Brady's distillation of the points.  Does Dr. Garrihy have a view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.1438" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joe Garrihy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022101800002#N00300"><p>It is a good question.  It is a tricky question because, as I mentioned earlier, prison visiting committees remain one of the only ways in which people in custody can bring their concerns to an independent actor.  However, we cannot ignore the prevailing perception of prison visiting committees among people in custody and among people like myself who research prisons.  There is a sense that prison visiting committees are too close to governors and to the Irish Prison Service and that independence, which is much vaunted, may not be so apparent in many of the reports or in terms of whether something has been overturned.</p> <p>  To address the Irish Penal Reform Trust's point on the writing and issuing of reports, there is a serious imbalance in the quality of reports from prison visiting committees in different prisons.  It can be hard to glean much information from a four-page annual report.  There are question marks about the ideal role, as was said, but whether that comes under the remit of the terms of OPCAT, it cannot be an NPM  because it does not fit the criteria.  Placing it under the new inspectorate may seem to remedy that but as people have mentioned, it is a serious undertaking and will require a root-and-branch reform in terms of appointments, expertise and training.  As others mentioned, often people do not know the process of being appointed and they certainly do not know the terms of reference for what exactly their role is.  These are issues that are not insurmountable but they are not small issues and I do not think that placing them under the new inspectorate is the quick fix to that.  </p></speech>

The value and the role of visiting committees are indisputable.  They are listeners, among other things, and they hear the voices of prisoners directly.  That has a huge value in and of itself.  They are a community contact for prisoners and we should not lose that.</p> <p>  If it would be of help to the committee, specifically on part 2 of the general scheme or on head 13, we address this on page 19 of our submission.  We neither have an aspiration as an inspectorate to be involved in establishing a visiting committee for each prison, nor do we think that it is appropriate that the visiting committee should effectively report to the inspectorate.  Head 13(12) could be read as implying that the visiting committees would somehow be accountable to the inspectorate of places of detention.  That is not something on which we were ever consulted and we do not think it is appropriate.  We think it would impinge upon their independence.  </p> <p>  Finally, under head 13(13), the idea that our inspectorate would take all of these disparate elements from different visiting committee reports and somehow edit them into one composite report is illusory.  The resources that we would have to put into that in terms of liaison with the visiting committee's fact checking, editing etc. would be disproportionate to the quality of the outcome.  As far as our inspectorate is concerned, Part 2 of the general scheme of the Bill requires extensive revision to capture the essence of the listening, the community contact and empathy rapport of the visiting committees, without subjecting them to an accountability mechanism that is not sought by the inspectorate.  </p></speech>

It is on the issue of the visiting committees and relates to when they go in.  I am wondering about the interpretation and the having a good grasp and understanding of any sorts of complaints by members of communities who do not have any English.  They may potentially be sometimes be relying on other people within the prison system who have some English.  Then they have to divulge the complaint to somebody else and have to trust them to pass that on.  If there are any issues in a health setting, they have to do that as well.  I wonder whether there is a need for this committee to look at recommendations around the right to interpretation in relation to human rights, especially with the visiting committees or the inspectorate going in.  Do they have a good grasp of what the complaints might be from other communities based on any language barriers or is there a need to address that?</p></speech>

It would run by telephone into the prisons, or even into other places within the criminal justice system.  These telephone interpretations work very well and I have had involvement in them in England in the borough of Newham.  The Irish Prison Service has an obligation to provide confidentiality and privacy to members who wish to speak not just to the visiting committee, but they may wish to speak to a chaplain or an emir as well.  Such a service should be available to them.  At the moment, other prisoners oblige by offering to translate but that is actually very wrong because you should not be disclosing personal information to another prisoner.  It is quite wrong.  The other prisoner could be of a religion or an ethnicity that is different from the prisoner who does not speak English.  The translation issue is therefore crucial.</p></speech>

Approximately a year and a half ago, our basic booklets were in English and Irish but they are translated into eight other languages as well.  There has to be more documentation translated.</p> <p>  Also, we have increased the availability of the translation services.  If the inspectorate goes out and finds people who are not voluntarily detained and who do not have access, they address it with the staff on the day.  I cannot imagine being in another country, not being able to speak that language, not being able to express oneself and relying on somebody else.  The issue of Ukrainians has recently come up, because different people came from different parts of Ukraine.  We have different people coming from different parts of Africa.  Some of those might speak French, but the approved centre will have them written down as one thing, but in fact they speak a different language because they are from a different part of the country.  It is essential, because if you are to give these people a voice, you have to give them a proper voice.  </p></speech>

We inspected all the prisons last year through the Covid-19 lens and I can say that maybe five, six or seven times, we were making recommendations on access to information for foreign nationals and non-English-speaking people in prison.</p> <p>  Resettlement is also an area in which that is strongly needed.  When people are waiting, when they are talking to Irish Association for Social Inclusion Opportunities, IASIO, officers and when they are trying to get out, there is no way for them to communicate about where they are supposed to go.  This has therefore become central to our work.  In every inspection now, we give a small booklet to the prisoners to share the findings.  It comes in ten languages.</p><p>We have information booklets for prisoners in eight languages.  We are starting to survey prisoners using digital tablets.  It comes in ten languages.  Everything we do is to try to push that because our foreign national prison population will only grow.  The recommendations we have been making we cannot make enough.  We should definitely all continue to make that recommendation.</p></speech>

Foreign nationals were committed for up to 14 days without any knowledge of where they were or why they were sitting there for 14 days.  In response to our recommendation, they started to provide information on the committal process, the number of days, when one gets tested and those types of things.  We have been engaging in a monitoring process on those recommendations.  Shortly, members will start to see what the IPS has been doing and then we go back in and access its monitoring of the recommendations.  There is movement but could be much more.</p></speech>

This is one of the key findings that came out of it.  We spoke to over 100 people of the 560-odd in prison at the moment.  Language permeated every aspect of their existence in prison and restrained them in many ways.</p> <p>  I note that the IPS has put on record that it agrees to translate the prison rules and other documents into many languages.  It has been said at a conference, though I do not know if this will happen, that it has put out a tender for translation services.  In places like the Netherlands, there is a dedicated phone service so a person can pick up a phone and there is a translator at the other end.  It is not to say there are no issues with that implementation but there are things in place.</p> <p>  We also have international obligations.  European prison rules say people in prison must be furnished with a copy of the prison rules and other documents in a language they understand.  The vast majority of people who did not have a high capacity in English that we spoke to never received any prison rules, not to mention in a language they understood.  That translates - no pun intended - into repatriation applications, complaints and other aspects that are basic elements of life.  The translation issue will get bigger and needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

Prisoners find themselves in this position struggling against issues of translation, but their experience of the justice system began in the Garda station and moved through the courts.  What was their experience through that?  We have had sessions here with people talking about the difficulty of translation in the courts.  It is a much broader thing which the committee needs to look at through the entire journey of the justice system.</p></speech>

They have not been charged with anything and there is no place for them in the prison system.  That needs to be addressed at some stage.  There are many people in prison who should not be there anyway, because of mental illness and otherwise.  There is a wide spectrum that needs to be looked at.  Many people are not suitable for prison and it is the last place they should be.</p></speech>

One is on going back to Limerick Prison.  This speaks to some of the issues of whether or not people should be in prison and the issues behind that.  I think Dr. O'Connell wanted to come in on that point.  I visited the new Limerick prison which will open in January to see what it was like and it is an excellent facility.  Chief among the facilities is a dedicated rape crisis counsellor, which is of huge significance in a women's prison.  There are few people who end up there who do not come from a background of significant trauma.  There is also a dentist, another significant support for women in prison.</p> <p>  We have talked about short sentences and I agree with all the points made.  Short sentences are pointless from the perspective of the State because there is no opportunity to begin education or training programmes in a meaningful way.  They do not deliver anything for the State or the person in prison.</p> <p>  Women in prison must be among the most vulnerable, particularly women from the Traveller community.  They have not been mentioned today and I want to highlight them.  The IPRT published good figures on how disproportionate their experience was in being represented in the prison community, the circumstances through which they had got there and various things that had happened to bring them to that point.  I refer anybody watching to the IPRT figures on that.  I spent two hours with women in Limerick Prison having sandwiches and talking about the issues they faced, that is, the rape crisis centre, dentistry and women from the Traveller community.  They are in very difficult circumstances, notwithstanding what else happened in their lives.  I think Dr. O'Connell wanted to come in on trauma.</p></speech>

It should be on a mixed-staffing basis but the high-contact points should be run by women.  In areas where there are private interactions, it should be women running those positions.  That is not currently the case.  It used to be the case that people assigned to work in women's prisons were trained in gender.  I think every prison staff member should be trained in gender because we all have genders.  Gender-based violence should be understood across the spectrum.  There is no training in gender sensitivity for prison officers, even when they are moved to a women's prison.  I wanted to flag those key points.</p></speech>

First, we talked about new prisons earlier and the opening of this prison is welcome in some ways, but it increases the number of women in prison in Ireland to nearly 200.  That is an escalation in prison numbers for women and not the direction we should be going.  Second, the D&oacute;chas Centre was state-of-the-art 30 years ago and I would argue it has fallen into disrepair and disuse.  Many of the things much vaunted about the new prison were present in D&oacute;chas and are not functioning now or in stasis.</p></speech>

We look forward to the new prison and the issues about why women are there or should not be there.  Mental health issues and others are separate to that.  I thank Dr. Garrihy.</p> <p>  Though the Department representatives are here as observers, is there anything they would like to clarify for us now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-18a.1455" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lisa Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022101800002#O01200"><p>We are happy to try our best.  As we are here as observers, we had not prepared speaking notes but want to convey that we welcome the submissions, comments and questions from the committee.  The pre-legislative scrutiny process is timely and important as drafting of the Bill commences.</p> <p>  I will make a few points to try to expand on or explain the policy intent behind some of the heads.  A number of questions came up a few times.  I stress that the general scheme heads are always scant in detail.  That is, unfortunately, how it works.  The detail will come in the drafting.  Questions around definitions, clarification, functions, etc., will be teased out with the expertise of the Office of the Attorney General in the drafting process.  The report of the pre-legislative scrutiny will feed into that.  </p> <p>  The Department recognises this is long-awaited legislation.  It is Government policy not to ratify international instruments unless primary legislation is in place.  We have been engaging with the sub-committee on prevention of torture, SPT, at the UN, in co-ordination with the Department of Foreign Affairs, and will do so after enactment on a more formal basis and with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC. </p> <p>  I will give more background to some broader questions that came up a few times.</p><p>It is the Government's intention that all places of detention will be covered.  This Bill is specifically on the justice sector but one will see in the heads a reference to the Minister for Health, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p><p> Independence came up a lot.  It is the Department's intention that the Office of the Inspector of Prisons will be functionally independent.  The obligations are set out and I recognise that we need to make them clearer in drafting.  The inspectorate has to report to the Oireachtas and be accountable to it, but not on policy because policy accountability is for the Government, including the Minister.  With regard to the functions and administration of the inspectorate, the inspector will be accountable to the Oireachtas.  That is clearly set out.  We will probably need to ensure it is much clearer in the drafting.</p><p> Resourcing was also raised a number of times.  The previous inspector commissioned, in 2018, an independent review into the office, its structures and how it would look.  That review recommended that the office should stay under the Department of Justice.  That is the basis for the head in this regard and the underlying policy on maintaining the office of the inspectorate under the Department.  Having a separate Vote would, in the words of the independent consultant, cause an undue administrative and financial burden on the office.  It was claimed that the benefits of remaining in the Department outweigh any disbenefits, including perceived independence issues.  Again, this was all informing the policy behind the relevant provisions in the heads.</p><p> The Department has sought to increase resources to the office over recent years.  There was a quite significant increase between 2020 and last year.  Once the legislation is enacted, the Department will continue to negotiate with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure additional increases and resources to ensure the office can carry out all its functions.</p><p> Appointments came up at one point.  I must make it clear that appointments are made by way of public competition through the Public Appointments Service, not the Minister.</p><p> We will certainly take on board the point on engaging with civil society.  There is definitely room to consider that in the drafting and after enactment.</p><p> On the prison complaints system, work is ongoing on drafting secondary legislation that will provide for a whole new prisoner complaints system through the amending of prison rules.  That is being informed by recommendations of a previous Inspector of Prisons.  It is at quite an advanced stage.</p><p> On the prison visiting committees, there has been a very interesting, useful discussion.  We understand the sequencing was unfortunate.  The Bill was not published; it was just the general scheme, but the Bill, which is now to be drafted, will be informed by the outcome of extensive public consultation and inputs and submissions by the various stakeholders concerning the prison visiting committees process.  This will be in the coming weeks and months.</p><p> I hope that gives some clarification.  We are certainly looking forward to the report of the committee and to determining how we can act on its recommendations.</p></speech>
