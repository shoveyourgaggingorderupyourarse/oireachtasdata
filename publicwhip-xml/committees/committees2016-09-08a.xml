    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCJ2016090800002#A00200"><p>I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones, as they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  Television coverage and web streaming will also be adversely affected.</p><p>I have received apologies from Senator McDowell, but I welcome everyone else to the first meeting of the joint committee.  I congratulate the newly elected Members who are joining us.  It is a great honour for me to Chair this committee and I look forward to working with everyone positively and constructively.</p><p>We are meeting European Commission Vice President Andrus Ansip regarding the digital single market.  I propose that, after our meeting with him in public session, we hold a short private session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I propose that Mr. Ansip speak for ten to 15 minutes, followed by a questions and answers session in which each member may ask a question or make a comment not exceeding three minutes.  I am conscious that Mr. Ansip needs to attend another meeting at 1 p.m., so we might keep that in mind.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The purpose of this meeting is to discuss with Mr. Ansip the progress in the completion of the digital single market at EU and national levels.  Its completion has been identified by the Commission as one of its top ten political priorities and Ireland is committed to playing its part in the completion of such a single market.  The value of the digital single market to the European economy is estimated to be approximately &euro;400 billion per annum.  As such, it is hoped that Ireland's economy will in turn benefit from its completion.  This meeting presents an opportunity for the committee to get an update from Mr. Ansip on the progress to date and Ireland's performance in the digital single market compared with other member states.  Ireland is ranked eighth of the 28 in terms of digitalisation and is performing better than the EU average, but it is improving at a slower rate than the EU as a whole.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Ansip and we are delighted to have him present.  We look forward to his opening state.  I wish to draw his attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if he is directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continues to do so, he is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise him that any submission or opening statement that he makes to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Ansip to make his opening statement.  He may wish to introduce his officials.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrus Ansip" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCJ2016090800002#A00300"><p>I thank the honourable Chairman and members of the joint committee.  It is my great pleasure to be here.  I have a written opening statement, but it would be artificial to spend ten minutes on it.  For that reason, I will place this written statement on the Internet.  Members already have it in paper.</p><p>I will reflect instead on the issues mentioned by the Chairman.  </p><p> Ireland is digitally well advanced compared to the rest of Europe.  The Commission's digital economy and society index ranks it in eighth place among the 28 member states.  In terms of e-commerce and small and medium-sized enterprises, Ireland ranks first in the European Union.  Its performance, in percentage terms, is twice the average in the European Union.  Some 32% of Irish small and medium-sized enterprises are selling online.  The average in this regard across the European Union is 16%.  In terms of cross-border sales, the story is the same, with Ireland ranked in first place across the European Union.  </p><p> The EU Single Market was created 20 years ago.  Every country has benefited from the Single Market, including Ireland.  However, it is a single market in physical terms only, as a digital single market does not exist.  We must create a digital single market.  According to analysis prepared by the European Parliament in 2014, the cost to Europe of not having a European digital market is huge.  Some &euro;415 billion per annum is being lost.  The amount being lost is set to increase rather than decrease in the years ahead.  As such, there is an urgency to a digital single market.  We are not, unfortunately, progressing quickly enough.  In 2010, four Prime Ministers issued a letter to their colleagues in which they proposed the creation of a digital single market in the European Union.  A decision was made to have a digital single market in place across the European Union in 2015.  It is now 2016 and all we have in place is a digital single market strategy.  We need to speed up.</p><p> Last May, we launched the digital single market strategy.  On the basis of this strategy, we made our first proposal last December.  This year is delivery year.  During this year, we would like to make all the proposals based on the digital single market strategy.  Last December, we proposed to allow portability of content.  An important detail in the digital single market strategy is that currently 20% of Europeans spend at least ten days a year in another EU member state and while there they would like to have access to their legally bought digital content but because of copyright restrictions they cannot do so.  Technically, this is not a big issue.  Some 20% of Internet users in the European Union are using VPNs to get access to digital content.  Some 68% of film viewers state that they are using free downloads to get access to movies.  VPNs are not free of charge.  It costs up to &euro;10 per month and &euro;20 per three months.  Many users think that because they are paying for a VPN they are not doing anything wrong, but authors are not being remunerated.  For this reason, we proposed portability of content.  I would welcome the support of the committee for this proposal.  </p><p> In February, we made our proposal for the 700 megahertz spectrum.  As this measure is technical in nature, it must be dealt with by parliaments.  Currently, we can only dream about 5G in terms of the Internet, remote surgery and so on.  Without access to the 700 megahertz spectrum it will never be a reality.  It is proposed that the 700 megahertz band will be divided into two parts, with the upper side being made available to telecom companies and the lower band being made available to broadcasters for wireless microphones and so on.  Some member states believe that the target of achieving clarity by 2020 is too ambitious and that 2022 is more realistic.  The year 2030 is also realistic.  We know, for example, that South Korea will start using major elements of 5G during the Winter Olympics in 2018.  At a G7 meeting in Japan I heard that Japan will use 5G during the Olympic Games in 2020.  Ericsson and Teliosonera have stated that they will commence the use of major elements of 5G in two towns, Stockholm and Tallinn, in 2018.  If we do not speed up the process of providing access to the 700 megahertz spectrum we will find ourselves lagging behind.  If this new generation network is not made available we will continue to only dream about apps created on the basis of those new technologies.  We will know theoretically how it works, but practice creates the best ideas.  It may seem as though we are talking about peanuts, but in 2014, 1.8 million jobs across the European Union were in the app industry.  According to analysis, in 2018 there will be 4.8 million jobs in the app industry alone across the European Union and 3 million associated jobs.  A 700 megahertz band is necessary not only for that industry but also for the car industry, remote surgery and other applications.  We must do our outmost to get clarity in this regard.  </p><p> As I said earlier, Ireland ranks first in the European Union in the area of e-commerce.  However, as members will be aware, the e-commerce market across the European Union is fragmented.  The European Commission organised a mystery shopping survey.  According to this survey, 2% of people who wanted to access websites to purchase goods and services from another member state were blocked from doing so.  One might say that was not a big problem, but 27% of those who could access websites were unable to register because their IP addresses were wrong.  Of those who were able to register, 32% experienced delivery problems, which are natural problems to which we must also find solutions.  Twenty-six percent of people who wanted to buy goods and services from another country experienced problems making payments.  Although we have SEPA in the European Union, some credit cards were not accepted because they were issued in the wrong countries, including Estonia.  Thirty-six percent of people who tried to buy goods and services from another EU member state were unable to conclude their purchases successfully.  We must abolish unjustified geo-blocking.</p><p>In the coming weeks we will make our second copyright proposal and also the telecom proposal.  I know Ireland would like to cover the country with a high-speed fibre network.  According to my understanding, access to the Internet must be one of those fundamental rights and we must do it.  As we know, especially in those areas where population density is not so high, there is not as much tough competition.  With the market conditions, telecom service providers are not as ready to invest in those fibre networks.  It means we must create certain better conditions to attract those investments.  I would like to say we are trying to turn Europe in the same direction as Ireland is moving already.</p><p> The second copyright package proposal will be quite a large proposal, with different issues dealing with exceptions relating to education, handicapped people, text and data mining.  We have to make text and data mining available for all the scientists across the European Union.  Today in the majority of EU member states, scientists cannot use text and data mining.  We would like to provide better access to digital content for our people.  Our aim is to double cross-border access to digital content for our people.  It is the aim of our second copyright proposal.</p><p> At the end of this year we will also make a free data flows proposal.  We must create an environment in the European Union where free data flows will be possible in the Union and we will not always have to face data authorisation threats.  I thank the committee for inviting me and I am ready to take questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCJ2016090800002#C00200"><p>Before I ask my colleagues to contribute, I have one question relating to cybersecurity.  Reports have indicated cybercrime is on the rise in Ireland.  Does the witness have a particular view as to whether Ireland is more at risk in this regard as opposed to other member states or European counterparts?  Will the witness expand on the role of the European Cyber Security Organisation in liaising with national bodies and member states?  Does the witness have any comment on the privacy shield between the European Union and the United States?  Does the privacy shield offer sufficient protection to EU citizens with respect to data and privacy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrus Ansip" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCJ2016090800002#C00300"><p>Thank you for those questions.  I will begin by addressing the privacy shield.  The aim of the Safe Harbor principles was really good as it was to protect Europeans' data.  In 2000, we did not have any kind of idea what kind of technical instruments for mass surveillance, for example, would be around in 2013.  In 2013, there was the understanding that the Safe Harbor principles were not safe enough.  We saw information from the likes of Mr. Snowdon and so on and in 2013 we started to negotiate with the Americans.  We got a court ruling when we were almost there with an agreement; with the ruling we had the understanding that we had to continue the negotiations.  We have concluded those negotiations.</p> <p>  The EU-US privacy shield, according to my understanding, is a much better and future-proofed solution because it has a review clause.  This will be a process and we do not have to wait for another 13 years to understand that we might have some kind of problem.  If we have problems, we can immediately fix them.  Since 1 August this year, companies have been able to join the EU-US privacy shield.  We already have approximately 100 companies that have joined the privacy shield, with 190 companies in the process in the United States.  There are approximately 250 companies that have prepared the application for joining the privacy shield.  It is proceeding, according to my understanding, as we expected.  It is definitely needed.  We have to allow free data flows not only across the European Union, but also between the European Union and our partners.  At the same time we must protect everybody's privacy.</p> <p>  Cybersecurity is an area where no single member state is able to deal separately with the issues.  We have to co-operate.  I can give an example from the country I know best.  In 2007, we moved a Bronze Soldier war monument from the city centre to a cemetery and were faced with riots over two nights.  In some cities they have those kind of riots after every football game where a local team loses but for us it was totally new.  We also faced cyber attacks.  With fruitful co-operation between the national computer emergency response teams, we were able to cut the majority of those attacks before they crossed our borders.  We were able to deal with those cyber attacks because of co-operation.  Now we have a network and information security directive and this is also about co-operation and transparency.  It is not about making information about those cyber attacks public but it is important for stakeholders and those dealing with cybersecurity to be informed.</p> <p>  We also launched a public-private partnership proposal for cybersecurity and we expect to get &euro;1.8 billion per year of investment for the area soon.  I invite Irish companies to join this process.  It is really important to protect cyberspace and to do this we must co-operate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCJ2016090800002#C00400"><p>I welcome the witness and his staff.  I have two short questions.  Mr. Ansip has correctly referred to the importance of creating the digital single market and the fact that we are in eighth place is good.  We are improving at a slower rate.</p><p>Collectively, the national broadband plan will be rolled out over the next couple of years.  I hope it will help to move us forward and to maintain the pace of growth.</p><p>  Roaming charges are due to be abolished on 15 June 2017.  Ireland is the only country that will have a problem, due to the unfortunate active partition of the country with its artificial Border.  Britain will still be in the European Union as its act of political kamikaze will not be completed by 15 June 2017 and for some time afterwards but Brexit will be completed.  How can we safeguard roaming charges in Northern Ireland?  If an Irish person travels to Estonia or Romania he or she will be protected against increased mobile phone roaming charges.  If one travels a few miles up the road on this island, as Britain will be outside the EU, a mobile phone user could be faced with increased roaming charges.  I need not tell the committee the effect such charges will have on business, commerce, and people who trade North and South.  Most political parties and businesses are trying increase North-South trade.  </p><p> My next questions are on geo-blocking.  Who will create active geo-blocking?  BBC has a programme called "Spotlight" that is available in the North but not in the South.  Who is responsible for this situation?  Is it a free market issue?  How can we remove geo-blocking?  One can appreciate that people living on a small island comprised of a little over 6 million people need access to the same media sources.  If people are not charged extra for mobile phone usage when they travel to Estonia, Bulgaria or Romania then the same situation should exist in Belfast, Tyrone and Fermanagh.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCJ2016090800002#D00600"><p>I welcome the Commissioner Ansip.  I thank him for his presence and for the work that he has done to date.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to his prepared remarks, in particular to his second statement that says "Ireland is digitally well advanced compared with the rest of Europe."  I want him to know that such advancement is not by accident and is the result of a definite policy by successive Governments, with much of it set around attracting high-end ICT companies.  We have worked in harmony with the education system to develop a tech-savvy society.</p> <p>  Yesterday, we had ten hours of discussion in the Parliament on the situation that has emerged from the decision by Commissioner Vestager to find against Ireland's tax law from a competition perspective.  I do not expect Mr. Ansip to answer for the Commissioner, but it would be remiss of me not to raise the issue with him in light of his being the Vice President of the European Commission.  I wish to share with him our frustration, annoyance and concern about what my party and others believe to be an overreach by the Commission in straying from competition policy into an area of taxation policy.  Mr. Ansip is well aware that taxation policy is a competence of member states.  It is not pooled or shared through any of the various instruments that we have agreed on over the life of the European Union.  We vehemently disagree with the position taken by the competition Commissioner because we believe it has the capacity to impact on our ability, in the first instance, to determine and define our own policy on taxation.  It is difficult for us, as a peripheral State in Europe, to attract foreign investment and the kind of tech-savvy companies that have allowed us to emerge, grow and compete with what might be considered mainland Europe.  I want Mr. Ansip to take my comments and share them with his Commission colleagues in due course.  I want him to recognise that it is the will of the Parliament of Ireland to vigorously defend its right to set its own tax policy.  Obviously, that will happen now as a result of the decision taken by the Government to defend against the decision of the Commission.</p> <p>  I wish to comment on a matter that is more relevant to the brief of the Vice President, which follows on from the important point made by Deputy Stanley about the elimination of roaming charges.  The European Commission has done good work on this matter.  The measure has helped to establish and build on the freedoms that have already been established across Europe.  It also helps to develop trade.  In the past number of days I read in an article that the Commission has decided, or proposed, usage limits for free roaming.  If that is the case then I think the measure would be a retrograde step.  I ask Mr. Ansip to clarify the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1397" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCJ2016090800002#D00700"><p>Earlier I indicated my wish to comment because what I want to say is relevant to the latter comments made by Deputy Dooley.  I also appreciate that Mr. Ansip would like to answer our two sets of questions together.  I welcome the European Commission Vice President.  It is good to have him with us and I appreciate his initial presentation.</p> <p>  I completely support the view put forward by Deputy Dooley.  His view is reflective of a large majority of the Parliament, and there is a sense of frustration and alarm.  The point was well made by one of the commentators that were the level of proposed imposition on Ireland, or the proposed amount of money that merited collection, to be implemented then the productivity of the Apple workers in Ireland would be beyond anything else on a worldwide scale and in the realms of science fiction.  Therefore, the sum involved is unrealistic on that level and on a number of levels.  We have operated a very transparent tax system that has been discussed at a number of levels within the EU.  It has been defended by the Taoiseach at EU level and discussed openly there.  We feel frustrated about the matter and I support the concerns expressed by Deputy Dooley.  I agree with him that it would be remiss of us not to have that view expressed.  Placing the onus on this State to collect the money is an unrealistic proposition.  It is crazy and unacceptable, and we disagree with the proposal.  This matter is not specifically the remit of the Vice President, but we had to make him aware of it.</p> <p>  I have two questions that I want to address to the brief of the Vice President.  For us to achieve a single digital market across Europe, the big need in Ireland is to have access to high-speed broadband across the country.  Large chunks of rural Ireland do not have access to high-speed broad due to population, topography, a lack of infrastructure and a number of other factors.  We are now in the process of trying to rectify the situation.  In the process of doing so, we intend to use what we call the gap funding model.</p><p>The private sector will ultimately get ownership of the network in the 37,000 households that will need support from the State to access broadband, but it will be very important to control costs.  Mr. Ansip might comment on that, regarding the role the EU and the Commission might play in controlling the cost the private sector could impose on individual consumers.  High-speed broadband is so vital to all these areas of rural Ireland.  Before we talk about e-commerce, education, local business or anything of that nature, the fact that so many people are trying to access education locally as well must be recognised.  It is a huge issue.</p><p> To move very briefly to e-commerce, there is tremendous untapped potential for Internet sales and we have a long way to go.  Obviously, we have to get broadband in place across the country.  However, I would be interested in the Mr. Ansip's comment on the steps we could take to increase Internet sales further.  We are not benefiting enough nationally from them yet, but there is growth in that area.</p></speech>

From working with people from the Estonian Government over the years, my experience has been that Estonia is a very enterprising country that has very close ties with Ireland.  In such circumstances, Mr. Ansip, as an Estonian politician, is very welcome.  I agree with his comments on the benefits from advancing this digital single market.  I represent a constituency, Dublin Bay South, that is a technology centre, not just home to international companies but also local ones.  We have everything to gain in Europe by working together to be technology makers rather than taking from Asia and America, which will end up being the case if we do not work together.</p> <p>  I disagree with my two colleagues.  There are different views in the Parliament on the Apple tax issue, but I will not go into the details of that.  I will just ask two questions.  On tax, does Mr. Ansip believe that - whatever about the retrospective issue - there are now in place tax and transfer pricing rules that allow us to develop e-commerce without that becoming a fundamental difficulty?</p> <p>  My second question is very specific and I do not expect them to get into the politics of it, but our guests would recognise that the possibility of a Brexit has major consequences for the development of e-commerce, particularly in this country, given our Border and our relationship with the UK.  Incredibly complex issues immediately come to mind in terms of how we will manage e-commerce with the UK in a Brexit situation, how we will deal with media providers to this country that are based in the UK and also satellite providers - the regulation of which will have to be changed in the event of Brexit - and how we would manage the fact, given that we were talking about cyber security earlier, that everything we do on the Internet is subject to surveillance by the UK Government because of our physical location.  My question is not about the witnesses' opinion on what are sensitive issues, but whether the Commission will be able to provide advice for the likes of parliamentary committees such as this, given the technicalities, complexities and all those related issues, when it comes to understanding what is happening in any future negotiations.  Can the Commission provide informal advice on some of the technical rules we have to understand if we are to understand the implications of any negotiation process?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrus Ansip" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCJ2016090800002#E00400"><p>Thank you very much.  Some of those questions are quite complicated.  Two of them relate to the United Kingdom.  The official position of the European Commission is that we will not start to negotiate until the United Kingdom triggers the Article 50 process.  For me, it is absolutely clear that we must have good, pragmatic relations between the European Union and the United Kingdom after the latter leaves the Union.  We have to find the best solution for the European Union and for the United Kingdom.  There will be so many very practical issues, including roaming and how to continue with those roaming surcharges and phone calls in future.  It is too early to predict or to start the negotiating process.  The UK must trigger the Article 50 process first.</p> <p>  We started to abolish roaming surcharges in the European Union in 2007, but it has been a very complicated process.  In the United States, people do not remember roaming surcharges any more, but in the European Union we have a generation of people who know how dangerous it is to use one's mobile devices when travelling in some other EU member states.  Even knowing that this business model, based on roaming surcharges, is not sustainable, it is quite difficult for the service provider to change its unsustainable business model.  If service providers have to say to their customers, "Don't use my services when travelling in some other EU member states", that is not a sustainable business model.  If people do not care about this and continue to use those services while travelling in some other countries, they can easily start to hate those service providers because of the bills they have to pay.  Let us remember where we started from a little more than a year ago.  During the Latvian Presidency, we had a "5 + 5 + 5" proposal.  On five days per year, one would get five minutes of phone calls on a "roam like at home" basis.  Not per day, not free of charge, but "roam like at home".  Then five SMS messages per day during the five days on a "roam like at home" basis and then 5 megabytes.  If a person opened their iPad and there were some kind of automatic download or they went on Facebook and there were videos playing, they could lose up to &euro;100.  European citizens had to be happy about the "5 + 5 + 5".  We had really tough negotiations and then the decision was made.  Since May this year, those roaming surcharges have dropped once again by 75%.  I would like to say people were quite happy about this decision during the holidays.  The decision was made that from 15 June next year those roaming surcharges will be totally abolished, but we promised to agree on wholesale reform.</p> <p>  We also promised to implement the fair use principles.  Why are those fair use principles needed?  There is a situation where people from some countries visit southern European countries more often than people from southern European countries visit Scandinavia, for example.  In those countries, the people are not ready to pay much more for domestic calls or data just because of roaming.  We have to set some kind of safeguards to avoid free-riding.  The Commission has not made a decision in this area yet.  Those articles were about a proposal about consultations, which will last for three months and this is about safeguards.  It was also written that, as a minimum, 90 days of surcharge-free roaming phone calls will be covered.  I am sure the big companies that have started this practice already will continue.  They will say that during the entire year there will be no more roaming surcharges.  Even for those, safeguards will be needed.</p><p>It can happen theoretically that people from countries where prices are at a very low level will subscribe to and consume these services in countries where labour costs are at a much higher level.  Some kind of safeguards will be needed.  I do not want to protect this concrete figure of 90 days.  I do not think there is a big difference between 90 days and 180 days.  A 90-day figure will cover 99.9% of all these cases.  We can discuss those issues.  There has to be compromise.  I remind the committee that service providers and member states were not ready to move on from the 5+5+5 proposal.  Strong support is coming from the European Parliament, but it is not enough.  We need to have consensus among member states.  Then the European Commission and the European Parliament will have to share the same understanding.  I think Europeans deserve the total abolition of roaming surcharges.  I am sure it will happen in practice on 15 June 2017.</p><p> On the geoblocking of programmes, we will make our second copyright reform proposal during the next couple of weeks.  I am not ready to say exactly when this will happen.  We would also like to propose some changes in the cable and satellite directive.  We would like to extend the country of origin principle to IPTV.  This would mean that broadcasters with clear rights in one country will be able to send their content through satellite or IPTV to Ireland so that people here can enjoy it.  This is our aim.  The proposal is not ready yet.  We are in the process.  According to the broadcasters, 65% more content will be available across borders if we implement the changes in this plan.  I do not think that is enough.  We can do more.  I think we can double the volume of content that is available for our people across borders.  According to our proposal, we will protect creators and will provide better and fairer remuneration to them.</p><p> I would like to speak about Ireland and digital development.  I was the mayor of the second-largest town in Estonia for six years.  I spent nine years as Prime Minister of Estonia.  Ireland was always a really good example for me and for all Estonians.  When we made our reforms in Estonia, we copied the Irish example.  Ireland's very liberal model of the economy was a dream of every Estonian.  Estonia is now doing relatively well in digital media, for example.  According to this index, we are ranked seventh.</p></speech>

Tax rates are at quite a low level.  We practically did not set any deductions, exceptions or exemptions.  It has to be simple, transparent and easy for everybody to understand.</p> <p>  On the Apple case, I do not think I am able to add anything new to the arguments that have been made available over the past week.  I think the situation will be a little different when we publish this case.  It is up to the Irish Government to push the button in that regard.  The Commission is ready to do it right now.  The Irish Government has to be absolutely sure that we will not make public any confidential tax or business secrets, etc.  It takes time.  More legal clarity will be really good.  I am absolutely sure this case will provide such clarity for Ireland, the EU and the whole world.</p> <p>  I would like to speak about co-investment in access to high-speed broadband.  I have already described our plans to attract investment to build up fibre networks in rural areas where population density is not high enough to attract such investment on the basis of today's rules.  My understanding is that Ireland is moving in the right direction, as I said at the outset, but we have to turn the whole of Europe in the same direction.  I would like to protect those first movers or first investors.  Competition has to stay as a central principle, but in some cases we have to protect those who take huge risks.  I will give an example.  The service provided by the incumbent telecoms service provider in a town in one western European country was not good at all.  The incumbent company was not prepared to improve the situation, so local investors decided to invest to create a better Internet service.  The incumbent then decided that new competitors were not needed.  Of course it had enough funds to kill the local initiative.  I do not think that is fair.  We have to find something to protect first movers.  I repeat that competition has to stay as a general principle.</p> <p>  When we make our telecoms proposal in the coming weeks, we will set new goals, aims and objectives for the EU.</p><p>These include achieving gigabit connection for main social drivers and a 100 Mbps connection for all households, etc.  Investment of at least &euro;500 billion will be needed to achieve this objective.  According to analyses, if we do not change our rules and try to attract more investment, there will be a gap.  According to some concrete analyses, this will amount to &euro;155 billion of the &euro;500 million investment required.  We have to at least try to cover this gap.  As I stated, the European Commission's aim is the same as Ireland's aim.  Ireland wishes to provide a high-speed network throughout the country and we aim to cover the entire territory of the European Union with a high-speed network. </p></speech>

Mr. Du&scaron;an Matulay" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016090800002#E00300"><p>It is my great pleasure and honour to join the distinguished Chairman and members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs of the Oireachtas here today.  The role of national parliaments has increased significantly since the Lisbon treaty.  Interparliamentary co-operation is a key ingredient of an accountable EU.  It enhances legitimacy and reduces democratic deficit.  COSAC is an important platform of discussion among parliamentarians.  I know the members of this committee were not able to join the first COSAC meeting in July in Bratislava  I hope they will be able to join their colleagues at the plenary meeting in November, especially as the voice of small countries is very important.<br/><br/>As the Slovak ambassador to Ireland, I feel especially privileged to present the priorities of the first Slovak Presidency in the Irish Parliament because the EU journey of my country started in Ireland.  It is a historic fact that in 2004, the biggest EU enlargement ever took place in Ireland and became a hallmark of the Irish EU Presidency.  It was the Oireachtas which had to ratify our accession.  In 2004, Ireland prepared a generous welcome for the new member states.  For that reason, I would like to start my presentation unconventionally by bringing closer those glorious days with the words of the most appropriate master, the great Irish bard, the late Seamus Heaney, who wrote a poem dedicated to the accession of the new member states and recited it in the Phoenix Park in May 2004.  I apologise in advance for my Irish language pronunciation.  I will do my best to pronounce them correctly.  The poem, &quot;Beacons at Bealtaine&quot;, reads:</p><blockquote><i>Uisce</i>: water.  And <i>fionn</i>: the water's clear.<br /><br />But dip and find this Gaelic water Greek:<br /><br />A phoenix flames upon <i>fionn uisce</i>here.<br /><br />Strangers were barbaroi to the Greek ear.<br /><br />Now let the heirs of all who could not speak<br /><br />The language, whose ba-babbling was unclear,<br /><br />Come with their gift of tongues past each frontier<br /><br />And find the answering voices that they seek<br /><br />As <i>fionn</i>and <i>uisce</i>answer phoenix here.<br /><br />The May Day hills were burning, far and near,<br /><br />When our land's first footers beached boats in the creek<br /><br />In <i>uisce</i>, <i>fionn</i>, strange words that soon grew clear;<br /><br />So on a day when newcomers appear<br /><br />Let it be a homecoming and let us speak<br /><br />The unstrange word, as it behoves us here,<br /><br />Move lips, move minds and make new meanings flare<br /><br />Like ancient beacons signalling, peak to peak,<br /><br />From middle sea to north sea, shining clear<br /><br />As phoenix flame upon <i>fionn</i><i>uisce</i>here.</blockquote> <p>I do not want to dare to interpret the great master, but what I feel from his verses is a sense of unity and optimism and I cannot shake off the feeling that we are sometimes lacking such ingredients these days.<br/><br/>After 12 years of EU membership, Slovakia is honoured to lead the Union.  The Presidency is a milestone in the history of Slovakia on the bumpy road since independence in 1993.  Now we have a good story to tell.  It began with our predecessors' dream to be part of a free and democratic world and continued with our integration into the European family of nations, with which we are bound by our rich history, diverse cultures and common values.  Indeed, &quot;back to Europe&rdquo; was one of the principal credos of the Tender Revolution in 1989, when we obliterated a brutal undemocratic regime with peaceful means.  It was a voice of our European identity.  We are proud to call the EU our home, the euro our currency and Schengen our area.  The EU provides us with security, stability and prosperity.  We are grateful for that because we were given a lot.  Now it is time to finish the story by giving something back.<br/><br/>We will not have it easy.  We joined the Union at a time when optimism about the European project was at its peak, but we have taken over the Presidency at a time when passion for EU membership has been replaced by euroscepticism and enlargement fatigue, a fragmented and individualistic approach is winning over unity and joint action, radicalism and extremism are putting pressure on mainstream parties with their easy solutions to complex problems, the economic and financial crisis has shattered our trust in the euro and our economic foundations, our high expectations of brighter futures for our eastern and southern neighbours are appearing quite distant, migration has touched upon our humanism and capacity to help the rest of the world and one country has decided to leave the Union.<br/><br/>The EU has become a victim of its own success.  The benefits of EU membership are perceived as granted or are downplayed.  The Union's shortcomings are often blown out of proportion or presented in a deliberately misleading and negative manner.  On the other hand, there are sometimes tendencies to procrastinate and to offer pseudo-solutions, which solve nothing or make things worse.  All in all, it is a perfect breeding ground for populists, political soldiers of fortune and those who are not happy about the strength and success of the European project.  We have failed to communicate the benefits of the Union to our citizens.  We should not hide behind complicated language but rather talk simply and clearly.  We must talk the language of ordinary people rather than the language of technocrats, lawyers and bureaucrats.</p><p> We should also think of new and more attractive ways of engaging the wider public in EU affairs.  Our communication strategy must be tailor-made depending on the situation and audience.  The EU is not only formed by Brussels and its institutions but also by its member states and citizens.  Therefore, the main driving force behind the EU&rsquo;s renovation process shall be the member states.  In an open and honest dialogue with the EU institutions, we should adopt strategic decisions accepted across the wider political spectrum because it is about member states understanding best what their citizens need.  This is a serious task but we must keep calm and act in unity.  All ongoing crises - not only Brexit - are a reminder that the EU and its benefits cannot be taken for granted.  There is no longer enough confidence among Europeans that the EU can deliver.  People fear loss of safety, identity and prosperity.  Some surveys suggest that the EU does not do well on migration and the economy.  Our citizens fear most that EU elites will not be able to cope with all the challenges we face.  It is time to take an honest look at the union and ourselves.  It is obvious that the practical and political consequences of the UK referendum will dominate the EU agenda in the coming months.  We want to maintain the best possible relationship with the UK.  Although we do not wish to prolong the time of uncertainty, we understand that no negotiations can start without the UK&rsquo;s notification of its withdrawal in the context of Article 50.  Slovakia has had positive experience in the split-up of the then Czechoslovak Federation when, regardless of many emotions, the swift negotiation process was dominated by responsibility and good agreements.  Those settlements were favourable for both parties and later became an important base for the following good relationship between Slovakia and the Czech Republic.  Furthermore, self-reflection has become a must, not an option.  There is an urgent need to jointly reflect on the future direction of the union in 27-country format.  Our Presidency will convene an informal summit on 16 September in Bratislava, where Ireland will be represented by the Taoiseach.</p><p> Constructive and open dialogue about the challenges the EU is facing has never been more needed.  Brexit should not dominate the summit discussions.  We want to focus on security in all its forms &ndash; economic security, employment, internal security and terrorism - but also the gap of communication between the EU institutions, member states and citizens.  I am sure what we all want is a modern and forward-looking Europe, a Europe of and for citizens.  There is much more that unites us than divides us but we must simplify the way we talk.  We must be much clearer in explaining to our citizens why the European Union is a solution and not a problem, why it is a friend and not an enemy and why it has no alternative whatsoever.  </p><p> Our Presidency programme does not even pretend to contain a miraculous prescription for all EU problems but the European citizen is at the heart of our programme.  We see ourselves as an honest broker, which should continue in all the previous projects and move them as far as possible and pass over to the next Presidency, which will be Malta, with a clear balance sheet.  Six months of a Presidency is too short to be over-ambitious or unrealistic and we want to be pragmatic and realistic.  Rome was not built in a day and a better, more effective and comprehensible Europe will not be either.  The Schuman Declaration already acknowledged this in 1950 when it said, "Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan.  It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity."  With this aim, our Presidency intends to be pragmatic, because it is time to deliver concrete and tangible results; uniting, since we must overcome fragmentation and the individual approach in Europe; and the people's voice as we need to deal with the real problems of our people such as the economy, jobs, security, migration and terrorism.  To achieve this, we have four ambitions: to make the economy stronger; to modernise and broaden the Single Market in areas such as energy and the digital economy; to work towards sustainable migration and asylum policy; and to pay attention to our external environment.</p><p> Despite the signs of recovery in the European economy after the crisis, full and sustainable recovery requires further incentives.  Our first priority area is thus focused on initiatives aimed at creating a supportive environment for the investments and further development of the union.  The Slovak Presidency is convinced that efficient use of the investment instruments, pursuing structural reforms and promoting a responsible approach to public finances are at the heart of an economically strong Europe.  The Economic and Monetary Union remains incomplete.  Therefore, the Slovak Presidency will support the implementation of the actions that will give positive momentum to its completion.  The economic crisis has shown that to enable the union to better deal with economic shocks it is necessary to deepen the Economic and Monetary Union.  The completion of the banking union is an important tool for the stabilisation of the banking sector.  The Presidency will pursue discussions on the European deposit insurance scheme which it sees as essential for improving the protection of depositors and for financial stability.  To boost investment, the Slovak Presidency will strive to strengthen the investment potential of the European Fund for Strategic Investments.  The Presidency will develop further the proposals contained in the recent communication of the Commission, the aim of which is to ensure the delivery of the maximum investment potential of the fund. </p><p> The Slovak Presidency will also support innovative and alternative sources of finance for companies among other means through the capital markets union.  The capital markets union aims to open up alternative sources of finance for small and medium-sized enterprises, which we deem to be very important and necessary, because they currently rely mainly on bank loans.  The main result will be the gradual elimination of the remaining barriers to cross-border flows of capital which will reduce the fragmentation of financial markets in Europe.</p><p> A supportive environment is a key precondition for the development and implementation of the European projects that are the main elements of the modern Single Market.  The Single Market is considered the greatest achievement of the European Union and the Slovak Presidency intends to support further development of the projects such as the digital Single Market and energy union.  Free movement of data has the unique potential to remove barriers and create more opportunities for innovative businesses and for all citizens, for instance in rural areas.  That is why we wish to make it a fifth EU freedom.</p><p> When it comes to concrete actions to pursue this objective, Slovakia will prioritise the elimination of barriers to the digital economy, the facilitation of the use of electronic services and access to the market, the availability of electronic content, as well as a high level of consumer protection.  Goals such as the removal of roaming charges or geo-blocking are attractive and understandable to the wider public and can highlight the real benefits of the EU to the public.  To stress the commitment to the digital Single Market, the Slovak Presidency will host the 2016 Digital Assembly on 28 September and 29 September in Bratislava.  This high level meeting will bring together officials from member states and institutions, policy makers, and stakeholders to exchange ideas and promote an innovative environment.  The ambition of the Slovak Presidency is to contribute to the creation of a resilient and competitive Energy union, with the main focus on energy security.  The Presidency will thus support efforts to improve energy security.</p><p> Ambitious policy in the area of climate change, with a correct set-up of the emissions trading system and a trend towards a low-carbon economy is an integral part of the energy union.  The Slovak Presidency will promote development of measures directed towards the circular economy.  Our objective is to reduce waste production, protect the environment and use natural resources such as water efficiently.</p><p> The ambition of the Slovak Presidency is to move Europe towards sustainable migration and asylum policy.  It is obvious that migration will remain an urgent issue not only during our Presidency, but also in years to come.  It does not represent a seasonal or local but a long-lasting and global problem.  The upcoming migration summit in New York on 19 September is a great opportunity not to be missed.  The migration crisis does not have an isolated European solution.</p><p>At the same time, we must realise that Europe must be the key part of a new global approach.  We can help resolve the issue only through joint EU-wide efforts and at the United Nations summit on migration by having one strong and leading voice.  To this end, the Slovak Presidency will promote comprehensive and sustainable solutions linking up relevant internal and external aspects.</p><p> Let us not narrow this complex problem to a single initiative, namely, the distribution of refugees.  The Schengen area is one of the greatest benefits of European integration but it is not currently fulfilling its essential role, which is to ensure the free movement of citizens and goods.  The Slovak Presidency regards the return to a fully functioning Schengen area as its main objective.  The protection of the European Union's external borders is a key precondition to fulfil this objective.  The Slovak Presidency will actively contribute to the deployment of the European border and coast guard.</p><p> Wider use of modern technology at the external borders is needed.  The Slovak Presidency supports smart borders and their implementation will facilitate the handling of passengers, contribute to the fight against irregular migration and strengthen the internal security of the Union.  Co-operation with third countries, namely, the countries of transit and origin of migrants, forms an integral part of a comprehensive approach to migration.  The Slovak Presidency will focus on eliminating the causes of migration and will encourage the development of targeted strategies to deal with the mass movement of people.  The migration and refugee crisis has led to reflections on the future of the joint European asylum system.  The Slovak Presidency feels a strong responsibility for further developments in this debate and wishes it to move forward in those areas where there is agreement among member states.  Legal migration should be a means of attracting highly qualified migrants wherever they are needed for our growing economies.</p><p> The Presidency will encourage an ambitious approach to internal security.  The main preconditions are improved information exchange, increased operational co-operation and mutual co-ordination among the police and judicial authorities of the member states.</p><p> Supporting the reinforcement of the global role of the European Union is the intention of the Slovak Republic within the fourth priority area.  The Slovak Presidency will support the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Federica Mogherini.  In the next period, the Union will focus on implementation of the global new EU strategy for foreign and security policy which will reinforce the role of the Union in the world, help face complex challenges and contribute to stabilising its neighbourhood.</p><p> Stability in the eastern and southern neighbourhoods of the EU has been significantly weakened in recent years.  The Slovak Presidency will, therefore, promote an effective European neighbourhood policy.  The enlargement policy is an effective means of ensuring a democratic transition for integrating countries and, in this regard, Slovakia can speak from experience.  With a view to strengthening the policy's credibility, the Presidency will seek to maintain the momentum of the accession process and achieve concrete progress in the candidate countries.</p><p> The Presidency will also actively engage in strengthening transatlantic ties and developing relations with other strategic partners of the EU.  Active engagement on the global scene must include strong trade links with key global economies.  The Slovak Presidency will focus on bilateral free trade agreements with third countries.</p><p> According to different polls, Slovaks believe the European Union is still the best solution for Europe and its citizens.  The EU is a visionary project which has brought unrivalled stability, solidarity and prosperity to Europe.  We seem to forget or take this for granted, however, and we accept the caricature of the Union in the media as a bureaucratic institution with an army of clerks who ponder over the shape of bananas or the size of pickles.  This is not the EU we live in and whose benefits we enjoy daily.  Everyone in this room knows the European Union is a solution, rather than a problem and to which there is no alternative, despite its imperfections.  However, we need to find ways to convince those who remain unconvinced, many of whom are our fellow citizens outside this room.</p><p>  Let me assure members that in pursuing our priorities, the Slovak Presidency will be an honest and fair broker.  I hope for the joint committee's support for our Presidency because only in close co-operation with the representatives of legislative bodies can we meet our common goals towards a better Union.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

I wish it well in its final months.  I propose to raise three issues.  I will not lie; I was slightly disappointed by some of the comments made by Prime Minister Fico on Brexit.  In our discussion in private session before the ambassador joined us, Brexit emerged as the most pressing issue facing the European Union, especially Ireland.  Members are very concerned that the special position of Ireland in having a land border with the United Kingdom and various cultural and economic ties with Britain may get lost in the negotiations on Brexit.  I ask the ambassador to ensure that this is borne in mind when Article 50 is triggered and negotiations begin.</p> <p>  I am delighted that the first priority of the Slovak Presidency is to strengthen the European Union economy.  How does the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, fit into this discussion?  I fear that after the 14th round of negotiations in July and the forthcoming presidential election in the United States, concerns about transparency and the increasing opposition to TTIP, especially in Germany and France, could leave the partnership dead in the water.  This would be a great opportunity missed.  The ambassador correctly noted the importance of trade agreements, especially with third party countries.</p> <p>  On the digital single market, how will the European Union overcome the issue of access to countries outside the EU, including China, one of the Union's major partners but one which enforces tight censorship laws?  How can this be factored into the overall strategy for developing the digital single market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016090800002#G00300"><p>I also congratulate the ambassador on his presentation.  He outlined a very ambitious programme for the Slovak Presidency and all members join him in hoping it achieves its objectives.  It is a broad programme that is fundamentally part of what the European Union is about and something that every country would strive to achieve in the Presidency role.  The committee hopes it will be successful.</p> <p>  I fully concur with the points raised by my colleague, Senator Richmond, particularly in respect of Brexit.  Ireland and the United Kingdom have had a common trade area for many years and Brexit presents a great obstacle to this trade.  It is an obstacle that is not of our making.  The European Union will have a major problem on its hands as it seeks to resolve the issues that arise as a result of Brexit.  This scenario has never arisen previously in this context.  The UK is an island off the mainland of Europe and Ireland, in turn, is an island off the west coast of the UK.  Brexit gives rise to many issues that affect us.</p> <p>  Ireland is not located at the geographic centre of the European Union but at its outer perimeter.  This issue has come into focus in recent days, as the ambassador will realise, as a result of the European Commission's decision in the Apple case.  Ireland strongly resents the attitude taken by the Commission in this case.  If applied broadly throughout the European Union in respect of other issues affecting different member states in a different fashion, the Commission's approach would have serious implications for solidarity in the European Union.  Solidarity is a concept that the EU has embodied and one which was very much incorporated in the ambassador's address to the joint committee.  Everybody has something to contribute to the European Union, whereas the tendency nowadays is to view the EU as an entity from which everybody should extract something.  We must return to the precept whereby every country brings something to the table and makes a commitment to the EU, as a result of which the sum becomes much greater than its parts.  I hope the Slovak Presidency will be successful in the pursuit of this objective.</p> <p>  The ambassador referred to bureaucrats, administrators and so forth.  We have the height of respect for bureaucrats from time to time.</p><p>When they err, in our opinion however, we believe we have the right to fundamentally reject what they have to say.</p><p> For 20 years, I have heard about the abolition of roaming charges.  It was a major issue in the European Union 20 years ago and its resolution was imminent then.  It still has not been resolved, much to the chagrin of all member states.  People roaming with their mobile telephones within the Union are penalised when making calls or downloading data.  As we well know, there is no need for this.  The benefit of being in a Union is that one avails of the services provided collectively by the Union.  It stretches the imagination as to why this issue has not been resolved.</p><p> Technology is going to be significantly important in combatting crime in the future.  We have seen countless examples of modern criminality and crime bosses who do not have problems with roaming at all.  They seem to expand and improve their influences, as well as commit atrocities, as time goes by.  We get affected by them, as do other countries in the Union.  Some of our criminals have domiciled themselves in other European countries as well, much to our annoyance.</p><p> We all have fond memories of Slovakia&rsquo;s accession to the European Union.  It has made a positive contribution since.  In recent times, there have been some discordant notes from various Heads of State across the Union on various issues, predominantly on migration.  They need to be resolved.  If we cannot live together as a Union, we should not be together.  It would be utterly hypocritical on our part to attempt to pursue the objectives of a Union if we are not thinking as one.</p><p> We have all heard from time to time the fact that the Members of Parliament of each member state should expect to have a greater influence on the Union in the future.  That is a contradiction and I cannot see how it can happen.  If each of the 27 member states insisted on ensuring their policies apply throughout the Union, there would be conflict.  There cannot be agreement if that were to happen.  This is why it is important that the contribution each member state has to bring to the Union has to be such as is part of the Union&rsquo;s own objectives.</p><p> I noted the oblique reference to continuing discussions with the western Balkans on enlargement.  Many argue we do not need any more enlargement.  We cannot divorce ourselves from reality.  It is important this area achieves Union membership in the shortest possible time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016090800002#H00200"><p>I welcome the ambassador to the committee and thank him for his comprehensive presentation.  I too feel the six-month term for an EU Presidency is too short.  If I were to be cynical, I would think it is a term dreamed up by bureaucrats to ensure politicians would never get to actually control the Union.  The ambassador referred to the rise of populism and I agree with him on that.  Unlike my colleague Deputy Bernard J. Durkan, I believe we are now reaching the stage of diminishing marginal returns in terms of expansion of an economic community.  As we get larger, we will start to amplify the differences between us rather than the commonality that holds us together.  I have serious concerns about that.</p> <p>  Given Brexit and the rise of populism, I am somewhat disappointed Slovakia has not decided to set aside all these grand plans and deal with one issue.  The one issue I would like the Slovakian Presidency to deal with is bringing the European Union back to its citizens.  There is clearly a terrible disjoint between where the Union is going.  Although there are benefits, they are fleeting and people forget them.  We look at our road infrastructure in this country which has changed beyond recognition over the past 15 years.  People forget, however, that European money funded these projects and our education system.</p> <p>  Instead, Irish people concentrate on the fact that we feel we singularly carried the burden for the economic collapse of Europe.  Whether that is true or not, it does not matter.  It feeds into the populist view of what the European Community is about.  We deeply resent the Commission sticking its nose into our affairs, trying to twist our arms into breaking our corporate tax regime.  Whether that is true or not, again this has fed into the populist view which exists.  The ambassador referred to natural resources and, in particular, water.  When he drafted his speech, he could not have been unaware of the sensitivity of the whole water debate in this country.  In this regard, there are people in Ireland who again feel the bureaucrats of Europe are deciding how we will manage our natural resources.  I believe we will have to pay to manage our national resources.  How we do that is a matter that has yet to be decided.</p> <p>  During its EU Presidency, Slovakia should set aside priorities such as the digital economy and the expansion of the Union and do nothing else but bring the Union back to the people and get the ordinary citizen on the street to recognise the benefits of being part of Europe.  It is my view that we are on the cusp of a complete breakup of the European project.  It was an excellent project from the outset.  However, Deputy Bernard J. Durkan referred to the differences in it.  We cannot have differences; we need to have common ground.  Maybe we are trying too many things at the one time.  Maybe we need to close things down and come back to the basics.</p> <p>  I wish Slovakia well in its first EU Presidency and hope we hear many positive developments over the next coming months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016090800002#H00300"><p>I thank the ambassador for his comprehensive address and outlining a vision for the European Union, which is sadly lacking.  He said himself unity and optimism is lacking in Europe, using a poem by Seamus Heaney.</p> <p>  The ambassador will be under no illusion but that the Brexit issue is the most important issue facing the Government and citizens of the Republic of Ireland.  While appreciating Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty has not yet been invoked, Oireachtas Members are clear we need to get the message out that Ireland is particularly affected by Brexit, probably more than any other EU member state.  While every EU member state will be affected in one way or other from the point of view of trade and so forth, Ireland has concerns about the future of the common travel area, the possible erection of trade barriers between the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the possible introduction of cross-Border controls.  The most important, but least tangible, concern is about the sustainability of the peace process in Northern Ireland.</p><p>In any meetings I have had in the European Union in recent months there is a great interest among our colleagues and MEPs in the European Parliament about the peace process and how it might be affected.  This is something we need to get across, that if there is poor economic growth in Northern Ireland it could lead to all sorts of problems and issues.</p><p> With regard to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, between the EU and Canada, I understand that the foreign ministers are meeting shortly to consider that further.  It has been suggested that the meeting might give provisional approval for CETA and I would be concerned about that because it has not really been discussed in our national Parliament.  It would be a mistake to go ahead with provisional approval of CETA at the September meeting.</p><p> The ambassador also stressed the position regarding migration and asylum policy.  This is one of the big issues which faces Europe today.  The EU-Turkey deal is now being implemented and there are concerns about how that is being implemented and also about the consequent EU migration partnership framework.  There is a general view among many people in Ireland that the security concerns are taking priority over humanitarian concerns.  I believe the European Union needs to stress the humanitarian considerations in all of this, apart from the other issues.  All of the speakers, including the ambassador, spoke about the democratic deficit.  The ambassador spoke about the gap in communication between EU institutions, member states and the citizens.  I believe it is painfully obvious to all that something needs to be done on that.  Senator Craughwell referred to the rise of populism.  The European Union is under threat and we need to be conscious of that.</p><p> The ambassador has set himself a very ambitious agenda.  He has come at a very difficult time for the European Union with its many challenges.  Certainly, as another small state, we wish him well in his endeavours for the benefit of all the citizens of Europe.</p></speech>

I wish his country very well with the EU Council Presidency  I support what my colleagues have said on the issues.  We held some discussion about Brexit before the ambassador came to the committee today, something which will undoubtedly be the predominant issue for Ireland.  There has been talk at the committee about the democratic deficit and that unity and optimism are very difficult to achieve because of narrow populism and people's human nature which can be selfish.  I will not go into what we thought about the British decision, even though it was narrowly achieved, but it is the dominant matter for us.  We would hope for the support of the smaller countries and particularly of Slovakia as the President of the EU Council, even though I do not believe it will arise for quite a long time and this uncertainty will continue.  Britain has declared that it will not invoke Article 50 for quite some time, maybe even not for a few years.</p> <p>  There are three main issues for Ireland.  We do not want a hard Border in our country because of the free movement of our people North and South and our peace process, as Deputy Haughey has said.  All the arrangements Ireland has predate not just the European Union but also the EEC.  I hope there will be agreement on that matter.  Our trade links with Britain mean the biggest difficulty for Ireland will be achieving something that is as close to the Single Market for Britain as is possible.  To achieve that they might have to accept a quota on the migratory front which they do not seem to want to accept.  There are a lot of difficulties and there is no point in getting into them today.  We wish the ambassador very well and hope for his support when it will matter and count.</p></speech>

We wish him well and continued good luck and success during the busy period of the Slovak Presidency of the EU Council.  I agree with his own sentiments, and with those of others, that the time is obviously very short.  I recall the time Ireland held the EU Council Presidency.  One is only getting ones legs under the table and getting going when all of a sudden one has to depart from the table.  It is most unfortunate and may perhaps be looked at in the future.  We wish the ambassador well.  The good side to the Presidency being condensed into a six-month period is that people really knuckle down to work quickly to get going and interacting with all the member states.  On a personal level I wish His Excellency every good luck and success.</p> <p>  I thank all the Members who came to the Public Gallery today to hear the ambassador's presentation.  I especially acknowledge the presence of the charg&eacute; d'affaires for Georgia, Mr. George Zurobashvili.  I welcome him, his colleagues and all the others here today.  I thank them all for being here.  I thank the members of the committee and I thank the secretariat for organising today's meeting.  As there is no other business to be dealt with today, this meeting shall adjourn until Tuesday, 4 October, or perhaps an alternative date, taking into account what a number of members from the Fianna F&aacute;il group have outlined to us earlier today.  It will be taken into account and we will try to deal with that.</p></speech>

Taking all the comments together, the main topic is Brexit.  The negative outcome of the referendum is a reality and we need to deal with it.  It is the first withdrawal of a member state from the European Union and it is certainly an unprecedented moment.  However, it should also give us the opportunity to ask the question why our citizens are withdrawing their trust in the EU.  In our view and in the view of Slovakia, there is no alternative.  We hope the Bratislava summit will be an event to kick off a wider political reflection to evaluate the current state of play of the integration project and the future of Europe.  The reflection process should continue throughout the next European Council meetings and culminate in March 2017 when we will commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.  The Bratislava summit should provide an impetus for further thinking and, more particularly, for action.  The event should be built around the idea of sending a firm signal of the unity of member states, which was also mentioned in several contributions by Senators and Deputies.  We expect from the summit a diagnosis of the current state of the EU which, after the UK referendum, is now in a specific situation.   We also expect agreement on a limited list of priority areas that will receive particular attention over the next month.  We believe it is necessary that the leaders have an informal political debate on the current state of the EU after the UK referendum where they can exchange their views on the situation, its causes and consequences.</p> <p>  In the case of Ireland we clearly see that Ireland has a unique position because of the closeness and the shared history, and that has been amplified in the committee members' statements.  Ireland is the only country that has a land border with the UK.  We all see this.  Slovakia, as a smaller country also, has a lot of understanding for the Irish voice in this debate.  It is important to stress that we would not like the upcoming reflection to be only about discussion on more or less Europe, nor about changing the treaty and transfer of powers between Brussels and member states.  This reflection should aim at delivering better results for the citizens.  Senator Craughwell referred to bringing the EU closer to the citizens and how that might be done.</p><p>Concrete projects such as the digital single market can eventually bring this closer.<br/><br/>Deputy Durkan mentioned that roaming charges would be abolished four years from now, but they have certainly decreased.  They are currently on the lowest level and we can see light at the end of the tunnel.  Concrete projects that we will be able to achieve include those in the digital area and the capital markets union.  The latter is a unique instrument which can bring clear benefits specifically to small and medium-sized enterprises.  <br/><br/>Deputy Haughey mentioned that Ireland was particularly affected and that this fact should be recognised by member states.  It certainly should be, because the EU is a very wide geographic entity.  What seems to be an extremely important problem in Slovakia may not be such a huge one here in Ireland, or <i>vice versa</i>.  In that sense, therefore, we need to have much more understanding of each other.  We should also be able to listen to each other and reflect on our partners' concerns.  I specifically want to stress the fact that we are a smaller country.  I am not saying that small countries should gang up against the big ones, but there is certainly more understanding and sympathy for each other in this regard.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for giving us the opportunity to speak at this meeting this morning.  My name is Conor Faughnan and I am joined by my colleague Mr. Colm Carey from the Automobile Association, AA Ireland.  AA Ireland is over 100 years old.  It was originally a motoring organisation and lobbyist for motoring interests, which is something we still do.  Indeed, I am on the register of lobbyists and must fill in my return annually.  I will have to remember to include this meeting.  In addition, the AA has grown into a very large motoring services organisation.  We are the largest personal lines insurance intermediary in Ireland providing motor, home, travel and, more recently, life insurance.  The AA has more than 120,000 motor insurance customers and deals with a panel of three underwriters to provide them with quality motor policies.  The AA occupies a unique position and is very well placed to see differing points of view in the ongoing debate on rising prices.</p> <p>  The rising cost of motor insurance is the single most important issue for the motoring consumer right now according to AA research.  We regularly carry out opinion surveys among our membership base, which involves sending out questionnaires with 25 or 30 detailed questions.  We typically receive 8,000 to 10,000 completed questionnaires from members of the public and AA customers.  We carried out a poll in March of this year, to which 9,000 people responded.  We had asked them to rank various issues in order of importance and they ranked motor insurance costs as more important than road safety, fuel costs, taxation and road maintenance.</p> <p>  The AA has been active on this issue for quite some time.  In November last year, we published a detailed set of recommendations under five headings.  These are summarised in the paper I have submitted to the committee.  Since November 2015 when we published that document, there has been disappointingly little progress on these issues.</p><p>There has also been a worsening of the competitive position for the provision of insurance in Ireland.  This is something that we feared but the situation is actually worse than we had predicted.<br/><br/>The market in Ireland is increasing, with new car sales up 20% as the economy grows.  Motor insurance prices are also increasing sharply.  This should mean that competitors are attracted into the market but, in fact, insurers are in active retreat from Ireland.  The entry of the Qatar Insurance Company which was announced on 31 August is welcome but is against the trend.  We do not know the planned extent of that company's participation in the Irish market.  Overall, there are very few foreign players looking to enter the market which is a deeply unhealthy indicator and a worsening problem.  Furthermore, premium increases have not finished yet.  We estimate that prices may rise a further 20% overall over the next two or three quarters unless action is taken.<br/><br/>As well as retreating out of Ireland altogether, insurers are also seeking to narrow their footprint.  They are now typically only interested in mainstream risks or what one could call the plain vanilla insurance policy.  They are interested in drivers with no penalty points, a standard car, an ordinary profession and a normal driving history.  Even these drivers are facing price increases but drivers who fall out of those standard categories can struggle to obtain insurance at all.  We have had conversations, for example, with people who have had an insurance claim or who have acquired some penalty points who cannot shop around.  They are captive with their existing insurance company and must absorb whatever price increases are sent their way.<br/><br/>There are several reasons we are not seeing foreign competition enter into the market.  One is the reputational damage that was caused by the failure of Setanta but a more significant reason is the lack of clear information and data on claims costs.  Foreign insurance companies considering entry into the Irish market are at a disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the insurers already here because our data is so murky and difficult to understand.  <br/><br/>What can the Oireachtas do about this?  Our submission makes a number of detailed recommendations.  I do not propose to read the entire paper now as that would take longer than the allotted five minutes.  There are a number of issues that I would like to draw attention to because they are levers that the Oireachtas can pull.  The first of these is to update the book of quantum.  Members might be familiar with this book, which describes in detail the appropriate level of financial compensation for injuries of a given severity.  There are two problems with the Irish book of quantum.  The first is that it is hopelessly out of date.  It is more than ten years old and is effectively useless as a guideline document for the courts.  The other problem is that the courts are not bound to abide by it.  There is a touch of chicken and egg operating here because if the document is not terribly useful, it is hard to compel the courts to stick to it.  <br/><br/>We are about to see an updated book of quantum which we called for last November and which was supposed to be produced in January.  The updated book is due next month and that will make an important difference.  However, what is even more important is that the courts, within the confines of the proper separation of powers, are persuaded to adhere to the book of quantum.  That is at the heart of the Gordian knot that feeds into escalating legal costs.  Individuals with insurance claims go to the Injuries Board and are given an estimate of the value of their claim.  Often their solicitor will suggests that they might do better in court and that they should threaten the insurance company with court.  The practical effect of this is that 20% of cases are settled by the Injuries Board, for which there is clear data, and 10% of cases end up in court, for which there is some data, but 70% of cases are settled directly by the insurance companies to prevent a court case from happening and we cannot see what is going on there.  The data on out-of-court settlements is not published.  This means that insurers are hiding 70% of claims information under their skirts, so to speak.  Insurance companies are reporting an increase in claims and I believe that is true.  They are also reporting that claims costs are going up and I am also inclined to believe that is true but we are not seeing the proof of that.  The key to unblocking this is a proper book of quantum to which the courts adhere.  That will remove the incentive for the solicitor to whisper in a plaintiff's ear and for them both to try to squeeze the insurance company.  <br/><br/>Another action that the Oireachtas could take is to introduce automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, which involves a camera in a Garda car or elsewhere reading a registration number which is then checked against a database.  This is a mature and well-used technology which operates in Great Britain and in many other countries.  In essence, it is one of the key ways to reduce fraud.  At the moment, we are still using a paper windscreen disk to determine whether a car is insured.  That actually facilitates rather than prevents fraud.  The only equipment available to garda&iacute; to check whether a car is insured is a torch to shine on the disk.  That is worse than useless.  We know, on foot of rising premiums, that uninsured driving is on the increase and that will continue because we are not giving the garda&iacute; the resources they need.  It is an unfortunate irony that garda&iacute; already have this equipment.  It has been physically installed in around 80% of the cars in the traffic corps.  There are other cameras out there that can read registration plates, for example, the cameras on the M50.  What is missing is the underlying database of insurance information and that is something that the insurance industry can be compelled to put in place.  We already have a database of cars that are taxed so, in the first instance, we should get rid of the tax disk and use technology to track that.  If a garda finds an untaxed car, I am willing to bet that he or she has also found an uninsured car.  Giving those tools to the garda&iacute; would help a lot.  <br/><br/>Members of this committee will probably be aware of the somewhat technical issue of the discount rate which does not lend itself to a simplistic explanation.  Broadly speaking, it is an assumed rate of return on a lump of money.  If an insurance company has to pay me for a catastrophic injury and the payout is estimated to be &euro;10 million, for example, the insurance company can pay me in tranches and there is an assumption made about how much interest or return that &euro;10 million would make.  This has a huge impact on the industry because since around 2002, a court precedent set that discount rate at 3%.  That was fine and everyone was working off an assumption that the discount rate was 3%.  However, a recent court case in 2014, the Gill Russell case reset that discount rate to 1%.  While that does not sound like much, for an insurance company that makes a huge difference to how much it must pay out in a lump sum in the case of a claim for catastrophic injury.  The insurance companies collectively looked all across their book, at the 2 million motorists they have on cover, and said the discount rate is not 3% anymore but is now 1% so we have to recalibrate all of our reserves.  That is part of what is pushing through into premiums but it can be fixed directly.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has the power under the Civil Liability and Courts Act to strike a discount rate or to simply state what it should be.  The Minister has not done so.  We have engaged with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality on this matter and brought it directly to her attention.  At the moment, because she has not struck a discount rate, the insurance industry collectively has to assume that it follows the court precedent set recently.  They must, of necessity, reserve prudently as a result and that is one of the factors that is feeding directly into the increase in premiums that we are paying at the moment.  <br/><br/>Our paper makes some other recommendations and I look forward to having a question and answer conversation with committee members.  Rather than read out the entire paper, it would be more constructive to leave it there, although there is one more point I would like to make.  We deal with insurance companies extensively and we know their DNA.  We do commercial deals with them all of the time.  One source of frustration for us is that the insurance industry collectively does not share data.  An integrated insurance data system is essentially a data hub.  If I want to move from one insurance company to another, I do not have to get a letter from the first insurance company and give it to the second one.  Companies can look at a data hub, see who I am, my claims history, my penalty points status and so forth.  That, in and of itself, should be in place.  It is in place in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland, for example.  The same insurance companies that operate north and south of the Border have done it in Northern Ireland but not in the Republic because they argue that it is complicated and that they have data protection concerns.  This is very frustrating for us.  That database needs to be complete and open to brokers and all actors in the insurance market.  The Oireachtas could help by compelling insurers to do this.  <br/><br/>As I said, there are a few other bits and pieces in our paper, much of which will be self-evident to members.  An obvious issue is Garda resources.  The Garda traffic corps has been reduced.  Every motor insurance claim begins with an accident but if Garda resources are increased, accidents will be reduced.  That is clearly an important measure that does not require much explanation. <br/><br/>My parting shot before I finish relates to Setanta insurance which is leading to uncertainty in the insurance market.  We have spoken to insurers who want to come into Ireland.</p><p>One of the reasons they will not is that they do not know what their liability is going to be because of the Setanta case.  If it is the case that for an insurance company to trade in Ireland part of what it must do is essentially guarantee its competitors against their failures, then this is a real barrier for insurance companies.  We spoke to an insurer outside Ireland.  Only last week one of my colleagues had a detailed conversation with a representative of the firm.  He said the firm was willing to trade here but that the Setanta judgment was one of the things preventing it from supplying in Ireland.  That is something that has to be fixed.</p><p> Thank you for your patience, Chairman.  I hope I have not gone over time.  I look forward to the conversation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kian Griffin" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090800002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me today.  Much of what I have to say will be identical to what Mr. Faughnan has said.  Primarily, the people I am here to represent are younger drivers.  Ireland UnderGround is the organisation I am here on behalf of.  It comes from a forum I set up in February to discuss issues relating to younger drivers.  Almost immediately the discussion turned to motor insurance.  This has always been a major concern for younger drivers but I believe in the past 12 months in particular it has gotten out of hand.</p> <p>  I am consistently getting messages, calls and social media messages from people who are in a state of despair.  They do not know whether they can afford to go to work the following morning because of the cost of their motor insurance on top of everything else.  One of the most worrying messages I am getting on a consistent basis comes from people who are refusing or who cannot afford to pay for motor insurance.  Figures published recently by the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland show a 17% increase in claims involving uninsured drivers.  Clearly, I need not tell the committee that is part of the problem.  We seem to be getting into a rather dangerous cycle whereby the costs are increasing and more people are using that as an excuse not to pay their insurance, or else they simply cannot afford to.  This increases the figures and it feeds in to increasing costs on top of that.  Judging from the messages I am getting, it does not seem like this will slow down any time soon, particularly in the case of the younger demographic.  They are saying they have paid for this year but they know it will go up next year.  They say they cannot afford this month's payment and so on.  It looks as though it will keep rising.</p> <p>  One of the key problems people have mentioned to me is that their premiums are increasing despite their having had no claims or accidents.  It does not seem logical to them that the price should go up when they are doing what they should be doing.  They are driving safely and they are not involved in any accidents or claims.  They are building up their no-claims bonuses, yet their premiums are increasing.  They see this as pure profiteering by the insurance companies.  I know these companies have to turn a profit to stay in the market.  They will do what they believe they have to do to keep their profits up.  The easiest way for them to do that is to increase the premiums to counteract the claims they pay out.  I have no problem with private companies trying to stay profitable.  The issue is that they are doing it at the cost of the motorist.</p> <p>  I believe we need to try to aid the insurance companies to bring down their expenses in order that they can remain profitable while offering lower premiums.  There are a number of ways we could do this at official level.  The first would be to bring compensation payouts in line with the EU averages.  As Mr. Faughnan said before me, we should compel the courts to adhere to the book of quantum rather than simply refer to it.  I am keen to see fraudulent and exaggerated claims tackled more aggressively and possibly the granting of greater powers to the Injuries Board.</p> <p>  Another issue that has been brought to my attention - Mr. Faughnan has touched on this already - is the lack of clarity.  When we take our motor insurance, it is to cover the risk of accident, theft, etc.  It would seem logical that as people gain experience, their premiums should come down.  However, such has been the increase in premiums that those who have been driving for years or even decades without a claim are still seeing extraordinary increases.  There seems to be no consistency in pricing.  People want clarity.  They want to see exactly what they are paying for.  I believe it is only fair that when someone is offered a premium, that premium should be broken down.  It should be shown clearly to the customer point by point what exactly they are paying for.  Using the same line of reasoning, insurance companies are claiming that much of the increase in cost is down to the cost of claims, yet, as Mr. Faughnan remarked, 70% of claims are settled out of court.  A motion was put forward by Deputy McGrath and supported by the vast majority of the D&aacute;il at the time calling for the implementation of a claims database, and I support the idea.  The companies may claim this is anti-competitive, but I maintain that if everyone wants to disclose their information on out-of-court settlements, then it is a level playing field for all.  I believe that would help reduce the cost of claims.  If we had the database, we could monitor whether suspected fraudulent claims were not being fully investigated.</p> <p>  The last issue I wish to touch on is a particular issue affecting younger drivers more so than older drivers.  There is a refusal by many insurance companies to take on cars older than ten years in some cases.  I am driving a 15-year-old car and I was restricted from shopping around for my premium this year.  I had to stick with the company I was with because other companies refused point blank to insure a car of that age.  This was something of a nuisance for me.  I am unsure whether they expect 17 or 18-year-olds to be earning &euro;50,000 per year, but I know few younger drivers can afford to buy a newer car to take advantage of the lower premiums.  If a car has a valid NCT certificate, then it should be required by law to be judged the same as a new car in terms of risk.  In most countries, the insurance companies assess the risk based on the car or the driver, but here they seem to do both.  I do not see why, if I am considered a low-risk insurable driver in a 2010 BMW, I should be considered a higher-risk or uninsurable driver in an older car.  Like most people, my driving style will not change based on the car I drive.</p> <p>  The feedback I am getting from younger drivers is that they are besieged on all fronts.  There is sense of hopelessness.  They do not know where to turn to try to alleviate the pressures they have on their shoulders.  We have to contend with a two-tier tax system, high fuel costs and poor road conditions leading to high maintenance fees.  Now, we have to deal with the rapidly increasing insurance premiums on top of all that.</p> <p>  The Government has consistently referred to keeping the recovery going.  That might be true in Dublin or for the upper class, but I cannot say that I have experienced any recovery, and I think I speak for all younger drivers and drivers in general in Ireland when I say that we need the help of the committee.  We are on our knees begging at this stage.  We simply do not know where to turn any more.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.64" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090800002#C00400"><p>On behalf of Age Action Ireland I thank the committee for its invitation to speak today about an issue that causes substantial frustration to many of our members.  In recent months, many have experienced substantial age-based increases in their car premiums.</p> <p>  Frank is a 70-year-old man from Dundalk.  He has never had an accident or made a claim.  He has a full no-claims bonus and drives less than 5,000 miles per year.  Last year, when he was 69 years of age, his car insurance premium was &euro;293.  Last week, his insurer quoted a price of &euro;493, an increase of more than 68%.  Frank relies on the State pension, and therefore his car insurance represents more than two weeks of his income.</p> <p>  In April this year we were contacted by Teresa, who is over 70 years of age.  Her car insurance was going up from &euro;470 to &euro;700.  She haggled with the provider - fair play to her - and got a deduction or discount of &euro;50.  However, it still represented an increase of more than 38% in her car insurance premium.  During her conversation with the customer service representative, she was told that the reason for the premium increase was that older drivers were more of a liability.  As Teresa pointed out, and as I will outline, older drivers are safer drivers because they have years of experience.  However, the comment made to Teresa illustrates a perception held by insurance companies that older people are more likely to be involved in accidents and should, therefore, pay a higher premium.  This view is not supported by the evidence.  The Central Statistics Office 2013 transport omnibus survey found that 22% of driving licence holders are over the age of 70 years, yet they received less than 9.5% of the total number of penalty points awarded that year.</p><p>Professor Des O'Neill, the national programme director for traffic medicine with the Road Safety Authority, referred to the belief that older drivers are more dangerous as a &quot;tenacious and fixed false belief&quot; that is not supported by the evidence.  He went on to cite Dutch research which found that children in crashes where the grandparents are driving are at half the risk of injury as where their parents are driving, simply because they tend to be driving at lower speeds.  The Institute of Advanced Motorists in Britain also says that older drivers are safer drivers.  They point out that older drivers tend to be more cautious and self-regulate by choosing not to drive at times when they do not feel comfortable, such as in poor weather or in poor light conditions.  They are also less likely to drink and drive, take illegal drugs or speed.  The institute has also produced statistics showing that British pensioners, despite making up 8% of all drivers, are only involved in around 4% of accidents that cause injury.  Yesterday, new research from the University of Swansea found that drivers aged 70 were involved in between three and four times fewer accidents than young male drivers aged between 17 and 21.<br/><br/>These arguments are echoed by the Consumer Federation of America's director of insurance, who said, &quot;The focus for insurers should be on driving record, mileage and type of car ... things clearly related to risk ... all the actuarial data I have seen indicates less risk for the older drivers.&quot;  When Age Action has asked for this actuarial data or any data from Irish insurance companies in the past we have been told it is commercially sensitive.  In this regard I echo the points, articulately made by Mr. Faughnan and Mr. Griffin, about the issue of trying to get data from insurance companies.<br/><br/>It is also important to highlight the additional health requirements imposed on older drivers and it would be very useful if the committee could determine whether these are considered by insurance companies when setting premiums.  Any driver over the age of 70 applying for a licence needs a certificate from their doctor confirming their medical fitness to drive.  These licences are only valid for one or three years, depending on the judgment of the doctor, compared with the ten years to which many of us are accustomed, and older drivers are subject to regular health checks to ensure they are safe to be on the road.  This is a level of scrutiny that is applied to no other age group but there is no indication that this is considered by insurance companies.<br/><br/>Age Action also suggests that the imposition of inflated premiums on older drivers may not be compatible with EU law.  Committee members will be familiar with the 2011 decision by the European Court of Justice which ruled that Article 5.2 of the 2004 Council directive on gender was incompatible with the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights.  This article contained an opt-out, availed of by all 27 member states including Ireland, which permitted them to allow insurance companies to treat men and women differently in setting premiums where this was justified by &quot;relevant and accurate actuarial and statistical data&quot;.  The court found that this was contrary to Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex.  The same article also prohibits discrimination on the grounds of age.<br/><br/>Finally, we would like to address the impact of increased car insurance costs on older people.  Being able to drive is synonymous with independence but it is more than simply a lifestyle choice.  For many older drivers it is an absolute necessity and may mean the difference between living independent, full lives in the community or being forced into residential care.  Some committee members represent rural constituencies and will be particularly conscious of the challenges facing older people, for example, where there is no public transport system.  Older people who are unable to drive face increasing social isolation and must rely on friends or family for transport.  Research published earlier this year in the <i>Journal of the American Geriatrics Society </i>found that &quot;driving cessation was ... associated with declines in general health and physical, social, and cognitive function and with greater risks of admission to long-term care facilities and mortality&quot;.  It also found evidence that the risk of depressive symptoms in older adults forced to stop driving was almost doubled.  While most older people who do stop driving do so health reasons, for others the challenge is financial.  As with Mr. Griffin, we have had people contact us saying the cost of car insurance premiums are in danger of putting them off the road.<br/><br/>In closing, while Age Action appreciates the fact that the committee is looking at the issue of car insurance on a broad basis, which we welcome, we urge members to address the impact of these rising car insurance premiums on older people.</p></speech>

Their submissions have been very informative.  I have a few interactive questions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was before the committee yesterday and I am sure the witnesses have already read some of the transcripts.  He said "the ability of the Government to influence insurance pricing is limited, as insurance companies are required by European law to price in accordance with risk".  It is worth our while interrogating further the setting of the discount rate.  The rate may be 2% or 3% but the insurance premiums have increased by multiples of that.  I assume that is because of provisioning.  It would be useful for people watching online if Mr. Faughnan could give them a better appreciation as to why there has been a loading on insurance premiums this year.  I am fascinated by the fact that he says insurance companies are narrowing their footprint and cherry-picking customers.  Mr. Moran has said that there has been no increase in the risk related to old drivers but they are being told when the go to renew their premiums that they carry a greater risk.  I imagine the market is still lucrative so I do not see why they are narrowing their footprint.  I imagine the risk is still covered to a large extent.  Is it because the underwriters, of which globally there are a limited number working in the motor insurance sector, are deciding the Irish market is not lucrative enough?  Are they saying that profit is the ultimate motive over and above that of risk?  I would like a deeper understanding of why the witness feels there will be a further rise of 20% over the next two or three quarters.</p> <p>  Are the witnesses interacting with the Minister of State's working group?  I get a sense from the Minister of State's intervention yesterday that while there have been meetings, the insurance industry is not really a stakeholder in the process but merely a contributor.  The firms give information but are not influencing a potential outcome which would see the necessary reductions in premiums, as called for by Mr. Griffin, especially in the case of younger drivers and older drivers.  We all have experience of this issue from our work in our constituencies, whether they be rural or urban.  As public representatives, we have seen a massive increase in the cost of premiums.  When we see increases of between 33% and 50% in the cost of premiums, we wonder if it is based on the profit motive or something else.  Is it only about the book of quantum or the automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, or the discount rate?  It seems to me there is something more to it than that.  Is there another explanation of the discount rate?</p></speech>

We had a very good conversation with him and we are encouraged that, across a wide spectrum of interests, there seems to be a broad consensus among people on the need to get this repaired.  We were particularly encouraged by the Minister of State's response around data sharing because that is key.  I appreciate that the book of quantum is thorny because it deals with the separation of powers and what the courts can be compelled to do.</p><p>Even so, there seems to be a fairly tight consensus around that and it is a good thing.  There are a couple of specific questions.  One is how big the influence of the discount rate is?  There are a couple of sets of data on that which show it is impactful.  The State Claims Agency, which is also affected by the discount rate, reckons that the change from 3% to 1% could add about &euro;100 million annually to its bill.  That is the sort of scale involved.  It might translate in terms of motor insurance premium to approximately 7% on a typical motor insurance premium.  That is how big the difference is.  In our case-----</p></speech>

The Civil Liability and Courts Act specifies that the discount rate will be set by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is the T&aacute;naiste at the moment and we have discussed it with her.  I appreciate it might not be quite as simple and that there are other technical provisions.  A number of court cases are pending which would affect the State Claims Agency.  I am not over-simplifying the landscape and saying that the T&aacute;naiste has a pen in her hand that she refuses to wield.  Nevertheless we should work this through.  It may seem a little bit absurd to say this but from the insurance industry's point of view, it almost does not mind what the rate is once it knows there is a definitive rate.  The Deputy asked if it was just the book of quantum and only the discount rate.  It is a combination of factors.  I will give a potted history in 30 seconds.  For about ten years, motor insurance premiums in Ireland fell year on year up to around 2014.  They began to fall recklessly and an Irish motor insurance premium was significantly less than a British one.  I have said before that, collectively, the industry was rather stupid.  It thought it was making money but it was not.  It realised as the claims matured over a seven-year claim cycle that it was actually losing money.  A couple of things really startled the herd.  One was the failure of Setanta which has left behind almost &euro;30 million in debts.  Then there were other insurers which ran into serious trading problems.  One of the major brand names still trading in Ireland hit reserving problems and had to transfer an enormous amount of capital across from its parent.  The industry collectively was like a herd of wildebeest on the edge of the stream.  Insurance providers all knew they had to increase rates but they all were competing on price and were afraid to be the one to make the first move.  Then the Setanta failure and other issues happened and they all went charging across the stream.  </p> <p>  In a sense, insurance providers have gone too far now and it has become excessive but they are taking advice from their actuaries.  Their actuaries are having to assume the perfect storm.  They are having to assume that Setanta means that they will have to pick up the liabilities if another insurer fails.  If another insurer fails, they will have to pay the bill.  They have to assume that the discount rate is going to live at 1% rather than 3%.  That is 7% on the amount of premiums that they have to claim.  They have to assume that the recent rise in court awards, which happened when court award thresholds went up a couple of years ago, is the new normal.  If all of those things are baked in as the new normal and there are other layers like Solvency II Directive, which is the European provision around reserving, there is no choice.  If they do those calculations, they must increase their premiums or they will not have adequate reserves.  </p> <p>  We should do what we can to provide clarity around those numbers, reduce claims happening in the first instance and reduce the cost of those claims when they happen.  Those measures all have an effect even greater than their primary number because they reduce uncertainty and make the actuaries less requiring of caution.  That in turn will feed directly into premiums.</p></speech>

In other words, if somebody had paid a premium of &euro;500, for example, and this year it is &euro;800, of the &euro;300 extra, what is the correction and what is absolute supernormal profits?  That is why if one speaks to Mr. Kian Griffin's constituency and to older people they are absolutely perplexed.  We are all perplexed as to why we are paying so much extra for our premiums overnight.  It seems to me that not all the factors that Mr. Faughnan talks about here are contributing factors but that there is a profit loading on that as well.  For instance, AA has three underwriters.</p></speech>

Perhaps that is the norm; I do not know.  It seems to me that the underwriters, which are big international houses, are influencing the market in little Ireland because it is a small market in global terms.  We should interrogate that further because I think Mr. Faughnan is saying that there is hope in terms of some legislative changes and data sharing, which is the European norm.  If we can get those things right within this committee and within the Houses, we will go some way to ameliorating the situation but the profit element is something we need transparency on.</p></speech>

AA is sort of like an insurance broker, although according to the Central Bank that is not the correct technical term for us.  We are an intermediary.  We have three motor insurance underwriters on our panel and we do business with them.  There is quite a bit of commercial tension there.  My colleague, our commercial director, will negotiate with them.  At the moment, there are three insurance underwriters on our panel.  We tender for that periodically.  Previously, we had more and we decided to go with three.  It is a dynamic thing.  We are in constant commercial conversation with them to selfishly try to get the best rates for our customer.  That is just an ordinary thing that goes on.  The Deputy had a specific question which goes close to the heart of the matter which is that some element of natural correction had to occur but how much is natural correction?  In other words, how much of the price we are paying is justified by underwriting criteria as the real cost of accidents?  How much is unfair or super profit?  How much is shoring up reserves that have been weakened by ten years of poor quality trading?  It is perhaps not accurate to term it as unfair but maybe one might describe it as paranoid or excessively prudent provisions being made because they have been stung in the past.  This body is not the only one wrestling with those calculations.  I cannot claim that we would know definitely but in the last two years, the overall motor insurance premiums were-----</p></speech>

This is just a pure guess.  Beside me is somebody with greater technical expertise than me who will probably shoot me for making the guess but as a rough rule of thumb, I would guess that perhaps half of it is explained by underwriting factors, namely, crashes and the cost of the crashes.  Layered on top of that there are things such as the discount rate, which is not an underwriting factor, and the Solvency II Directive, which is not an underwriting factor, but again they cannot claim this took them by surprise because it was coming for years and years.  I would not attribute the balance to supernormal profits - perhaps that is just a point of view - but to supernormal caution based on fears of having been stung before and fears that the new claims and cost of claims landscape is the new normal.  If what we have now in terms of the cost of claims is the new normal and if one hates all our existing insurance companies and wants to drive them all out of the country like St. Patrick with the snakes and bring in a new lot or start a Government one, it will not solve the problem because all of those underlying costs will still be there.</p></speech>

It is very important to hear all the different perspectives.  Is Mr. Faughnan concerned about the stability of the insurance industry as it is at the moment?  Leading on from the lack of transparency around it, one of the questions since the failures of Setanta and Enterprise Insurance is who will be next.  Consumers need reassurance when they are taking out insurance that in a few months down the line, they will not find that they have paid out this money for nothing.</p><p>When 60% of the claims go on legal costs surely we need to legislate to regulate the legal costs.  It is disappointing because Mr. Faughnan has made some very constructive recommendations since last year but a year later people have to pay huge sums that they can ill afford and Government has not reacted more quickly.  That is the job of this committee, to make sure we have a renewed focus on it and some actions are put in place.  </p><p> In respect of fraud, I am concerned that the focus tends to be on consumer behaviour.  That feeds into our reputation abroad for giving out huge compensation without really teasing out the 60% going on legal costs and we have ignored the International Monetary Fund's instructions to tackle these costs.  Why is that not being done?  This committee can do that. </p><p> Again, in respect of fraud, somebody is not doing her or his job.  Mr. Faughnan referred to the police not having resources and that plays a part but the lack of transparency means we do not get proper figures on whether this is anecdotal evidence about fraud.  Can we get specifics?  That is what we are trying to do here, get down to specifics to get the data and analyse it.  It seems that some of the insurance companies do not want increased competitiveness.  I am concerned about foreign companies coming here but being regulated in their own jurisdictions when the Central Bank and other actors are not robust enough in respect of the regulations.  That needs to be done before any new players come into the market.</p><p> The development of the independent medical assessment unit in Britain is a very concrete move and could be done here.  The evidence in Britain is that it has served to reduce the medical costs.  Mr. Faughnan has made some very constructive suggestions that can be worked on immediately.</p><p> I thank Mr. Griffin for his presentation as well.  What formal engagement has he had with Insurance Ireland or individual insurers and what was the outcome of those discussions?  Many of his suggestions are focused on measures that lay the blame on consumers or on reducing potentially legitimate pay-outs.  I am a bit concerned that it goes back to consumers.  Why should they be asked to modify their behaviour or reduce their expectations without any explanation of what has changed?</p><p> I congratulate him on the work he is doing on behalf of young drivers.  I see how in rural communities, in particular, they cannot access employment because they will not get a job within a 10 mile radius of their home.  Young people are being forced onto schemes that are often outside their jurisdiction and there is the threat of having their social welfare taken from them if they do not participate in these schemes but there is no public transport to access them.  The situation feeds into poverty for young people who have already had their payments reduced but do not have equal opportunity to access employment, training and all the things that young people need to guarantee their futures.</p><p>  Mr. Moran outlined exactly what I have seen in a rural setting for elderly people.  It is one of the biggest contributory factors to the social exclusion of elderly people who have no public transport.  If the local post office and shop have been closed down, they need their cars to participate in society and to get their necessities.  He has the statistics for the number of elderly people involved in accidents and if that was broken down to show elderly people in rural areas, it would be reduced further.  I am gravely concerned about the isolation that the cost of insurance for elderly people, who are often dependent on a basic income of &euro;188 or &euro;200 a week, is causing. </p><p> I thank all the witnesses for their contributions.  They will feed in to the committee making some very valuable recommendations soon.</p></speech>

Realistically, there are only five competitors left in Ireland.  Others are retreating and the five left are trying to narrow their footprint.  We need foreign competition.  The Senator&rsquo;s point about regulation is strongly made but there was nothing foreign about Setanta.  The only foreign thing about it was its brass plate.  There were Irish directors with an Irish brand name selling Irish insurance to Irish customers.  It was regulated in Malta, poorly.  When it went broke, one of the questions we asked, and to which I have not heard a good answer, was why do we not send the bill to Malta?  It was asleep at the wheel.  It is beyond me why ultimately the Irish motorist should be picking up nearly &euro;100 million in additional costs on foot of the Setanta collapse.  The Senator should not let others in the conversation spin that into a notion that we cannot trust foreign regulated insurance companies.  These were Irish guys who caused the mess.  At the same time, I believe we have to correct the regulatory space.  There is an outcome from the Setanta situation which is preventing insurers from coming in and that is the notion that, through the insurance compensation fund, the insurers must pick up the tab if a domestic insurer fails.  That is asking an insurer to play Russian roulette with its competitors&rsquo; reliability.  I have said, by way of analogy, imagine that somebody tells Supermac's or McDonald&rsquo;s that if a guy selling hamburgers outside Croke Park gives a dozen people food poisoning, he will go broke and they will pay for that because they are also in the hamburger industry.  It is just illogical to expect an insurer to come into Ireland and start trading feeling that if one of its competitors acts recklessly and goes broke, it will have to pick up the bill.  We know that first-hand from a conversation a colleague of mine had last week with an insurance player which would like to get into Ireland but that hangover from the Setanta issue is preventing it from doing so.</p> <p>  The other strong point the Senator made was about legal costs.  I agree absolutely.  It is scandalous how much money is being hoovered out of the system by the legal professions involved in motor insurance claims and they are adding no value.  The Injuries Board was created to prevent the legal professions hoovering money out of the compensation fund and it has worked only to an extent.  The real solution, however, as I have said before, is around the book of quantum.  If the book of quantum is done correctly and the courts adhere to it, the incentive to get the lawyers involved fades away.  At the moment going into court is like a roulette wheel.  If the Injuries Board says an injury is worth &euro;15,000 or &euro;20,000, the person may or may not accept that but the solicitor is probably whispering in the client&rsquo;s ear that he or she should spin the roulette wheel and see how much can be made in court.</p><p>A number of rogue or bizarre court judgments were handed down a couple of years ago that have terrified insurance companies, which I can detail separately if the committee so wishes.  For example, in one case before the High Court in County Clare a couple of years ago, the plaintiff's lawyers expected to get &euro;150,000.  They tried to settle with the insurance company for &euro;150,000 but the view of the insurance claims assessor was that the claim was worth only &euro;60,000.  As they could not come to agreement, they went to court.  The award from the High Court was &euro;508,000.  The plaintiff thought he was getting &euro;150,000 and the insurance company thought it was only going to have to pay out &euro;60,000, yet the award by the court was &euro;508,000.  There are many similar awards, some of which may be overturned by the Court of Appeal in due course.  In the meantime, insurance underwriters have to examine their reserving across their back books.  They had to look at all of the risks they have on cover with a view to strengthening their reserves.  If the &euro;508,000 award is the new normal, insurance companies must increase premiums.  The real trick to cutting the legal professions out of this is to get the book of quantum standardised, relied upon and adhered to in court.  That pulls the ground out from under them.  I accept that there is a tremendous amount of money being wasted in this area.</p></speech>

I am due to meet Insurance Ireland in Limerick next month.  Organising official interaction is quite difficult because of where I am located and the amount of time I am working.</p> <p>  In regard to my comment about consumer behaviour, the point I was making is not that consumers should change their behaviour but that all stakeholders need to look at themselves.  Rather than pointing the finger in all different directions, I would like to see stakeholders collectively working together, be that motorists not viewing an accident as a potential windfall, solicitors not telling motorists they can secure windfalls for them, and the insurance companies, in the same way, not pointing the finger and trying to blame someone else.  All the stakeholders are at fault to some extent and this is adding to final costs.</p></speech>

Age Action runs an information line through which it is contacted on a variety of issues, including benefits and entitlements.  We get more calls from older drivers concerned about car insurance premiums from outside the major urban centres than from inside.  A constant concern for me is that people in their late sixties or early seventies will decide to take the chance and drive without car insurance to the village because it is only eight or nine miles and the route is not a busy one.  That is a road we do not want to go down.</p> <p>  I echo the point made about transparency.  Many of our members are often bewildered by the increase in their premiums.  Mr. Griffin made a point earlier about the age of a car not affecting a person's driving skill.  Many of the people who contact us are people whose insurance premiums increase significantly when they move from the 49 to 50 years or 64 to 65 years age brackets, despite the fact that they are the same driver they were the day before in terms of experience or inexperience, because premiums are based on age.  There are some very unhappy birthdays for people in the context of increased car insurance premiums which are way beyond what they can afford.</p></speech>

The Central Bank categorises AA Ireland as an intermediary.  To the man in the street, AA Ireland is a broker.  A broker records a person's risk details and shops around the market to get the best deal for him or her.  An intermediary will seek cover from an insurance underwriter <i>en bloc</i>.

The hub is something called the integrated insurance data system, IIDS.  Axa was the lead manager of this, under the auspices of Insurance Ireland, for a period. It was trying to maintain it and was sharing it with the Garda, which in turn was using it with its automated camera technology.  However, the database and the underlying data were so poor that the Garda found it was making errors up to 25% of the time, which is to say that it was unusable.  Consequently, the Garda was obliged to stop using it because it was unusable.  However, fixing it is something the insurance industry collectively could do quite readily.  The industry must do two things in this regard, and we have called it out in this regard.  First, it must finish building that database.  The same brand names - that is, the same organisations - have done this up the road in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain, but in the Republic of Ireland they state they cannot do it yet because it is complicated and because they have data protection concerns.</p></speech>

However, its ownership is vested with Insurance Ireland.  We have made two suggestions about it and this was part of our conversation last week with the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  First, the tranche of work must be completed, but we also suggest there should be some form of independent participation in the database.  We suggest that perhaps the Financial Regulator should have access to it and should police the proper population of the database by the insurance companies with their data.  Many of the insurance companies are willing in this regard.  One of our insurance partners has stated it is quite willing to be fined if it does not do this properly.  They would like to see it but it would be useful for a body like the Financial Regulator to have oversight in this regard.  Another really important element, which will seem absurd to members but which I assure them is true, is that the insurance industry must be willing to share that data with everybody involved.  This includes the brokers and intermediaries and any potential foreign underwriters that wish to come into Ireland to trade.  At present, I am afraid they are treating it rather like a gentleman's club and are stating that if one wants access to this, one must be proposed by one of the existing members.</p></speech>

What type of regulatory regime should be in place here that would bring other insurance providers into the market, thereby bringing about what would be termed a sustainable level in which insurance premiums for younger drivers, older drivers and other groups would decrease to a realistic level?  When responding to that, Mr. Faughnan might indicate whether a comparison of insurance premiums in the United Kingdom - I will not say mainland Europe - with those in Ireland has been undertaken.</p></speech>

Broadly speaking, if one winds the clock back approximately 15 years, an Irish insurance premium was between 80% and 100% more expensive than its British equivalent.</p></speech>

That was approximately 15 years ago, after which a number of things happened here.  The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, chaired by Dorothea Dowling, was put in place.  It produced what was then a seminal piece of work that still is immensely useful and that gave rise to the Injuries Board.  We also then had the growth in the Irish economy, which drew in a great deal of competition, which meant we then had a highly competitive landscape for a long time.  We had a ten-year period during which every year, year on year, the average Irish motor insurance premium fell.  On a constant currency basis, it probably has gone a bit silly recently, but at the start of 2014 we got to a stage at which an Irish motor insurance premium was approximately 40% cheaper than its equivalent in Great Britain.</p></speech>

While we are not the same organisation, our British equivalent organisation produces a motor insurance premium index quarterly and has done so over the years.  It produces what it terms a shop-around index, which is an index of competition for switchers, and there are other data in there as well.  Moreover, there are plenty of other data that will tell a similar story.  However, I would caution that while the British do some things very well and it is worth copying them - they are world leaders in road safety, for example - I do not think they are a best-case example when it comes to motor insurance.  They have a legal profession that is even more rapacious than its equivalent here.  If members ever find themselves watching British advertisements on daytime television, they will see it features "Injury lawyers for you" and all that sort of nonsense.  Moreover, they have a significant problem with claims farming and with a legal industry that is subtracting even more value from the equation.</p></speech>

Finally, in respect of Setanta and the regulation, what needs to be done to encourage providers to come in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.164" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Faughnan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090800002#H03800"><p>There are two different things.  One concerns paying for the Setanta mess and any future messes.  At present, it is envisaged that this essentially will get paid for by all other insurers.  That is a mess and entities will not enter a market that has such a rule in it.  If one wishes to trade in Ireland, one must bear in mind that as soon as one pitches camp in Ireland one now will be obliged to pay the bill if one's competitor does something stupid and goes bust.  That is not sustainable and must be fixed.</p> <p>  The other question is about regulation, and again, there is material in our document and in stuff we published last November.  The Irish Central Bank is inadequately resourced to be able to properly regulate the insurance industry.  While the Central Bank gets its guidance on that from the Government, if one wants to employ actuaries and people with significant technical expertise, one must be in a position to pay realistic salaries for that expertise.</p><p>If one does not have a budget to do any of that, one will not be physically able to do the amount of work that is needed to watch that property.  I said earlier that, collectively, the insurance industry settles about 70% of cases privately.  Some form of aggregated data on that is provided to the Central Bank but the Central Bank does not have the tools to be able to do the work that is necessary on that data provided.  Additional resources need to be provided to the Central Bank to enable it to employ the expertise it needs to do the work that needs to be done.  I have no principal objection to an insurance company that is regulated overseas trading in Ireland.  That is all good.  We are all members of a Single Market, but if the regulator overseas makes a complete hash of the job and falls asleep at the wheel, I do not know why Ireland Inc. would not sending a letter to Malta which states, "Dear Sirs, please find enclosed an invoice for &euro;100 million reflecting the fact that you did not regulate this insurance entity properly".  I still do not know why that has not been done.</p></speech>

We would also like clarity of pricing so that people can see exactly what they are paying for in that &euro;50 might be going towards the cost of claims, another &euro;50 towards insurance fraud or whatever.

It should not be set simply because somebody is 65 or 70 years of age if there is no actuarial data to support the fact that older drivers are dangerous drivers or riskier drivers.  As I outlined earlier, I do not believe that is in place.  The European Court of Justice found that setting premiums on the basis of gender was contrary to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p></speech>

To start with Mr. Faughnan and the AA, what is striking, and it confirms our empirical experience and, I am sure, that of the AA, is the survey which finds that of all the motoring issues car insurance is the No. 1 issue, with 93% of people saying it is the most important issue.  Mr. Faughnan used the formulation, which is useful, about car insurance companies trying to narrow their footprint, which gives a certain explanation that premiums have risen in general but then they have risen to a greater proportion among particular groupings.  It is clear that is younger drivers, older drivers and older cars.  Are there other groupings particularly affected by that?  What is the picture of those sectors that are particularly affected by the narrowing of the footprint?</p></speech>

Also, anybody who has a claim outstanding for any reason, and anybody with more than one penalty point incident.  It used to be the case that if someone had just one penalty point incident it did not affect their insurance hugely but it does now.</p> <p>  There is another smaller cohort about which I have had some conversations with people, namely, returning emigrants, which is a frustrating one because in terms of somebody who has a perfectly good driving history in Canada there is an assumption of risk.  That would be another group.</p></speech>

On the question of the older cars, and we have younger drivers and older drivers represented, what is the insurance company's justification for higher premiums for older cars?  I understand there can be a point in terms of older cars not having the same safety equipment - roll barriers and so on - inside the car that newer cars would have.  Is that it or is there another reason?</p></speech>

In our internal conversations it is one of the challenges we have had because it is somewhat counter intuitive.  There does not seem to be much logic to it so if I may I will try to explain without defending.  In part, insurance companies are not looking at the cars themselves <i>per se</i>but are using them as one of their profiling flags.  It is not so much that there is anything wrong with the car but if insurance underwriters look at their books and see that they have about 20% more older cars on them than their competitors, they will want to narrow their exposure to that and will refuse or price themselves out of the older car category to bring them back into line.  It is not to do with the car itself, which can be difficult to explain, but they are using it as a profiling mechanism.</p></speech>

Even if one's instincts are cynical and mercenary, the one thing one could trust them to do is to act in their own self-interest.  Why would their self-interest be served by that because if they are going to collect a premium from a driver, they will be very concerned as to how likely that driver is to make a claim.  They are not at all concerned as to the demographic the driver falls into, only in so far as it might help them profile the likelihood or otherwise of the driver making a claim.  The Deputy's point is correct, but that is an output rather than an input.</p></speech>

I find myself having this conversation frequently on radio phone-in programmes and so on.  What I give by way of an analogy, and it is a little trite, and I am not trying to be simplistic, is that they are a bit like bookies.  A bookie will not give someone the same odds on Dublin as he does on Leitrim, and there is no element of discrimination in that.  It is mercenary; it is actuarially calculated.  For a car of a given age, for whatever reason, my claims likelihood is "X" and that is 20% higher than my claims likelihood for a car that is of a younger age.  I can price accordingly without troubling myself about the "why".  When insurance companies do that, which they do because it is in the nature of how they calculate, inevitably that identifies incidents of unfairness.  That is a feature of the landscape.</p></speech>

I presume the figure of 20% used to be higher and that it has come down.  How does it work in practice?  How do they act in order to undermine it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Faughnan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090800002#J01600"><p>It may not be something they are consciously trying to do.  It is as much complacency as being complicit.  On whether that figure has diminished, the answer is "No".  The Injuries Board was undermined almost before it started.  A Supreme Court action was taken to ensure that a solicitor could be involved if the plaintiff wished.  At a stroke, that almost compromised the Injuries Board and now 96% of plaintiffs bring a solicitor with them.  That 20% figure, unfortunately, has been there for a long time.</p> <p>  In terms of the way it happens, because 70% of this data is hidden - this would be my speculation and I cannot claim to have wisdom here but I think it likely, and we have challenged insurers on this - if someone wants to make a claim the Injuries Board reckons they are worth &euro;20,000 or that is the best intelligent guess as to what it will recommend.  Their solicitor says, "We will go to the insurance company, tell them we want &euro;40,000 or we will go to court", and the insurance company will probably offer them &euro;27,000 or &euro;28,000 to make them go away.  Every time the insurance company does that it undermines the Injuries Board.  They are doing that because they are following their own self-interest, and we can trust them to do that.  If they knew that there is no element of a roulette wheel in court and if the Injuries Board says &euro;20,000 because that is what the book of quantum says and that is what a High Court judge will say to someone when they eventually get there, then the incentive is removed.  As I said earlier, if there is one variable in this that can fix it, it is probably that.</p></speech>

According to the blue book, over the past 20 years, something like &euro;2.86 billion in pre-tax profit has been made by insurance companies.  It is a lot of money.  Clearly, if the profit was taken out, that is a cost, at least in theory, that would not have to be paid by policyholders.  Has AA Ireland done any research?  I have not met many who have done research on alternative models, for example, in New Zealand, Canada and Australia.  Is that something AA Ireland has looked into?</p></speech>

I would be misleading the Deputy if I said I had done deep-dive analysis of this.  However, there is one general point I would make.  I guess a point of view that one could reasonably debate is whether one is better off having private operators seeking to get profit out of it because, at least in theory, that gives one competitive dynamics and efficiencies that can be played back in and from which the consumer can benefit.  That is one school of thought.  Alternatively, one might suggest not to have that but to have a system, perhaps like that in New Zealand, or some way, shape or form whereby this is a function that the State performs.  In theory, the State does not need a profit motive and, therefore, that is some money that can go back into the pool.  AA Ireland would be perfectly agnostic about that but if a State entity was doing this tomorrow in place of the existing insurers, we would still have the same problem.  We would be no better off.  Such a State agency would either fall on the taxpayers to make up its shortfalls, go broke or charge customers the sort of premiums that we are talking about today in that the fundamental reasons for high premiums are not because there is profit but because of other broken dysfunctional elements in our system.</p></speech>

It is a sense of hopelessness.  In most cases, people have exhausted all avenues in trying to shop around.  They have tried to see if they can get their insurance from a company based in Spain.  They have tried, for example, to see if they could get group insurance, if they got ten or 20 motorists together, to see if they could get a collective discount.  Many people have been sending me suggestions to perhaps try the no-fault system, which they have in New Zealand.  I have been sent quite a few documents on that.  The feedback I am getting is that people just do not know where to go or how to go about bringing their premium down.  It is a sense of hopelessness that is feeding into motorists consciously deciding to drive uninsured, which is feeding into the problem again.  It is starting quite a vicious circle.</p></speech>

That is certainly a sentiment.  Is it Mr. Griffin's assessment that they are correct to feel ripped off?  The Central Bank stated that younger policyholders continue to present the highest average surpluses, that is, for every &euro;1 in car insurance paid by younger drivers, the car insurance companies pay out less per &euro;1 in terms of claims.  Is that Mr. Griffin's experience?  Is that how people feel about it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kian Griffin" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090800002#K00900"><p>Young drivers have felt ripped off for quite a while because we have always been paying high premiums.  My own premium is over &euro;950 this year and some drivers I know are paying in excess of &euro;2,000 for premiums.  Some quotes sent in to me were &euro;14,000 or higher.  The percentage increase overall is no more or no less than that for older drivers but the end result is a much higher premium, for example, an increase on &euro;900 of 38% is much more than on &euro;200.  They definitely feel ripped off for no good reason.  Many drivers would see themselves as very safe drivers because they have been driving since the age of 17 and have had five years with no claims.  It is just the fact that they are in that age bracket.  It is easy to categorise them as a high risk and charge them a higher premium as a result.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1308" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090800002#K01000"><p>Finally, I have one question for Mr. Moran.  He presented a clear argument and case that there is no rational reason for the extra that older drivers are paying.  What is the position in other jurisdictions?  Do older drivers in other jurisdictions also pay over the odds or what is the comparative?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.192" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090800002#K01100"><p>It can vary, on age and jurisdiction.  For example, in Britain there is a company, Herts Insurance, which specifically targets drivers over the age of 80 because they are seen as safer drivers and they driver more slowly.  There are senior discounts available in the United States.  That tends to go up to maybe the age of 75 and at that point, the discount goes.  There are issues at that point that kick-in in terms of older drivers.</p> <p>  Part of the challenge is trying to understand how the premiums are arrived at and how they are determined.  For example, there is a phenomenon called low-mileage bias which was certainly prominent in terms of how insurance premiums were carried.  It was basically calculated that for the amount of distance an older person drove, he or she was more likely proportionately to have accidents.  This explains why one needed to pay higher insurance premiums.  Research discovered in the late 1990s and 2000s that the reason drivers are having those accidents is because they drive less, not because of their age, and that has a knock-on effect in the premiums that are set.  When one accounts for age, older drivers are not having more accidents.  The fact is that those who drive less, regardless of age, are more likely to have accidents.  It is seeing this research and then marrying this with the increases in the car insurance premiums that we find challenging.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.193" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090800002#K01200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Apologies for having to leave earlier.  I was attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.</p> <p>  I suppose we all are here having this discussion for the same reason.  We all share the view that there is no justification, at which anybody can arrive, for the current premium increases or for the discrimination in respect of younger and older people, in particular.  I would argue it is happening across all spectrums.  That is what I am picking up personally and from constituents.</p> <p>  While Mr. Faughnan raised the issue about the book of quantum, the database, etc., I accept that we should be doing everything we can to ensure that premiums are brought back in line with what is affordable and acceptable.  However, on the issues Mr. Faughnan and his colleagues raised that need to be put in place and should be sharpened up, I would argue that such might have been the case anyway going back over the last number of years.  It is not as if we have just said there is no book of quantum or database this year but there was two years ago.  I put it to Mr. Faughnan that the issues that need to be put right, sharpened up or brought into focus have probably existed for quite some time.  There is no justification for the premiums escalating at the rate they are.  Collectively, we should be doing everything we can to ensure all the measures needed are taken so that premiums are regulated.  However, what we need to put in place today was needed for some time but it is only in recent years that premiums have escalated out of control.</p> <p>  The increase in premiums is over 40% in some cases.  Nothing has changed in my personal circumstances, of which I am aware, but my premium has increased by 40%.  A lady with a full licence in her early 30s who came to my office had to drop her insurance for the past two years as she had no work.  She went to get a quote two months ago and was quoted &euro;3,200 for driving an eight year old Mini.  Not to discriminate against the Mini - it is not a flash car - but it is not a BMW or a Merc.  It is completely unacceptable.</p> <p>  I could understand if one's premium was more expensive than that of anyone in this room because one might have many penalty points, a previous conviction or whatever.</p><p>If premiums were higher for individual policy holders based on their individual circumstances, we would not be having this debate because the increase would be related to a particular incident or issue, but this is widespread throughout all age groups in society irrespective of one's history or situation.  It is absolutely unacceptable.  The people spoken about by Mr. Griffin and Mr. Moran are now socially vulnerable, particularly the elderly on minimum pensions who cannot afford the increase.  As a result they are becoming socially excluded.  Young people feel victimised, leading to all types of social issues and this is a problem.  Shopping around is not an option.  I have shopped around and it is like a cartel.  A policy will vary by only &euro;50 or &euro;60, if at all.  There is no competition.  It seems a decision was made - I am not saying this is the case - to go high.</p><p> I ask Mr. Faughnan to comment on the following point.  My information may not be accurate but I understand claims in 2011 were &euro;1.5 billion and claims in 2014 dropped to &euro;1.01 billion, but this is being used as an excuse for an increase in premiums, which is unacceptable.  Approximately two months ago, along with my colleagues I attended the launch by Deputy McGrath of his proposal to deal with this issue.  He advocated the return of the motor insurance advisory board.  When it was in place it managed and regulated premiums pretty well, bar cases with individual circumstances.  Should we focus on reintroducing this?  It went out of play in 2013.  Should we focus on putting it back in play?  Deputy McGrath is very focused on this.  It might assist with the current issue, which is very much out of control.</p></speech>

Claims frequency is one thing, but the cost of settling individual claims has increased.</p></speech>

Injuries make up approximately 70% of the overall claims cost and, unfortunately, this has increased over the past two years.  It might seem like a small movement, but it has increased from 0.8% to 1%.  This 0.2% movement equates to approximately 5% to 7% in the rate.  The average claims cost for injuries is approximately &euro;40,000 and for accidental damage it is approximately &euro;1,500.  It is correct that claims have reduced but, unfortunately, the overall claims cost has increased in recent years.</p></speech>

I completely agree with Deputy O'Rourke that the insurance industry collectively is pointing to many things which are true but not new.  It is true that an Irish whiplash case tends to result in a more generous settlement than is the case in the UK.  In Ireland, it is approximately &euro;15,000 and in the UK, it is approximately &euro;5,000.  In continental Europe, it is much less again.  Unsurprisingly, this means Irish people claim more often for whiplash than they do in other jurisdictions.  There is the old joke that we appear to have very weak necks in Ireland.  All of these issues have been around for a long time.  They go some way towards explaining why insurance is expensive but they do not do anything to explain why it has got so much worse in the past two years and this is a very strong point make.</p> <p>  With regard to the notion of being able to shop round and whether there is a cartel, people are aware this is a criminal allegation and I have no evidence of any type to support it.  I do not believe it is true.  It is a funny old industry in a way.  One sells a product today and one will find out over the next seven years what it cost to manufacture the product and whether it was done profitably or not.  It can be slightly false to look at one trading year and state it was a good year and the insurance guys are laughing, because the next year could see claims mature and what was thought to be profit two years ago ceases to be when claims work their way through the pipeline.  In 2014, several factors combined to worsen the scenario for insurance companies.  We have mentioned Setanta and there was also an increase in the amount of compensation that can be paid by the courts at various levels.  This made a significant difference because it increased court awards.  When this happened, it made people more likely to go to court.  This is slightly cynical, but there was an increase in the number of minor injuries reported.  This is not a huge surprise; the courts pay out more for minor injuries and, bizarrely, this seems to lead to more minor injuries happening.  These factors occurred in combination.  Deputy O'Rourke is definitely right to take a jaundiced view of the industry pointing to factors that are as old as the hills and stating they are what led to an increase in the past two years, because there is clearly a disconnect there.</p></speech>

We all accept and agree there is no justification for the widespread and widescale increase which has occurred to the level it is at present.  Someone in their early 30s who has had insurance for years and let it lapse can now be quoted &euro;3,300 for a policy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.199" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Faughnan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090800002#L00600"><p>There is a mechanism under the declined cases agreement.  It is a legal obligation to have insurance and if an insurance company declines people, they can get a letter stating they have been declined.  An artificially high quote can be considered tantamount to refusal to quote.  There are mechanism to correct this, but evidently the insurance company does not want the business.  This comes to us a lot in our engagement with AA members and motorists and, very often, with the sons and daughters of AA members and motorists.  We are regularly asked how it can be just because people's circumstances have not changed, they continue to have no penalty points or claims, they drive the same car and are in the same occupation so why has their price increased by 30%.  The answer is not particularly pleasant but there is some validity to it.  Insurance is a pool of money.  Everybody pays into the pool so that when anybody needs to draw out of the pool, the money is there.  If the money being drawn out of the pool increases because there are more claims, claims have become more expensive, legal costs have increased or there must be insurance against the failures of others, it means more money is drawn out of the pool.  If more money is drawn out of the pool then innocent participants, whose circumstances have not changed at all, will still have to pay more.  This is just nature of how insurance works.  This is why the recent price rises are being felt not only by individual groupings, but by 2 million Irish motorists.</p> <p>  In terms of scale of the damage, if we consider that 2 million Irish motorists pay premiums at present and if, typically, individuals report their price has increased by &euro;300, and there will be some cases where it is significantly worse and others who will feel as though they are getting away with it, but if we conservatively state it is &euro;300 per motorist this amounts to &euro;600 million per annum, which is an astonishing amount of money.  Let us think about what could be done with this money if it were all put in one spot.  It is extraordinary.  To me this is the size of the prize.  This is what can be fixed.  We published reform proposals last November and we are still banging on about them.  Last week, I discussed them with the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy.  Even if the reforms were carried through we may still wind up paying more for insurance than we did three years ago, and we may still grumble about it, but at least all we would be paying for is insurance and not insurance plus fraud plus waste plus lawyers plus a failure to modernise and everything we are paying for at present.</p></speech>

The big problem is the huge increases over the past two or three years.

How do we compare with other European countries?  Have claims increased significantly more here than in other countries in the past three years and, if so, is this reflected in the increase in premiums?  I wonder how all this squares.</p></speech>

In some countries, for example, in cases involving a catastrophic injury, the cost of long-term care for the individual in question and whatever other costs arise are socialised.  Given that these costs must be paid in any case, it is merely a question of how it is paid.  However, if one has a model in which the state's health service picks up this cost, which is fine, this cost does not need to be paid for by private motor insurance.  As the same things are not being insured, it is difficult to have a meaningful like for like comparison for a unit of motor insurance in Ireland versus Sweden, for example.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, the United Kingdom is the country that best mirrors the position in Ireland.  I use the word "unfortunately" because it may appear lazy to only look at the neighbours.  Moreover, the UK also has problems in the insurance industry.  As I indicated, I would not hold it up as an example of best practice.  </p> <p>  The Deputy also asked whether there had been anything in our claims frequency in the past couple of years that would mark us out as different from other European jurisdictions.  There appears to be evidence that the total number of catastrophic crashes and material damage injuries have not changed significantly in Ireland, whereas the total number of minor injury claims has increased significantly.</p></speech>

The average pay-out for whiplash is approximately &euro;15,000 in Ireland, whereas it is approximately &euro;3,000 in France and Germany.  We have a much higher number of whiplash and minor muscle injury claims and we pay out five times more than other European countries.</p></speech>

Every one present is in agreement that there is a problem that needs to be tackled by the joint committee, the insurance industry, the working group and the Minister.  After six days of deliberations, we will all know what are the problems.  While many of them have been evident for some time, no one has tackled them.  If there are only five major players left in the insurance industry, it must be in their interests to eliminate fraud and reduce dangerous claims and vexatious behaviour.  There must, therefore, be a benefit in sharing information.  It is being done in other jurisdictions for a reason, namely, that it is of benefit to the insurance companies.  I do not understand why it is not considered to be in everyone's interest to root out the bad people who are costing everybody else money.</p> <p>  I am in the same position as everybody else.  My car is getting older, as am I, and I do not drive long distances yet my insurance premium has increased by exactly 33.3%, which is similar to the increases experienced by many others.  I use the services of AA Ireland, which are perfectly good, but the quote is always higher than the premium I ultimately pay.  I presume that is the case with everyone.  The Chairman stated yesterday that it is up to all of us to shop around and telephone our insurance provider to have the data it holds on us reviewed.  I am not doing anything different from what I did previously.  I have not made claims, nor have I incurred penalty points, yet my insurance premium has increased by one third.  I assume many other members are paying similar increases.  </p> <p>  I will cite an example that is worse than any of those cited by Mr. Faughnan.  I know of a person who was paying an insurance premium of &euro;800 and was quoted a premium of &euro;1,360 having turned 80 years.  This is an increase of 70% on what was already a relatively high premium.  The person in question did not make a claim in the previous 12 months and rarely drives in the evenings, on motorways or for long distances.  This individual makes short trips of between one and three miles in the local area.  Insurers were required to stop discriminating between men and women.  I do not understand why the relevant legislation permits discrimination on the basis of age.  Why can this not be challenged?  If one cannot discriminate on the basis of gender, why can insurance companies continue to discriminate on the basis of age, even if there may be statistical reasons for doing so?</p> <p>  I congratulate Mr. Griffin on the work he is doing on behalf of younger drivers.  We were all younger drivers once.  Motor insurance for younger drivers featured very strongly in the 1997 general election campaign during which I helped a certain Deputy.  The issue was all over the "Liveline" programme which was hosted by Marian Finucane at the time.  The costs of premiums for young drivers were phenomenal at the time.  We thought the issue had been addressed subsequently but it has now re-emerged.</p> <p>  Every uninsured driver puts himself, herself and everyone else at risk.  I am also concerned that the sum uninsured drivers should pay for insurance, however significant, is not being put into the pot, which results in premiums increasing for everyone else.  </p> <p>  Mr. Faughnan made the point that insurance companies are being asked to pick up the tab for other people.  I assume any company that enters a market will try to win customers from its competitors.  By default, therefore, a new entrant will damage the business of other companies in the industry.</p></speech>

A commercial entity will enter a market that has not significantly expanded.  Car sales may have increased but new cars by and large replace older cars.  They are generally not all bought by new drivers.  Although some people turning 18 years of age will join the market, people at the other end will also leave the market.  We have a long history of insurance companies going wallop.  Cases include PMPA, ICI, Quinn Insurance and Setanta Insurance.  Everyone else is expected to pick up the tab when companies fail.  Ultimately, however, the people picking up the tab are not the insurance companies but drivers with an insurance policy.</p></speech>

Insurance companies state clearly that increases in premiums are justified because insurance awards are higher.  While the number of claims may not have increased, they have become more expensive.  We have transparency in cases that go through the system but we do not know whether legal costs account for 90% or 40% of the cost of claims settled outside the courts system.</p> <p>  On an annual basis and expressed in percentages, what proportion of drivers make a claim?  Is it 5%, 15% or 25%?  What is the average cost of a motor insurance premium?  I accept that averages are simplistic.</p></speech>

Approximately 1% of insured drivers will claim for injury, approximately 3.5% will claim for accidental damage and a further 3.5% will claim for third party damage.  The average cost of an injury claim is between &euro;35,000 and &euro;40,000, while the average cost of accidental damage and third party damage cases is approximately &euro;1,500.

In this regard, one must consider where the insurance companies are incentivised.  They are acutely incentivised to understand how much fraud costs and they are certainly incentivised to ensure they are not more exposed than their competitors.  However, provided they can put a number on it and charge the punter, they are not incentivised to fix the problem.</p><p>If one understands the problem very deeply, but one's potential competitor from overseas has not got a clue, then one is still less incentivised to fix it.  I would take the view that the industry is not being cynical, it is just following its self-interest, but it is acutely aware of how to cost this.  For reasons of genuine citizenship and frustration with the whole thing, it does share many of our broad concerns and would like to see it fixed if handed a wand, but it is not actually incentivised to fix it.  That may be part of the problem.</p><p> The other issue, which may or may not be heretical, in the context of using age as a weighting factor, the AA took the view that the gender directive as regards motor insurance was a mistake.  It has probably been one of the factors pushing up prices overall.  Sometimes in this country the words "equality" and "fairness" get used as if they mean the same thing.  They do not mean the same thing and are often mutually incompatible.  Insisting that there is no such thing as gender is actually unfair to females, particularly young females, because the long-term consequence of it is the systematic overcharging of young females to fund the systematic undercharging of young males.  While both groups are going up to an unacceptable extent, gender bakes in an unfairness.</p></speech>

He quoted an individual who had come to him, who had gone from the age of 79 to 80.  One of the issues that is constantly raised by our members is that over the age of 70 they are going for a medical test every year.  They are paying for a medical test every year to ensure they get a certificate from the doctor saying that they are fit to drive.  They do not get any feedback from insurance companies that this is factored in.  There is a group of people who are getting tested medically every year to ensure they are safe to be on the roads.  I would have thought, although I do not have the technical expertise possessed by some of the people here who are in the industry, that if somebody is getting tested every year like that, it would have a positive effect on their premium, which our members are not seeing.</p></speech>

That was a mistake.  As a young male driver, I would be the one to be targeted.  That was a mistake because they are pricing young female drivers in the same way as young male drivers.  We would have the same issue then if we challenged the age discrimination - they might price older drivers as having the same risk as younger drivers - so I am not confident that this would be the ideal way to go.  Some of the people I represent would probably not like me saying that, but targeting it across the full spectrum would not be the ideal way to go.</p></speech>

They took their premium money, they invested it badly or unwisely, it lost value and we are now being asked to stump up for it.  Is there any data to suggest whether that is the case?</p></speech>

There are regulatory rules around what one does with investment income.  If an insurance company takes &euro;500 or &euro;1,000 off me for a premium, it has to reserve that and must invest it prudently, so it cannot go and play the stock market with it.  The return on those investments has diminished very significantly, as did the rate of return on all sorts of investments, a bit like with the discount rate, so Government bonds and so on-----</p></speech>

We had a crisis in the late 1990s, which led to the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and then the Injuries Board.  In a funny way we never truly solved the problem, but the enabling sense of crisis disappeared.  Incomes rose, the economy prospered, the total number of policies went up.  Then we had very intense competition, which became hyper-competition, which became stupid competition, which then went broke.  Through all of that, we never really solved the problem.</p> <p>  What was done around the same time, and the other big issue I have been lobbying on in my professional life, was road safety.  Huge strides were made in that respect over this period.  We had our first road safety strategy and millennium goals and all the things we are now familiar with, such as penalty points, the Garda traffic corps and blood alcohol tests, modern roads and speed limits and that sort of stuff.  All of those improvements came on stream, which organically reduced the cost of claims.  Road investment in motorways led to a reduction in risk per mile travelled.  Many factors swung in our favour.</p> <p>  Back in the 1990s, the problem was actually diagnosed.  A solution was put in place via the Injuries Board.  The solution was undermined.  It never truly worked, but a whole host of other factors swung in our favour and it ceased to be the crisis that it was.  What we are now discovering, as the tide goes out, is that problems we correctly identified 20 years ago were not fixed.  There is still an insane amount of legal cost in the system, there is still too much fraud-----</p></speech>

It is hard to put one's finger on it, but I would compare it to the road safety critiques that we were making in the past.  One of the problems with road safety at the time was that it did not have a single owner; it had multiple actors.  There were those responsible for road engineering, the National Roads Authority, NRA, the Garda, the Department of Transport, the Department of Justice, all of which were stakeholders.  Everybody was full of opinions as to what the other guy needed to do, but there was no one person in charge.  There was not at that time a Minister with Cabinet responsibility for road safety with a set of goals and actions stapled to the brief.  That is one of the things that was improved and one of the real reasons progress was made.  If one compares that to motor insurance, there is a similar set of issues.  There are 2 million stakeholders, but in terms of the actors who affected it, this committee is talking to 22 or 23 different voices.  They are all relevant.  The document that we supplied to this committee is an evolution of a document that we published in November of last year.  We have identified actions under five different headings, but there are different people who have to take those actions.  There are some things that the Minister for Justice and Equality can do, there are some things that the Garda can do, there are some things that the Department of Finance and the regulatory regime can do and there are certainly things that the industry can do, but one of the central problems is that there is no one owner who has to deliver each of these actions.</p></speech>

As we said - and I totally agree with the Chairman - data protection just seems to be an excuse for inertia.  However, the other European jurisdictions, including our British neighbours, are obeying the same data protection principles as we are, so if they can do it, why cannot we?  I cannot give the Chairman a good answer to that but I believe that it can be fixed.  I believe the companies can be compelled to do it and, as we said earlier, what I would like to see specifically as regards the database, and what the AA would like to see, is definitely for the regulator to be involved there and to compel all of the insurers to properly put their information onto the database, which is not terribly hard, and fine them if they do not.  One of our underwriting partners has said that it is willing to be fined for not doing it-----</p></speech>

If solicitors or legal representatives working through the PIAB were able to get their legal costs there as part of the settlement rather than the claimant having to pay, if it were all part of the settlement, would that not encourage them to settle through the PIAB rather than encouraging a client to go further with barristers and everything else, thereby adding substantially to the legal cost?</p></speech>

I have rammed the back of your car and you have an injury.  I have no dispute in this.  All we need to establish is the appropriate level of financial compensation.  For no-fault cases it was envisaged that there would never be a lawyer involved.  I am not sure if it was the Law Society or an individual but, in any case, a case was taken disputing this and insisting that a client could bring his or her solicitor if he or she wished.  That case happened in the opening months of the Injuries Board's existence and was successful in the Supreme Court, which found that if a person wants to bring a solicitor with him or her, he or she must be allowed to.  The Injuries Board's response to that was to state that one can bring one's solicitor if one wishes but that in a no-fault case the position is that legal representation is not needed and if one wishes to bring a solicitor, it is one's prerogative to do so but is also at one's own expense because there are no legal costs incurred in the Injuries Board.  That is its position.  However, as I said previously, the fix to this is to take away the incentive to ignore the Injuries Board.  The reason people ignore the Injuries Board is that there are more goodies available elsewhere. One can go and haggle with the insurance company-----</p></speech>

If one removes the incentive and if we have a book of quantum which is the same whether one tries to haggle with the insurance company or tries to have a go in court, one will still only get what the book of quantum says.  In that scenario I think we will then see people use the Injuries Board.</p></speech>

Whether one would do something as crude as applying the CPI to it or whether there are other metrics and correctors one can put in, it would probably have to be a continually reviewed living document.  What is of critical importance - we said this earlier - is that one cannot compel courts to do anything in the democracy that we have, but it will be as an outcome absolutely vital for courts to abide by the book of quantum because the moment they deviate from it, it undermines the entire mechanism.</p></speech>

A rating structure for an insurer is not the same for, say, the AA.  We add extra data to the equation.  For example, we would tell our members how often they break down and what car they have.  We add extra information which allows an insurer to give a more accurate price.  Accordingly, there will be different prices for someone who goes to the AA and to the direct players.  In many cases, the AA will be cheaper than the direct player.  It is not a profit margin equation.  Where we add our value is that we have much more data.</p></speech>

That was the cost of equipping the Garda fleet with the cameras and the physical capability of polling the database.  The underlying enabler for that is obviously the quality of the database itself.  There is no point in providing the Garda with a tool that gets it wrong 20% of the time.  They cannot use that.</p></speech>

That information is sitting somewhere.  Every time one drives past a Garda car, his dashboard should go &ldquo;Ping&rdquo;.  There is no good reason that this is not the case.  The windscreen discs are actually counting against this.  They are actually facilitating fraud.  We have more fraud because we have windscreen discs.  We are kidding ourselves with windscreen discs to demonstrate a car is insured.  It is actually causing uninsured driving.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses, Mr. Dermott Jewell and Mr. Raymond O'Rourke, from the Consumers' Association of Ireland.  I remind you that you are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you are to give this committee.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or identifiable.  That is a bit of housekeeping.  I propose that the witnesses give an opening statement and then members will have some questions.  We will take it from there.</p></speech>

It is wonderful to be able to contribute because this is such an extraordinarily important area.  We are really glad that the committee is focusing on this.</p> <p>  Over the past 18 months so much has been written outlining the difficulties, the causes and the background issues, yet very little of it is substantiated by pure data.  This was a case some years ago.  The fact that there is no independently verified data or detail makes this a great difficulty.  I am very conscious that every member here will have heard and read much about the difficulties experienced by motorists.  I will introduce our position on this.  We have been trying to create a level of interest in it since early 2013.  We wrote to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in 2015.  The reason we wrote to that Minister was that that was the Department that initiated and established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.  Members can see where we were going with this; we were trying to point out the very significant - at that time, double-digit - increases that motorists were experiencing.  Even then it was proving to be something of an affordability issue as well as a question of value for money.</p> <p>  In 2015 providers across the industry were making the point that increases were a necessity because, as is generally suggested, it was to do with the cost of claims, the cost of legal practitioners' fees, the level of court awards, and the age and condition of the vehicles.  It was everything except anything to do with the industry.  That is not to say that it is, but it still raises the question: "If you are going to say that, can you not please provide the clear, clinical data to allow us all to understand this?"  That has been the main thrust of where we were.</p> <p>  The Injuries Board, in its 2015 annual review, outlined its concerns about the cost of claims.  It made the point that it was very far from its comprehension of the market and the statements from the industry did not in any way indicate a necessity for increases resembling those that were coming forward.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was reported to have indicated that there was a higher risk to road safety from older cars.  The Injuries Board made the point that that did not match its evaluation of the situation.  Motorists or consumers then started to question the validity of the national car test because they were spending significant amounts of money to maintain their vehicles, putting their cars through the national car test and passing the test, yet they were told they were not viable vehicles to insure any longer.  There is a great loss to the consumer there.</p> <p>  In our letter, we referenced the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.  In 1984, the then Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board (Establishment) Order, which formed the basis for the 1998 formation of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.  We then quoted extracts from the Act to indicate that they are totally fit for purpose today.  They work; they give the power, they give the strength, and they ask for the independence to do what is necessary to understand this market.  As a result of that, many good things came in the 2002 report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.  There were 67 recommendations, most of which have been implemented.  It was due to the work of that board that consumers for the first time got a renewal notice well in advance to allow them to look around the market - to shop around.  That is what made that possible.  They could not do it previously.  They struggled even to get a renewal certificate and certainly a no-claims discount certificate.  Much has changed since then, and a new approach is needed.  To bring it right up to date in 2016, we have made the point that there is a need for re-establishment of some form of board resembling the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, because it was an independent structure.  It had representatives, literally, from every agent and actor engaged in the provision or purchase of motor insurance, and it was excellent.  Good people came around and figured out what the problems were.  I am not saying it is not in train at the minute, but it needs to be taken into a greater context.</p> <p>  Not much happened because the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation now is not responsible for transport, and our letter was sent to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, but there was a change in government and everything got pushed aside and delayed; we acknowledge that.  The point was made to us in a response from the Department that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission issued a report indicating that there is plenty of competition in the market.  We acknowledge that there is plenty of competition in the market, but at outrageous and ever-increasing rates that many people just cannot afford.  The key element of this is that this insurance is legally required; one must have it.  It is not logical to say to anybody that one must have something regardless of how expensive it might be.  It is certainly not what would be, even in good governance circles, an honest message to pass on to a citizen.</p> <p>  So, where are we?  We have got the worries about that.  Many consumers have gone for cheaper alternatives.  The problem is, as much of the media has reported in the past two weeks, that many consumers who are seeking to get the best deal they can have approached providers that are not resident in this jurisdiction.  For example, Gibraltar is home to 11 of 24 foreign insurers operating in the Irish motor market.  We have already had difficulties coming through a number of those companies, and that is just at the early stage.  Most recently, one of them announced it would not take any new business.  There is a problem here.  The problem is in the cost of claims.  If we are to take that on board, it is fair enough.  These organisations are allowed to trade in Ireland if they have a compensation scheme, but they do not operate one.  There is a reliance on us to provide, and the motorists who are already experiencing additional costs from the cost of claims and everything else will now potentially be asked to foot many more bills for claims from companies that just walked away, went back home and left the Irish motorist in a very poor condition.</p> <p>  In the past ten or 14 days, another issue of significant concern in this market was reported to us.  It was pointed out to us that certain members of Civil Service employee unions were in receipt of significant discounts.  To have that level of discount challenges the market that was already challenged when it came, for example, to giving lower rates for female drivers.  The European Commission stepped in to stop that.</p><p>Where insurance is a legal requirement, subsidisation like that must be reviewed without delay because it is discriminatory.  It is entirely separate to a no-claims bonus, to which everybody is entitled.  If we cannot all access the same discounts, then there is a very real problem that is open to both appeal and sanction.</p></speech>

I was contacted by an ex-employee who is now a member of the journalism fraternity who was shocked to find that, having changed jobs, she was now at a significant disadvantage because she could not access the discount.  The increase in her insurance premium, to the best of my memory, was just under &euro;300.  It was pointed out to her that the increase would only be &euro;73 had she still been in the union.</p></speech>

There are various public sector organisations, as well as associations involving, for example, chartered accountants and so forth.  There are various groups out there.  Is that the kind of scheme to which he refers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.313" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermott Jewell" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090800002#Y00800"><p>It seems to be.  I raise it because it is another factor that must be examined by an independent body to determine whether it is reasonable.  It must be looked at because many motorists are at a disadvantage in the sense that they do not have access to such schemes.  If one takes the example of health insurance, members of group schemes are entitled to a discount but individual consumers are also entitled to ask for that same discount and can receive it from insurers.  In that context, it makes sense to bring a review body together, similar to the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, for a fixed term of no more than 12 months.  A lot could and should be done in that period, particularly by picking up threads from others who are currently working on and engaged in this area.  The body should be able to look at any and all increases in premiums.</p> <p>  Access to information is vitally important.  What happened with the last MIAB was that all of the data from the insurers was anonymised.  The data was then provided to an individual who was able to analyse it and come up with a set of statistics, based on pure data, on costs and problems.  If a new analysis of the data were to find that the problem is indeed the cost of claims or the age of vehicles, that would be great because it would restore confidence in the market, something which is missing right now among motor insurance customers.  It would also enable those in the industry to say that they are doing their best and to ask what else they can do.  An independent analysis will allow for a better understanding of all of the factors giving rise to increased motor insurance premiums.  </p> <p>  While I am consistently referring to the MIAB, I must point out that I am just using it as an example of a body that could be reconvened.  The legislation can be re-enacted, made workable and moved upon.</p></speech>

I found their contribution very interesting and welcome the submission they made to the committee.  It is a welcome tonic in the face of some of the absurd claims that are being made about the reasons behind the hikes in insurance costs.  The witnesses have made a powerful case that the insurance industry has many of the characteristics of a cartel.  It does not share information, it has been censored by the Competition Authority for signposting increases and has been accused of exclusionary tactics.  Do the witnesses agree that the industry displays some of the characteristics of a cartel?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses think that the Financial Services Ombudsman should be playing a more proactive role in this?  In a report published last year, the Law Reform Commission proposed a number of changes to protect consumers entering into insurance contracts.  Is there a legal way to empower consumers from day one, when signing on the dotted line?  Is there currently an imbalance in favour of the insurer in standard contracts?  </p> <p>  We all agree that the data issue must be fixed as soon as possible.  Where are the blockages in that regard?  </p> <p>  While this committee is looking at motor insurance, it will not have escaped anyone's attention that house and health insurance premiums are also on the increase.  My party believes that the increase in motor insurance prices is mainly due to changes in the investment environment.  If so, it is only a matter of time before the other insurance sectors catch up.  Have the witnesses looked into that issue?  </p></speech>

As long as the industry continues to refuse to share data, it will remain open to the charge of operating like a cartel.  I know it is an exceptionally serious claim to make against any industry or sector and I would be concerned that such a claim might result in the attitude of the industry becoming even more entrenched.  That said, access to data has been an issue since the beginning of this century and in that sense, the industry must take the criticism on the chin.  I would consider the attitude of the industry to be more than a little entrenched at present and a strong regulatory approach may have to be taken.</p> <p>  On the question of the involvement of the Financial Services Ombudsman, I must first state that I am the chairperson of the Financial Services Ombudsman Council.  The Senator's point is well made but the ombudsman's office can only accept claims when all other avenues for resolution have been exhausted.  Furthermore, it can only act on receipt of a complaint.  Consumers can complain about the cost of insurance premiums but must also have a basis and foundation for such complaints and as I have already said, access to data is key.  The Financial Services Ombudsman does not even have access to the data, which is a matter of concern.  The issue is not how much consumers are paying but the underlying reasons for the increase in the amounts they are paying and none of us knows what they are.  We will all go home this evening and still not know the underlying reasons.  </p> <p>  The Senator is entirely correct with regard to the Law Reform Commission and we must acknowledge the value of its report.  However, as is the case with so many reports, its recommendations have not been acted on and it is lying on a shelf somewhere.  Indeed, many reports have fallen off the shelf and into a bin.  Too often we do not see the action that is needed on foot of reports.  We have an opportunity now to act, particularly with regard to motor insurance.  </p> <p>  The Senator is correct about the imbalance because at the moment, the entire emphasis of the providers is on bundling.</p><p>This approach confuses the price the customer is paying.  Is one service very cheap and the other very expensive?  It is very difficult to tell whether this is a way of clouding the matter.  It is problematic.  I will hand over to Mr. O'Rourke now.  We are worried about everything that has been said about the cost factor, and particularly what has been said about organisations moving in, selling the businesses and moving out.</p></speech>

As I served as the chair of the Financial Regulator's consumer panel some years ago, I have a little experience in this area.  I was appalled to learn that 11 of the 24 foreign insurers come from Gibraltar.  We have had problems with Malta as well.  When I investigated this, I found that the issues with Gibraltar are arising in much the same way as some of the issues we are hearing about in the context of Brexit.  I refer, for example, to the passporting issues that enable people to come into the UK in a kind of roundabout way.  Members will be familiar with EU law.  I am also involved in the food area, where there is total harmonisation.  The law starts in Brussels and that is it.  The consumer area has never been like that.  Some countries, including the UK and the Scandinavian countries, have higher consumer protections than southern member states like Greece and Spain.  There is always a kind of compromise.  The basic things have to be done.  I will explain the basic things that happen when a product comes from Gibraltar.  I am trying to recall a commercial business term that is applicable in this context.</p></speech>

I think the committee could make a statement in this area.  My mother was an insurance broker many years ago when PMPA went to the wall and a compensation fund had to be introduced.  The legislation in Ireland is very strong.  The committee could argue that it wants this to continue and therefore could propose that any business which operates in this country, regardless of whether it is passporting, must link in with a compensation fund.  Gibraltar does not have such a fund.  There are issues about whether it should link in with the fund here.  The committee could propose that nobody should be allowed to sell insurance in this country without being able to demonstrate that it is linked in with a compensation fund.  Members might be concerned that Brussels would not allow such an approach to be pursued, but I am of the view that Brussels will allow it as long as people are not locked out of markets and the rules of the Single Market are respected.  Nobody will be locked out if the approach I am suggesting is chosen.  Ireland gives an extra protection to its consumers because there is a history in the Irish marketplace of companies going to the wall.</p> <p>  I am always amused to hear public bodies emphasising the need to shop around.  The Financial Regulator used to say this and now the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is saying it.  Consumer lawyers think shopping around is great because it allows people to get the product, etc., but one does not find out whether that product is worth what it should be worth until things go wrong.  That is the sad thing about a large number of the 11 Gibraltar companies and the Malta companies that have come in.  When a company like that comes in, it is great for a while because it gives people cheap insurance or does stuff for farmers, young people or women.  When it suddenly hits the fan, everybody stands back and says nothing can be done because the matter is so complex.  I suggest that something can be done by demanding that there is always a compensation fund for motor insurance companies in Ireland.  That should apply regardless of whether the company is Finnish, Swedish or Greek.  We need to provide that when a insurance company comes into the Irish market, it needs to have a compensation fund.  I do not believe such a requirement would cause any problems in Brussels because its aim would be to protect consumers.</p></speech>

Some of them would be based online.  This is the issue.  Mr. Conor Faughnan is probably referring to belt-and-braces companies that are based in buildings when he says there are just five players in the market.  Many companies come into the market in other ways.  I am aware from my brokerage background that they may be sold in certain brokerages rather than in the high street.  This is how they come into play.  Maybe they concentrate on certain segments of the market, such as farmers or hauliers.</p></speech>

It is all about data and the lack of them.  Everyone has stories and anecdotes about stuff, but we do not know if it is factually correct.  We have been here before in 1984, 1992, the late 1990s and the early 2000s.  It is very frustrating for us as we seek to act on behalf of our electorate and the country.  We kind of sort it and then it all seems to go awry again.  We hear that legal costs and medical costs are increasing or that there is more whiplash here than anywhere else.  The recommendations in the assessment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board sound very positive.  What do the witnesses hope will happen after we have identified all the problems?  Nearly all the 67 solutions were implemented the last time.  What solutions need to happen this time?  What needs to be implemented if we are to bring about a reduction in the rate of increase or, ideally, a drop in insurance costs?</p></speech>

We have the capacity and the expertise.  It is not that long ago that I was speaking to the actuarial individual who took all of the data.  He is more than happy to do it again.  He just needs to be given the data and he can deal with it.  This will not happen overnight because it is not an easy task.  There is a mountain of figures, but he can do it.  We have the expertise.  The Chair is entirely right when he says that if we brought someone in to ascertain what exactly the underlying element is - bringing in a team of people would probably make it quicker - it would be money very well spent.</p> <p>  I would like to give a direct answer to the Chair's requests.  He is entirely right.  It is all very fine hearing all the problems.  We know them.  What can we do?  It would be better if we knew what to do.  A great deal has changed.  There was a difficulty with the reserves many years ago, as the Chair has correctly mentioned, but that improved.  Then we had another difficulty and now the reserves are not good for the industry providers.  There is no question about that.  It is the same all over.  We acknowledge that interest rates are appallingly low.  We have to wonder whether they are trying to rebuild their reserves.  They are open to being told, "You must be rebuilding reserves, as opposed to the cost of claims, until you tell us that is not the case, but you will not tell us that is not the case because we cannot understand and you are not even trying to help us to understand."  It would be helpful if we could see the underlying costs.  That might give us an opportunity to approach the matter in the sense of a designed level of cover for a particular individual.  In such circumstances, at least we could eliminate the phenomenon of drivers not being covered.</p><p>Almost without exception, there is cover for third party, fire and theft or comprehensive.  There used to be another basic level of affordable insurance that anyone could have so that he or she could drive a vehicle safely, but that does not seem to be there anymore.  The market needs to change to ensure offers are understandable and value for money and, importantly, allow a vehicle that has been approved by the State to be safely put on the road to be driven affordably by someone who must legally have insurance.</p><p> Without question, we must examine the way in which claims are paid.  An approach is taken in the UK and there is an attempt to do the same in Ireland.  Rather than a large lump sum, an insurer would pay for someone's care until he or she was well.  There is much credence and sensibility in this, but we must bear in mind that we cannot just go from one to the other.  It is fine to be able to pay a doctor if one is ill, but one needs to be able to live as well.  Some form of support is required, but it needs to be managed and reasonable.</p><p> I have never heard anyone say that he or she would have a word with the Judiciary to get its view.  A book of quantum is about to be restored and reviewed, but is it not the case that we cannot ask the Judiciary whether, since everyone is shamefully blaming it for the cost situation, it can do anything about it?  The Judiciary would not be impressed.  Neither would I were I a judge and someone told me that this was my fault.  It cannot all be the Judiciary's fault.  It is down to the lack of information and sharing, which is why I will refer to the MIAB.  There is no need for everyone to meet around the table.  That would be ridiculous.  I was a member of the MIAB.  It was difficult work.</p><p> The committee could determine to engage with every member, but not just in finite terms.  In other words, its invitation was fantastic and appreciated and there would be no problem with the invitation being issued again, but to a meeting of a different format where information, details, statistics and data on this, this and this were requested.  Hopefully, we would then start moving in a direction and the committee will have materials to compare.</p></speech>

I wish to raise a number of issues.  Were I sitting at home watching this on Oireachtas TV, I would be as disheartened a member of the public as I am a politician.  It is disappointing for people who have experience of this matter every day of the week.  As has been stated by the Chair, we know the problems.  No one disagrees that the situation is unacceptable.  What must we do to bring it under control?  The increase in premiums is not sustainable.</p> <p>  Year on year, we are considering how to give more back to people in their net incomes, for example, by removing people from the USC net, giving tax breaks and so on, in order to compensate them for the difficult years through which they have gone.  However, there is no point in trying to improve people's quality of life if an insurance company or the like is waiting to take 40% more from them.  We must ensure that something is done and that this committee is not just a talking shop.  A solution must be delivered for those who need reduced premiums.</p> <p>  When Mr. Faughnan and his colleagues from the AA attended this morning, I mentioned that much needed to be done if we were to make the situation more transparent, accountable and better.  I will discuss the MIAB in a moment.  We have been told that books of quantum, data and so on need to be put in place.  I accept that.  This morning, Mr. Faughnan agreed with me that all of this information did not vanish off the cliff in the past two or three years.  The need for better regulation, data and accountability has probably always been there.  This situation has not just happened, but the premiums at the time were not increasing as drastically as they have been in the past three years.  We should not be looking for excuses or reasons in this forum for justifying the increases.  They are not acceptable.  End of story.  We should be doing everything possible to make the system more transparent and accountable so as to ensure that this issue does not continue, but we should not be using the situation as a reason for the 40% increases of the past year or two.  There is no excuse for that.</p> <p>  This morning, I used the term "cartel".  I have no problem using it.  I am not accusing anyone of operating a cartel, but one could be forgiven for believing that there is a cartel.  Competition has been mentioned, but there is none.  As is the case with every other public representative, constituents attend my clinics weekly or I speak with people on the street.  I know from them and personally that there is no competition.  One shops around insurance companies and the difference in premiums is &euro;30, &euro;40 or &euro;50.  It is not worth the hassle of changing a direct debit.  Competition does not exist.</p> <p>  The Chair asked what more could the MIAB do now, but when it was in place, it stopped premiums increasing at such a rate.  This has been pointed out to me by a number of legal and general experts in the business.  According to them, bringing the MIAB back into play would be of assistance.  The same issues obtained while it existed, but the increases were not as out of control as they have been in recent years.  I am substituting for my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, who is trying to have the MIAB re-established because he believes that it would have some worth.  Given Mr. Jewell's comments to Senator Conway-Walsh, he probably thinks the same.</p> <p>  We are discussing out-of-control 40% increases in premiums, but companies are also cherry-picking.  If cars have valid NCT certificates, it means that they are roadworthy irrespective of whether they are five, ten or 15 years old.  A certificate of a standard, it deems to the best of the tester's ability a car as being roadworthy until the next test.  In roadworthiness terms, it is as good as a car that has just come out of a garage, having undergone a forensic test, but insurance companies are being allowed to refuse to consider it because it is X years old.  That is scandalous.</p></speech>

There must be some level of engagement with the companies and they should be made accountable for this.  What is the point in taking a car that is over a certain age, for example, ten years, to an NCT centre if some insurers will not even offer a quote on it in any event?  That is ridiculous.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned discounts.  I know someone who recently received an insurance quote for a car.  When the person took out a package through a union with the person's partner, the same policy was provided for &euro;250 less.  The only difference was name X rather than name Y.</p></speech>

I am frustrated at the prospect of our even trying to square everything.  How can this be squared against what the companies are claiming are the reasons for increasing a person's premium?  If it has increased for one of the unacceptable and ridiculous excuses that the insurers have been trying to give in recent years, why are they able to offer a premium of nearly &euro;300 less for another member of the same family?  It does not stack up because it is not true or transparent.  The companies are operating in this way because they believe that they have free rein to charge anything they want, which they are.  I am happy to be challenged on this in any way.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Rourke stated that there were approximately five main insurance companies operating in buildings.</p><p>Many people now operate businesses online and that is fine.  There is no issue with that.  If it brings about better competition and insurance rates, bring it on.  I have strongly advocated that we should be opening up the insurance market and doing what we can for European countries coming in to give the customers a better deal, as they are being absolutely conned now.  I will not use another word but what is happening is unfair.  Surely the country of origin of those companies should have compulsory regulation of the companies.  If they get many customers here over the course of a year or 18 months and leave a legacy, there should be some clawback.  Is such a system in place and what can be done to ensure it is in place?  It would certainly help in opening this to the European Union.</p></speech>

I apologise to anybody watching this if I am affecting an already disastrous day which has seen difficulty with transport.  The committee has heard from Mr. Faughnan and the brokers' side.  We can look at everything that is going on.  We have a small market, as the Deputy mentioned, with the big five working down and out to the brokers, with an underlying few companies from other member states.</p> <p>  We must discuss who is settling the claims.  Many of the claims, either sold through a broker or one of the main companies, are sorted by the insurance company.  The person is asked not to accept liability but to leave it to the companies.  There is a problem in there somewhere.  The companies resolve the problems and make significant payouts to the great detriment of people who have already paid a very significant level of insurance premiums over years and who will then be guaranteed to pay an ever-increasing premium for four, five or six years until what was paid for a claim is ultimately discharged.  The people have no say, hand, act or part in the process.  Very many people might argue they did not cause an accident, although they would acknowledge problems.  They should have some say but there is no opening for that.  It is an issue that should be examined to start with.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Rourke is right in that one way of getting the data - perhaps a short cut - is to go to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and say that we believe a cartel is operating and it should prove otherwise.  It must have access to data to do so.  Perhaps it is a way of short-circuiting or moving that rapidly forward.</p></speech>

We must understand what are the profits and, most important, just how well the money is being managed and spent.  Is there an overspend to the degree that it is another factor in the ever-increasing cost, with too much being paid on commission, bonuses, salaries, rents, rates and marketing - such as having a name on a stadium - as well as a variety of other things?  We need to find out the outlay and reverse it if necessary.  If the State determined tomorrow that we cannot manage this as it is a disaster and if it wanted to set up its own insurance operation, there would have to be a set of guidelines relating to cost-effectiveness.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would be great at running an insurance company.  Thinking about how to do this is a way of finding out what exactly we are missing that we are not being told.  Underwriters and actuaries will tell us very quickly where are the gaps.</p></speech>

I do not mean to keep coming back to Mr. Faughnan, who was speaking more as a representative of the Automobile Association on behalf of motorists than a broker - he would have experience as a broker as well - but he argued that even if the State did it, much of the cost would remain.  He indicated that we should tackle the settling of claims and the lack of information about how they are settled.  We do not even have data on the settling process, such as whether the legal costs are 90% or 10% of the total.  We never see that process.  Much of it avoids the Injuries Board and ends up in the courts, with costs involved.  Mr. Faughnan was quite negative and I get Deputy O'Rourke's argument that we have been through all this before.  It is my view as well.</p> <p>  We are not the only country in the world that has motor insurance.  We are a small country and we do not have a road network all that different from many other places like Scotland or Scandinavia.  We could argue that there are more rural areas than places like Germany, the UK or France but, equally, many places are more rural than we are.  I would like to leave this third session of public hearings by saying if we can do A, B or C, we will either stop the price increases or, ideally, get a drop.  We have discussed this for the guts of an hour at this stage.  Is there anything that could be done to get a quick fix, although that may be oversimplifying the matter?  We can look at marketing budgets, rent and rates.  One gets the impression the money is all going out on claims.  It would be interesting to find out the cost of overheads as a percentage of premiums.  Is it a factor that the Aviva Stadium has that title?  I presume that is what the witness was alluding to.  Is it that one judge would give &euro;15,000 for a claim but another would give &euro;75,000 for pretty much the same type of claim?</p> <p>  I heard during the week that insurance companies have people in the courts and when they discover a certain judge is hearing a case, they are willing to go to court, but if there is a different judge around, they try to settle, even for double what they would initially have sought to settle for, as it would still be cheaper than dealing with the judge.  This goes back to the book of quantum but if it is a case of only "having regard" to it rather than having it as a bible, the process might need to be considered more than insurance overheads.  Are there two or three actions that could be taken that would go a long way towards trying to tackle the problem?</p></speech>

Without any doubt, one of the first actions would be to utilise the regulatory body that is there.  That is not to say there could not be another regulator but we should use the existing authority, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  If we are talking about a legally required insurance product, it could be the body to investigate the issue.  It should not report five years down the road and it should have a defined period in which to work, probably of five or six months.  That, in turn, would allow the body to recruit whoever it needs in the short term to put as much pressure as it wants on the big five insurance providers.  Let us put pressure on those five companies and see what is driving the cost, no pun intended.</p><p>We want to know and we are entitled to know.  If they do not tell us there will be a penalty, so a penalty should be introduced overnight for a lack of provision of clear and transparent information.  Penalties would help at this stage and perhaps we need to announce a whistle-blowing period to allow anybody from any sector of the industry to come forward.</p></speech>

We have tried and it has agreed, but I am disappointed that we did not go ahead with it.  It, of course, believes that what it is saying is quite correct, that it is the cost of claims.  However, if we are to be honest, I have to prove how much.  If I say something, I need to prove it and many people are the same.

Figures from the AA this morning show that 2 million motorists on average are affected.  If one looks at an increase of &euro;300, or even picking a more conservative figure, across 2 million people, one can calculate what it has netted per annum in insurance premiums.  Are we saying that a consequential amount, <i>pro rata</i>, has been paid out in claims?</p></speech>

That is my personal view.  As regards claims and payments, as the Acting Chairman said, is it related to one judge awarding a certain amount and another awarding a different amount for a particular accident?  My view, while it may be wrong, is that has always been the case.  Some 25 years ago, I knew of two families involved in a car accident.  They both claimed off their insurance, yet got different sums of money for whiplash injuries.  That was a long time ago.  If we drill into it, they were nearly justifying it.  We should not even be attempting to do that, however.</p> <p>  What is happening now with claims being paid out and differentials in awards by judges, or however it is done, has always been the same traditionally down through the years.  That still does not give any reason, excuse or justification for the increases, which should not be accepted.  The problem is how does one get accountability and delivery.  It is when one employs a consequence and a penalty in any cross-section of life.</p></speech>

There is something that could be done tomorrow morning.  For example, there should be an automatic penalty for any insurance company that refuses to give a quotation to any person who has a valid NCT certificate showing that the car is roadworthy, irrespective of its age, because otherwise that is discrimination.  There is no such penalty, however, and that is absolutely wrong.</p> <p>  The Acting Chairman asked what could be done.  I am suggesting that, as Mr. Jewell said, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission should immediately carry out a thorough audit and investigation of what is going on because there is no justification for it.  No matter how the figures are presented, it will not change my mind because it does not make sense.  This is not new; it has been around for some time.  A new motor insurance advisory board, or its equivalent, should be established.  Those things should be done immediately.</p></speech>

If I go to other countries, I can get a no claims bonus letter from an insurance company here, which is recognised abroad.  It is even recognised in other countries by some of the insurance companies that operate here, yet in this country they will not recognise such a letter from a company abroad.  What is the explanation for that?  Huge amounts of money are being demanded from returning emigrants for insurance cover here.  How can we force insurance companies to operate in the same way as they do in other countries?  That shows us that the difficulty lies with the regulations here, rather than with the insurance industry itself which is operating under one law abroad, while the same company here might operate otherwise.</p></speech>

The no claims discount suggests a history of the driver.  In other words, he or she is a safe driver and has not had a claim.  If there is such a history, it makes logical sense that it should be accepted.  If such no claims bonus letters are not being accepted on a regular basis, then it needs to be challenged.  I would like to think that it could be challenged here at home, but we are all members of the European Union so it should be easy to seek a quick review and response as to why foreign no claims bonus letters could not be accepted in this jurisdiction.  What makes us so special that companies do not want to do so?  I would have thought that under EU law they should be required to accept such letters.  I am surprised that they are not accepting them.  I must put my hands up and admit that I am unaware of the background, but I look forward to finding out about it.  I will certainly come back to committee in any way I can.  That practice is wrong, however.</p></speech>

One of the views in the past was that motor insurers were not making any profit and that was why premiums had to be high - because it was basically a dead-end business for them.  I do not think that is the case, but I would ask where the insurers look at motor insurance in terms of their overall business and, if they are making a particular level of profit, whether that subsidises house insurance, liability insurance or whatever.  There is a lot of that with insurance companies, and that is what we do not see.</p></speech>

I am old enough to remember that this is almost a case of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>because we were here in 2002 for exactly the reason.  There is very little that is new.  The crisis in the motor insurance industry is not new nor is the fact that premiums are rising.  The fact that insurance companies have lost money on their investments is not new.  Insufficient data from insurance companies, defaults from insurance companies and the fact that policyholders have to carry the can for much of this are not new.  The lack of competition in the marketplace is not new nor are the arguments between insurance companies and the legal profession with each blaming the other and delays in the system.  The fact that insurance companies are settling cases without recourse or referring back to their clients is not new.  The fact that we have an Oireachtas committee investigating the horrendous increases we are suffering is not new.<br/><br/>In 2002, there was little or no public information available relating to overall numbers and costs of claims for personal injuries and the only figures that were made public did not contain any information on the costs of directly settled cases.  Without access to that information, a full picture of the impact on personal injuries was difficult to establish back then.  Nothing has changed.  In 2002, some 90% of the 35,000 cases that did not proceed to trial lacked visibility.  In 2014 and 2015, of the 31,000 or 32,000 injury claims registered, only 9,000 went to court or were finalised by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  Again, we are talking about 71% of the cases having no transparency so we are back into exactly the same position.  The industry said that it made a loss of &euro;198 million from underwriting insurance and we know that it has been badly hit on its investments.  Again, there is nothing new about that but back in 2002, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, discovered that, among other things, the profits relative to premiums for Irish insurers were many multiples of their English counterparts.  Again, we know that it is the same.  From 1998 to 2002, the same group of insurance companies were found to be less than forthright with their figures to MIAB.  The last investigation by MIAB led to significant and dramatic savings over the following 12 or 13 years.  CSO figures show that the cost of motor insurance reduced by about 40% over that period but things have changed since 2014 so we are back to the same thing.  MIAB reduced the length of time it was taking through the introduction of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and brought it back down from three years to seven months.  MIAB made 67 recommendations, some of which were not followed through.  I will return to that point.  <br/><br/>Claims numbers have increased only marginally in the past year, more than likely as a result of economic activity.  There has been a 6% increase compared to 2015 but, again, we can see that this is slowing this year.  The average awards have remained relatively static over the past five to six years.  If one looks at the Personal Injuries Assessment Board figures, one can see that in 2009, the average claim was something like &euro;23,000.  In 2015, the average claim was &euro;22,800 so, again, there has been very little change.  There is very little evidence that the claims are increasing through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  <br/><br/>We have a continuous line of complaint from our members regarding the handling of what they would regard as questionable claims and the fact that insurance companies continue to settle without the consent or knowledge of the insured businesses.  In the opinion of many SME owners, this adds to the fraudulent claims culture that is there.  <br/><br/>There has been plenty of talk about the book of quantum.  We are still waiting to have the latest version of that.  To wait 12 or 13 years for a revision of that is not on and we hope that from now on, there would be a more regular review of the book of quantum.  <br/><br/>The poor regulation of the insurance companies that are regulated outside Ireland but which operate in the market also drives up the cost of premiums.  We know that the legal position is that many insurers must reserve against the risk of future market failures of other companies.  This, obviously, does not help the SME sector.  We must take into account the assertions from the legal profession that it is not its fault and the insurance companies' assertions regarding part of the information and part of the reason for increased costs.  We know that back in 2002, a large amount of the awards were going to professional fees to the legal profession and others.  <br/><br/>ISME thinks that part of the answer to this lies in a reform of the MIAB with a similar task to the previous one.  As part of that process, we would need a review of the 67 recommendations and the reasons that some were implemented while others were not.</p><p>We would like to see totally aggregated figures made available on the number of claims, the value of claims and the associated legal and professional costs for processing these claims.  That information gathering exercise must also include estimates of fraudulent claims and a continuing review of the book of quantum.  It would be preferable that the insurance industry itself should develop a common reporting matrix which could and should be aggregated by an external agency because the industry keeps on talking about competitiveness and competitive information.  It could work if we could anonymise and pool the information through an external source.  In the absence of an agreement from the insurance businesses, I believe the Central Bank must insist and must get involved.  The Central Bank must impose stricter reporting obligations.  At the moment it seems that the Central Bank's main job is to ensure it looks at the matter from a prudential point of view.  Obviously the bank does not want to see insurance companies going to the wall, but the Central Bank would not see the issue of increased premiums as part of its job.</p><p> The type of information which the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, required for investigation back in 2002 was essential to identify the main contributors to the massive rise in motor insurance premiums.  We are back at the same point now, and if we can get that information, it could be weighted accordingly to find out who and what are the actual contributors to the increases in premium.  We hope that the new edition of the book of quantum would be reviewed by the Court of Appeal prior to publication and that there would be a certain amount of training.  I am loath to mention that the judges need training but they certainly need training in how to use and implement the book of quantum.  We hope there would be a consistent application of the book of quantum across all awards in order that the awards would be predictable and certain over a period of time.  If the book of quantum is accepted, it would be crucial to reducing the need for taking costly litigation.  All awards should be benchmarked internationally in order that we can see what is happening in Ireland and in comparison with our competitor countries.</p></speech>

Whether they have one business vehicle or multiples, their message coming back to us is very clear that there is now a motor insurance crisis and it is affecting the costs base of their companies.  In 5% of members' cases they are actually saying this crisis could put them out of business.   We welcome the attention the committee is giving to the issue.  When all the different stakeholders come to the committee, there will be broad consensus about what needs to be done, and it is to be hoped we will see some action.</p> <p>  The SFA conducted a survey of members just last week to gather some contemporary data to share with the committee.  It shows premiums have been increasing steadily over recent years.  There was a 6% average increase from 2012 to 2013, followed by an increase of 9% in 2014 and 13% in 2015.  However, in this past year things have actually skyrocketed, with most companies seeing premium price increases of 35%.  We expected to see a difference between companies that had experienced claims and companies that had not, but even companies with no claims have seen premiums increase by 34%.  Therefore, we know that the market is fundamentally not working in the State and there are a number of factors the SFA believes would help.</p> <p>  When we asked about the implications of motor insurance as an issue for our members' businesses, 20% of our survey respondents said they had reduced their number of vehicles because of the cost base, which means they cannot do as much work.  They are reducing the scale of their operations and the employment that goes with it.  This is an issue.  Another 20% of our respondents have reduced their level of cover, leaving their businesses at greater risk of exposure, which is also a concern.</p> <p>  We have discussed these issues with our member companies and we have summarised our findings into five areas upon which the committee could focus its work: introduce a new book of quantum, which we understand is a work in progress; move to a care not cash approach, in particular for whiplash cases; increase competition in the insurance market to ensure there are a sufficient number of companies providing cover; combat fraud; and review the powers of the Injuries Board.</p> <p>  Businesses accept they have a responsibility to ensure the provision of proper safety management in their workplaces and to give their staff every training necessary.  The SFA has been working with companies in this regard.  That we have a responsibility for this aspect is a given.  We know the book of quantum is being re-worked and will probably be published in the next month, and I have been around long enough to remember the previous crisis.  However, our concern is the way the book is calculated which is based on actual court awards.  At the time of the previous book of quantum the awards were already super-inflated because the judgments were too generous.  That is the book with which we have worked all these years.  If the same methodology is used and if it is based on the more recent awards, it will not act in our favour as it will actually increase the levels of awards.  In the review of the book of quantum it is very important that we are not merely reflecting awards that have been given out in recent years but that we incorporate a system around what an injury is actually worth and do the benchmarking analysis internationally.  Our analysis shows that court awards have increased by over 30% in 2014 alone.  The book is one thing, but getting the book right is another.  If we are going to have a book of quantum then it should not just be the Injuries Board that follows it, the courts should certainly follow it.  Award levels should not be a discretionary matter to a given judge.  The SFA has found and the insurance companies we regularly meet will tell us that everything goes to the steps of the court because it depends on which judge one gets on the day.  That is not a good, fair or efficient system for dealing with this.  Many costs could be removed if there was more certainty in the system.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the system termed "care not cash".  This system has been trialled in the UK and is working well.  Essentially it means that people who are affected by accidents will get all their hospital costs and their care looked after but there would be no financial compensation element to the award.  That is what is important in this.  It removes the fraudulent element from the situation.  If one takes the awards for whiplash, for example, in Ireland the average award is almost &euro;15,000 while in the UK it was &pound;5,000 but now it is zero because of this new model.  Getting those multiples of incidents out of the marketplace to begin with would treat people fairly and well and would also remove that noise from the system.</p> <p>  With regard to competition in the insurance market, the SFA met many insurance companies to discuss the issues.  The SFA has a group insurance scheme and our companies would tell us they accept there is a cyclical element to it and their businesses may be in difficulty as well.  However, I believe it is the legal underpinning which is essential for these companies.  There are 1,000 insurers across the EU.  Why can more of these not be brought into the Irish market? Those insurers will tell us that it is because they literally do not know what it is they would be underwriting.  If an insurance company fails in Ireland the wider industry must pay out on its awards, which comes back to all of us as policyholders.  The Setanta Insurance ruling has been particularly damaging and the SFA would ask for a lot more clarity around that.  We should not tolerate a position where people operate in the Irish market while being regulated overseas but if they collapse then Irish policyholders are held responsible for that.  We know from experience in the cycle that we have all benefited by tremendously low premiums at various points in time, but we would prefer not to do that.  We would prefer to have a normalised cost base and not have people behaving irresponsibly in this marketplace.</p> <p>  It is estimated that fraud costs the industry &euro;200 million annually, of which &euro;100 million relates specifically to motor insurance fraud.  Periodically the insurance companies step up their anti-fraud campaigns but we believe a lot more should be done on that front to raise public consciousness around not tolerating people claiming when we, as individuals, know these claims to be unfair.  There also needs to be harsher penalties when it is proven that people have taken fraudulent claims, including custodial sentences.  The area of fraudulent claims has been growing and if we become serious about it, it could remove an estimated average of &euro;30 from the cost of every premium, which is the cost to cover these fraudulent claims.  That would make a significant difference straight away.</p> <p>  The SFA strongly supported the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, now known as the Injuries Board.  In its early years it certainly solved the last crises and it was working very well.  We know the board was not welcomed by the legal profession which, I believe, has been trying to undermine the board since its establishment.  We need to look at that situation and figure out how this blend can work.  It was believed that the Injuries Board process would remove a lot of the costs from the system.</p><p>Yet now, if we look at what is going through the Injuries Board, 90% of claimants have legal representation and in 40% of cases awards are rejected.  If it is simply something that people are going through to get to the other end and if they are not really serious about it, then this is wasting the time of the Injuries Board and everyone else.  Moreover, it is simply adding more cost.  We need to review the functioning of the board.  In terms of reform we believe that, for example, a request to attend a medical examination organised by the Injuries Board should be compulsory.  Furthermore, we believe that if people reject the Injuries Board awards but do not get a higher award in court, they should be penalised.  This would help to get the message out that this is genuinely an important part of the system and cannot simply be disregarded.  At present, it is not working at it should be.  As a model, we are confident that it is the right course of action and that it should be successful.</p><p> I will set out some broad points in conclusion.  Small companies have had many issues to deal with during the recession, including issues around finance and public procurement.  However, we are hearing from members now that costs are the most important thing, in particular, rising business costs and competitiveness.  This is the case more than ever in the context of Brexit and our competitiveness with the United Kingdom.  This issue is second only to labour costs - a staggering reality.  We might think the bill will not be significant but for many companies this is definitely reminiscent of the early 2000s.  At the time I knew of companies going out of business because they could not get any cover.  At the time premiums eventually reached 100% or 200%.  Were it not for the group scheme we operated, our members would not be still in business today - and these are good businesses.  I do not want things to get to that stage and, therefore, intervention at this point in the cycle is important.  In the context of dealing with this issue in the early 2000s, we probably rushed through legislation and the establishment of the Injuries Board.  Then, when the crisis passed it was not revisited.  If we revisit what we have, strengthen and empower it and change our legislation - something within the remit of the committee - then I believe we can go some way to solving some of the problems.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Neil Walker" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090800002#JJ00300"><p>IBEC is the national voice of Irish business on a wide range of policy issues, including environment, health, safety and related insurance.  Some of the factors driving up motor insurance premiums in Ireland are impacting on other forms of insurance as well, notably employer liability, EL, and public liability, PL.  This is to be expected given that the third-party element of every motor policy is essentially covering public liability risk.  Since the underlying cost drivers are similar, the remedies that IBEC is proposing to keep down the cost of liability insurance should benefit private motorists as well as employers.  A recent survey of our members suggests that EL and PL premiums taken together equate to nearly 3% of company payroll.  Billions of euro are at issue each year.  If these premiums start to rise as rapidly as they already have for motorists, it will have a damaging impact on competitiveness and hence on jobs.  There are concerning signs that this is starting to occur.  We want the Government to take urgent action to head it off at the pass.</p> <p>  In our view, the courts system is a big part of the problem.  Only a small proportion of personal injury claims result in court awards.  However, the sums awarded there set the benchmark for a far larger number of settlements negotiated out of court or on the steps of the court.  Since the arrival of a new cohort of judges in 2014, personal injury awards have been rising steadily.  There seems to be a high degree of inconsistency as well, as others have mentioned, with some court awards being far above the guideline amounts set out in the Injuries Board book of quantum.  The Injuries Board is effectively competing with the courts and is regularly outbid.  Naturally, this encourages claimants to reject the Injuries Board recommendations and proceed to litigation.  We expect the second edition of the book of quantum will feature increases in the guideline amounts, bringing them more closely in line with what the judges, and hence the insurers, are doing.  This might reduce the incentive to litigate, but it could also drive up insurance costs even further, simply providing a new benchmark for the courts to regard as a starting point for ever greater awards.  Court awards in England and Wales pay far greater heed to the UK Judicial College guidelines, and it is little wonder given that these are endorsed by senior appeal court judges.  It is also clear from our research that the British guideline amounts are far lower than ours across a range of common personal injuries.  Whiplash, referred to previously, is simply the best known example of this disparity and the figure is somewhere in the region of 300%.  IBEC would, therefore, like to see a reduction rather than an increase in the guideline amounts, and to have these reductions endorsed by a senior member of the Judiciary.  We are keen to see a greater granularity, in other words, more categories with narrower ranges.  Above all, we want far greater consistency in the application of these guidelines by individual judges.  By reducing the perceived risk for insurers, this will hopefully foster competition in the market.</p> <p>  The legal profession can be part of the solution.  The law courts are increasingly clogged with personal injury cases dragging out over months or years.  IBEC would like to see the Law Society of Ireland encourage greater use of pre-trial protocols to cut unnecessary delays in discovery and procedure.  This would benefit injured claimants and respondent companies alike.  The insurance regulator and the insurance companies have important roles to play in containing costs.  The lack of meaningful information on claims settlements and provisions for future liabilities make it difficult for customers to know whether their premiums are cost-reflective.  The Central Bank, concerned only with solvency, seems to be advising insurers that they need to raise their EL and PL premiums.  We question whether this is justified by the evidence.  IBEC is keen to see a pooling of insurer data for the purpose of cost analysis.  This should include a code of practice with common reporting standards.  It may entail setting up a black box to ensure compliance with competition law.  This type of mechanism has been shown to work effectively and at reasonable cost in other sectors, notably the producer responsibility schemes for recovery of waste electrical and electronic equipment.</p> <p>  Lastly, there needs to be a tightening of the legislation governing the claims process.  Claimants should be obliged to co-operate with the Injuries Board.  For example, if they want the option to reject a recommendation, they should not be allowed to refuse an independent medical examination when requested.  In conclusion, to echo the title of our recent report, it is time to reduce the burden of personal injury claims.</p></speech>

As in our earlier sessions, we will allow various members of the committee to put questions to the deputations.  We will then allow the latter to address the queries rather than have a series of different people all coming in at one time.  Would Senator Conway-Walsh like to start?</p></speech>

The representatives will appreciate that much of what we have heard is in line with what we have been hearing all day and what we heard yesterday.  In any event, it is interesting to hear the different perspectives.  I agree with almost all of them.</p> <p>  It was interesting to hear Mr. Fielding's comment to the effect that claims have only marginally increased, the figure cited was 22,800.  In one way, that is at odds with the emphasis from IBEC to the effect that the main focus should be around reducing the amount of injury claims.  Further examination is required in this area.</p> <p>  I absolutely agree with IBEC on the question of new entrants to the market and the blockages for them as well as the comments on the burden of reckless companies or companies which are not operating in the way they should, and how this puts a burden on those operating responsibly.  I endorse what was discussed earlier - the idea that no one should be allowed to sell insurance in Ireland unless they are locked into a compensation fund.  That is something we will certainly follow up at EU level.  There needs to be greater congruence between the European Commission and ourselves in tackling many of these issues.</p> <p>  I thought the comments on the book of quantum were interesting, particularly regarding the precariousness around it and the danger that if the position is not put right, costs could increase further.  We need to be mindful of that.</p> <p>  I like what was said about the endorsement by a senior member of the Judiciary.  It will be problematic if we do not get buy-in from there.  We should not be afraid to say, as Mr. Fielding noted, that judges need training.</p><p>I think they need training in a lot of areas.  In this instance, we should all be open to training and to gathering expertise in respect of matters in respect of which developments are taking place all the time.  If we can link that up as well, we will do some good.</p><p> I agree with all of the witnesses that insurance costs are crippling small businesses which have never made claims and which operate in a responsible way.  This matter needs to be examined.  Mr. Fielding mentioned the profits, the multiples and the comparisons that are made with UK counterparts.  There are many different aspects to insurance that need to be examined.  I do not want the committee to just focus on people who make claims.  The reason we have insurance is to provide safeguards for individuals when accidents occur.  </p><p> I agree with the suggestions in respect of having a common reporting matrix and for the Central Bank to enforce reporting procedures.  I also completely agree with the call to reintroduce the MIAB.  The latter made 67 recommendations, some of which have not been implemented.  The fact that people have called for a return of the MIAB shows that it did not solve the core issues in the first instance.  However, I support the calls for its reintroduction.</p><p> We have a great deal of work to do to resolve this matter.  We will only make progress by working together and not being afraid to ask difficult questions.  We also need to put pressure on people to supply the data that is required in order in order that we proceed on the basis of proper evidence as opposed to anecdotal information and, thus, pursuing the wrong people.  When people are reluctant to submit proper information - such information is provided in other countries - then one must inquire as to what is being covered up and why that is being done.  The committee and the Government need to uncover and unravel the real position in order to discover the crux of the problem.  I thank all of the witnesses for their presentations.</p></speech>

The witnesses have put their cases very well.  There was a slight difference of opinion.  The perspective of IBEC is that legal costs are rising versus Mr. Fielding's comment that the costs have not changed that much.  We have heard the same stuff for the past two days, so we have been here before.  That is the slightly depressing or disappointing aspect from the point of view of members.  We are wondering why must we keep revisiting these issues.  Motor insurance is something that happens all over the world and Ireland is not that different from many other countries.  Our roads network, population and people are not that different from those in many other countries.  Why do problems with motor insurance keep arising here?  It is unfortunate that these problems continue.  I thank all of the witnesses for their contributions.</p> <p>  I call on Deputy O'Rourke for his questions and comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090800002#KK00500"><p>I thank all of the witnesses for their presentations.  I have worked in the private sector for years and I am a massive supporter of the SME sector.  I work very closely with businesses in my constituency.  I support them and promote the idea of them working together.  Running a business is difficult at any stage but it has been particularly difficult during the past eight years.  In such circumstances, I endorse and agree with everything that has been said by the witnesses.</p><p>The Acting Chairman has said that Ireland is no different from other countries in terms of insurance.  I am of the view that there is a reduced risk of accidents occurring here on foot of the fact that Ireland is an island nation and, as a result, has a smaller population, a smaller number of cars, etc., and everything is<i>pro rata</i>.  One could make the argument that the risk is reduced and it certainly has not increased by 40%, which is the statistical figure that has been stated all morning.</p><p>I take on board everything that Ms Callan said.  We need to do everything that we can - and I am tired listening to myself saying so at this stage - to make the insurance industry more transparent and more accountable, to ensure that there will be consequences for insurance companies and to impose penalties on them in respect of their unacceptable behaviour with regard to individuals and businesses.  Ms Callan mentioned certain issues and suggested  that we may be feeding in to this problem.  As I have said all day, I am concerned that we are nearly justifying or explaining the bad and unacceptable behaviour demonstrated by insurance companies in increasing policies premiums.  Such increases cannot be justified because all of the issues have existed for some time and date back years.  That is definitely not an excuse failing to take action.  I am hugely proactive and believe we should do everything we can - collectively and by means of a partnership approach - to resolve this problem in order that we never need to have this discussion again.  There is no justification for the increase in premiums in the past three years and, in particular, the past year because the current issues have existed for ten or 15 years in every sector whether it is claims or whatever.</p><p>In terms of business, I know of one haulage company that had to set up outside of Ireland.  All of the vehicles had to be sent abroad to be registered and tested and then brought back here.  Even though the company had made no claims and all of its details remained the same, the cost of its insurance premiums doubled in one year.  If it had paid the premiums, the only option would have been to fold and close the door.  The company employed 25 people in a local economy.  It is frustrating and annoying to speak about this situation because there was no justification to increase the premiums.</p><p>I like the proposal made by Ms Callan for the novel approach of care not cash.  I did not hear the terms before but I like it because it is a good idea and takes the onus away from euro or pound signs appearing in front of one's eyes when an accident occurs.  When an accident occurs, a minority of people think, not so much &quot;How badly injured am I?&quot; but rather &quot;How much can I get from a claim?&quot;  A claims culture has always existed but it still does not justify increased premiums.  The claims culture needs to be dealt with head on by tight legislation or regulation but that is still not an excuse for what insurance companies are doing at present.</p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh mentioned the outstanding 67 action points put forward by the MIAB and the fact that the current discussion about the insurance industry proves it had not done its business.  I would take a slightly different tack by saying that while the MIAB was in existence - this is what I have been informed by industry - it may not have completed its job but we do not need the current discussion.  It has been strongly indicated to me by people I meet, engage with and represent from all walks of life, that the disbandment of the MIAB has been a contributing factor in the context of the issue we are debating.  We need, as a matter of urgency, to reintroduce the MIAB or establish an equivalent thereof that will have teeth.</p><p>Increased insurance premiums are crippling businesses that are already faced with pressures imposed by paying wages and rates.  Also, there is less money being spent in the economy so turnover is down.  Let us remember that the SME sector is the lifeblood of the economy because we know the number of people it employs and the returns made to the Exchequer.  Yesterday, we talked about multinationals that are great and needed but the SME is hugely important.  Increased premium constitute a major issue for the SME sector.  If the matter is not resolved, then the economy will be in serious bother.</p><p>Earlier, the Chairman said that Insurance Ireland will attend one of our meetings in the coming days.  Today, I have substituted for a colleague and, unfortunately, do not attend meetings of this committee regularly.  Perhaps Mr. Fielding made two or three points before I arrived.</p></speech>

I think his main question is really the last question which was written down in front of me.  It was a question I was going to mention.  We will have representatives of Insurance Ireland before the committee next week.  We had the Consumers' Association of Ireland in just before the current witnesses and we asked the representatives if they had engaged with Insurance Ireland.  They had not actually met Insurance Ireland.  I asked what they would do if they were in our position and sitting on this side of the table.  We got some questions from it.  Equally, I would be interested to hear from all three organisations that are here now as to what they would say.  From my own understanding, quite a lot of the 67 recommendations were implemented.  Is that correct?  A number of them were not, but they were not all left undone.</p></speech>

I cannot remember but it was up in the teens.  To take the Senator's point, maybe it did not solve anything.  All they can do is recommend.  It is up to the Oireachtas and the Government to bring that in and follow through on the recommendations.  That is one thing.  There was a question on the actual awards.  The Injuries Board's awards are on record and they are the figures about which I was speaking.  The average award in 2009 was &euro;23,000.  In 2015, the average was &euro;22,800.  The sequence was &euro;23,000, &euro;22,000, &euro;21,000, &euro;22,000, &euro;22,000 and &euro;23,000.</p></speech>

Between PIAB and the courts we are getting visibility to a certain extent on about 30% of claims.  We do not appear to have any visibility on 70% of claims, where legal costs could be at 90% or at 9%, but we do not know.  Mr. Fielding's comment, which I do not doubt is perfectly accurate and valid, is on Injuries Board figures, which refer to a relatively small component of the total number of claims established and finalised one way or the other.</p></speech>

I do not want to put words in their mouths but I want to be sure of what Mr. Fielding said.  It is Injuries Board claims that have not changed, but more and more people over time are abandoning or discounting the Injuries Board to take their chances either in the courts or with settlements because they feel they will get more out of a settlement than the Injuries Board figures are establishing.</p></speech>

It is for the total aggregated figures to be made available, the number of claims, the value of claims and the associated legal and professional costs.  That will give us the answer and show the contributory factors to the increases.  At the moment we do not know, although we know that there has been lazy financial management.  We know that back in 2002 - and we have the same again now - the insurance industry did not manage its finances because its players were dependant on investments.  We all know it happened to the investment industry.  That is what has happened, but it happened in 1998 up to 2002 also.  We need somebody who will put manners on these people because they are treating small and medium-sized businesses and the citizens of Ireland with disdain.  They just throw the figures up.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Rourke was talking about an incident or a particular company.  Just last Friday, one of our member companies which had 11 vans was seeking to increase the number to 19.  The 11 were costing it &euro;9,000 to insure while 19 were going to cost &euro;24,000.  These are absolutely crazy figures and no talk about it.  One sole trader decided to incorporate and form a limited company, so he was no longer insuring his car as a sole trader and private individual but as a company car.  His premium went from &euro;650 to &euro;2,200.  That is the type of stuff where there is no rhyme or reason.  All of these questions have to be asked.  It is back to exactly the same position as before.  That is what is so frustrating about this.  It was done before.  We have done this before and are back to the same stuff we were at 14 or 15 years ago.</p></speech>

I am getting restaurateurs, publicans and hoteliers all saying that their insurance costs are increasing massively, which has nothing to do with their claims history, any incident, reckless behaviour or health and safety issues.  It is just that these costs are arriving and there is almost nothing one can do about it.  One shops around and, as Deputy O'Rourke said, one might get &euro;50 off, but that is not what a lot of people would regard as normal competition.  That is the frustrating thing.  The point I took from Mr. Fielding is that the MIAB is very important, but equally it is about the data and what we do not see or know.</p> <p>  We have anecdotal stories about investment performance or otherwise.  We have stories about solvency levels having to be brought up to new rules and therefore they are trying that.  We have various other things about the overheads of insurance companies, sponsorship of various other things and marketing budgets which are out of control.  We are told that is where it is all going.  Then there are the legal costs.  We mentioned yesterday when the Minister was here the idea of a care-not-cash model, and he was saying that it sounded very innovative, which I think it does, but the argument from the legal profession may be that it moves the money from the legal profession to the medical profession.  I am not sure I am convinced of that.  Equally, Mr. Fielding mentioned 300%.  Why do we have whiplash awards of &euro;15,000 here versus &pound;5,000 in the United Kingdom, while it is virtually nothing in mainland Europe?  That is what we are being told.  Certainly, we need data.  The Minister and his working group are investigating things we are not involved in and will bring stuff back to the committee.  We just do not know if there are profits or profit gouging, with supernormal profits being made here, or whether it is genuinely the case that settlements are much more expensive than they were.  The committee really needs anonymised, aggregated data from all of the players.  We heard earlier that there are 24 players, of which 11 are based in Gibraltar.  Equally, we heard this morning that there are really only five main players in the motor insurance business.</p> <p>  I note to Ms Callan that a book of quantum is really only going to be of benefit if it is somewhat binding.  If it is just there and one can have regard to it or, equally, ignore it, I do not know how much value it can have.  There is a concern that it will normalise what is currently abnormal, and that is a very important point.  On competition, we heard this morning from various sources that people are more likely to be leaving this market than coming into it.  We do not seem to have a great record right back to PMPA and, more recently, Setanta.  One could include Quinn Insurance in that bundle of companies that sold stuff apparently cheaply.  If one did not have a claim that was fine, but if one claimed, it was not resolved as satisfactorily as one might have liked.</p><p>What I took away from the IBEC contribution was its legal costs and that that is the emphasis it would like to put on the issue.  Was Dr. Gillen indicating he would like to come in on that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-08a.420" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michael Gillen" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090800002#MM00200"><p>In answer to Deputy O'Rourke's question, what we would like members to ask the insurers when they come in next week is to agree to sign up to this type of black box concept.  Like Mr. Fielding, I was involved in this area in the early 2000s.  We asked them for the same data we will ask them for again, and they will argue that on competition grounds they cannot give it to members.  The research we have conducted does not support the idea that super profits are being made in motor insurance.  If there were, the insurers would not all be leaving the market; they would be joining the market.  Members should therefore park that idea.  It is easy to hit out at the insurers and claim super profits are being made.  They are not making money on motor insurance at the moment.  They have the data that will allow people to form concrete decisions as to how to address the issue but they are nervous to release them on competition grounds.  The black box will work because it will be done anonymously.  As Dr. Walker said, it works really well for the producer responsibility schemes, such as for WEEE.  It is a very efficient and very effective method for getting the data out there.  There are mountains of data that are not being mined.</p> <p>  By way of clarification for Senator Conway-Walsh, the numbers Mr. Fielding quoted from the Injuries Board show that when people engage with the board, it works.  The amounts it has been awarding over the past ten years are more or less consistent.  However, approximately 40% of all assessments made by the Injuries Board are rejected by claimants.  Either they decide they can get more elsewhere or they are advised they can do so.  That is where the problems begin and where the insurers will make the decision, based purely on risk metrics, that it is cheaper to settle, even though they think they could win, than to take the chance of going in and having an award for &euro;80,000 or &euro;400,000 made for the exact same injury.  If members are to ask the insurers anything next week, they should ask them to sign up to this black box concept.  All of a sudden a mountain of data will be made available for members to mine effectively, and it will form a very solid basis on which to base new legislative agreements.  The Motor Insurance Advisory Board has largely morphed into what is now the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  As Mr. Fielding said, the bulk of the 67 recommendations were adopted, but what we never adopted was a metric whereby people could be compelled to engage with them and we never adopted a process whereby the data insurers had could be made available anonymously in a non-competitive way such that people could mine it effectively.</p></speech>

We all have buckets of stories and anecdotal evidence, which is all true in itself, but the data in totality may not reflect it or may absolutely reflect it.  We just do not know.  The only thing we know is that motor insurance premiums have gone up by 36%, 38% or 40% in the past 12 to 15 months.  I am sure every one of us knows from our own insurance renewal premiums - I certainly do - that they are going up by those percentages.  Are there any other points the witnesses would like to address?  Ms Callan and then Dr. Walker, if that is okay.</p></speech>

What the Injuries Board assessment shows is that it always sticks to the book of quantum.  That is why it does not vary year to year.  We know that the court awards increased by 30% in one year, in 2014, and we know that the insurance industry has lost &euro;120 million on motor insurance, so it is loss-making.  In answer to all of those years in between when this was not an issue, there was more competition in the market.  In fact, some of those traders who were trading badly meant that the price probably came down too much and that is why we are-----</p></speech>

Ideally, what one wants is to get the motor insurance industry data from those companies before the book of quantum is reviewed, because it was 70% of the market.  Then one has a proper assessment.  However, it will also be very important to attract new companies into the market.  If I am deciding whether this is a good market for me, if I really understand all the variables, then I, as one of the other, newer entrants, is more likely to come in.  Again, this is very much Central Bank regulatory territory, so that would be critical, but we need to revisit the Setanta decision.  No company in its right mind - and I represent businesses and understand how business works - is going to come in with its risk assessment, cost base, marketing and everything else and then have this hurdle thrown at it from outside over which it has no control.</p></speech>

The likelihood is that any new entrant will go in to get business for themselves, but that will, by and large, be at the expense of other business, particularly in something like motor insurance.  One does not create extra motor insurance just because one enters the market.  One can argue in an airline scenario that if one drops the price enough, people travel more, but there is one motor insurance policy for a person's car or per person, and a new entrant, if they do it right, will damage other businesses.  Then the customer is supposed to pick up the tab if that business fails, which is a peculiar way of looking at things.</p></speech>

They are a symptom of the broader problem.  The problem starts in the courts.  That sets the benchmark for everything else, and it is a fact that on a very low-risk basis a solicitor can say to a client that he or she will get the client 50% more than whatever the Injuries Board offers.  Why would the client say no?  That needs to be eliminated so the judges will not be awarding 50% more.  Then there is no need for the solicitor.  In fact-----</p></speech>

They would just take a cut from whatever is awarded.  There should be no need to bring a solicitor in, but the reason that people do so is because many of them are keeping their options open of going on to litigate afterwards or at least knowing that they have a very good chance of doing better than the Injuries Board award, not because of a clever solicitor, but because that is what the courts are doing because they think there is 12 years of inflation.  However, the problem is that the level of awards set 12 years ago is still two to three times higher than the current British awards.  There are a range of awards, but the top of the British range is generally lower than the bottom of the Irish range.  That 300% factor is like comparing the middle of the ranges.</p></speech>

Motor insurance premiums went up by 35 to 40% in the last year.  What does each organisation believe to be the number one reason - or two or three reasons if the witnesses need them - for this rise in the past year?  Is it claims, an attempt to recover past losses or solvency?  What do the witnesses think is the real reason premiums are up 40% in a year?</p></speech>

It is a combination of all of what the Acting Chairman has just said, and it is quite difficult for anybody on the outside to give a definitive answer and say it is this one reason or that one.  However, the committee has heard today from the legal side of things.  It has heard, as I said, of the lazy financial management of insurance companies over the years.  We only have to consider where we were back at the turn of the century to see we are in exactly the same position.  The committee should consider the MIAB and what it did and see the figures that it got.  Until 2013 there was a 40% reduction in motor insurance premiums because the MIAB was able to get at least some information together.  However, it comes back again to the information.  I honestly could not give the committee one reason, but it is a combination of all of those.  We need to know what the factors are so that we can drive at those.  Is it because our judges have gone AWOL?  Is it because the doctors are charging?  Of course it is not.  It is not one particular thing; it is all of the above.</p></speech>

I have bilaterally met all the insurance companies, trying to work through these issues for members.</p><p>The Solvency II directive, the reserves, the state of the investment market and other such financial issues which we do not consider when we think about claims and accidents are factors in the background.  As has been said, there really are only five companies, which are all multinationals that operate elsewhere.  They wonder why they are in this market.  As an association, our real worry is that if one of them pulls out, we would be in serious difficulties.</p></speech>

I truly believe, however, that if I were to give an answer, it would be based on anecdote and hearsay.  This is why I reiterate that in the absence of independently verified concrete data no one can answer it.  We call all give an opinion, but the trouble with the debate to date is it is based on opinion and not facts.  If the committee gets the data it will have the answer.</p></speech>

We spoke earlier about the Consumers Association of Ireland trying to get to the bottom of the issue.  I asked about a regulatory body getting its teeth into it to get the information required.  If the information is all so good and can be validated, what is the risk of putting it into a public forum where it can be analysed and examined?  I am concerned as to why the information is not being put out there.  As Ms Callan stated, this is the thin end of the wedge.  Next will be home insurance and insurance for businesses creeping up.</p> <p>  No one is suggesting the insurance companies are making massive profits, but they are doing something in a very closed, unacceptable and concealed manner.  They have a blank cheque with regard to motor insurance premiums for businesses and private citizens and it is not good enough.  This is what we are dealing with.</p> <p>  The courts should have a matrix of awards so if someone is unfortunate enough to get whiplash in an accident and gets cash instead of care there should be limit.  The problem is a judge might give me &euro;5,000 and give someone else &euro;15,000.  This is a huge issue and it is a factor.  They are not above the law either and they must be accountable.  It is no one person's responsibility to solve this - a partnership approach is required.  That is why the motor insurance advisory board or an equivalent body could play an important role.  It would bring all stakeholders together, which is the only way this will be solved.</p></speech>

Dr. Gillen's point was on the concept of a black box and all of the players' data becoming available anonymously and not for the benefit of competitors.  At a previous session, the point was made that it could be argued the industry is operating as a form of a cartel, and on this basis the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission could be used to get stuck into the figures involved but this is not Dr. Gillen's point.  What are his thoughts on such an idea?  We have had much talk in the past week about EU Commissioners looking at various competition matters and using them as a way to interrogate issues.</p></speech>

In fairness, the point of a cartel is to make money and all of the evidence suggests the companies are losing money.  I had not considered the competition angle, but the analogy I would use is a small country town with five shopkeepers all of whom are asked to announce to the entire populace how much they will charge for a chicken on any one day.  If only one person states the price, a competitive advantage is immediately given to all of the others.  My black-box concept would override this.  I do not believe the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is set up to do this type of work.  I can understand it wanting to get its hands on it, but I do not necessarily-----</p></speech>

Companies are regulated here and at EU level.  From our experience of dealing with banks in recent years when we asked for more data on SME lending, the banks found a way to give the data to the Central Bank which gave it back to us in a way that was not anti-competitive.</p></speech>

I do not think it ever does any harm to ask the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for its opinion.  We should also ask whether there would be any barriers.  That is why the Commission exists.</p></speech>

One would expect the Central Bank estimates on something as simple as the average size of a claim to be bigger because it is forward looking and includes provisions for legal costs but it is the other way around as far as we can tell.  The famous headline regarding a 27% increase in premiums was based on a much smaller number than that of the Injuries Board and we cannot fathom this.  Until we have hard data, we could have one regulator telling the insurers to charge more because they do not charge enough while another states they are acting as a cartel and need to charge less.  A battle of regulators would not be terribly helpful.  We can agree on facts but there is a big shortage of them at present.</p></speech>
