    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Val&eacute;rie Masson-Delmotte" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018112100002#B00300"><p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation and giving us the opportunity to share the key findings of the IPCC special report on global warming of 1.5&deg; Celsius.  I will begin by highlighting the four main messages of the report, which are that climate change is already affecting people, ecosystems and livelihoods all around the world; limiting warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius is not impossible but would require unprecedented transitions in all aspects of society; there are clear benefits to keeping warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius compared with 2&deg; Celsius or higher; and limiting global warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius can go hand in hand with other world goals such as achieving sustainable development and eradicating poverty.</p> <p>  The report is the outcome of the collective work of 91 authors from 40 countries who have assessed new knowledge based on 6,000 publications.  The successive drafts of the report received more than 42,000 review comments from more than 1,000 expert reviewers.</p> <p>  Since pre-industrial times - the end of the 19th century with regard to temperature - human activities have caused approximately 1&deg; Celsius of global warming.  We are already seeing the consequences of this through, for instance, rising sea levels and more extreme weather.  At the current rate of warming of 0.2&deg; Celsius per decade, the global mean surface temperature will reach an increase of 1.5&deg; Celsius in the climate sense, averaged over 30 years, between 2030 and 2050.  Although past emissions will continue to cause changes in the climate system and rises in sea levels, they alone will not cause global warming of 1.5&deg; Celsius.  Thus, limiting warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius is not geophysically impossible.  It will depend on emissions from now on.</p> <p>  I will discuss the differences between global warming of 1.5&deg; Celsius and 2&deg; Celsius for climate-related risks.  Climate models project robust differences in regional climate characteristics between global warming of 1&deg; Celsius, 1.5&deg; Celsius and 2&deg; Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  They differences include the level of warming in various land and ocean regions, hot extremes, heavy rainfall in several regions and the probability of drought in some regions.  Sea levels are projected to increase.  Limiting global warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius compared to 2&deg; Celsius would reduce the rate of sea level rise by approximately 10 cm by the end of the century.  That would mean that fewer people would be exposed to the consequences of rising seas and that there would be more time for adaptation.</p> <p>  Limiting global warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius compared to 2&deg; Celsius would also reduce the transformation and degradation of marine and terrestrial ecosystems and the risk of irreversible loss of biodiversity.  It would imply smaller reductions in yields of key cereals, including maize, rice and wheat, and lower risks for fisheries and associated livelihoods, especially tropical fisheries.  It would also reduce the percentage of the global population exposed to water shortages.</p> <p>  Climate-related risks are disproportionately higher for some regions, particularly dry land regions, small island developing states, the least developed countries and the Arctic region.  There is a close link between development and climate-related risks and limiting warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius compared to 2&deg; Celsius would reduce the number of people exposed to climate-related risks and susceptibility to poverty by up to several hundred million by 2050.</p> <p>  Our report shows clearly that limiting global warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius compared to 2&deg; Celsius is associated with lower climate-related risks for food and water security, health, human security, livelihoods and economic growth.  Our assessment highlights the need for adaptation, even to a small amount of warming such as 1.5&deg; Celsius at a global scale, and the fact that there is a wide range of adaptation options that can reduce climate risks.  However, there are knowledge gaps associated with the co-benefits, costs and limits of adaptation.  To sum up, each 0.5&deg; Celsius matters.</p><p> What emissions pathways and systems transitions are consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius?  If we want to limit global warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius, global emissions of carbon dioxide need to fall by about half by 2030 and reach a net figure of zero by approximately 2050.  For the purposes of comparison, limiting warming to 2&deg; Celsius implies reducing emissions by around 20% by 2030 and reaching a net figure of zero by 2075.  Mitigation pathways also imply deep reductions in other emissions of substances that lead to warming such as methane and black carbon by 35% or more by 2050.  Reducing these non-CO2 emissions has direct and immediate benefits for air quality and health.</p><p> Limiting global warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius is not impossible, but it implies rapid changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, urban, infrastructure and industrial systems.  It means deep emissions reductions in all sectors, a steep decline in coal usage, the use of a wide range of technologies, behavioural changes on the demand side and an increase by a factor of five in investment in low-carbon energy and energy efficiency measures by 2050.</p><p> Rapid progress is being made in some areas, notably renewable energy.  There is clearly a need to pick up this rate of progress in other sectors such as transport and land management.  </p><p> Pathways also show that to limit global warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius, we would need to start eliminating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the 21st century.  Methods for doing this include land management, for instance, afforestation and reforestation; restoration of degraded ecosystems; agricultural practices linked with biochar and soil carbon sequestration; bioenergy combined with carbon dioxide capture and storage; and other approaches that are at the very early stages of research.  Carbon dioxide removal on a large scale, for instance, with bioenergy, would have implications for food security, ecosystems and biodiversity through additional pressures on land.</p><p> Pledges made by governments under the Paris Agreement within the last three years are clearly not enough to keep global warming below 1.5&deg; Celsius, even with ambitious and very challenging efforts after 2030.  These pledges put us on track for 3&deg; Celsius or more of warming if there is no increase in ambition.  If we want to avoid overshooting 1.5&deg; Celsius, or reliance on carbon dioxide removal later, carbon dioxide emissions would need to decline substantially on a global scale before 2030.  To summarise, with 42 billion tonnes of CO2 emitted each year, each year matters.</p><p> What is the interplay with sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty?  Climate change impacts and how we respond to them are closely linked with sustainable development.  Our report shows clearly that each option and pathway has different synergies and trade-offs with other sustainable development goals.  As part of limiting global warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius, the report shows that it is a mix of measures to adapt to a changing climate and options to reduce emissions which, if carefully selected within each community, have benefits in meeting sustainable development goals.  This reflects the notion of ethical and fair transitions.  We also show that pathways with low energy demand, low material consumption and low carbon food carry the highest co-benefits, including for public health.  Feasibility requires key ingredients - co-operation, governance, innovation and mobilisation of finance.</p><p> Each half degree matters; each year matters; and each choice matters.  Limiting global warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius is not impossible, but the political will to accelerate transitions is key.  I thank committee members for their attention.</p></speech>

I thank the joint committee very much for the invitation.  As the slide shows, I will focus in my contribution on the agriculture sector as it represents a key sector for discussion.  It accounts for roughly one third of all Irish emissions and is an important economic sector for the country which will be massively impacted on by climate change in the coming years, given how it is organised.  It has already been the case this year.</p> <p>  In my contribution I shall focus on shedding light on the propositions made by the Citizens' Assembly and putting them in the perspective of the special report on global warming of 1.5&deg; Celsius.  The Citizens' Assembly made three proposals.  They were taxing greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions from the agriculture sector and rewarding agricultural practices that sequestered carbon; making the measurement of and reporting on food waste mandatory at every part of food chains; and supporting land use diversification, with specific emphasis on afforestation and organic farming. </p> <p>  I would like to show that while the recommendations get right to the point, they are not enough in the light of the results of the special report.  I have already explained what the results are, but I would like to stress what they mean for the agriculture sector.  The special report presents three pathways to get to a carbon neutral world by 2050.  On all three pathways the agriculture sector plays a key role in at least three ways.  First, there is a need to massively reduce the level of emissions from the agriculture sector to zero in a maximum of one or two decades.  Second, the agriculture sector has to contribute massively to carbon sequestration.  The removal capacity of the sector must be increased.  Third, the land and agriculture sector has to support other sectors through the production of biomass that can be used for either energy or material production.  When taken together, all of these objectives will greatly affect land use, as Professor Masson-Delmotte said.  This, in turn, will impact on at least three other aspects, namely, biodiversity and ecosystem services; food production, food security and food system organisation; and adaptation of the agriculture sector.  The way in which we deal with these three objectives simultaneously will impact on the other three aspects. </p> <p>  What does this mean for the Irish agriculture sector?  The sector has experienced a similar path to the rest of European agriculture, that is, intensification, concentration and specialisation.  Since the 2008 crisis, the targets set for the sector have aimed to increase production, mainly in the ruminants and bovine sector.  The targets aim to increase dairy production by 50% in volume and 20% in value by 2020.  Following this plan which was issued in 2010 is unlikely to lead the Irish agriculture sector to neutrality in line with the special report's recommendation.  It will probably lead to an increase in the size of the ruminant herd and, in turn, increase greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, when the idea is to bring the level of emissions to zero, offer sequestration potential for other sectors and produce biomass for energy and other purposes. </p> <p>  I will finish my remarks on the Irish agriculture sector by stressing that there are options to make it carbon-neutral at sectoral and national level, but in the light of the special report's results, this will not be enough.</p><p> There are a couple of implications for the sector if we are to be in line with the recommendations in the special report.  First, there is probably a need to decrease the level of dairy production.  Even if the efficiency level increases, it has to go hand in hand with a production decrease.  We have to have both.  Second, it will be dependent on the way in which domestic and international demand evolves.  The Irish sector is very much export oriented.  If there is still considerable international demand, why should the Irish sector not meet it?</p><p> Last but not least, it is important to point out that the aim in the report is carbon neutrality at global level, not at national or sectoral levels, meaning that, given the configuration of Irish agriculture, it is likely Ireland will have to contribute to offset for residual emissions from other parts of the world, especially highly densely populated areas where offsetting possibilities are low.  This puts even more pressure on the way on which the land is used and on sequestration ambitions.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  It is a great honour to be asked to present here.</p> <p>  I will talk about climate extremes at global warming of 1.5&deg; Celsius and 2&deg; Celsius.  I shall provide a little more background on projected changes at those two levels of warming.  I was involved as lead author on the chapter in the special report dealing with the impacts of global warming of 1.5&deg; Celsius on natural and human systems.</p> <p>  I want to start with a point that Professor Val&eacute;rie Masson-Delmotte made, namely, that we are living in a warmer world, with 1&deg; Celsius of global warming.  We saw very well this summer that the implications of warming of just this amount are substantial.  There was a drought and heatwave in Ireland, and there was also a heatwave in the United Kingdom.  There were forest fires in Sweden.  At the same time, there was a drought in Germany and Switzerland, where I am from.  There were fires in California, and more again recently.  There were heatwaves in Japan and Canada.  Any single one of those events would be difficult to attribute to climate change but it is unlikely that all the events would have happened at the same time without climate change.</p> <p>  I want to mention a point made that was quite striking for me.  Often when we think of the impact of climate change, we think of developing countries but there were several deaths associated with heatwaves in developed countries, including in Japan and Canada, which are developed countries in high latitudes or mid-latitudes.  Recently there were deaths in California.  Even developed countries are not safe from climate change.</p> <p>  Members can view a slide illustrating the widespread heat wave.  I believe Professor Stott mentioned this a month ago.  In the past, there were areas that might have been as warm locally as this summer but what was very different this summer is that there was a global signal.  It was not located only in Europe.</p> <p>  If we examine temperature anomalies this summer by comparison with the middle of the 20th century, we see that from April to July this summer, there was an anomaly of more than 2&deg; Celsius.  It means that even those there is warming of 1&deg; Celsius, there can be much larger anomalies in a single location or in single months.  One can see clearly that this was a very extreme summer.</p> <p>  It is not only temperature that is affected; so too is the water cycle.  There are impacts in the form of heavy precipitation.  The link is that when there is warmer air, it can contain more moisture, which means that when it is raining, there is more rain.  There were some floods in France in 2016.  There were some in Japan in 2018.  There were some in the United States associated with tropical cyclones.  I have heard about flooding in Donegal.  There is no specific study on this but with heavy precipitation increasing with warmer climate, it is probable that precipitation levels have also been affected.</p> <p>  To give members a general picture, the last IPCC report, from 2013, shows a likely increase due to human influence on climate.  For heavy precipitation, the evidence is less strong but there is medium confidence that the trend since 1950 is also due to human influence.  There was lower confidence in the evidence for drought and tropical cyclones but there is new evidence for the attribution of drought to human-induced climate change, for instance, in the Mediterranean region.  This is also the case with heavy precipitation associated with tropical cyclones.  We have more evidence for extremes being linked to human-induced climate change.</p> <p>  I refer to extremes associated with warming levels of 1.5&deg; Celsius and 2&deg; Celsius.  I wish to demonstrate the direct link between carbon dioxide emissions and global warming.  Members can see from the slide that, for a given warming target, there is an associated CO2 emissions level.  We are speaking only of global warming, not of regional changes in extremes.  A slide shows the average change of temperature of the hottest days with average warming of 1.5&deg; Celsius and the change on the coldest nights.  On average, while there is average warming of 1.5&deg; Celsius, it is much higher in many areas, especially land areas.  Land areas tend to warm much more, to a factor of two or three.  This is why, when one hears about warming of 1.5&deg; Celsius, which sounds like a lot, one should realise, it can imply warming of 2&deg;, 4&deg; or 5&deg; Celsius in some locations.  Europe is strongly affected.</p> <p>  The same principle applies for warming of 2&deg; Celsius but there are even greater changes on the hottest days and coldest nights.  A slide shows the average warming is between 2&deg; Celsius and 3&deg; Celsius but it is up to 4&deg; Celsius in some cases - for the hot extremes.  In the high latitudes, there is warming of up to 6&deg; Celsius or 8&deg; Celsius.</p> <p>  We considered the difference between changes with warming of 1.5&deg; Celsius and 2&deg; Celsius in the report.  We could identify robust and statistically significant differences.  There are differences in the temperature of hottest days at the top and the number of hot days.  In most locations, including Ireland, we find substantial differences in hot extremes based on warming of 1.5&deg; Celsius and of 2&deg; Celsius.</p> <p>  Another slide shows changes in mean precipitation.  There is a trend towards a decrease in precipitation in the southern part of Europe, for instance, but an increase in the northern part of Europe.  Ireland is located in an area where there is a substantial robust increase in mean precipitation with additional warming.</p><p>Mean heavy precipitation is projected to increase compared to pre-industrial levels, both at 1.5&deg; Celsius and 2&deg; Celsius.  It is the same with extreme precipitation, with an increase in heavy precipitation at 1.5&deg; Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels and at 2&deg; Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.</p><p> There are some differences at 1.5&deg; Celsius and 2&deg; Celsius.  The slide shows results aggregated for all of northern Europe, which includes Ireland.  On one side, we can see different indices of heavy precipitation, and, for most measures of heavy precipitation, there is statistically significant increase in heavy precipitation at 2&deg; Celsius compared to 1.5&deg; Celsius.</p><p> I refer to some other impacts associated with global warming.  We look at impacts on human, managed and natural systems above 1.5&deg; Celsius.  In some cases, we have irreversible changes.  For example, in regard to coral reefs, we are at a warming level that is risky for the reefs and could lead to extinction if there are higher levels of warming.  There are also irreversible changes between 1.5&deg; Celsius and 2&deg; Celsius with melting of ice around Greenland and some sea level rises.</p><p> To conclude, half a degree matters.  Limiting global warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius would avoid widespread increases in extremes, as well as heavy precipitation extremes in several regions and droughts in some regions.  We are experiencing the impacts of global warming at 1&deg; Celsius.  We have amplification of regional changes in temperature extremes and there has been a much higher warming of extremes compared to the mean global temperature in many locations, as well as, for example, some irreversible changes for biodiversity and sea level rise.  There are also substantial changes in heavy precipitation and in temperature extremes for Ireland and northern Europe.  Of course, we need to model scenarios to have more information for Ireland.  As was mentioned, limiting global warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius is geophysically still possible but it would require unprecedented changes.</p></speech>

I will start with some questions before I go to members of the committee.  The IPCC's latest report suggests the world needs to get to zero global emissions by 2050 for us to stabilise at 1.5&deg; Celsius.  Ireland's long-term national policy position is for a reduction of at least 80% in emissions across the energy, built environment and transport sectors, and for carbon neutrality in agriculture and land use by 2050.  In May of this year, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, indicated that Ireland is projected to fall far short of our 2020 targets and that, at best, we will achieve 1%.  With that in mind, do the witnesses believe that Ireland's national policy of at least 80% reductions across these key sectors, and carbon neutrality in agriculture and land use, is compatible with the IPCC report with regard to achieving a reduction of 1.5&deg; Celsius?  Should we revise our targets?  Given we currently way off course for 2050, where should our level of ambition be for 2030 if we are to really try to achieve these targets?</p> <p>  On a practical level, what are the key opportunities for Ireland in regard to reducing our emissions?  Can the witnesses highlight two or three technologies and solutions that Ireland could adopt at scale to have an immediate impact on reaching those targets?  What tax and policy framework would be needed to introduce those technologies and solutions at scale?  Are there other countries that do this well?  For example, there is the issue of retrofitting residential homes, for which there is a great deal of appetite among citizens, although cost is an issue.  How do other countries finance this?  The Government can finance some of this but it cannot pay for everything.  Have models worked in other countries whereby the private homeowners could finance the deep retrofitting of their homes?  Do the witnesses have practical examples or suggestions for us to lay out a pathway, given we will write a report in January?  The suggestions may not work in an Irish context but it would be interesting to hear of other countries that do this well.</p></speech>

With respect to what has been achieved so far, approximately 50 countries have reached peak emissions and there is a decline, although often too slow with respect to what is at stake.  What we observe is not just something for Ireland; it is much broader.  This report was requested by delegates from countries during COP21.  There would not have been agreement at COP21 if there had not been the indication to prepare this report, especially as some governments considered that the Paris agreement target of below 2&deg; Celsius was not sufficient to avoid dangerous consequences in their regions.  We have prepared this assessment.  I have shared with the committee the key findings and there are 400 pages of more substantial information within the report, all of which is online.  COP24 will be focused on dialogue but the same dialogue applies in each community and each country as to where we are, where we want to go and how we get there.  Rather than thinking of climate change as a constraint, there is potential to see it as an opportunity to think of well-being for the future, for example, where we want to go, collectively, and how to improve health, transport or well-being within buildings.  Climate is part of that, among many other aspects of sustainability.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked for examples.  For land systems, our report shows the importance of thinking change as a whole, that is, to have adaptation and mitigation at the same time.  For example, the agricultural system is resilient and can have a climate resilient development pathway.  Options in the report are linked to conservation agriculture, sustainable intensification, livestock management, irrigation efficiency, agroforestry, managing food loss and waste, new technologies - for example, to reduce enteric methane emissions from cattle - ecosystem restoration, community-based adaptation and wetland management, and these are some of the key elements of a systems approach for land transitions.  Ireland has significant potential for many of these aspects, so there are many opportunities.  The key is thinking on the systems scale and integrating not just climate change but more particularly climate change in the context of diversity and well-being for people up-front.</p> <p>  The report also shows that, in the discussion of what can be the transitions, key issues are associated with power and inequalities.  What works is based on inclusive processes.  There are examples from other parts of the world of successful transitions in the agricultural sector, and I have in mind a co-operative of Danish and Swedish farmers that produces dairy products.  This big co-operative is engaged in a transition with evidence for the ability to continuously decrease their greenhouse gas emissions.  These are examples that work and that could be inspiring.</p></speech>

If we want to achieve 1.5&deg; Celsius, the report suggests we would need zero emissions by 2050.  However, this is a long-term goal, so it is probably better to focus first on 2030.</p></speech>

From the report, the goal is to reach about 50% of the 2010 emissions by 2030.  However, developed countries will need to make a bigger effort as they are developing.</p><p>In terms of the retrofit of homes, I am from Switzerland.  The Swiss Government gave subsidies for people to retrofit their homes.  The scheme was efficient so homes are relatively well insulated.  Insulation is also good for the climate and saves energy.  Retrofitting has many benefits and the initiative has been successful in Switzerland.</p></speech>

It has been stated here that it would cost &euro;50 billion to retrofit all homes in Ireland, which the Government cannot afford.  Therefore, we must find innovative ways to assist private citizens to retrofit their homes.</p></speech>

That could be something that is thought about at a European level, as a political entity.  That aspect is something we must keep in mind.</p> <p>  Regarding immediate political actions, looking from a food system perspective, there is broad consensus that diets must change.  This aspect has been discussed for a couple of years in academic literature but it is not really a matter of political action.  In terms of where one take immediate action, there are things to be done to better communicate to people that they can reduce their calorie intake, protein intake and intake of animal protein and replace it with vegetarian protein intake, and reduce sugar intake.  These changes will be doubly beneficial as they will protect people's health and protect the climate.           </p></speech>

The report is a wake-up call, as if we had not enough of those already, and raises a red flag in a way that previous reports have not done.</p> <p>  It has dawned on this committee that we need to adopt a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to tackle climate change and communicating with citizens will be crucial.  I believe that we have failed to communicate with citizens to a great degree.  A national dialogue on climate action has been established but an enormous amount of work remains to be done to tackle the complex problem of climate change.  Can the witnesses list the actions that other countries have taken to communicate with citizens that have proven to be successful?  Are meteorological services in other countries used to communicate with citizens?  Met &Eacute;ireann, the Irish national meteorological service, communicates weather information several times every day.  I firmly believe such communication is an opportunity for the State broadcaster and Met &Eacute;ireann to work together to promote climate change.  I ask the witnesses to express their views and cite examples.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses recommend a set of climate principles that all political parties could take on board?  Regardless of which party is in power, we must ensure that the principles underpin climate action into the future. </p> <p>  The witnesses made a reference to the impact climate change would have on islands.  Ireland is vulnerable to climate change due to being an island nation.  What will happen if temperatures are not kept in check globally?  What will happen to this island in a catastrophic situation?  At what point will a situation be declared catastrophic?  What adaptation measures have been successful in other countries?  I would like to know that so that we might add them to our climate action plan.</p> <p>  The Citizens' Assembly recommended a tax on greenhouse gas emissions generated by the agricultural sector.  How do the witnesses view the imposition of a greenhouse gas tax on agriculture in Ireland?  Would the initiative have a net benefit on global emissions or displace production to somewhere less efficient?  That latter issue has arisen and we must take it into consideration.</p> <p>  Should methane be added to the emissions trading system?  Are there examples of methane sequestration available?  </p> <p>  As much as 20% of the land in Ireland is covered in peat.  Is there a potential for using peatlands for sequestration and as a carbon sink?  Do the witnesses have a calculation on the re-wetting of bogs and whether it is successful?  </p> <p>  The Republic of Ireland has a very mixed agricultural policy.  Some farmers are interested in afforestation but some are not and view the planting of trees as a waste of good land.  Are there good examples of afforestation?  If so, we can incentivise farmers to increase afforestation.  What types of trees are the best choice?</p></speech>

Education is key.  School programmes should start early in the lives of children and be structured to provide tools for future citizens to understand what is at stake.  The programmes should also focus on providing solutions.  Such education should provide tools for younger generations in order that they can act when they graduate from the education system.  Why not use schools as places for experimentation?  One could implement projects in schools and then base them in communities.  There are powerful examples all around the world, in both developed and developing countries, that have the potential of giving a strong base for climate action within communities.</p> <p>  The second point was about governance, issues like methodology for the climate proofing of all types of projects.  One would not just look at the usual administrative rules or the cost but also the systematic assessment of the resilience of the project in a changing climate, and the implications of the project during its lifetime for greenhouse gas emissions and the consistency with the pathway that the country wants to follow.  </p> <p>  With respect, one can also see Ireland as a large ocean country.  Next year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, will release a Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, which deals with the frozen parts of the world.  The special report will have a specific chapter on coastal areas and a specific chapter on marine echo systems and the livelihoods that depend on them.  Those chapters will be very relevant to this country.  There are examples of adaptation strategies for coastal areas in many places around the world.  There are also examples of decision processes and democratic approaches that discuss what one wants to protect and at what cost.  That includes very high investment that blocks some adaptation processes or provides a more flexible approach that allows one to revise an adaptation strategy as well as provide nature-based solutions.</p> <p>  In terms of the last question, there is a potential to eliminate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere using peatland restoration.  The report shows that afforestation and the restoration of eco-systems, and some agricultural practices, are the least costly approaches for carbon dioxide removal.  However, there is a need for more knowledge on the true potential for extracting carbon dioxide and the durability of the storage as well, so that it is not dependent on drought or fires that would risk putting CO2 back into the atmosphere.</p><p>There is a need for more knowledge on the true potential of how much CO2 can be extracted and the durability of the storage that is independent of drought or fires that would risk putting that CO2 back into the atmosphere.  That is the potential in many ways.  Nature-based solutions such as this one offer multiple advantages through ecosystem services and recreational activities.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the meteorological services.  There are specifically two topics on which the meteorological services could do more communication including here in Ireland.  I mentioned whether this summer was related to climate change.  On the level of communication it is important to do climactic attribution so that whenever there is an event we should look at what was the contribution of greenhouse gas forcing to those events.  Some countries are considering doing some operational event attribution, for instance in Germany.  It may be difficult to develop a new system in Ireland; maybe it could be done in collaboration with other weather services.  It would be very powerful to be able to say that a particular event may have been made stronger because of climate change, for example identifying it was three times more probable as a result.  In terms of communications it gets the message across very quickly.</p> <p>  What I was showing in climactic analysis is very coarse.  As it is based on those global scenarios, we do not have a focus on Ireland.  We cannot really provide country-based information.  I was trying to extract the information I could.  For instance, we recently developed climate scenarios for Switzerland where we co-ordinated with M&eacute;t&eacute;oSuisse, the Swiss weather centre.  As the Deputy said, the weather centres have a good reputation among the population.  It would be useful to have them more involved in the development of this type of information and also having the scenarios targeted for a country because then people can basically consider what the actual implications for the country would be.  This would also be a useful development.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what the impacts for Ireland would be.  Of course, the report contained a really broad assessment.  I cannot speak specifically to Ireland.  It is clear that all locations have an increase in temperature extremes.  In high latitudes to mid latitudes, such as here, we have an increase in heavy precipitation, which is also associated with more flooding.  I do not know about droughts, which is a difficult topic.  We see that the probability is higher.  We would not expect such an increase, but there was a summer drought so maybe we are not sure yet.  Of course, a sea-level rise could be relevant for coastal regions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Pierre-Marie Aubert" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018112100002#G00300"><p>On the agriculture sector, the Deputy asked whether we should tax emissions from the agriculture sector.  She mentioned the problem of potential emission displacement.  We need to consider what the basis for taxation would be.  Would it be on the basis of the level of efficiency or on the basis of absolute level of emission?  The choice makes a big difference.  Taxing on the basis of efficiency might be a better option if we are to consider that at the global level the most efficient production systems have to be favoured.  In any case, as I said in my introductory speech, we need to go for both efficiency improvements and overall reduction in the production if we are to meet the target that we have set.</p> <p>  If the current technologies to increase the efficiency level in agricultural production are implemented at scale, they might have some impact on the way landscapes are managed in Ireland.  In order to complement feed and use methanogenesis approaches, cattle need to be kept under shelter at least for a certain number of hours.  It will be necessary to change completely the way Irish cattle are raised and they will no longer be totally grass-fed.  That will have a significant impact and needs to be carefully considered.</p> <p>  There are two other things related to the potential displacement that could result.  If the approach is in terms of absolute levels of emission, the question would be to what extent farmers at an individual level or the collective level would decrease the size of the herd.  If the size of the herd decreases, with what can it be replaced?  Ireland is import-dependent for its food in the sense that it does not cover its needs with most staple products coming from other countries.  If Ireland replaces bovine herds by something else allowing it to meet the needs of its population, that might also be something interesting.  The country could re-diversify the production at the national level which might also be a very good option.</p> <p>  I wish to discuss the symmetric option which would be to reward good practices.  The options are to tax greenhouse-gas emission or reward sequestering practices.  That leads to the Deputy's question on afforestation and how to favour afforestation practices at farm level.  In considering the types of incentives to favour sequestration at the farm level, it is important that the kind of practices favoured to sequester carbon will not change over time.  To put it simply, if people sequester carbon and build carbon stocks in soil by grazing in a particular way or by growing crops without tilling so on, if at some point in time there is a change in that practice, all the carbon that has been sequestered in the soil will be released.  There is a big issue.  If it is decided to favour practices to store carbon in agricultural soil, it is necessary to ensure that practices will not change over time, otherwise it will be totally missed.</p> <p>  It is similar with afforestation in the sense that it depends on what the trees that are planted will be used for and when.  I do not have clear examples of countries where agroforestry practices have been highly incentivised.  As we discussed over lunch with Professor Masson-Delmotte, agroforestry might be one of the best options to store carbon in agricultural land.  I do not know the exact potential in the Irish context given that one of the main interests of agroforestry in France or Mediterranean countries is that it limits the drying effect of sun.  I do not think that is an issue here where the level of precipitation is expected to increase rather than decrease.</p></speech>

It is not just an issue in terms of farming practices, but also in terms of the link to local supplies for the building sector instead of the use of concrete or other options.  We see major progress in this direction in other European countries with multilevel buildings being developed using specific types of wood.  It would also be interesting to think not just about the farm level, but also about the ultimate use of the wood at the country level.</p> <p>  I wish to comment on the methane side at the global level.</p><p>We compare today the effect of greenhouse gases by looking at how much heat they trap at the top of the atmosphere.  We call it the radiative forcing.  For the well-mixed greenhouse gases, it is altogether 2.8 W per sq. m approximately, 1.8 W from CO2 and we estimated for methane about 0.5 W for the direct effect and there is also an indirect effect because when methane interacts with atmospheric chemistry it creates near-surface ozone, which is a challenge in the context of air quality.  It creates water vapour in the high atmosphere that has a warming effect and then it finally gives way to CO2.  The indirect effect is about the same amount, so altogether it is around 1 W per sq. m, which is very significant after the CO2.  Recent studies show that the direct effect might have been underestimated.  There are a couple of studies in the literature which show that new knowledge on how methane interacts with visible radiation, short-wave radiation, suggests the direct effect to be perhaps 25% greater than previously assessed.  That is important, but I am not aware of any specific trade scheme.  I have seen very theoretical studies of potential chemical reactions that could interact with methane in the atmosphere but nothing close to a sequestration approach.</p></speech>

I framed the questions based on the submissions as I read them.  It is a very welcome report.  It has utterly transformed the narrative on climate change and what needs to be done.  It is very interesting that it was followed quickly by the Living Planet report from the World Wildlife Foundation, which backed up everything that was being said in terms of the urgency and what is required to get us out of what could be a catastrophic extinction event, as well as catastrophic climate change.</p> <p>  Professor Masson-Delmotte might find this an odd question.  I think the language in the report is good because it talks about a rapid, unprecedented transition.  For that to happen she went through the list of changes that are required on an unprecedented scale in energy, on land and urban areas, infrastructure and industrial systems.  Does she think that would also require unprecedented change in the political systems?  She might not want to comment on that.  We met representatives from the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  One of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly is to establish an overarching independent body that would have legislative back-up to ensure that the recommendations we make will be implemented.  Professor Masson-Delmotte should have heard the resistance from the Department of Finance.  We were told it would not work and the Department completed disagreed with the recommendation.  Are we saying that a revolution must happen before we implement what is required in order to keep us out of trouble?</p> <p>  My second question is whether Professor Masson-Delmotte would agree that market mechanisms that were introduced as a result of the Paris Convention - such as offsetting, carbon trading and carbon taxes - have failed to stop climate change in its tracks.  The market is the biggest contributor to global warming due to the way we produce industrially and agriculturally, how we make profits and how we trade.  Does Professor Masson-Delmotte agree that market mechanisms have failed and that we must consider the type of recommendations that have been made by the witnesses?</p> <p>  My final question for Professor Masson-Delmotte is one that we were recommended to ask by the committee and I think it is a very good one.  In terms of taking a blank canvas approach, how would she recommend we progress for a national parliamentary system such as Ireland&rsquo;s?  That is in some way related to my first question.  Could she refer to just transition for workers and communities, because that is a real challenge for us now with Bord na M&oacute;na closing down peat production?  Does she believe the European Union is doing enough to contribute to what is going on?  We do not hear much from the European Parliament about legislation in this area.</p> <p>  Should I continue to ask questions, Chairman?</p></speech>

The Deputy can see that she is putting me outside of my comfort zone in that the IPCC reports are policy-relevant but they have to be neutral.  In a way, she asked me to provide advice or recommendations.  I just want to make that clear.</p> <p>  The first question was about the political system and the changes that are needed to facilitate the transitions.  What is really interesting about our report is that in chapter 4, Strengthening the Global Response, it looks at the systems transitions, integrating adaptation and mitigation, not separated, and then for each big option for adaptation or mitigation it looks at six dimensions of feasibility - geophysical, environmental, technological, economic and socio-cultural in terms of the notion of acceptability and finally the institutional part.  This effort was based on scientific literature and it helps to identify where the barriers are.  For many options available today, the barriers are on the institutional side.  As a result, what is really relevant is to identify where the barriers are.  In many ways, they are in how administrations operate in silos rather than having an integrated approach.  There are options for thinking about differently how political systems work to facilitate the implementation of transitions where we see they are feasible in terms of technology and the economy but sometimes it is governments that are not ready to deploy them at the scale on which they could be deployed.</p> <p>  The second point was about market mechanisms.  That is really outside my area of expertise.  I am not sure I am the right person to comment on that part but it is clear that free markets without governance cannot help deploy solutions at the scale at which they are needed.  What is really important is governance.  There is experience from various regions of the world showing that a number of tools are available, including, but not only, carbon prices,.  Then there are lessons learned from what works in many different contexts.</p> <p>  I share the Deputy's view regarding the notion of a just, fair or ethical transition.  Our report is very explicit on that in the framing chapter and in the last chapter on the sustainable development pathways.  It means for each choice paying specific attention to those who are most exposed and vulnerable to climate change or to the policy response options and considering their interests upfront.  It is reversing the power structure in a way to make sure that the policy decisions protect the most vulnerable people.  That is really a key ingredient.  There are many lessons learnt from many other changes such that if transitions are not designed to be just and fair then their implementation will fail because of the public perception of not being involved in the decision-making or being disproportionately affected by the decisions, especially for the poorest.</p></speech>

I brought forward a Bill - I hope it will go through Parliament - to end the issuing of licences for offshore fossil fuels exploration.  It has met great opposition from the oil industry and vested interests.  Ireland does not have oil tycoons in the same way as  Iraq or Saudi Arabia, because we do not have big oilfields.  However, the head of Providence Resources, Tony O'Reilly Jnr., recently levelled the accusation that the Bill is short-sighted in nature and makes no sense.  He said it would force Ireland to turn its back on its own hydrocarbon potential.  Earlier, I noted feeds on Twitter concerning a website for business people - proactiveinvestors.com - which states that Ireland's great opportunity is now closer than ever as new drilling comes into view.</p><p>If one drills down into that, so to speak, what they are proposing is a partnership with China on further oil exploration off the Irish coast.  On a national and a global scale, do the witnesses believe it is wise for a country like Ireland to ban further exploration of fossil fuel given that if we manage to do it, we would be the fifth country, including France, to declare a ban on issuing more licences?  The witnesses ended their presentations by stating it is not just a local responsibility but a global responsibility.  We may not be very oil rich but it would be part of a global effort to deal with a very serious crisis.  I would like the witnesses' opinion on that issue because I am very annoyed with the way the business class is responding to this Bill.</p></speech>

Like Professor Masson-Delmotte, in terms of my position, we are supposed to be policy relevant and not policy prescriptive.  The main issue is CO2 emissions in the atmosphere.  We have to make every effort not to add additional CO2, therefore, going into oil exploration is not a solution.  What the Deputy said makes sense.  As we know we have to make this energy transition, it would make sense for Ireland to turn away from that source of fossil fuel.  From that point of view, any additional CO2 that is emitted will contribute more to the problem.</p></speech>

I am fascinated by this subject because I believe it is one of the biggest challenges we face.  The witnesses took a look at the Irish agricultural sector, which is all about producing more cows for both beef and dairy production, and exporting them, interestingly, to places that traditionally never ate beef or dairy, such as the Middle East and China.  The chief executive of Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board, boasted recently about going to China where they had a great time promoting the consumption of dairy products.  In a world where climate change is happening, it is obscene that we would promote the consumption of more dairy and meat, particularly in terms of health.  How do the witnesses view the role of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, either in terms of intervening or having a discourse with those in the Irish agriculture sector on the way they do their business and the need for joined-up thinking in our Government, which needs to tell the agricultural sector to stop producing more cows and more food in the manner in which it has been?  Have they looked at a policy area that might help to do something about this problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Pierre-Marie Aubert" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018112100002#J00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question; she got straight to the point.  I will take the end of the question first, namely, the CAP.  We have to keep in mind that the agrifood sector in Europe is the first economic sector in terms of GDP creation.  I am not saying I am for or against it; it is a matter of fact.  In that context, another aspect has to be kept in mind.  According to the Directorate General for Trade, it is expected that 90% of the economic growth in the agrifood sector will come from exports to third countries.  One of the key options at the Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development is to make sure that Europe remains the top agrifood exporter in the world and that it increases its market share worldwide in terms of the products for which we are the best placed.  Irish production of dairy and meat is seen as a sector in which we have good competitive advantages.  I do not believe there is the political will to stop that.  On the contrary, we will say that we are able to produce dairy products and meat in Ireland that are climate efficient.  The best option will be to make sure that is the produce that is consumed worldwide rather than other products that would be less carbon efficient.  That is basically the narrative.</p> <p>  On the 1.5o Celsius in the IPCC report and any links, we talk constantly about the need to change the demand and so on.  I do not know the position in China, India or elsewhere but we have been working at a European level in different countries and it is clear that the way dairy consumption has evolved has been driven by the supply.  The fact that French people, and I guess it is the same in other countries, now consume 400 g of dairy products a day is partly the result of a deliberate strategy on the part of processors and farmers who saw that for the production to be sold on the market, they needed French people to eat more dairy products.  My point is that if we have been able to drive people towards more dairy produce consumption, we shall be able to drive them towards less dairy produce consumption.  Who will do that and on what basis?  We foresee some potential, which needs to be quantified, to reduce the overall consumption and production at EU level while keeping farmers' incomes constant if we go for quality, climate-friendly production.  For example, as the food share has declined to approximately 10% of the annual household budget, there is room for improvement.  It is possible to increase that to 15% or 18%.  </p> <p>  Furthermore, in some areas - I am talking about France - an organic farm of 300 ha in arable crops can have up to seven persons employed full-time whereas another family in the same area may employ only one person.  I am not saying that organic farming is necessarily better for the climate.  That will depend upon the specific practices that are implemented at farm level, and we have to be cautious not to equate organic farming with climate-friendly farming.  That is a very sensitive topic.</p></speech>

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, is also preparing a special report on climate change and land.  It will be released next August.  It is currently under expert and government review.  It includes aspects related to food systems, food and nutrition, including the mitigation potential of healthy diets.  There are multiple types of healthy diets with various environmental co-benefits, including for climate but also biodiversity preservation.  My remark on that is that it is deeply related not just to local and national aspects but to global trade.  There is a key issue in addressing climate policies within trade systems.</p></speech>

There is an issue that is worth clarifying.  All of us raised interesting questions.  I found the witnesses' presentations stimulating.  They were far too short, so we will have to do some reading outside this committee.  Agriculture production methods have been transformed and that has led us to where we are now, but Dr. Aubert asked who will give us the reverse transformation?</p><p>It is important to say it will be innovators, entrepreneurs and business people who will do it and lead.</p><p> I am particularly taken by one of the last points Dr. Aubert made about household budgets and food.  One of the figures given in a presentation indicates that we waste 30% of the food we produce, which is a horrifying statistic.  I am very taken by the suggestion that household domestic expenditure on the weekly food basket has been dropping.  I presume it is being replaced by spending on consumer items, including the plasma television screens or iPhones.  It would be a useful exercise for the committee to focus on that.  The suggestion is there is a price to be paid for the changes we must make and there is scope to pay the price if we change our consumption habits.  It is really important.</p><p> Our President was recently inaugurated.  I will not ask any political questions of the witnesses but I was very taken by a couple of the points that the President made in his inauguration speech.  He spoke about a generation younger than mine made up of "post-consumers".  They are not as absorbed by consumerism as my generation and the one immediately following mine has been.  They do not want plastic or disposable items.  They want food and products of integrity far more than my generation would have been used to.  They are demanding it and certainly pushing change.  He also spoke about intergenerational injustice.  While I champion and support these perspective, they also sound very western.  We want to deny emerging economies all the things we have taken for granted as consumers over decades just as they are growing.  Perhaps the three witnesses could comment on that.  Dr. Aubert mentioned four contrasting pathways and I am sure there is much detail in the paper.  Will he summarise those four contrasting pathways to the 1.5&deg; Celsius figure and give us a little more information on it?</p><p> We are quite deep into the debate at this committee, which arose from the Citizens' Assembly, to which the witnesses have referred.  The bulk of the early presentations was almost an attempt to convince us once again that climate change is happening.  I know we moved from global warming to the term "climate change" but is even more language needed to convey the importance of the matter and the potential catastrophe that awaits?  The witnesses are speaking with the converted here and my thinking is there was no need to reinforce the idea as to what happens if we hit the 1.5&deg; Celsius or 2&deg; Celsius increase; there clearly is such a need.  Even with the United States, the issue of climate change converges with economics and politics, leaving major challenges.  There are questions in those comments so will the witnesses respond to them?</p></speech>

That must be acknowledged but the incentives must be correct for those businesses, entrepreneurs and innovators to do their job.  This is a policy perspective.  There are policy options with the food budget issue that would allow people to dedicate a larger share of their budget for healthy and climate-friendly food.  Professor Masson-Delmotte will deal with chapter five of the special report, dealing with sustainable development and climate change.</p></speech>

There are examples of compulsory distribution of foods that might be wasted by supermarkets to charities, typically, and this works well in other contexts.  There are innovative approaches using applications.  For example, restaurants could make available food that would be wasted at a late hour in the evening, for example to students who cannot afford to buy a meal in a restaurant.  This is being explored in many places but regulation is an incentive for the deployment of these types of solutions.  Many of them come from the private sector.  There are many opportunities to avoid food poverty through dealing with food waste and possible reuse.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about post-consumers and the concept also emerged in our discussion this morning with younger persons involved in the ECO-UNESCO initiative.  There is potential for shifting from owning things to sharing things, which is an opportunity for social innovation.  This is facilitated by numerical transitions as well.</p></speech>

There is much potential for thinking differently about things.  This is also related to the assessment of life cycle emissions.  If one shares the use of something that causes emissions to be produced, the use of that product will be optimised.  Typically, this is exemplified with car sharing or other options.  There are many different ways of thinking about it.  The Deputy touched on the idea that this mode is only from rich countries but that is not the case.  It can act against marketing pressure as well as peer pressure.  There is an issue with looking at the grounds of consumerism with young people, which is related to mental well-being as well.  There are many different issues that go deep in the values of people and why consumerism is perceived to be contributing to a person's well-being.  This is partly explored in our last chapter, which is on sustainable development and which looks at different approaches in different contexts.  The Buen Vivir approach is grounded in South American cultures, building on local and indigenous knowledge, and it is interested in thinking of well-being upfront rather than in other dimensions of development.</p></speech>

One of the challenges facing us is how we make it possible for everybody to do their bit.  Those last few thoughts are very stimulating.

I was invited to do so by churches of different denominations.  This is a really important dimension.  There are three main parts and perhaps this would also help to frame the social discourse on climate change.</p> <p>  One concerns developing versus developed countries.  Some countries are already developed.  There is a limited budget and as some countries have not developed, is it fair they have a limited amount of emissions?  There are other related aspects, such as where there are rich and poor regions in the same country.  This relates to adaptation.  Persons in the West tend to emit more as they might travel more but they could possibly adapt more by moving elsewhere; poorer people would have more difficulties in adapting.  The last point about intergenerational injustice is really important.</p><p>Perhaps we should communicate more about the fact that, in some ways, it is a problem we are leaving to younger generations.  There is an association in Switzerland, Grandparents for the climate.  In terms of communications, perhaps these are areas where we do something.</p></speech>

There are four illustrative pathways with more details given in the summary for policy makers.  The only one that avoids large-scale deployment of bioenergy with capture and storage is the one with low demand - the sobriety pathway.  There is a sustainable pathway, a middle-of-the-road pathway and one with a larger degree of consumerism.  That is the one that relies on very large-scale bionenergy with capture and storage and implies an overshoot and return to 1.5o Celsius, with a risk of irreversible effects on ecosystems and people in the case of an overshoot.</p></speech>

I have to keep my questions short.  My first question is for Professor Masson-Delmotte.  She stated that pledges by Government made over the past three years are not enough to keep warming below 1.5o Celsius, even with ambitious and challenging efforts after 2030.  I think she said that they allow for an increase of 3o Celsius.  Could she confirm that?</p> <p>  My other question concerns reducing greenhouse gas emissions for transport and the haulage industry, particularly freight.  The haulage industry would argue that there is no alternative.  While we have talked a lot about agriculture today.  Obviously, transport and haulage are other major contributors.</p></speech>

That was the most challenging point for the approval process relating to the 1.5o Celsius report with government delegates.  That is one element of the context.</p> <p>  The Deputy's point concerns the potential for decarbonisation of transport.</p></speech>

There is a continuous decline.  What is challenging in the context of transport is full decarbonisation, which is why there are negative emissions in many pathways so there are options to take CO2 from the atmosphere and store it durably.  Some aspects of transport are very hard to decarbonise - not only maritime transport but airline transportation.  There are multiple options.  My view is that the pledges from the international aviation and maritime sectors are not on track with the well below 2o Celsius pathway.</p></speech>

In the context of sustainability and land use, this requires using land that might be used for growing food.  What is the science behind the benefits of it?  Does it stack up?  There are emissions from using biomass.</p> <p>  My other questions relate to agricultural waste.  We have a large agricultural sector in this country.  Does Dr. Aubert see a lot of potential in terms of using agricultural waste to generate biogas?  What are the best plants and trees for sequestration?  Do they include willow, miscanthus or sugar beet, which is grown in France but which is no longer grown in Ireland?</p></speech>

There is some potential to use waste to generate biogas.  We must keep in mind that in most cases, we cannot run a biodigester with waste only.  We also need residues from crops like straw or even maize silage, as is the case in Germany.  This must be quantified.  If not quantified, it was at least approached in the Teagasc report from 2013 so there should be some data.  Regarding the best plants or trees for sequestration, it depends on the paleoclimatic conditions of Ireland, which I do not really know.</p></speech>

In terms of technology, what would be the big game-changer?  What would be a major win-win in terms of a country such as Ireland that has significant carbon emissions?  We are producing about 60% more per head of population than the rest of the EU.  What are the two or three major things we need to do now?</p></speech>

I do not know if this applies to Ireland but one area we did not discuss is the shift from combustion engines to electric vehicles.  This is a big game-changer.  Under the most ambitious scenario, more electric vehicles would be sold in 2025 than combustion engines.  That would be a major game-changer.  There would be other benefits, such as less air pollution.</p></speech>

I have a few questions about the agricultural side of things.  I represent a rural constituency.  Regarding innovation in agriculture, the witnesses spoke about carbon neutrality over a number of years.  What innovations exist with regard to agriculture?  What innovations are out there to make agriculture carbon-neutral?  What is their take on the forced downsizing of agriculture compared to the displacement of agriculture or agricultural production to less carbon-efficient jurisdictions?  We could have carbon leakage whereby if there is a forced downsizing in agriculture in Ireland, which is quite carbon-efficient relative to other countries, that slack in food production could be taken up by other less carbon-efficient countries.</p> <p>  I do not believe there is any kind of technical short list or relatively technical solutions out there relating to accounting for the likes of gases differently under greenhouse emissions - the likes of methane given its short life cycle.  Will there be a different type of accounting of that in the future?  If a carbon tax was introduced, would it exacerbate the displacement of agriculture from relatively carbon-efficient jurisdictions to less carbon-efficient ones?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.76" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Pierre-Marie Aubert" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018112100002#M00100"><p>On the question of innovation, we have to think about how we envision the agriculture sector ten to 15 years down the line.  Are we talking about improving the existing sector or reshaping it?  If it is the former, then we have a series of technological improvements that, if not already available, will probably soon be available in terms of methanogenesis to reduce the enteric fermentation from ruminants, and in terms of changing feed structures to reduce enteric fermentation.  Those are two things that are about to be taken up on farms and they will lead to emissions reductions of 20% to 25% on average at farm level for the same herd.  This will not bring us to carbon neutrality, however.  Keeping the sector the same overall, even if we apply all the technologies we know, will not lead us to carbon neutrality or even sufficient reduction.  We have to think about reshaping the sector.  Innovations are not easy to discuss ahead of time.  I must admit that, as I do not know enough about the Irish sector, I cannot really make any pronouncements.  I am aware of a couple of things that can be done in respect of arable crops, but they are not ones that are grown here.  I have some difficulty in this regard.</p> <p>  The risk of carbon leakage is another, less-efficient aspect.  It all relates to the discussion we had regarding the real demand and the extent to which we create the demand that is needed for our economic development, speaking as European citizens.  Keeping in mind that 85% of dairy production in Ireland is exported, 70% of it to the European market and the rest to third countries, the strategy is to increase Ireland's market share in third countries such as India and China.  Frankly, I do not know anything about what a sustainable diet is there but for European people, we could easily cut our dairy consumption by a third or even by half without any consequences for our health.  Those are the nutrition recommendations of the European Food Safety Authority; they are not coming from NGOs or advocacy people.  On that topic, if the level of demand remains constant or even increases, which is what is foreseen by the international network of dairy production, then taxing countries that are the most efficient - Ireland is among the most efficient countries regarding dairy production - might lead to some displacement in other countries that are less efficient-----</p></speech>

How can people be made less demanding while remaining healthy and happy?  That is the key point.</p></speech>

My understanding is that they moved from the food system assessment of emissions - farm and supply chain - to having a clear strategy to reduce them.  It is also driven by the demand of their consumers.  It is about having both sides working together, so they are basically exemplary in a way.  The second point was about accounting for different gases.  There are different ways of aggregating gases that have a long lifetime in the atmosphere like CO2 and N2O and those that have shorter lifetime such as methane.  It depends on the time horizon.  The committee may be familiar with CO2 equivalence, where it is calculated over 100 years, but if we look at 1.5&deg; Celsius warming, which may happen in a few decades, it does not work.  That is why, for the 1.5&deg; Celsius report, we were very clear.  We have CO2 on one side.  Then we measure the other elements by their aggregated radiative forcing and we show that it is necessary to act on both; CO2 emissions to go to net zero and then a decrease of the radiative forcing of the others.  That gives flexibility.  It is hard to get out of N2O emissions due to the need for fertilisers for food production but there is strong potential for many aspects related to methane, including waste and other elements in addition to livestock.  Due to the fact that methane has a short lifetime in the atmosphere of about ten years, there is also potential for almost immediate benefits of acting strongly on methane.</p></speech>

Picking up on a point Deputy Neville made in respect of reshaping agriculture, we had officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine before the committee in the past week or so.  There is a research organisation within that Department whose projections are for carbon emissions to remain the same or to increase despite mitigation measures.  Is that being mirrored elsewhere?  It is very aspirational to say we will change dietary intake in society; it would take centuries, not decades.  Can the witnesses correct me on that?  Could they give examples of how societies have changed their dietary requirements?  How does that fit into dairy and meat consumption?  Is there any evidence of a transition to increased processed food consumption in certain societies where the poorer groups could be more reliant on food that is not fresh or that is processed?  A shorter supply chain is obviously healthier.  How does that fit into the societal context in terms of health?  We could flip dietary requirements and increase the cost of dairy and meat but that could have a deeper impact on poorer people in society.  I am interested in a policy sense in how we transition towards what is the right aspiration for the environment.  The Taoiseach is on record as saying we are behind relative to most of the other European countries.  Can the witnesses pick an example of smaller economies that are showing excellent leadership?  How can we innovate and be leaders in this area?</p></speech>

The changes in diets that are forced in most scenarios are the same order of magnitude as the changes we have experienced in the past 40 or 50 years in Europe.  We are not talking about a revolution in diet.  We are talking about gradual changes that are basically of the same order of magnitude as we have experienced.  For example, in meat and dairy consumption, at European level, the amount of dairy produce quickly increased from the 1960s to the 1990s and then stabilised a bit, although I do not have the figures to hand.  The same goes for meat.  For chicken meat, for example, the rise has been very quick and now it is stabilising, and it is the same for pork.  The kind of changes we have experienced are quite important.  We tend to minimise them as a way of suggesting that the changes scientists are talking about are impossible because they would take centuries.  No.  It can take 20 or 30 years.  It has already happened and is already happening.</p><p>For example, the rate of consumption of meat in France has been decreasing slowly over the past ten years.  That trend will probably continue.  Change is already taking place and we need to make that change visible and desirable.  To do so, we need to invest a bit more in public action and advertising.  That is on diet.</p><p> On reshaping the agricultural sector, I will not talk about the Irish case but I can talk about the French case.  We have a lot of ideas and proposals on the table and these are being discussed with the major farming unions.  These include reintroducing ligneous crops in rotation, lengthening rotation again and reconnecting the livestock and crop sectors.  Those things are being discussed now.  It means we must not only change practices at farm level but also reshape all food chains.  Reshaping food chains means reterritorialising them, which is to say that if one diversifies and lengthens crop rotation, one has to have a market for the farmer.  It means one has to have processors, buyers and so on in place.  These are people who are not there any more and that means having to think about getting people to hear about and buy the production from the farmer.  As to which countries have changed quickly and are leaders in that space, Switzerland is a really good example.  I am not kidding.  It has developed.  I am not an expert about Swiss agricultural policy but I have a call next week with key people there.  I understand Switzerland has moved strongly to shift policy towards climate-friendly and biodiversity-friendly agriculture in an amazing way.</p></speech>

It is striking that in New Zealand and among farming organisations in Australia there is currently a demand for action on climate change as farmers there are the ones facing the consequences of a changing climate.  It is striking when that demand comes from the professional organisations themselves and how much innovation can be available there.  Revenues can be increased for farmers by building on innovation and thinking beyond dairy and meat.</p></speech>

What I take from what has been said is that ownership of the problem is key.  We have a real problem in Ireland in that none of our farm organisations take ownership of the problem and our Department does not either.  How do we address that?  That is probably where I want to go.  I will quote a submission the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine made here to provide an example to our guests.  It states:</p><blockquote>Methane, which is [the] predominant emission from the agricultural sector at approximately 60%, has a 12-year cycle after which it breaks down.  The knowledge relating to that involves identifying that if this is the case in practice, provided that methane emissions do not go up, it does not have an additional global warming potential as a consequence.  That is why the primary focus of our interventions is on carbon dioxide, etc.</blockquote> <p>Can our guests comment on that and say whether it is reasonable?  Given that it comes from the Department with direct responsibility for dealing with this situation, it demonstrates the scale of the problem we face.  I ask our guests to talk a bit more about the French example and changing production.  Who is saying that?  Is it the relevant Ministry in France?  Is that who can start the conversation we need in Ireland?  Dr. Aubert referred to the requirement to provide ways to off-set residual emissions from other areas of the world which are more densely populated.  That is the responsibility of Irish agriculture.  Can he talk about that also?  It would be horrific for Irish farmers to have to think that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.86" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Pierre-Marie Aubert" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018112100002#N00400"><p>The question of ownership is a good way to link with what we are doing in France.  We have been teaming with the French Ministry of Agriculture and Food which is in charge of designing the agricultural part of France's low-carbon strategy.  The Ministry says the emissions are not very high because it is only a cut by 50% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  We have not calculated the amount of bioenergy that could be produced but it would be a lot.  We are nearly reaching carbon neutrality under this scenario for the sector.  That does not mean we can reach carbon neutrality for the whole national economy.  I will follow Professor Masson-Delmotte.  We are currently leading stakeholder groups made up of representatives of French farmers, major food-chain actors, NGOs, consumer organisations and the Ministries with responsibility for agriculture and the environment, respectively.  We have taken the broad scenario at national level and are exploring what it means concretely at the farm level and for food chain actors.  As Professor Masson-Delmotte said, those people were unwilling to engage in that process two years ago.  However, following the many extreme events they have had to face over the last two years, they are clearly aware that they have to move.  They are happy to find a seat in such a dialogue to express ideas, suggestions and propositions.  That is what I can say about the French example.  While I could go deeper into the technical details, I do not think that is the point of this discussion.</p></speech>

France is a large country and it is less densely populated than other European states.  The possibility exists in the natural world to offset the emissions of other countries.  This is not something that has been brought into the debate, but it will have to be.  I do not have clear ideas on it but while I am sure there will be some reluctance and resistance, it will have to be put on the table, at least to make choices and to be aware of what those choices mean.</p></speech>

That is very important for the idea of ownership and to create a bridge between practitioners' knowledge, which is broad, and academic knowledge.  There are multiple examples of this, albeit farming is a very good one.  It is the same for urban innovation.  One also needs people with practitioner knowledge within cities to work with people in the academic sector to think together about pathways to change the urban system.  It is very similar in a way.  One needs practical spaces for that work and transparency on the lessons learned from experimentation that can inspire others.</p></speech>

There is a huge potential to restore peatlands for the value of the services they provide like water management and recreational activities.  They can also work with sectors that find it hard to decarbonise, like the airline industry, and which work on carbon offset schemes which are often located on the other side of the world and are difficult to supervise.  There are opportunities to provide services to companies which need to store carbon, with strong monitoring so that it is verified.</p></speech>

It has direct and indirect effects.  It also acts on air quality.  Our 1.5o report shows clearly that, if we want to stabilise global warming, then one needs to act on CO2 because of its cumulative effect, and emissions of methane need to be reduced globally, typically by about 35% or more by 2050.</p></speech>

I have just a few observations.  I have asked this question before but I did not get a straight answer.  Dr. Aubert spoke about trees as carbon sinks.  I am interested in trees or plants that are most effective as carbon sinks.  In Ireland we have forests of conifers.  I do not believe they are as effective as carbon sinks.  Have any studies been done to promote more broadleaf trees or hedgerows, not just as carbon sinks but also for the attraction of wildlife for which broad leaf trees are more friendly?  Are we planting the wrong sorts of trees?</p> <p>  On the issue of cattle and livestock, farmers here would shudder at the idea that not only are the cows causing problems and are the second contributor to the problem but also that we might also have to consider our landbank to offset for other countries that are not as populated.  While we need to look outside of ourselves and see it globally, it would be quite scary for all of us in the State to have the double whammy of responsibility.</p> <p>  Is it an urban myth that if seaweed were to be mixed with the cattle feed it can reduce 99% of the-----</p></speech>

The next generation coming up is much more open to less meat and more vegetarianism, along with a significant increase in veganism.  This will have an impact, but currently nobody knows how much.  Perhaps studies need to go on with that.</p></speech>

I will address this on a general level and not specifically for Ireland or France.  It must be kept in mind that if a region goes for afforestation for the sake of increasing the carbon sink, it will be at the expense of agricultural land and of permanent grasslands.  Biodiversity issues are key.  At the moment, more than one quarter of all species and habitats that the European Union set out to conserve according to the 1992 habitats directive, are in direct or indirect relationships to permanent grasslands.  If a region chooses to afforest those grasslands for the sake of increasing the carbon sink, which may a very good idea, we must think of the kinds of biodiversity an area would lose because of that measure.  Thought must be given to the kind of afforestation that is to be done to limit the biodiversity loss that would be inevitably linked to this afforestation.</p> <p>  In that sense one might consider fast-growing species when planning afforestation for carbon sinks.  Those fast-growing species such as the Douglas fir species grow 30 m3 per ha per year of growth during the first years.  They are very good for carbon sink but are a nightmare for biodiversity.  I have another background in forestry before, and it is clear that at the moment we really lack experience and knowledge about what to do and how to do a biodiversity friendly large-scale afforestation scheme.  We need to invest in that area if we want to have afforestation and carbon sinks without harming too much biodiversity.  That is a key point.</p> <p>  With regard to the question on seaweed and methane, I do not have a clue.</p></speech>

It is exactly what we do.  We share the carbon budget between each administration and each ministry.  We see who is able to do what and then we bring everything together and see to what extent it is enough to reach our commitments.  If it is not enough, then there is interaction and we go back to each sector and say that we have to do more.  That is basically what we do.</p></speech>

In respect of the witnesses' interactions with other governments, academics and entities such as the European Commission, is there a sense that the next CAP will deal with agricultural production in a way that will allow farmers to reshape food chains, to use witnesses' term?  Will it also be dealt with in a way that will allow us, in any Irish context, lessen our dependency on intensive farming and move towards policies such as afforestation or horticulture?  Do the witnesses have a sense from the early workings on CAP that the European Commission is moving in a particular direction with climate change and agriculture?</p></speech>

What does that mean?  It means that under the new CAP, if the European Commission's proposal is approved, subsidies will be allocated on the basis of a strategic plan designed at the member state level but which will have to be approved by the European Commission.  All in all, there will be much responsibility in the hands of member states.  That is my first point.</p> <p>  My second point is to ask if it will be enough to go in the direction mentioned by Deputy Sherlock.  There are two safeguards in that regard.  One is that in the European Commission's proposal, there is the necessity that 40% of the subsidies allocated by a member state go for climate action, under either Pillar 1 or Pillar 2.  The second safeguard is that under Pillar 1, each member state will be asked to devise an eco scheme but the boundaries, the amount of money and the type of practices that could be awarded through this eco scheme are still a bit blurred and under discussion.</p> <p>  There are opportunities in this new delivery model.  We should not overlook that.  In the meantime, there are also huge risks.  Where member states are competing with each other in both the internal market and the export market, there is a risk of a type of race to the bottom in environmental and social requirements.  If it is up to the member states to devise and design the criteria for subsidy eligibility, then there is a temptation to lower the environmental and social requirements to minimise production costs to be more competitive both in the internal market and the export market.  We do not know exactly what will be the European Commission's position and its capacity to make sure that member states, in their strategic plan, will raise environmental and social ambitions rather than lowering them.</p></speech>

I understand what he is saying about the member states&rsquo; application or implementation of those schemes.  I would have thought, however, perhaps naively, that the European Commission is realistic now about the challenges member states are facing in respect of climate change.  The European Commission, as an entity in and of itself, notwithstanding any critiques I might have of it on other issues, has no other choice now but to make sure there is a proofing mechanism to ensure there is not, as Dr. Aubert put it, a race to the bottom.</p></speech>

For most people working there, this new delivery model was seen as the only way forward, given the political situation in Europe and the demand expressed by many member states.  It was also seen as a way to make sure environmental measures will be adapted to specific contexts that are very different across Europe.  The Commission is very willing to move forward with climate ambitions.  It is keen on that.  It remains to be seen, however, how it will be able to negotiate, concretely, the content of the strategic plans.</p></speech>

Yesterday, a senior agricultural representative was trying to convince me that methane is not a problem.  That cannot be said tomorrow.  That has to stop now, today, and never be suggested again.  The second big issue is at the centre of our debate.  It is claimed that Irish agriculture is saving the world.  We are exporting infant formula instead of breast milk to China.  We are also exporting meat to China.  The consumption of meat in China has increased greatly over five or ten years, never mind 40.  We are saying that we in Ireland do not have to reduce our emissions in this area.</p><p>We are more carbon efficient per kilogramme of that beef than the Brazilians or the Argentinians.  I wish to clarify something Dr. Aubert said.  From the IPCC perspective, is that argument not credible, particularly following the recent report?</p></speech>

I would not say it is not at all credible, but it is an argument which must be handled with much attention.  It is true that we need to ensure that products that are needed somewhere are produced in the most efficient way.  I do not know anything about Brazilian, Chinese or Indian diets and, therefore, I do not have anything to say about that, but we can assume that it might be the case that those people will need to consume more dairy products for whatever reason.  In the time between when they increase the level of carbon efficiency of their dairy production and now, it might be useful to export dairy from Ireland, but this must be temporary.  If it is only a way for the Irish farmers to increase their market share on the world market, that is not credible.  It depends on the pathways of the exports and role of Irish production.  It is not an absolute term.  It is a relative term regarding where we are now and where we want to go.</p></speech>

Global solutions need to be found.  If there was some type of CO2 tax, the meat that is produced at the same time, which leads to higher CO2 emissions, would be more expensive and, therefore, it could be one way to solve the issue.  As always, it is an interconnected problem.  I do not know if it is realistic to have a global CO2 tax.</p></speech>

It seems promising because it is a CO2 tax where money is given back to the population.  Some type of transfer mechanism is needed to encourage production which does not lead to high CO2 emissions.</p></speech>

There is no point in bringing wood from Canada or Russia just because they are areas where wood will come from, given the transportation costs in terms of money and CO2, and given the biodiversity impacts of harvesting forests in Russia or Canada.  We have the same problem in France.  We have just transformed a former coal power plant into a wood power plant.  We do not have enough wood in France to supply that power plant and, therefore, we are importing wood from Canada, but it does not make any sense.  The question is how to lower the demand for energy.</p> <p>  On biomass, there is potential for biogas production in Ireland to avoid relying on wood imported from all over the world.</p></speech>

The IPCC has good wording where it considers predictions to be "likely", "less likely", "more likely", "very likely" and so on.  For a country like Ireland, where there is a target of an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050, everything the witnesses are saying suggests that it must be a 100% decarbonisation.  What is the likelihood of us facing that reality in a regulatory political assessment before 2030?  If we set out on a less ambitious path for 2030 and, halfway there, the international rules and the political environment in Europe and elsewhere change, what is the percentage of probability that would happen?  Assuming at some stage we will have a higher target within the international mechanisms to which we are a party, what is the advice for us?</p></speech>

We spoke about the notion of justice and fairness, or the fair share of the load and effort.  One must also consider that developed countries have more cumulative emissions than other countries.  In aiming for net zero, there might be a need for developed countries to act earlier than emerging economies or the least developed countries, which also have a right to develop.  These are all elements to consider and, in any case, reducing carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 is not on track with the target of 1.5&deg;C.</p></speech>

There are also scenarios where the carbon capture is in storage, which is a more technologically advanced development we do not have at the moment.  This matter is under discussion in Switzerland, where a company is working on carbon capture although it does not yet do the storage part.  When we talk about the responsibility of developed countries, we must also bear in mind the responsibility to work on solutions.  One possibility is carbon capture and storage while another is more renewable energies, which we did not speak about much, such as wind energy and so on.  We should also consider research and development to find new solutions.</p></speech>

As Deputy Eamon Ryan suggested, the 80% goal for 2050 is already challenging.  Most of the 1,000 scientists who reviewed the 1.5&deg;C report, although not all of them, include carbon capture and storage because it is so challenging.  Without it, it might in some cases be a matter of reaching 1.5&deg; or 2&deg;C.  It is not, therefore, one or the other.  One cannot gamble on it or guarantee that it will work.  It is a question of research and development, and we cannot be sure it will work.  It is worth making the effort to try to see if a solution can be found.</p></speech>

It is a risk associated with, for example, negative effects of ambitious mitigation for specific sectors and people.  There is the risk of stranded assets in the economic world.  As the report shows, we are at a crossroads in dealing with these risks and it is important that we examine them and identify the risks, in respect of which we understand the consequences, and those that are uncertain.  For me, large-scale use of bioenergy, with capture and storage, is uncertain.</p></speech>

For me, the risk lies in Ireland not taking action, which is what we have been doing for the past few years.  We import most of our oil and gas energy supplies.  We also import most of our food.  We export a huge amount of beef and dairy products.  In the past few years,this small country has intensified the production of beef and dairy products in the face of the report.  We have not been taking notice or action.  Professor Aubert spoke about proposed changes in the food chain.  As I said, we are importing most of our food and not taking opportunities to change.  On renewable energy, we have been told that we have opportunities in terms of the use of the oceans and seas around us, but we are not taking them.  The big risk for us lies in non-compliance, which will hit us in the face in the imposition of fines.  Ireland faces a dilemma.</p> <p>  Will the delegates point to examples of best practice that we should consider in the context of large-scale housing retrofit?  Transport has not been mentioned much.  Again, Ireland is a disgrace in the provision of public transport.  Will the delegates also point to examples of best practice in active travel such as walking and cycling, in food choices and peatlands re-wetting and restoration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.166" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Val&eacute;rie Masson-Delmotte" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018112100002#R01000"><p>On housing retrofit, of particular importance is the availability of almost zero interest loans, in respect of which which people can be reimbursed when they get the benefits of investments in energy efficiency.  There are multiple examples of such actions.  It works best when it is done at community level and administrative procedures are as simple as possible.  It fails when people have to go through multiple entry points to avail of the supports available from local government.  Simplicity is important.  Initiatives must be targeted at the most vulnerable people, in particular those facing energy poverty.  For example, in the city of Grenoble people have been appointed to certain jobs to work on the bills of others and help them to understand how they can reduce them and the other things they can do.  There are differences between owning and renting housing.  It is important to target the two approaches.  Based on the experience in France, what is really important is that there is a system in place to control the quality of the work done, with people being paid once there is proof that a particular level of avoided energy usage has been reached.  Practice shows that even with goodwill, the implementation of retrofitting can be of poor quality, if not done well.  Having in place a system whereby payment is based on quality of service puts pressure on those who implement the retrofitting and may help to ensure the savings expected are achieved.  France is late in its commitment in that regard also.</p> <p>  On transport, I recently examined an interesting piece on the life cycle of various types of vehicle.  The weight of vehicles for private transportation is key.  Electrified transport and super heavy cars do not work well when one examines the life cycle emissions from production to dismantlement.  As I said, the weight of the vehicle is very important.  The added value of electric vehicles depends on the way the batteries and the vehicle are produced.  If it is using coal, it is different from other options.  Also, it depends on the carbon content of the electricity used when using the car.  It is important to remember that while electric vehicles produce zero emissions during use, they still produce emissions over their life cycle.  The best option in travelling distances of 10 km or less as is the case for many people on a daily basis is to use bicycles, including electric bicycles.  This requires public investment in secure transportation pathways, in respect of which Switzerland is leading the way, together with other countries.</p></speech>

This points to the question of whether organic agriculture is compatible with a carbon free diet, which I do not believe it is, because for organic agriculture, one needs to have bovine ruminants, for many reasons.  To develop this scenario, we took all of the recommendations for diets from researchers and NGOs and national and international agencies.  On this basis, we built a typical diet which would be in line with European habits, at least in the way in which they have evolved in the past 40 to 50 years.  As I mentioned previously to other members, the diet we proposed, for which we implemented a scenario for the calculation, is not that different from the current diet, although it cuts by half the amount of consumption of animal products.  There is also an increase of more than 50% in the consumption of fruit and vegetables for the sake of intake of fibre and vitamins, as well as a slight decrease in total calorie and protein intake, with the replacement of animal protein by additional proteins.</p><p> All in all, as I said, the order of magnitude of the changes we foresee in this scenario is totally compatible with what we have experienced in the past 45 to 50 years.  As has been said, from a health point of view, there are millions of diets that are compatible with nutritional recommendations expressed in terms of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates.  The way in which the nutritional recommendations are translated into an actual diet based on concrete elements and agriculture production depends on cultural habits and the type of environmental target one wants to reach.  For example, because ours is an organic scenario, red meat remains quite important by comparison with other scenarios.  We need the animals to maintain grasslands and for fertility transfer.  </p><p> A scenario has just been published by Dr. Marco Springmann and other colleagues in the EAT consortium and the Resilience Alliance.  The diet proposed is much more radical in the sense that the amount of animal protein is down to 20% of total protein intake.  In our scenario it is at 40%, while in the current situation, it is 65% or 66%.  The total calorie intake decreases a bit more than in our scenario.  However, it is much more compatible with carbon neutrality than ours.</p></speech>

I want to go back to the question of renewable energy.  We have not discussed it much today.  Obviously, agriculture is a big issue in Ireland.  A big element of the 1.5&deg; Celsius scenario is the electrification of energy use.  Moreover, electricity production should be carbon-neutral.  That is an essential element.  As has been said, there is a lot of potential for development in that regard.  It is also an area we pursue quite a bit in Switzerland.  The use of solar panels may be a possibility, but I do not know if there is enough sunshine in Ireland.  Germany produces a lot of solar energy.  It is a good example of a country that produces quite a lot of energy from renewable resources.</p> <p>  There is a point we did not discuss at all.  I know that it is relevant in Switzerland, but I do not know if it is relevant in Ireland.  I refer to finance.  Investment is a big issue, that is, whether there is investment in fossil fuel companies.  As Professor Masson-Delmotte said, at some point there might be stranded assets.  There are also systemic issues.  A whole economy is dependent on CO2.  The whole system must be changed.  In Switzerland there is a lot of thought about this aspect.</p></speech>

It is important to make invisible greenhouse gas emissions visible to consumers.  There are tools to visualise the nutritional profile of food products.

The petition concerns the official Dublin Christmas tree lighting ceremony, which is not going ahead.  The petitioner states that there has been no crowd trouble in the past and he does not anticipate any in future.  I note that when the committee was in private session committee members expressed some views on the matter.  I will open the floor to Senator Buttimer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1391" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018112100002#B00300"><p>Thank you for allowing us to speak on this, Chairman.  We will keep the petition open and go back to the petitioner.  The decision of Dublin City Council not to have an official Christmas lights ceremony in the capital city is unprecedented.  I was in Cork last Sunday when we had 20,000 people at an event.  It was well-managed, policed and stewarded.  There were no issues of public health or safety.  Everyone moved freely.  There was good access to and egress from the event.</p> <p>  I know that Dublin will have Christmas lights, but is Dublin City Council really telling us that it cannot manage a crowd of people coming to the capital city?  The council can manage throngs of people on St. Patrick's Day for the capital parade.  Is the council saying that people going to the Aviva Stadium or Croke Park cannot be managed?  It is a disappointing decision.  I think the council is having a laugh, to be honest, at the expense of people.  I know there are lights but I would hope that Dublin City Council, through our intervention, will change tack.</p> <p>  The petitioner has made a clear point in the petition.  I call on the committee to write back and engage with Dublin City Council.  There are numerous locations where the council could hold an official switching-on ceremony.  I am not from Dublin &ndash; I accept that &ndash; but having come from Cork last weekend where there was a wonderful atmosphere on a cold night I take the view there is no reason we cannot do the same in Dublin.</p></speech>

I am a rural Deputy but I know people from rural areas who come to the city for the switching-on of the lights.  The switching-on of Christmas lights, wherever it happens throughout the country, is a major occasion especially for the younger people.  They love it and are excited by it.</p> <p>  What happened to problem-solving?  The reply from the council states that the closure of the Luas cross-city service would have to take place if the lights were to be switched on at the usual venue.  Why not move the venue?  There are several venues around the area where the council could move the switching-on of the lights.  We should praise Mr. O'Callaghan for bringing this to our attention.  I hope there will be a change of heart.  It is even a big event on television and gets considerable coverage.  Let us hope there will be a change of heart.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1301" speakername="Brendan  Ryan" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018112100002#B00500"><p>It is worth making public the text of the petition.  The petitioner highlighted how the Christmas lights ceremony has been a long-held tradition in Dublin city and how it is loved by many.  He pointed out that there has been no crowd trouble in the past and said he saw no reason to envisage any trouble at this ceremony in future.  He also said the ceremony has become a part of Christmas for many people and it should stay that way for future generations.</p> <p>  The response of the council is along the lines that there has been trouble managing large crowds attending lighting ceremonies.  As Senator Buttimer has said, that is nonsense.  Reference was made to the need to disrupt the Luas.  That would be relevant if there were only one possible location in the great city of Dublin.  I reckon it is not beyond Dublin City Council to come up with an alternative location.  The petitioner deserves better than the response from the council.  I think someone was asked to tick a box in responding to the committee, and that is unfortunate.  There has been no serious consideration of the matter.  We should write back and let the council know the strong views of the committee.</p></speech>

The Dublin team has had four homecoming events in a row in Smithfield, a cobblestoned area, where the council has held the celebration of Dublin coming home with the Sam Maguire cup.  We have had the Dublin Pride parade in Smithfield.  It is a wonderful space and it could be used.</p> <p>  Like Deputy Ryan, I think the response of Dublin City Council has been lame.  There is a tradition in almost every town and village in our country of an official switching-on.  Are we really saying that Dublin City Council, which is responsible for the capital city, cannot manage the turning on of a Christmas tree event?  Deputy Ryan made the point that there are several locations that could be used.  We should respond to Dublin City Council and encourage the council to use the space in Smithfield.  The square there has successfully held the Pride event and the Dublin GAA homecoming event.  Surely there can be engagement with those who operate the Luas line on co-operation.  I think Dublin City Council is having a laugh and being a little Scrooge-like.</p><p>I hope those responsible in the council will rethink.  Perhaps we might invite them to explain the rationale also.</p></speech>

It requires a little imaginative thinking in the transportation department of the city council and liaising with Luas in holding a major event.  There have been many changes in the co-ordination of public transport services.  As a result, the number of lanes open for cars throughout the city has been reduced.  It is not only a city event.  It also involves people from neighbouring counties, including mine, who enjoy it.  As I said, it requires a little imaginative thinking.  As one moves from O'Connell Street by the GPO, it is clear lanes have been removed because of the Luas.  The same applies at the traditional cross-section. </p> <p>  Deputy Brendan Ryan pointed to the language used by the petitioner in referring to long-held traditions within the city, many of which are eroding.  O'Connell Street was a traditional venue, but we have seen the closure of Clerys.  The long-held tradition of viewing its Christmas window is no more.  We can go to the commercialised Grafton Street where those involved obviously no longer believes in Christmas because stores such as Brown Thomas simply have fancy dress mannequins in the window.  Anyone would be forgiven for not knowing what season it is.  It could be Easter for all we know.  Obviously, the commercialisation of a Christian festival has been removed from the window.  I would hate to see the State authorities participating by taking away any joy from the Christmas festivities.</p></speech>

We should keep Mr. Darryl O'Callaghan's petition open.  I am getting a direction to the effect that we should correspond with Dublin City Council.  I suggest we say to it that we do not accept the correspondence it has furnished to the committee.  It states in it that the traditional location for the Christmas lights switching-on ceremony was on O'Connell Street.  It seems it does not want to inconvenience people by asking the operator of the Luas cross-city line to stop operating it in order to accommodate the ceremony.  Moreover, it seems there have been issues in managing the large crowds which have attended the lighting ceremony in recent years.  The council has also stated it has created winter lights in Dublin city and brought Christmas lights and building projections to more locations and people than ever before.  I think we all accept that the council is trying to do its best.  Let us suppose I was a first, second, third or fourth generation Dubliner and going to see the switching on of the lights.  It is a real family event, something that is synonymous with Dublin at Christmas time.  It is firmly the view of the committee that some mechanism should be found to facilitate the process.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to have a discussion first with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, on governance and child safeguarding policies in Scouting Ireland.  Our second session will be a discussion with representatives of Scouting Ireland on the same topic.  I would like to advise the members of the committee that while there have been reports in the media, it is important to note that the committee cannot discuss individual cases and members should avoid naming names and individuals, whether those names are in the public domain or not.  It is also important that we do not discuss anything which is likely to be the subject of court proceedings.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  She is accompanied by her officials, Ms Clare McNamara, principal officer in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Ms Michelle Shannon, director and assistant Secretary General in the Department.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses to please turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode because they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the proceedings of the meeting.  Television coverage and Internet streaming might also be affected adversely.  I advise witnesses any submission or opening statement made to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  After the presentation, there will be questions from members.  I now call on the Minister, Deputy Zappone, to give her opening statement.  </p></speech>

Deputies and Senators will be aware that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  Youth clubs and services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the national youth strategy as part of a cross-sectoral, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  Scouting Ireland is one such service which provides a non-formal educational experience that is firmly rooted in the experiential educational mode.  It is one of Ireland's largest youth movements, with more than 50,000 members.</p> <p>  Scouting Ireland is funded by my Department through the youth service grant scheme and the allocation for 2018 was &euro;876,336.  Scouting Ireland groups around the country also are eligible to apply for grants under the local youth club grant scheme.  In March or April 2018, I became aware that there were deficits in the governance arrangements in Scouting Ireland.  I had concerns about how a serious alleged incident was handled in addition to other matters, including safeguarding and Garda vetting.  All publicly funded organisations are required to meet strong governance standards and as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have a duty of care regarding the public funding provided by my Department.  In light of my concerns, I decided to withhold any further drawdown of funding to Scouting Ireland until such time as I could be satisfied that the organisation&rsquo;s governance standards were up to the required level.</p> <p>  When I became aware of the extent of the concerns, some of which had been aired in the media, I wrote to Scouting Ireland on Friday, 13 April advising it of my intention to withhold further funding to the organisation.  I also requested an urgent meeting with the board of Scouting Ireland.  The purpose of the meeting was to provide Scouting Ireland with an opportunity to clarify the revelations highlighted in the media coverage which raised serious questions for the organisation.  I subsequently met with Scouting Ireland on 19 April.  It confirmed its commitment to implement the recommendations on safeguarding and Garda vetting and to carry out a full review of historic cases.  Scouting Ireland also informed me of its proposals to put new structures in place.  </p> <p>  In light of that carrying out of the full review of historical cases, I received information late last evening.  It was stated verbally that the following is the case.  Mr. Ian Elliott has been examining the historical evidence.  He has found evidence of 71 alleged abusers and 108 alleged victims.  This is based on his work to date and the numbers may change.  Most of the cases occurred between the 1960s and the 1980s but there may be one from an earlier period.   None of the alleged abusers is still working with Scouting Ireland.  Reports have been made to Tusla and the garda&iacute; in respect of all of the alleged abusers still living.  </p> <p>  As I think the committee is aware, Mr. Elliott had also been engaged by Scouting Ireland to conduct a review of its child safeguarding, protection policies and procedures.  An interim report was produced in October 2017 and a final report was produced in January 2018, and both of these reports were subsequently submitted to my Department in March 2018.  In 2017, Scouting Ireland commissioned Mr. Elliott to carry out a case review into the organisation&rsquo;s handling of an allegation of a serious sexual assault on an adult volunteer by another adult volunteer.  While this alleged assault took place in 2009, it was only reported within the organisation in 2016.  Following on from Mr. Elliott's report of his review, Scouting Ireland engaged an independent barrister to conduct a full investigation into this allegation.  In particular the investigation would examine the handling of the matter by four senior volunteers, three of whom were on the board of Scouting Ireland at the time of Mr Elliott&rsquo;s report.  I expect to receive both reports once the independent barrister's investigation is completed.</p> <p>  In May, I appointed Ms Jillian van Turnhout, as an independent expert, to examine the governance and related issues within Scouting Ireland.  Ms van Turnhout submitted her final report to me on 14 June.  It contained a number of recommendations in the areas of safeguarding, management of the organisation, governance proposals and charities regulation.  The report suggested that the restoration of funding to Scouting Ireland should be clearly linked to the successful implementation of these recommendations.  The board of Scouting Ireland subsequently confirmed its decision to fully implement all the recommendations contained in the review of the Scouting Ireland report.  On this basis, I decided on 25 June to provide Scouting Ireland with interim funding for a further three month period, up until the end of September of this year.</p> <p>  In providing this interim funding, I requested that Scouting Ireland provide me with a further report by 24 September detailing progress in the implementation of the outstanding recommendations contained in the van Turnhout review of Scouting Ireland.  This report was subsequently submitted to me on 24 September for consideration.  At the end of September the then board of Scouting Ireland voted to reinstate the Chief Scout as chair of their forthcoming emergency general meeting.  This was done notwithstanding the fact that the Chief Scout is a respondent in the ongoing independent barrister&rsquo;s investigation.  I felt that this was unacceptable.  Shortly afterwards, I received letters from the then interim chair and Mr. Ian Elliott setting out their serious concerns about the board's actions and its ability to properly govern the organisation.  Having discussed the matter with the interim chair and Mr. Elliott, I decided to suspend funding for as long as the then board was in place.</p> <p>  Scouting Ireland held an emergency general meeting on 6 October 2018.  At the meeting, all the new governance proposals were passed by over 95% of those in attendance.  A new ten member board was elected following a skills assessment process and they took up their new role as of midnight on 6 October with the former board resigning from that time.  I have met with Ms Annette Byrne, who was acting chairperson during this change process and also with the CEO.  I was pleased to learn of the organisation&rsquo;s commitment to change and good governance.  A new interim chairperson, Ms Aisling Kelly, has now been appointed along with new board members at the emergency general meeting.  I look forward to having a constructive working relationship with the new team and the realisation of Scouting Ireland&rsquo;s ambitions for the young people it works with.</p> <p>  To date, I am satisfied with the significant progress made by Scouting Ireland regarding implementation of the van Turnhout recommendations and in the essential governance changes committed to by the organisation.</p><p>For that reason I have restored funding to Scouting Ireland until the end of April 2019.  I have requested a further progress report from the organisation by the end of March 2019 as well as copies of the independent barrister's report and the final report by Ian Elliott of the individual case review he conducted.  I will review the funding arrangement again at that stage.</p></speech>

It is important that we would have oversight of the report given its importance to the organisation in the context of the various goings on over the past 12 months.

She referred to information that came to her last night.  That is probably the most shocking part of her entire presentation this morning.  It is probably too soon to ask where the Department sits in relation to funding.  I will be asking Scouting Ireland later whether any of the 71 alleged abusers are currently in the network or were when Mr. Elliott was carrying out his review.  Based on that, what is the position with funding?  It all goes back to governance, standards and transparency.  I supported the Minister when she suspended the funding last September.  She did the right thing.  What is the situation now with Scouting Ireland in terms of support from the Department?</p></speech>

Based on the verbal information I have received, my understanding is that none of the alleged abusers is still working with Scouting Ireland.</p> <p>  As Deputy Rabbitte is aware from what I said in the presentation, one of the reports Mr. Elliott was asked to do by the organisation on safeguarding and Garda vetting recommended that a historical analysis of cases would be carried out and that is currently under way.  The information I provided to the committee this morning comes out of the process of doing a piece of work the organisation asked Mr. Elliott to do.  My understanding is that the work is not yet completed.  I am in the process of continuing to review whether to fully restore funding to the organisation.  The information I received yesterday and the additional information that will be available on completion of the report will be integral to the assessment of the restoration of funding.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.216" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018112100002#E01100"><p>I welcome the Minister here today.  She has given us some very devastating news based on what she heard late last night.  We heard that there are 71 alleged abusers historically and 108 survivors that we know about.  It is pertinent for us to empathise with the fact that there are potentially more than 108 people out there who are potentially traumatised by their experiences.  When Mr. Elliott came before us on 9 May he gave an undertaking that he would look at the historical cases pre-2003 and the review has come up with that devastating news.</p> <p>  In light of this news very late last night I want to get an understanding of the Minister's interaction with the new board in terms of how she and the Department will deal with it.  Is it the case that all bets are now off regarding future funding until such time as the situation is clarified and rectified?  Notwithstanding what I have said, I should add a proviso to the effect that 99.9% of those involved in Scouting Ireland are honest, decent volunteers who are doing an excellent job and will be devastated by the news.  They  will be traumatised by this as well and they will want the funding to continue.  How do we find a mechanism to ensure that scouting continues and that the new board, which we wish well and which has been given a clean slate, can operate and that we find a mechanism to deal with the historical issues and also ensure that scouting can continue safely and without any cloud hanging over it?  The Minister's human response will perhaps give some solace to people who are honest and decent and who constitute the vast majority of scouters, their parents and friends.  We need to hear from her on how it is intended to deal with the issue.</p></speech>

He is correct that it is devastating.  As Minister, I find it extremely distressing to have received the information I have at present.  I have been assured that none of the alleged abusers is currently still working with Scouting Ireland.  I have also been told that reports have been made to Tusla and to the Garda in respect of the alleged abusers who are still living.  I will be listening carefully to the Scouting Ireland testimony that the committee will receive this morning.  I will engage with the Chair as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  I will examine where we are right now in terms of the funding decisions that I have already made.  I also acknowledge the extraordinary work that does go on within the organisation, which I have seen at first hand throughout the country.  I want to assure people that I will continue to support that work and the work involved in supporting the children and young people and also the volunteers given how important that is.  At the same time, we have been given this information and also other information.  I am waiting still for a couple of outstanding reports.  My officials and I are working closely with Scouting Ireland.  We are monitoring the situation and trying to understand it and looking for the best way to proceed in this regard.  The funding has not been fully restored in the same way that it has been before, so this is happening in the context of that decision.</p></speech>

I want to get clarity in my own mind that the Minister is satisfied that those files have now been sent to the Garda.  Given that the Minister only received the information late last night I would like to know what has occurred, procedurally, in the less than 12 hours or so since she has been in receipt of the information.  I am sure we will have an opportunity to speak to the board in respect of its handling of the issue but I wish to get the Minister's perspective.</p><p>I have been assured by both the CEO of Scouting Ireland and Mr. Ian Elliott that those files have been sent to Tusla and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

When Mr. Elliott spoke to the Minister last night, did he outline a procedure to put in place a protocol for the victims?  Is action on funding the only punitive measure the Department wishes to consider to deal with this revelation?</p> <p>  As the Minister said there are 50,000 members of Scouting Ireland.  Is just withdrawing funds the totality of what the Department?  Are there other ways of putting a stop to this behaviour because the Department only got the information last night?  While the withdrawal of funding is important and is evidence of the serious concern of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, would it not stop the implementation of the suggestions made by Ms Jillian van Turnhout?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018112100002#F00700"><p>I think the Senator has asked very helpful questions.  People may come forward who need support and my understanding is that there are policies and procedures and supports for victims who come forward in the organisation.  It is important to take a look at that again and to review it.</p> <p>  As the Senator is aware, we have been very focused on the governance of the organisation.  I asked Ms van Turnhout to examine Scouting Ireland and make recommendations.  The recommendations have been strongly made.  The board has put in place an implementation plan.  One of the key aspects of the recommendations is the resignation of the last board and the appointment of a new board based on the skills and competencies of board members and the 95% agreement of the whole organisation to follow through on the implementation of those recommendations with new leadership in the context of governance.  Those actions come as a result of the work of my Department to ensure that we are moving forward into a different area.  It is a very difficult time for the organisation.  There are a lot of things that need to be done.  There are more ways in which they will need to respond in light of the information I have just shared.  I will be discussing these issues with the chief executive and the board as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.228" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018112100002#F00800"><p>As the members have expressed, we are clearly shocked.  The Minister has expressed her shock.  Does the Minister have confidence in the organisation?  Admittedly these allegations date from the 1960s-1980s, and the committee has no evidence of other incidents with the exception of the 2006 case, which is under review, and was subject to a <i>nolle prosequi </i>by the DPP.</p><p>Does the Minister have confidence in the organisation, having learned from this experience?  There have been governance changes - the board and Chairman have changed - but, further to Senator Freeman's query, is funding the only means by which the Minister can make the organisation sit up and provide information in a timely manner to the authorities, not just to Tusla and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but to the Department, as primary funders of the organisation?</p><p>I do not want to diminish the significance of the figures the Minister has given to us.  Is any of the alleged perpetrators or victims deceased?  We have been told by the Minister that none is currently in the organisation.  Is the State aware of the names of these individuals?  In the case of the alleged perpetrators, is this the first instance in which any complaint has been made about them?  Are the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Tusla aware of the names of the individuals?  I appreciate that the Minister has only been made aware of this in the past 12 hours or so.  Are the alleged perpetrators of crimes in the 1960s-1980s still active in any organisation with children or young people?  I think these pertinent questions should be given an airing.</p></speech>

As I said, I find it deeply distressing.  I am also aware of the fact that some of the alleged victims could be listening to what we are discussing right now.  I am deeply upset about that as  I cannot imagine what they must be going through.  I hope that the actions that my Department and I are taking and the actions of my colleagues are in the best interest of the organisation.  We are doing everything we can to ensure ultimately there will be opportunities for them to go through a different process of healing.  I hope for some of them that healing has already taken place but we are so aware of the fact that an integral aspect of that process is an acknowledgement.  </p> <p>  As I said I have information of alleged victims.  It is important that we are able to have this knowledge now and that the knowledge is interrogated and investigated.  As I have said already, I too will be listening carefully to what the evidence provides and we will continue that conversation with the organisation to follow it up.</p> <p>  It is important to say in this context of people wondering whether children are safe in Scouting Ireland that I have been assured by the former interim chairperson, Ms Annette Byrne and also Mr. Ian Elliott, who is the child safeguarding expert, that the vast majority of volunteers involved in Scouting Ireland do an excellent job.</p><p>I assure Deputies, Senators and parents that all the actions I have taken were a response to bad governance and were in no way connected to the fantastic work being carried out by scout groups, leaders and volunteers throughout the country.  I have been assured they are committed to and compliant with the highest possible level of safeguarding standards. </p><p> The Chairman and Senator Freeman asked if funding was the only measure.  I have outlined the other actions and measures we are taking to ensure the organisation is supported to move beyond this period.  We have a new board as a result of the report of the independent reviewer who made recommendations which the organisation followed.  The board is in place to take the next steps needed to ensure the safety and proper responses to information coming forward now about the organisation.  </p></speech>

I looked over her statement last night and thought it was very positive and then we were hit with a bombshell today.  There is very little we can discuss about it.  How soon does the Minister hope to meet the board to discuss this sad and distressing news?  I was going to ask the Minister questions about it but I do not know if it is appropriate to do so now.  According to Scouting Ireland, Mr. Ian Elliot indicated the organisation was under-resourced with regard to safeguarding.  Does the Minister think we may have to consider increased funding?  How many of the recommendations from Ms van Turnhout's report have been implemented?  Is there a timeframe for implementation of all the recommendations?</p></speech>

On the funding issue, it needs to be considered.  That is what I will say right now.  One of the areas that I am particularly concerned about in light of the revelations is that the organisation is supported or resourced enough to provide support to alleged victims.  On the question about how many of the recommendations have been implemented, we have 13 recommendations from the report and all are in the process of implementation.</p></speech>

Like every other member of the committee, I am aghast at what has come out.  It is important to note there were procedures, reviews and examinations to identify this information.  I will try to phrase this as well as I can.  I welcome that the information has been found and that it is coming out.  I do not welcome that it happened.  It is important we continue with our examinations to extract the truth and that we get the likes of this out in the open.  We should deal with it through Government channels and also put measures into practice to ensure we mitigate against this kind of behaviour and that it is identified extremely quickly if it happens in the future.  The Utopian view is that it should never happen.  We have to put all necessary procedures in place to ensure it does not.  I will be waiting to hear the update from our next witnesses.  I thank the Minister for her contribution and for answering questions.  I will not repeat questions that have been asked already.</p></speech>

I am making that assumption and I could be wrong.  I would like to be corrected or educated on whether that is the case.

I had the opportunity to speak with members of the organisation before coming into the committee room.  They are fully aware of the implications of this.

I am thinking of other revelations of child sex abuse in the past.  When figures of 71 alleged perpetrators and 108 victims are presented, it is clear that multiple children were subjected to abuse by the same individual.  Has the Minister been presented with any evidence thus far of that sort of concentration?  Is one individual responsible for multiple alleged incidents?  Did the information presented to the Minister last night allude to any location or locations in which these incidents allegedly took place?  Would it be pertinent at this point to put that into the public domain?</p></speech>

That has happened.</p></speech>

When I was travelling to the Oireachtas yesterday morning I got a phone call.  It was an unknown number and I just managed to answer it.  It is important to put on the record what was said.  A gentleman who was one of the 108 called me.  I was a bit taken aback.  He proceeded to tell me about the trauma of his life for the last several years.  On the flip side, he also told me about the intervention he has received in the last several months because his was one of the files that was investigated.  He wanted to say that he was eternally grateful for the opportunity to benefit from the counselling and support he has received.  He believes it has been a game-changer for his life.  It is important to mention the support for the victims of abuse that is coming to light.  The Minister is right.  People are watching and listening to us this morning.  It is important to say that this man is totally grateful for the support he has experienced.  He asked me not to identify him, but to put on the record that he is grateful for the support he has received from the people he has engaged with within Scouting Ireland.</p></speech>

I brought this up before the meeting started this morning.  I too have been contacted by somebody who is very grateful, not necessarily to counsellors, but to the staff of Scouting Ireland.  Obviously some mechanism is now in place that is allowing the staff to handle these queries and to handle the victims.</p></speech>

I wish to note two things.  One is that it is really good to hear the Senator bearing witness to the testimony that she has heard in the context of what we are doing this morning.  This also indicates the importance of the work the committee does.  The fact that its members are public representatives and able to receive that information really helps this process to move forward.  I want to acknowledge that.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I welcome Ms Aisling Kelly, interim chairperson and non-executive director of Scouting Ireland; Dr. John Lawlor, chief executive officer of Scouting Ireland; Ms Lisa Barnes, non-executive director of Scouting Ireland; Mr. Adrian Tennant, non-executive director of Scouting Ireland; and Mr. Ian Elliot, independent safeguarding consultant.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I ask witnesses to switch off their mobile telephones or put them on flight mode, as they interfere with the sound system, make it difficult for reporters to report our meeting and adversely affect our television coverage.  I advise witnesses that any submission or opening statement they have provided to the committee will be published to the committee website after this meeting.  After their presentation I imagine there will be a significant number of questions for witnesses. </p></speech>

I have been an adult scout volunteer for 23 years.  Previously I was a youth member of Girl Guiding from the age of 9.</p> <p>  I am accompanied by Mr. Adrian Tennant, director of Scouting Ireland, Ms Lisa Barnes, director of Scouting Ireland, who resides in Northern Ireland, Dr. John Lawlor, CEO of Scouting Ireland and Mr. Ian Elliott, an independent safeguarding consultant, who has been working with us as the interim safeguarding manager. </p> <p>  I want to tell members about the progress Scouting Ireland has made since the last time the organisation appeared before the committee on 9 May 2018 and I also want to outline the challenges we face.  When we last appeared before this committee, an apology was offered for the hurt that has been caused as a result of poor practice on the part of those involved in scouting.  Some of this occurred many years ago but the effects are still causing distress today.  I want to reiterate that apology and add to it our sincere regret for what has happened, and our absolute determination to learn from those mistakes and make Scouting Ireland today as safe an environment as we can create for all of our members.  To that end, we have made many positive changes in our structure and our approach to governance.  </p> <p>  The committee will recall that previously Mr. Martin Burbridge was present in his capacity as the head of the governance review group, which was the group responsible for designing and recommending governance changes within Scouting Ireland.  At that time, the company, Scouting Ireland Services CLG, and the unincorporated association, Scouting Ireland, were run as one entity.  The company's board and the association's national management committee were populated by the same people.  There was no non-executive board which one would expect to find in a company of this size.  The executive and non-executive were enmeshed.   </p> <p>  I am very happy to report that this is no longer the case.  The company and the association, on 6 October 2018, voted overwhelmingly, nearly 99%, in favour of radical governance change.  This was a monumental decision for the organisation, heavily debated and examined by the membership in minute detail.  Our youth members were instrumental on that day and I am delighted to say that it reflects how informed our organisation is by its youth-led ethos.  This decision was taken against the backdrop of the highly sensitive safeguarding investigation being carried out by independent barrister, Ms Lorna Lynch.  However, despite requiring the high threshold of a 75% majority, the membership at the EGM on 6 October 2018 showed great determination in voting for a new future for Scouting Ireland.  It will be a new era of openness, integrity, transparency and, most important, accountability.  </p> <p>  The unincorporated association is in the process of being wound down and we have instructed solicitors in this regard.  The assets and liabilities of that entity will be transferred to the company.  Residual accounts which are held there will also be transferred to the company.  There will be no renewal of membership in that association from January 2019.  The membership of Scouting Ireland now resides in the company in the form of the individual scout groups.  The governance documents which reflect the relationship between the scout groups and the company are clear in what each entity expects of each other.   </p> <p>  I am glad to inform the committee that, since 6 October 2018, the new board has been extremely busy.  It took office earlier than originally envisaged under the governance review group proposals but has hit the ground running.  It has met 15 times in seven weeks, averaging two meetings a week, one by teleconference and one face-to-face.  The ten members of this board, three of whom are present today, are dedicated and committed to steering the company into a new era of transparency and one where safeguarding of children and adults is our number one priority.  Scouting Ireland commits to making the organisation a safe environment for all of our members.   </p> <p>  As recommended in the Jillian van Turnhout report, safeguarding is now a standing item on our agenda.  The board has had the benefit of two detailed briefings from Mr. Ian Elliott in relation to the current and historic situations which we now face into.  It is apparent from the ongoing review of past practice being carried out by Mr. Elliott at the behest of the board that there is evidence of past abuse emerging from the former organisations that merged to form Scouting Ireland some 16 years ago.  Unfortunately, this is the situation, as with so many other organisations in this country's history, but Scouting Ireland is working hard to establish the full extent of the knowledge that exists in relation to that abuse.  That is a process which takes time and space in order to gather an accurate picture.  No adult volunteer wants to hear that of their organisation which forms more than a hobby for them, but rather a way of life.  Personally, as a mother of two very young children, this fills me with deep sadness. </p> <p>  I want to say categorically that Scouting Ireland is committed to providing support and help to all victims of past abuse within Scouting Ireland and is looking to include this in our policy framework.  The committee should be assured that this new board of oversight will meet this situation with integrity, compassion and dedication.   </p> <p>  It has been highlighted by Mr. Ian Elliott that Scouting Ireland is under-resourced with regard to safeguarding. The board has some work to do on scoping out what the these new resources will look like, how key people will be needed with new skills.  This work is not just critically important, it is highly specialist and expert.  I would ask all members of this committee to have regard for what Scouting Ireland is trying to achieve in ensuring a comprehensive and compassionate response to those who were so badly wronged in the past.  We look forward to a discussion with the Minister in the future about how these resources can be sustainably funded.  </p> <p>  As an indicator of how much of a priority this is for the new board, I can inform the committee that just this week we have advertised for a safeguarding manager in the national and international press.  The recruitment of an experienced and independently minded individual is a key priority for the new board.  Indeed, when we last appeared before this committee, we reported that we were in the process of implementing the recommendations of Mr. Ian Elliott in ensuring that the safeguarding team is made up of professional members of staff.  I am happy to report that we are working hard to achieve this.  </p> <p>  In addition to ensuring that safeguarding is resourced and supported within the organisation, the new board has made another priority in the enactment of new policies relating to dispute resolution and disciplinary procedures.  These policies have been externally reviewed by a specialist employment lawyer and we are happy to report that the board was in a position to ratify and adopt them at our meeting on Sunday, 18 November 2018.  The roll-out of these policies will ensure that Scouting Ireland develops a culture of consequence.  The position of the adult volunteer must always be that he or she serves as a volunteer for the furtherance of the development of young people.  Positions of responsibility over young people, and fellow adults, are a privilege, not a right.  We, after all, are adults who agree, by thought, word and deed, to be a positive influence to young people.  </p> <p>  Scouting Ireland welcomes the ongoing discussions with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  As the committee is aware we met with the Secretary General and members of his staff on 24 October 2018.  We had a detailed and constructive meeting, where I and Dr. Lawlor and two others briefed the Secretary General as to the governance changes within the organisation.  The officials in the Department with whom we have been working are supportive and encouraging and we greatly appreciate the Department walking the walk with us this past year.  Scouting Ireland welcomes the restoration of funding from the Minister as announced on 30 October 2018 and sincerely thanks the Minister in that regard.   </p> <p>  We are an organisation which welcomes oversight.  There has been concrete progress on implementing the recommendations of Jillian van Turnhout and I am glad to be able to report that substantial progress has been made on these recommendations and reported to the Department to its satisfaction.   We are also in the process of ongoing engagement with the Charities Regulatory Authority and our next meeting is on 10 December 2018.  We welcome the publication of the new governance code for charities which was published on 7 November 2018 and are committed to full compliance with this code.  </p> <p>  Lastly, we value your interest and oversight as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  We hope that some of our younger members watching this on TV look at each of you as role models and understand the important responsibility you have in being prepared to hold organisations and individuals to high standards.  It is a significant role which allows us the opportunity for self-examination and reflection.  We welcome all support and constructive feedback.  The new board genuinely thanks the committee members in this regard.</p></speech>

When I came before the committee on 9 May, I made reference to the fact that I was concerned about the situation that I believed existed in relation to the past practice of the scouting organisations which now form part of Scouting Ireland.  On this occasion, it is important I share with the committee the knowledge that I have at this point.  Although it is dark, I emphasise that this is the information that I have at this time.  There is knowledge of 71 alleged sex offenders and 108 alleged victims.</p> <p>  It is important for the committee to understand that this information has come from a number of sources.  It has not been simply acquired through a reading of the documentation that exists within the organisation.  Obviously, there is information there that has contributed to that, but it has also come from two other important sources.  One source is personal memory and recollection of individuals within the organisation who have shared with me concerns and knowledge stemming from many years back which has not been properly bottomed out.  Also, importantly, it has been derived from victims, people who have come forward, spoken to us and shared with us what their experience has been.  That is happening in increasing numbers.  There are an increasing number of people who are coming forward and talking directly to us.  The reason they say they are doing so is that they have confidence in the process and confidence that they will be listened to, believed and helped.</p> <p>  The figure of 108 victims is an important one.  I want members to think of that, not in numerical terms but in human terms.  That is 108 people who have suffered and are suffering today as a result of being exposed to situations to which they should never have been exposed.  It is important for me to confirm to the committee that the new board of Scouting Ireland has impressed on me its absolute commitment to responding to those individuals with compassion and concern and to helping them in every way that it possibly can.  That is what we are seeking to do.</p> <p>  I do not believe the figures I am sharing with the committee at this time will be the final figures.  I believe the numbers will increase.</p> <p>  I will provide a significant detail that the committee needs to be aware of because a question was asked when the Minister spoke with regard to how many of the individuals of whom we are aware had multiple victims.  There are 14 such individuals.</p> <p>  The committee is also concerned to ensure that the reporting requirements in relation to all of those individuals have been met. I can assure members that that is the case.  The majority of the alleged offenders are deceased.  Those who are alive have been reported to the appropriate authorities in the jurisdiction in which they are located because Scouting Ireland is an all-island body and they are not all located within the Republic.  Some are in Northern Ireland and some are overseas.  We do not know at this time what all those, among this group of individuals, who are alive today are currently doing.  What we know is that they are not in scouting.  We have reported to the appropriate authorities who they are but we do not track those individuals as we do not have that capacity.</p> <p>  Senator Freeman asked what protocol applies in relation to victims who are coming forward.  Since the new board came into being on 7 October last, considerable progress has been made from my perspective in handling and dealing with the difficult issues that arise from this matter.  I proposed to the new board that it adopt a victims' policy for Scouting Ireland which simply sets out the board's commitment to victims, the responses that should be made and how those should be monitored.  The board has agreed to do that and is in the process of adopting that policy.  I believe it will shortly become part of the policy framework.  That is a considerable step forward and I compliment the board on that.</p> <p>  There is an issue about the resources that are required to ensure that every victim who comes forward and speaks to us is responded to in an appropriate way.  The work is not only time-consuming but also emotionally demanding.  Experience and skill are required to do it effectively.  I have shared with the board and also the CEO, Dr. Lawlor, my concern with regard to the capacity of the organisation to respond.  However, I have absolutely no doubt that the commitment is there.  As the committee will possibly be aware, I have a fair amount of experience of working with organisations that have a difficult and bad history in this area.  One meets with a variety of approaches but what the new board of Scouting Ireland is doing is stating that it is owning this problem, not denying it, and that it wants to accept that it has happened, deal with that reality and reach out to those who have been hurt and harmed in a compassionate and effective way.  I have been offered all the support the board can provide in order to do that.  That is an important message to take to the committee.</p></speech>

I am sure the new board, the staff of the organisation and the volunteers have a difficult and challenging time ahead.</p> <p>  We were told by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, that she was advised last night about the 71 perpetrators and 108 victims.  Did Mr. Elliott have that information before last night?</p> <p>  Ms Kelly stated that Scouting Ireland has created a policy to help anybody who telephones or gets in contact with the organisation.</p><p>Will our guests talk me through that?  Policy is one thing but I want to know what happens on a day-to-day basis.  Are people informing Scouting Ireland about what happened to them and how they are doing?</p><p> Capacity is another issue.  The figures related to the terrible experiences of some members of Scouting Ireland have been revealed today.  These revelations will probably encourage other victims to make contact.  What capacity does the organisation have to contain or handle that?</p></speech>

I emphasise that I am conscious of the fact that when I last came before the committee and spoke about this issue, I did so in terms that may have conveyed to members that I thought this was a serious situation.  It is not until one has the evidence that the situation becomes real.  I can give the numbers to members but I need them to think of the human cost that is involved.  Very significant human suffering has taken place and has been part of the history of those who have been involved in scouting.  I know that is an unpleasant message and that many people will be very shocked.  The way to deal with it, however, is to own up to it and face it, not to deny it.  That is important.  </p></speech>

Our capacity is limited, which is a concern to me and one about which I have spoken to the board and others.  It is limited not just by the issue of dealing with the past but also the issue of making sure that what is happening currently is dealt with in an effective and efficient way.</p> <p>  Ms Kelly made the committee aware of the fact that we have placed an advertisement for a safeguarding manager, and that is an excellent start.  I hope that advertisement will be successful and I also hope other advertisements, which we will require for case officers to strengthen the safeguarding resources that are available to us at this time, will be successful.</p></speech>

Scouting Ireland is being contacted by people daily.  How are his staff handling that and are they receiving support, given that this must be distressing for them?</p></speech>

A point was made about numbers.  Each number is an individual who has suffered terribly.  That also has an impact on our staff who live it on a daily basis.  Our staff are very good people and very human in their response.  I was heartened to hear the two testimonies offered in the previous session in regard to the actions of staff when working with victims.  That has been my experience of our staff working with victims and, more recently, when they had the benefit of the professional guidance provided by Mr. Elliott.</p> <p>  There is no gainsaying that we have been badly stretched.  A number of our staff have built up experience and received training as designated persons and in counselling services.  We have redeployed front-line staff to do this work and plug the gaps.  We have also engaged professional external counselling support.  The service is stretched now.  Over the past five months, our staff have been within days of receiving notice of being laid off, yet they continued to do a professional job, particularly in this important area.  Their commitment is undeniable and they will continue to show that commitment.  However, we desperately need to put additional resources into this area.</p> <p>  The Senator is right.  I believe the information placed before the committee today was correct.  It was important that we did that today.  The move will encourage more victims to come forward, which is healthy.  It is terrible that people have carried this burden without being able to reveal it for so many years.  The Senator knows from her own work how that adds to a person's pain.  We will work with people and find the resources to do so.  We look forward to engaging with the Minister and her officials to see if they can help us in this matter. </p></speech>

I provide reflective supervision to each member of staff.  That is an absolute guarantee.  If I feel they are being overwhelmed by what they are being exposed to, I will withdraw them from that work.  Our staff are very dedicated and committed people who have a history in scouting.  It is a great source of distress to them that this has happened.  They want to address the issue but, at the same time, I have a responsibility to keep them healthy.  I must make sure they do not overstretch themselves because if they were to do that, they would not be effective in terms of working with the victim.  Staff must have the capacity and emotional strength to do this work, and not everybody has that.  Many people cannot do this work.  We must have an ability to respond and we have that ability.</p> <p>  The victims' policy, which I believe will be adopted shortly, is a great step forward.  It is a statement by the organisation that we are committed to this work and which sets out what we will do and how we will do it.  It is a value statement and incredibly important.  I praise and compliment the organisation on this policy.  In addition, others who have been hurt in the past will take great strength from the fact that it is now the policy of the organisation.</p></speech>

In the conduct of the cold case review Mr. Elliot has carried out in recent months, one of my colleagues has suggested the total number of cases may be 500.  I remember that figure being mentioned so I will use it again.  What percentage of the files has Mr. Elliot gone through?  I presume he has read them all.  How many files were found to require the intervention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in how many cases was it considered appropriate to close the file?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.283" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Elliott" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018112100002#L01400"><p>These are all closed cases; they are not current.  The majority of the individuals referred to as alleged perpetrators are deceased.  I cannot stress enough the variable quality of the information that exists.  In some cases, one has handwritten notes of a very limited nature.  It is only through taking on further investigation that one gets an idea of what is being referred to.  One of the issues that has come to light is the discovery of a very serious perpetrator on whom we did not have a file.  It was a case that was discovered as a consequence of a victim coming forward and saying what had happened.  We were not aware, within the organisation, that the individual in question was a perpetrator.  A simple review of the paperwork is only part of the story.</p><p>I have already spoken to the board about the work that has to take place.  The approach that I would like to follow - I would like to have the time to do it as well - is to formally interview a number of people who have memories and experience of those times and formally gather information from them, and add to that the victims' stories to put together a comprehensive knowledge of what took place.  We know it is bad practice.  We know there were situations that should have been responded to and were not responded to in a proper way, and although the perpetrators may be dead, the victims most certainly are not.  Not all of the perpetrators are alive.</p><p> I do not believe that figure of 108 is a final figure.  When we explore that further, the figure will probably rise quite considerably, and possibly as a consequence of what we have today, it will rise further.</p></speech>

In the short time that we have had the benefit of Mr. Elliott with the organisation, one can see that there is a dramatic response by victims to that because they see that there is someone there and a team in place that have the appropriate training to deal with this.  We are stressing to the committee that it is expertise that we need because it will allow victims to come forward.</p></speech>

I assume that either Mr. Elliott or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been in contact with all of the living victims of child sex abuse.  Ms Kelly mentioned the requirement of the organisation to have professionals to handle this so that, as Mr. Elliott outlined, the victims coming forward have confidence in the process due to his presence, because of his reputation and the fact that this matter is in the public domain.  The additional supports that are required within the organisation must be addressed by the Minister.  Indeed, the Minister has referred to seeking a meeting with Ms Kelly in short order.  I would imagine, from an organisational perspective, that Dr. Lawlor will be aware of the numbers of staff we are talking about because it is clearly not only one individual.  Given the size of the organisation, I do not imagine that would be sufficient.  Would Dr. Lawlor like to put some meat on the bones of the particular requirement that Scouting Ireland may have in the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.287" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John Lawlor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018112100002#M00400"><p>There has been some scoping of what a dramatically enhanced safeguarding capability within Scouting Ireland would look like and it is a quantum difference.  Mr. Elliott has been helpful on its elements.  It will require an experienced safeguarding manager with a track record in the sector and suitable qualifications.  It will require professional case officers with experience of safeguarding, investigation and support of victims.  It will require significant additional administrative support.  It will require the engagement of sessional officers to deal with cases - these would be external professionals we would engage on a case basis.  I might ask Mr. Elliott to comment on that.  It is a substantial commitment in terms of the salary expenditure that would be involved.</p></speech>

The sessional officers would be by engagement.  Of course, we must be mindful where we are using contracted support that it is in the context of observing the confidentiality of this kind of work.  That would apply even down to administration.  In trying to alleviate some of the pressure on us in the administration area, we might engage contract administration staff but we cannot do that in the safeguarding area, and would have to do that in-house.</p> <p>  Mr. Elliott might comment further on the structure I have outlined.  The committee will know from those sort of numbers that it requires a fairly substantial investment for the organisation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.290" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Elliott" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018112100002#M00700"><p>As Dr. Lawlor outlined, we are talking about a substantial amount of resources being channelled towards safeguarding.  I believe that there is the commitment now.  As Ms Kelly referred to, I have given two detailed briefings to the new board over the past month.  I have gone through all of this work in great detail with them.  The first time I met them, I remarked to them that I did not trust them, which is probably not a good way to start off.  I did it because my experience of previously working with individuals within Scouting Ireland has not always been easy and straightforward.  I said: "I will learn to trust you when I see your actions give me cause to trust you."  They were quite taken aback but I have to say that over the course of the six weeks or so that they have been in place, on behalf of those people who have been hurt as a consequence of having contact with scouting I have been greatly impressed, reassured and encouraged.  I now feel that we are in a very different place going forward.</p> <p>  One cannot view the victims as being a homogenous group.  Victims are adults and they have a right to their privacy.  They may not want to have any contact with Scouting Ireland or anything to do with us, or they may want to have simply very limited contact.  I have been contacted by victims, individuals who were in very senior positions in scouting, who simply wanted to have a conversation with me so that they could be apologised to and also so that they could be reassured that what happened to them mattered to scouting today and that there was concern for their situation; that was really important to them.  They were reassured by that and they did not want any further contact.  That was it.  That is not an uncommon reaction.  In other cases, it is very different.  One is meeting individuals who have been very seriously impacted as a consequence of what happened to them and who are still dealing with the trauma they suffered when they were abused at ten or 11 years of age.  In many respects, one is responding to and meeting a ten or 11 year old boy who happens to be a middle-aged man with serious life difficulties.  That is the human cost that one must always take into account.</p> <p>  The point is Scouting Ireland is a brilliant youth organisation doing a wonderful job but it has a responsibility to every young person with whom it comes into contact that it treats him or her fairly, with respect and ensures his or her safety at all times.  I believe and have confidence in the new board and in the chair, and in the CEO, Dr. Lawlor, that now there is that total commitment to ensure that happens.</p> <p>  Today is, in a sense, a starting off.  We are not hiding anything from the committee.  This is what we know and as we know more, we will share that with the committee.  We are not trying to deny anything.  This is exactly what the situation is.  We want it known so that we can address it and also encourage others who we do not know to come forward and talk to us so that we have a full, in-depth understanding and knowledge of what has taken place in the past.</p></speech>

At that point, there was much that we did not know.</p><p>Mr. Elliot had said at that stage that records were &quot;kept securely in fireproof filing cabinets in Larch Hill&quot; and the Garda and Tusla had been informed about that.  We are a number of months on in the process and we have a picture of the number of alleged abusers.  We may not have been presented with a finite number but we understand that it is an iterative ongoing process and that the number of victims may increase as well.  As he said, there are no files on one or more alleged perpetrators.  <br/><br/>I am satisfied as to the openness of Scouting Ireland's engagement with us today in ensuring that there is confidence on the part of Members present but, most important, on the part of the  ordinary decent people who give of their time every day to the organisation and those who fund the organisation, namely the taxpayers.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the devastating numbers of people who are survivors or victims, some of whom are deceased, we cannot even imagine on a human level what the survivors are going through at present.  It is unconscionable.  We have to have some confidence in the fact that the organisation is now, to use its own phrase, &quot;taking ownership&quot; of the issue and that they are putting in place a victims policy.  That certainly gives me some confidence.<br/><br/>Is Scouting Ireland making a financial contingency on its books for a number of cases where the DPP decides that there is a <i>nolle prosequi</i>with some cases because of insufficient evidence?  I do not want to presume the outcome here but, for example, there was a recognition in the Cloyne diocesan investigation where certain cases came before the court with the same <i>modus operandi</i>that on the balance of probabilities etc. that there was enough proof, notwithstanding the lack of proof in the book of evidence, and that there should be some form of compensation.  Is the new board discussing those issues?  I do not expect the board to say that it is but I want this issue on the agenda to get some sense from the organisation that it is dealing with that issue.</p></speech>

We have had a full briefing from Dr. Lawlor, the financial officer, in on that.  The second part of the question is whether we have considered ring-fencing a reserve for a general compensation fund without the need for a victim to go through a litigation process.  That is something that we will have to explore - I do not want sound like a broken record - but finances are an issue for us.</p></speech>

Ms Kelly's intervention deals with three thematic areas: safeguarding; accountability and disciplinary policy.  As a member of this committee, I wish the new board well.  The mood music has changed on ensuring that there is a new transparency in how matters are dealt with.  The new board has received a strong mandate from the individual members of the scouting organisation.  When it comes to a new disciplinary policy, am I correct that the organisation has engaged an employment lawyer who has externally reviewed the policies, and that it has adopted new procedures since 18 November?</p></speech>

That is the in-house panel, which deals with disciplinary matters.  I do not know whether that answer the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

There are outstanding issues that I want to deal with.  There is, for instance, a complaint against an individual who is now the subject of a disciplinary procedure because he was critical of a senior officer within the organisation.  There are allegations against the complainant by a senior officer of the organisation, who has stated in a letter that the complainant has actively supported criticism of him and of his performance of his duties and has called for his resignation.  The person who called for the resignation of the senior person is now being brought in front of Scouting Ireland under page 11 of the disputes and adults policy, etc.  When we are members of organisations and put our heads out there, it is likely that people will criticise us.  There is a fine line between criticism and something that is actionable or subject to a disciplinary procedure.  Has the new board examined whether the four live complaints will proceed?  Have they the support of the board?</p></speech>

As a non-executive board, we are also the board of final oversight.  We must have confidence in the disputes panel, to which we have devolved responsibility for this matter, to carry out the procedures.  If there is a requirement then for an appeal or subsequent attention, we would come to any issues completely untainted from knowledge of them.  My opinion and that of the board is that must have confidence in our disputes panel to deal with these matters.</p><p> The second leg of the question related to whether the board was aware of criticism.  What I can say in commenting generally is that I welcome criticism.  It is something that is to be supported and encouraged.  It is not that the organisation does not regard the criticism of the board or staff members as something to shy away from.  There is a line beyond which, however, appropriate criticism becomes perhaps inappropriate criticism, and that is a line to which all organisations should have regard.</p></speech>

It is something that Ms Kelly, as chairperson, should have cognisance of in respect of the nature of the complaints.  That is all I am saying.  I am keen to keep this in a positive vein.</p> <p>  Again, I thank the representatives of Scouting Ireland for coming before the committee.  We have a clear sense and understanding now of where Scouting Ireland is going, and that is important.  I wish to ask about the advertising of the safeguarding manager position.  Ms Kelly said the safeguarding manager was advertised in the national and international press.  When was that exactly?</p></speech>

I have sat back and watched this for the past few months, no more than the witnesses have.  Indeed, it has been going on almost a year at this stage.  I will surmise what happened and then get into the questions.</p> <p>  My belief is that the lid not only came off but was blown off Scouting Ireland.  The governance needed dramatic change and cultural change.  Interpersonal difficulties came to the fore as well.  A legal quagmire came about.  What was at risk at all times was the main purpose and ethos of Scouting Ireland and the 50,000 personnel and young children who were part of Scouting Ireland.  At all times they were caught in a stormy sea through no fault of their own.  They were at sea in stormy conditions.  That is why it is important to acknowledge the great work of the volunteers and parents who continued to send their children to Scouting Ireland throughout this entire process.  It is important to acknowledge the great work of the paid staff who stuck with Scouting Ireland through the uncertainty from quarter to quarter over whether funding was going to come.  They have to be acknowledged.  For much of this time they were left in a stormy sea with little information.</p> <p>  At all times I have taken the view that Scouting Ireland was taking three steps forward and then seven steps back.  We must talk about this in the context of last September or October.  To be honest, I was disgusted about the process that unfolded last September and October.  At the time we had an Oireachtas committee meeting at which it was clear that guidelines and a process were being set in place.  However, I cannot understand the train of thought that could allow a situation in which, one week before an annual general meeting, all of this could unravel and put at stake the paid staff jobs and put at risk the parents who continued to support Scouting Ireland and children who continued to attend.  As far as I was concerned, we were facing into the abyss at that stage, from which there was no coming back, in the knowledge, because we are well informed, that Ian Elliot had received the guts of 500 files from Larch Hill and in the knowledge of what was unfolding there.  I believed it was very important that Scouting Ireland be kept together for all the reasons set out by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, this morning.</p> <p>  I am glad to see the report from Ms Kelly this morning.  It is most welcome.  I am warmed by what Ian Elliot has said in support of the board.  I am disappointed that it has taken months to have a safeguarding position advertised.  While the matter was in the capable hands of Ian Elliot, it would have been important to have the position advertised to show that we were taking it seriously and that we were prepared to move forward and to stop having an interim arrangement.  In any event, it is good to see that the post has been advertised.  How long did we leave the position vacant?  How long did we not have a full-time person covering that role?  I do not want to hear about "interim" or the post being "under the role of the chief executive".  When was the last time Scouting Ireland had a safeguarding officer in place?</p> <p>  After all my surmising, much of this comes back to Mr. Elliot.  I am confused at this stage because the Minister harked on about one point but we did not get into it enough because of what she said.  I am referring to the independent barrister.  How many times has the board of Scouting Ireland met that independent barrister?  Why was that independent barrister assigned from the first day?  We do not have any updated information on what is going on there.  What was the role of the independent barrister?  I am wondering about it and something out there is not sitting right with me because I do not have a report or review from that particular person.</p> <p>  How many cases have gone before the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, in the past ten years?  We are talking about between 60 and 80 cases and it seems to be back there the whole time.  I am talking about here and now.  In the past ten years, how many cases have gone before the DPP relating to Scouting Ireland?</p> <p>  The optics around all of this are very important because the optics indicate what we want to show in the future.  I realise we have only got to the 1980s with Scouting Ireland files, but I want to know whether all the files before 1980 have been assessed.  Is Scouting Ireland still going through some of these?  As far as I am concerned, we have a further 30 years of files to go through and the 540-odd files that Mr. Elliot would have seen on the first day.  Mr. Elliot said that persons are becoming more forthcoming with information but we did not have files on them at all.  I want to hear the Scouting Ireland take on it.  Today is 21 November.  Where are we at with the whole review?</p> <p>  As far as I am concerned, this has blown wide open.  We know what is going on with Tusla on child protection.  We know about mandatory reporting.  Where are we going to get the skill set to support the board?  Unless every board member is trained in social care, counselling and everything else, we will not get the skill set to do this work.  Will Scouting Ireland keep it all in-house to ensure the work is done to its ability?  I am sorry.  I realise I have asked many questions.</p></speech>

First, I acknowledge the thanks of Deputy Rabbitte in respect of the thousands of volunteers.  More than 14,500 adult volunteers give their time every day.  That number is in excess of the number of garda&iacute; in the country.  My husband thinks that I have taken on a second job because, after we put the children to bed, I sit down in the evening and work for four hours a night on this.  We have to acknowledge that there are thousands of people doing very good work.  The staff in Larch Hill have been exemplary in their dedication to Scouting Ireland.</p> <p>  I will address the comments relating to the independent barrister's report.  I share Deputy Rabbitte's concerns about the response time for the report.</p><p>However, this is an independent process and the minute we start putting deadlines on it, we will then have a question mark with regard to whether or not due process is followed.  It is something we are following up with regard to instructing solicitors and it is a concern of mine.  I can see Deputy Sherlock shaking his head.  Perhaps he has a follow-up question.</p></speech>

There are some questions I cannot answer because I simply do not have the information.  Deputy Rabbitte asked about the independent barrister's report.  Obviously, this is not really a matter on which I can comment but the Deputy asked a specific question about how often I met her.  I met her once.</p></speech>

There is really nothing else I can say beyond saying that I met her on one occasion.  With regard to skill sets, I share the Deputy's concern about where these will come from.  Would we keep them all in-house?  We are committed to providing a service and we work in partnership with a variety of different voluntary organisations and groups.  If those skill sets are available to us from elsewhere and we are unable to get them in-house, we will be open to that conversation and to trying to bring those people in.  The concern for us is making sure those people who need a service are provided with that service.  I know from experience that this is quite specialised work and is not readily available in the marketplace, but it is important work.  We will explore all possibilities available to us.  If it means establishing a partnership with another provider, we will do that.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to be able to confirm that again to the Deputy.  If I did not feel that this was in place, I probably would not be here.  It has not always been present with regard to the experiences I have had in working with Scouting Ireland.  I have had good experiences and experiences that were not very good.  I made it clear to the board when I first met it that I needed to be convinced that it was going to do the right thing at the right time for the right reasons.  Although we have only known each other for a short time and I have only worked with it for a short time, I have been greatly impressed by its commitment, openness and willingness to accept criticism and what I am saying.  These are not easy lessons to learn.  These are all people who have very positive experiences of scouting so they think Scouting Ireland is a wonderful organisation, which it is, but they also think that this sort of experience does not happen to young people who come to scouting.  I am saying that it does happen, has happened and to more than one person, and that Scouting Ireland should accept responsibility for that problem, own and deal with it and get it out there so we can move on from it.  I have confidence that Scouting Ireland is doing that.</p></speech>

What I can say and what I have been particularly interested in identifying are locations and activities that seem to feature prominently in victims' stories.  In respect of the victims with whom I have spoken, it is obvious that residential camps and jamborees are high-risk activities as far as the victims are concerned.  Abuse is frequently reported from those activities.  In a way, it makes sense.  When a child or young person is removed from the protective care to which he or she is subject in the home environment, that child or young person is more vulnerable and it is harder to put in place good signed safeguarding processes for those activities.</p> <p>  It is important to mention that two members of my team were on site for 12 hours every day at the jamboree that took place this year in Stradbally.  I was in the background monitoring that so there was a very good safeguarding presence at that jamboree, which was a very positive experience.  Of the 6,000 young people who attended that jamboree, the vast majority had a wonderful experience, but we had 16 referrals.  There were 16 or 18 situations that occurred within that setting.  The point was that we had the cover and the staff, the staff provided that service and those situations were dealt with.  We talked to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  It was dealt with very well.  That is an example.  I am sure all the people who attended the jamboree were unaware that during that very positive activity, that number of situations arose, but that is the reality.</p></speech>

The Minister has already asked for a copy and I do not see why she would not be furnished with a copy as the board is fully committed to honouring requests of that nature.  It is difficult to speak in the abstract about the content of the report but we would have to consider whether there was a need for redaction.  We would have to seriously consider its wider publication for the membership but my default attitude is for, rather than against, disclosure.</p></speech>

Under the company owning model, the role of the chief scout is considerably different and the role is now written into the company's constitutional documents.  The executive function of the chief scout, who would traditionally have been involved in the management of the company, has been taken away and the role is more ceremonial, or presidential.  I cannot comment on the role of the current chief scout until the delivery of the report and it would not be appropriate to anticipate any of the findings of the report.</p></speech>

However, I and others are in possession of letters about complaints made against individuals.

I feel uncomfortable speaking about the particulars of those matters.  There is no point in a company having a set of policies if the board has control over who issues a complaint, who does not and the content of the complaint.

There needs to be a clear demarcation between roles and everything should be upfront.  A person who is listening to this meeting and who may be the subject of a complaint will know that there is a policy and procedures for how the complaint is dealt with.</p> <p>  I wish the new board well.  There will be a role for us in seeking to examine how the transition between the old and new boards progresses.  Mr. Elliott was very honest with us on the challenges he found and I imagine that the new board will have to challenge a pre-existing culture.  I am not saying there is a black mark against existing cultures but one has to let in the light and certain people might not be favour of that.</p></speech>

When we engaged Mr. Elliot in the summer of 2017, our child protection officer had left that month.  We engaged Mr. Elliot immediately to take on the role.  We have not had someone in the old position but, as I have outlined previously, what is proposed now is an entirely new structure; it is not the replacement of one officer for another.  We believe that would be an inappropriate structure not only because of the volume of complaints, of which the committee has got some sense of today, but the complexity of the job.  It would put undue strain on one person if it all fell on him or her.  Mr. Elliot spoke about the team and the need for a manager.  We believe the next key step is to employ a manger who has the experience, background and qualifications and to build a team around that person.</p></speech>

We will hold two sessions on the topic.  The first session will involve Rare Diseases Ireland, which is the umbrella body for patients with rare diseases and will present to the committee first.  The second session will be with officials from the Department of Health and representatives from the HSE and the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Philip Watt, chair of the Rare Disease Taskforce and CEO of Cystic Fibrosis Ireland; Ms Vicky McGrath, interim CEO of Rare Diseases Ireland; and Dr. Derick Mitchell, CEO of the Irish Platform for Patients, Organisations, Science and Industry.  </p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses that any opening statements made to the committee may be published on the committee website after the meeting.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

We are the national alliance for voluntary patient-led organisations for people affected or at risk of developing rare diseases in Ireland.  We are committed to the identification, treatment and cure of rare diseases.  Today, I am joined by Mr. Philip Watt, chair of the Rare Disease Taskforce and the Medical Research Charities Group and CEO of Cystic Fibrosis and Dr. Derick Mitchell, CEO of the Irish Platform for Patients, Organisations, Science and Industry.</p> <p>  Orphan drugs are defined as medicines that prevent or treat rare diseases.  There are an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 rare diseases that we know of with more being described.  Collectively, rare diseases may affect up to 8% of the population.  It is estimated that rare diseases affect 300,000 people in Ireland during their lifetime.  Rare diseases have a significant impact on our citizens and an associated economic impact on our society.  A recent survey across Europe revealed that more than 70% of people living with rare diseases have difficulties with daily activities, motor and sensorial functions and social interaction.  A total of 30% of carers spend more than six hours per day on illness-related tasks.  Over 95% of primary carers are family members with the vast majority being women.  A total of 70% of patients and carers had to reduce or stop their professional activity due to the disease.  There is a significant mental health burden with rare disease patients and carers being three times more likely to feel depressed compared to the general population.  </p> <p>  Orphan drugs provide an opportunity to improve lives considerably or even cure disease.  During 2017, the members of this committee met with two Irish rare disease patient organisations - the Alpha One Foundation and Muscular Dystrophy Ireland.  During these meetings, members heard about the challenges facing these organisations' patient communities around access to novel and life-saving orphan drugs.  These medicines have been found by regulators to be both safe and effective and have been approved for reimbursement by many of our peers across Europe yet they are still not available in this country.  Over the intervening 12 months, the committee has, no doubt, encountered many other patients and patient groups with similar stories.  Access to life-saving and curative therapies in this country is lagging behind that of our neighbours.  This situation must change.  The reimbursement system in Ireland continues to fail the patients it is supposed to serve.  We must take an innovative approach to reimbursement and design a system that is fit for purpose - a system that is not only suited to so-called "common" diseases but also addresses the needs of rare disease patients.  Such a system will ensure that all members of our society can contribute maximally.  </p> <p>  There are no comparative therapies for most rare diseases.  In most instances, the patient will not transition from one therapy to a better one.  Orphan drugs constitute the only game in town and provide the best opportunity to slow disease progression and improved quality of life.  As with cancer patients, we are seeking to avail of the best therapies today in the hope of being in a position to avail of new and better therapies in the future.  Many rare disease patients are not being afforded this chance at a better and longer life.  We must build a reimbursement system that provides that bridge to the next therapy.  We must have a system that is robust enough to address challenging decisions.  We know curative gene therapies are on their way.  These transformative therapies will be expensive.</p><p> We all want value for money but how does one define value when one considers the ability of an individual to walk unaided rather than being wheelchair bound for decades or the child who will have have his or her vision restored and can thus integrate normally into classroom life?  What type of society do we wish to have ten years hence?  Today we are on the cusp of a step change when it comes to rare disease patient care.  Access to the European reference networks as a result of the EU's cross-border directive will allow rare disease patients in Ireland access to the best clinical minds across Europe.  Our care will be on a par with that of rare disease patients throughout Europe.  Our care pathways will be best in class and we will be provided with opportunities to enrol in clinical trials.  Innovation will be at the heart of our care.  However, if the reimbursement system in Ireland does not change we will fail at the final hurdle and continue to be denied the therapies we need.</p><p> We acknowledge that progress has been made over the past 12 months, but it is very slow and just too late for many patients.  In recent weeks the rare disease technology review committee began its work.  Patients finally have the opportunity to provide real world experience of living with a condition and the impact that a particular drug may have on quality of life for both the patient and his or her carers.  We are not there to give a sob story but as experts on our diseases.  More significantly, patients are often members of the committee and we finally have a seat at the table as equals.  We are no longer viewed simply as stakeholders.  We are decision makers within the committee and have an equal say in the recommendations that the committee will provide to the HSE leadership, where the ultimate decision around reimbursement lies.</p><p> We understand that these are very early days for the technology review committee and we caution that more time is required to bed down the processes and learn from experience.  Nonetheless it has finally been recognised that patients have a valuable contribution to make to the discourse and decision making process.  To build on this we seek a seat at all stages of the process, be it horizon scanning, the pre-submission consultation or the HSE's decision making meetings.  We have a growing cohort of educated patients who understand the process and the decisions involved.  If we do not have a seat at the table, are we just on the menu?  We have no interest in recommending treatments that do not work.  We do not wish to take medicines that will not work and we do not want to waste money.  We believe that innovative approaches to reimbursement decisions are required.  Payments based upon defined clinical outcomes, so-called pay for performance, or guaranteed access to future improved therapies should be the norm, not the outlier.</p><p> Another development in recent months is Ireland joining the BeNeLuxA initiative, which aims to ensure timely access to, and affordability of, innovative medicines.  Disappointingly, since the Minister for Health signed the agreement five months ago there has been no evidence that we have made any progress.</p><p> Finally, orphan drugs are at the cutting edge of medicine.  We are moving into the realm of personalised or precision medicine.  Orphan drugs should only be provided to those who will benefit from them.  They are not designed for the wider community or even for every patient who might have a particular rare disease.  A genetic diagnosis will be required for many orphan drugs that will come onto the market.  Genetic services, by which I mean consultant geneticists, genetic counsellors and genetic testing facilities, fall far short of what we need in Ireland.  Waiting lists are growing by the day.  Current services are under-resourced and overwhelmed.  We must address this basic building block of medicine in the 21st century if we are to have any hope in the future.  Genetic diagnosis coupled with patient registries will ensure that only those who will benefit from the drug will be put on the drug.  Registries will also allow for post-marketing data collection, enabling the pay for performance reimbursement model to be employed.</p><p> In summary, we have three messages to deliver today.  First, we must develop an all-inclusive, transparent and accountable reimbursement system that will withstand the challenges that lie ahead.  We must think creatively and innovatively.  We must build a system that ensures that the needs of every patient in the country are addressed.  Just because somebody is the only one with a particular rare disease does not mean we are indifferent to that person's needs.</p><p> Second, we must build genetic services capacity that meets the needs of not just the rare disease community today but those of the nation.  Personalised or precision medicine is not just a dream.  It is knocking on our door and the only way we can take part in this revolution is by ensuring that every patient has the opportunity to know more of his or her genetic composition.</p><p> Third, we are not just a voice or even stakeholders, we are decision makers and must be allowed to take on this role in the development of our health service.  Of all the interested parties, patients have the most risk.  It is our health that is at stake.  There is a perception among patients that the health authorities fear our input.  We are not to be feared.  We are the experts on our diseases and we must be involved in all decisions involving our treatment.  Revelations within the health service in Ireland over the last 12 months have shown that patients must be included in all decisions - nothing about us without us.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

The advocacy work and the pressure and technical expertise they bring to the table are incredibly valuable.  I realise they can feel they are ploughing a lonely furrow for much of the time so I wish to acknowledge all the work they do on behalf of many men, women and children throughout the country.  They should keep it up and we will support them in any way we can.</p> <p>  I wish to focus on some of the possible solutions.  I keep hearing that Ireland is lagging behind.  We signed up to the BeNeLuxA initiative.  It agrees on a certain orphan drug yet Ireland does not bring introduce it.  I saw data recently that showed we are the last or one of the last countries in the EU to introduce drugs that have been approved across the EU.  It is probably not always the case but that is what I hear from the parents of sick children, experts such as the witnesses, clinicians and the pharmaceutical companies.  Everybody seems to be saying that Ireland is last or close to last with regard to some of the incredible drugs that are coming through.  The witnesses referred to that several times in their statements.  Why do the witnesses think we appear to be slower than most of the rest of Europe in giving people access to these drugs?  What can we do in real terms to speed up the process?</p></speech>

My sense, and the committee will probably hear this from the representatives of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics and the HSE later, is that some positive things have begun and we welcome those.  They include the BeNeLuxA initiative and the rare disease technology review committee.  They are moves in the right direction.  Professor Michael Barry would probably say that we need to tweak the system rather than reform it.  We are saying we need to go a little further than that.  What we are asking the Government to do is set out an overall policy position which would cover everything, not just the minute detail of appraising a particular drug, representation on one or two committees and so forth.  It would look at the entire process and, indeed, the cost, because we see it from the committee's perspective as well.  These drugs are a horrendous price.  We would all say that we will put on our Irish jerseys and support the Government to get the best and fairest price it can for these drugs.  However, that entails us working together in a more partnership way than has been the case up to now.  Certainly, the last thing we want to do is what Cystic Fibrosis Ireland had to do which was protest outside the Oireachtas.  We would far prefer to see the system being reformed.  It is going in the right direction but it must be far more comprehensive than it has been to date.</p></speech>

An additional element we would like is probably more transparency in the process.  It has been very frustrating to have to go to multiple different sources to get the facts about the delays.  A number of studies have been performed but the system does not seem to release information readily.  From a patient perspective to know where a particular drug is in the process at any stage would be one thing, but also to know which stakeholder has been holding up the process would be very beneficial as well.</p></speech>

I was going through the process on this last week and the view I got was that the clinical evaluation is quite open and moves at a decent clip.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, whether one agrees or disagrees with what it decides, arrives at a recommendation quite quickly.  It has its &euro;45,000 per year measure, with which we can agree or disagree, but it is there and the centre moves through that quite quickly.</p><p>Their recommendation goes into the HSE or the Department and at that point it becomes completely opaque.  Does that sound about right to the officials or would they describe it differently?</p></speech>

It is often done through the health technology assessment process which looks at one key outcome for a drug, but science has moved on.  These new drugs are treating the underlying cause of the disease, not just the symptoms.  The drug must be measured by several outcomes.  There must be reform.  I expect that Professor Barry would also acknowledge that these discussions are taking place at a European and international level.</p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely correct about transparency around the second stage of the process, which involves senior people in the HSE and politicians, but in addition, the whole system needs to be looked at in a holistic way to see what reforms need to be introduced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018112100002#F00300"><p>Specifically on evaluation, one of the issues in passing these rare drugs is that they do not meet this magic number of &euro;45,000 per quality-adjusted life year, QALY, or a disability adjusted life year, that rare drugs are not meeting.  This is for several reasons, including the lack of comparator therapies to use, because they are very expensive due to the small numbers of people to whom they apply and partly, we are told, because the State does not have a system of payment by performance.  Are the officials in favour of a ring-fenced budget that would say that a certain amount of millions of euro was designated for orphan drugs and the &euro;45,000 would be moved to something else and bring in extra issues?</p> <p>  Professor Barry has repeatedly made the point that in the case of orphan drugs, there must be payment by results.  One reason it is so unaffordable is because there could be a phenomenal drug that works on one in 20 people suffering from a rare disease, but because one must pay for all 20, it becomes uneconomical for the one person.  I have put that directly to the pharmaceutical companies, including some of those making rare drugs, and they have said that they would be very happy to move to a payment by results or outcomes system, however, the IT systems are not in place.  They said that it is nothing to do with the pharmaceutical companies but relates to the inability to cope by IT systems in Irish hospitals.  They have cited places such as Scotland and England where they have been introduced.  Does that sound correct?  Have the pharmaceutical companies told the HSE and the Department that they are willing to move to payment by outcomes?</p></speech>

The systems are not currently in place, and we have some hope that they will become available but it has been a very slow process.  We need to ramp up investment in the area to ensure that it can happen in the next two to five years, or else we will always lag behind and will never be in a position to identify that one patient who is getting good outcomes, and we will always struggle to reimburse.</p> <p>  A ring-fenced fund is a good idea in theory and it is something that we would like to see in the short to medium term.  However, we do not want the ring-fencing to be a limit or barrier where we have a discrete pot of money and we end up arguing among ourselves over which patients we will spend the pot on.  There are other areas where the health service can be streamlined so that funds could be taken from one pot and put into another so that it does not become the case that there is only one bloc of money available.  </p> <p>  The Deputy spoke of a cost-benefit, the QALY and so on.  Mr. Watt has alluded to re-jigging the entire heath technology assessment, HTA, system.  We must take account of the burden borne by people in general and by society generally.  It is not only the Department of Health budget or the Government, but it is about all the work we do and how better can we invest our money and time into other areas if these therapies were being made available. </p></speech>

When we are trying to fight for rare disease drugs we are told that they are so expensive that we are denying others services.  It is not only that patients are having to live with their disease but they are also being blamed from taking resources from somewhere else.  We would counter that it is not a zero-sum game.  The Government has been criticised for years for spending far too much on drugs which are much cheaper in other European countries, and that we do not have enough investment into biosimilar and generic drugs which would come at a fraction of the cost of many of these drugs.  We still have a long way to go to reducing our drugs cost and using at least some of that money on innovative and new technologies such as those for rare diseases.  There is also a lack of recognition that the cost of developing a rare disease drug is recognised internationally as far greater than one for a more common disease.  I am not defending drug companies trying to exploit countries but that is an economic reality.  If there is only a small number of patients from which a company can make back its money, and it costs $1 billion to develop a drug, there is no doubt that the drug will be expensive.</p></speech>

The committee has written its report and several of us have argued and fought for various different organisations.  I and Deputy Brassil and others have worked closely with the Alpha-1 foundation in its fight.  In the last week or so, we secured a guarantee on the 19 remaining patients that were on clinical trials.  I had a sad situation of my own where someone I knew well, Marion Kelly from Nenagh, who is no relation, unfortunately passed away after being taken off Respreeza.  Her family had some satisfaction last week.</p> <p>  Responsibility in clinical trials is a real issue.  There are issues around honouring commitments, whereby pharmaceutical companies sign up to these trials but then can withdraw from them.  We need protocols around clinical trials in Ireland, but my question is how we do that.  It is a very important area and I do not want to see something like this happen again.  As far as I am concerned, two people lost their lives after coming off a trial because of how it would be administered.  One of those people had been in my office only two weeks earlier.  </p> <p>  I am trying not to overlap with the good questions Deputy Donnelly asked.  I refer to reimbursement and the whole process surrounding it.  There is an issue around jumping between the Department of Health, HSE and the National Contact Points, NCP.  Unlike Britain, the NCP here is not aligned with the budget.  Therefore, unlike other jurisdictions, those who decide on drugs do not have control over the budget, which is a real issue.  How can we change this?  We have seen so much jumping around on decision making.  The committee found a farcical situation where there were letters going between the Department of Health, the HSE and the NCP; it was insane and it  is infuriating.  Will the officials give their views on how we can have budgets and decision-making in the one place?</p> <p>  Will the officials comment on the rare disease committee being decision makers and how that might work into the future?  I can see that the witnesses are passionate about this but how do they anticipate it will happen?</p><p>How do the witnesses envisage they will form part of the team that makes decisions?  I ask that because I do not want to see a situation where the witnesses are not part of the team.  </p><p> Some of us here have had a lot of discussions on biosimilars.  How can we move quickly in this area?  We must move a lot quicker in this area because it will solve some of the issues.  The witnesses referred to the issue, on which I have strong views.</p><p> My last question is on genetic services.  It is a topical issue because of the revelation about a transcription error in Crumlin.  I understand that Ireland is quite behind in terms of genetic services.  The HSE has tried to recruit senior people with expertise in this area in order to upgrade services, which hinges on the fact that personalised drugs are the future of medicine.  I do not think they can match until genetic services reach the required level from a quality and quantity analysis perspective.  In other words, we need a service that is able to review many people pretty quickly.  We are nowhere near that stage in Ireland.  I would like the witnesses to give their thoughts on that matter.</p></speech>

In terms of compassionate access to innovative drugs that have not received marketing approval or been approved by the European Medicines Agency, that has been a grey area for us.  The Deputy is right that protocols should be put in place.  It is something we have included as part of our joint work on our Drug Iceberg reports where we feel that any patient who is on trial, as part of a compassionate programme, should have access to that drug for their life.  When we talked to other stakeholders in the area there seems to be a reluctance to adhere to that aim for a number of different reasons.  Let us consider the environment for clinical trials.  A new clinical EU directive is coming down the tracks that will detail how clinical trials will, potentially, be harmonised.  The Department of Health is doing a lot of work into research ethics in terms of creating a single committee.  The Helsinki Protocol governs how patients should gain access to clinical trials.  The area of compassionate access has not been structured in a satisfactory way for patients.  Recently the European rare diseases organisation, EURODIS, has compiled a report on trying to get a consistent approach to compassionate access and made a number of recommendations.  We could consider those recommendations in order to move the issue forward in Ireland.  If there is a potential that Irish patients would get compassionate access, then we should ensure that the company that allows a drug to be available for free adheres to a set of guidelines.</p> <p>  The next issue is biosimilars.  In the absence of a national policy on biosimilars, from a patient perspective it makes sense to use these drugs.  However, we should do so on the basis that the savings accrued to the system would be reinvested in innovation or similar types of drugs.  We have had some discussions on substituting an existing innovative drug for a biosimilar, and who might be involved in that instance.  We would like to see greater interaction between clinical and pharmacy communities on those decisions because we feel that pharmacists have a role to play maybe not as the decision-makers but, certainly in terms of the decision itself, there should be more collegiality between the two communities on that aspect. </p></speech>

I would caution against the use of the phrase "decision-making" because we do not want people to believe that the group makes decisions on reimbursement.  It does not.  It is making a decision about a recommendation for reimbursement.  We need to be very clear that the committee is not the decision-maker.</p></speech>

In terms of the make up and operation of the group, it looks at everything outside of pricing, the economic reimbursement or the economic models that the National Contact Points, NCP, would traditionally consider.  It considers clinical trials and the impact the results would truly have on somebody's life, and quality of life.  The group's role is far more objective.  It is not that it is unsupported by evidence and research but it is much more based on the patient.  The group aggregates the data and the data produced by the clinicians around members' own experiences dealing with these patients, and the effect that they feel the drugs would have on them.  It is not an economic conversation; it is about how will this truly impact on the life of the patient.  The group makes recommendations on the basis of that information, and not on economic information.</p></speech>

There should be a scientific analysis of the particular drugs using a hospital treatment insight, HTI, system that we can all agree with, and then that assessment is done.  It is slightly odd to see the person responsible for making those judgments talking on RT&Eacute; the next day arguing about the price.  I greatly admire Professor Michael Barry.  To me, it is a conflict of interest when he, as the Chief Medical Officer decides whether a drug is good enough, goes on radio the next day and says that the drug is not worth the price that has been offered.  Naturally, when one is on the airwaves one will use any argument to support one's reason to deny a drug and one quickly starts talking spin whether one likes it or not.  The NCP should be given the task of making judgments and somebody from the corporate pharmaceutical unit, CPU, of the HSE should be the person discussing the price on the airwaves.  The squeezing of the margins is part of the problem.</p> <p>  In terms of genetics, Professor Smyth compiled a report on the future of genetic services in Ireland five years ago.  Virtually nothing has been done but the HSE is recruiting a couple of people to work in this area, which is positive.  I was not surprised by what was said earlier concerning genetic services because they are completely understaffed.  The staff are fantastic, do their best and provide great support to patients.  The current situation is a national outcome of a decade where clinical genetic services have been underfunded. </p> <p>  We considered the HSE's service plan from two years ago.  We noted that clinical genetic services were not mentioned and not even the word "genetics".  The HSE is playing catch up.  Genetics and the human genome are the way forward in terms of personalised medicine.  It is only now that we are getting our heads around that aspect.</p><p>That is why there must be an overall Government strategy that recognises all of these new developments.  </p></speech>

We have talked a little about bringing transparency into the process but we keep coming up against the barrier of commercial sensitivity.  Is there any country that does it better?  Could we look to Scotland or replicate what is being done in any other country?  Do we need to reinvent the wheel if another country has gone to the trouble of working out the process well?</p> <p>  The process here is flawed and those who are central to it very often seem to be furthest away from it.  The witnesses will be aware of my views on this issue as I have discussed it with them previously.  Recently there was interaction between massive pharmaceutical companies, the Government, patient advocates and politicians and we ended up being used as pawns in a game being played by the companies and part of that was because of the process.  The companies were putting pressure on us to put pressure on the Government.  People came to the D&aacute;il waving pieces of paper around, screaming and asking "What price for a life?".  All of this is extremely emotive and is a really poor way for us to have to make decisions.  There has to be a better way.  At the end of the process, if it does not work, how can we reasonably say "No"?  Is there evidence from other countries that suggest that we can do so?  At the moment, what happens is that if the drug is over a certain price, that is it.  The answer is going to be "No" and then we get into a long, drawn out process.  That is clearly not working and is not satisfying anybody.  In the event that we go through the process but there is just not sufficient evidence in terms of positive outcomes to justify the expense, what happens?  I do not mean to sound cold but are there countries where this works?  Is there anywhere where patients and patient advocates are so centrally involved in the process that they understand that a drug might not be for them?  That seems to be the hardest part.  Patients say that if the answer is "No", they will accept it.  If they are told that it does not work, they will accept that but the "No" is always on price.  It does not seem that sufficient evidence is being presented back but when one turns on the radio, one hears people who are central to the process saying that a drug is not good value for money.  Then we are back on the merry-go-round, shouting at the Minister and so forth and it all keeps coming back to the same place.  There has to be a better way to do it.  There also has to be a way to do it better if the evidence is not there to support a drug.  Do other countries get it right?  If so, I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that.</p> <p>  How many times has the technology assessment review group met?  Is there a hope that it will review and improve the process, particularly in the context of the patient and advocate involvement?  My last question relates to overall costs and the issues that are not really taken into consideration.  I refer here to the additional burden on the health service.  Perhaps burden is the wrong word but if drugs are not made available then presumably the everyday crises in the health service like trolley waits, waiting lists and so on will have a more profound impact on the people the witnesses are representing.  Like everyone, they clearly want to be able to stay out of hospital.  Is there evidence of higher incidence of hospital presentation for the groups that the witnesses are representing?  Is there any way of identifying what the consequent savings to the health service might be?  I know that is not considered here but it is considered elsewhere.  Part of any assessment process is to weigh one factor against another.  It is hard to quantify in some instances but it is something that should be taken into consideration and offset against the cost.  While I do not agree that cost is the only factor, it would be silly to pretend that it is not an important one.</p></speech>

Scotland has successfully incorporated both patient and clinician perspectives in parallel.  They have managed to do it from a health care improvement perspective, which has led to the new processes within the Scottish Medicine Consortium.  We would look very favourably on what it has managed to achieve in terms of incorporating more qualitative evidence and also developing a process that is far more welcoming.  We had the privilege of being observers at a recent Patient and Clinician Engagement, PACE, meeting.  It is similar to the rare disease technology review group but at a level up in terms of the decision making process.</p> <p>  As Mr. Watt suggested, there is a reluctance in the system to systematically engage with patients due to media coverage and public policy coverage.  What we have been doing in more recent years is structuring the way that patients are educated and informed around this particular area in medicines research and development.  We now have a growing cohort of educated Irish patients who are more than willing to engage with what we would determine as meaningful opportunities.  Rather than simply plucking an individual patient from out of the blue and putting him or her on a committee, we would support a much more systematic process whereby if the opportunity for a patient perspective as part of a committee has been identified, then the patient should be supported and educated to a certain degree.  As a minimum the patient should feel that it is an opportunity to be embraced.  Once we get that process in place then the point about accepting that sometimes "No" means "No" for very good reasons is relevant.  At the same time, there is a challenge on the patient side for any citizen in Ireland.  If one's brother, mother or other family member is suffering from a rare disease, one has a right to stand up for one's relative.  </p> <p>  There are a number of responsibilities attached to this too, particularly with regard to the way things are reported in the media.  A lot of positive things are happening in this area and there are lots of new developments but if everything ends up being commented on negatively, how exactly are patients going to view our system?  </p></speech>

This committee has invited us here as patient advocates.</p><p>However, the committee should also bring before it the clinicians because they feel equally outside the system as often they are not asked for their opinion in a systematic way.  They are our doctors and many of them are involved in the clinical trials on these drugs.  The Scottish system was very good from this perspective.  Certainly the day we were there, there was no disagreement between what the patients' representatives said and the assessment.  Obviously there was a greater sense of trust in the system.</p><p> I understand Deputy O'Reilly's point on interaction with the drugs companies and I suspect she was thinking about cystic fibrosis when she mentioned it.</p></speech>

The change needs to be more fundamental with regard to the health technology assessment process and afterwards.  This is the point Deputy Donnelly raised with regard to transparency after the process.  When we drew up our documents we tried to find a flowchart of the drug approval system in Ireland but we could not find one.  There is none on the HSE website.

Their lung function did not increase that much but their need to go into hospital reduced by more that 30%.  This was proved in the clinical trials.  Obviously massive savings will be made.  It also means that patients are living longer, which is why we are fighting for the 20-bed unit in Beaumont Hospital.  Our patients now live into their 30s, 40s and 50s whereas 20 years ago they died at the age of 16 or 17.  This is the difference the care has made and we acknowledge the Irish health system in terms of these changes.  We speak about all the bad things but when we see how things have moved on for our patients we realise that if the will is there massive positive changes can be made.</p></speech>

The nine criteria offer a degree of flexibility.  In particular, in terms of what we are speaking about today, there are other countries that have managed to put in another level of criteria for orphan drugs that greatly recognises the specific unmet need with regard to more rare conditions.  I am thinking in particular of Sweden.  It comes back to the other question that was asked.  Sweden was able to put in place these principles because it had a degree of public trust in the system's ability to assess, evaluate and make decisions.  It also has a very well-recognised national registry system.  It has a health information system that is able to monitor effectiveness in a much better way than we have in Ireland.  It comes back to Deputy Donnelly's point that an IT system and a national electronic health record for individual patients with individual identifiers definitely need to be part of a national strategy on what we are speaking about, in terms of personalised medicine and precision medicine.  The patient registries have a very important role to play.  They have been doing phenomenal work for a number of years with very little resources.  They are approaching a tipping point in terms of their ability to sustain this.  At the same time, they are being very innovative in bringing in new solutions for how patients can be effectively monitored, whereby they take their medication and, ultimately, we are able to show the improvement in outcomes.</p></speech>

Regarding orphan drugs, Ireland is at a disadvantage because of the size of the country and our population.  A country with a large population like Germany is able to make progress at a faster rate.  I refer to recommendation 13 in our report.  We had done an agreement in the past five months and the witnesses are saying there is no evidence that working closer with other countries has come into effect.  Ireland's approach seems to be to deal with countries with smaller populations.  Would we be better off aligning with a country with a bigger population in that we would be in a better position both in terms of assessment and trying to deal with the price issue?  I am aware of a drug coming onto the market which would have benefited only ten people in the Thirty-two Counties.  Of the ten, six would have had a real benefit from it, which is a very small core group of people.  However, if we were dealing with a country with a larger population, more people would benefit from a particular drug.  Should we examine that in a more comprehensive manner?</p> <p>  Regarding assessment, we seem to be going through a long process of assessment when the European Medicines Agency may have approved the drug already.  There was a recommendation in our report on working with other countries in doing the assessment rather than having a team here devoting all its time to doing it when three or four countries are doing the exact same assessment.  There is a duplication in that regard.  I recall speaking to a pharmaceutical company that had presented more than 300 pages of documentation on its research and development of a drug here.  The process seems to be drawn out.  We are in the European Union.  The idea was that we would work together to ensure there would be benefits for everyone thereby removing all the duplication.</p> <p>  My next question is on rare diseases.  I dealt with a particular case of someone with epidermolysis bullosa, EB.  Debra Ireland raised a simple point with me five years ago, namely, that even if patients with EB had medical cards, the cost of bandages was not covered by the medical card.  I arranged a meeting with the medical card service to ensure that bandages could be made available to those on the medical card scheme.  I am sure there are small areas that are being ignored because that is the regulation and we cannot bend that rule.  Could we be doing much to assist patients with rare diseases that do not fit into the criteria provided in regulation or legislation because we do not have a system within the health service to help them get access to an improved level of care?  It is one of the problems that tend to arise for people with rare diseases.</p> <p>  My final point is on cross-Border healthcare.  As someone who was involved in that issue in Brussels in 2008 and 2009, the directive has now been transposed.  Could we work with other countries on cross-Border healthcare and remove some of the hurdles here to getting access to care?  We are doing that in many other areas.  Why can we not do it much more in healthcare?  We seem to be unable to do that.</p></speech>

To start with the one on cross-Border healthcare, we work with the rare diseases group in the North.  Members can tell from my accent that I am from Belfast.  That group feels utterly abandoned.  There is no administration, and they are dealing with Brexit as well.  They are very concerned about the cross-Border services that will be affected by Brexit.  They are distraught; that is the only word I can use.  We need to extend a hand to them much more often than we do currently in terms of making sure they are included.</p> <p>  We still have backs to the Border.  Everybody in the South looks at Dublin and everybody in the North looks at Belfast.  It is far too small an island to do that.  We need to pool all our resources, and there are some fantastic services in the North.  They are developing genetic services of which we can avail.  Some retina operations are done in the North.  Likewise, patients with heart conditions are treated in the South.  As the chief medical officer in Northern Ireland stated, we just have to get on with it and try to ignore Brexit and the fact that there is no Administration in the North and make sure those services work for our patients.  I believe we should not stop that but enhance those services.  I take that point fully on board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.467" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Vicky McGrath" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018112100002#K00500"><p>I will go back to the Senator's first question and then move on to the cross-Border directive.  In terms of the BeNeLuxA initiative, it is five months in.  We need to give them a little time to do some work but it comes down to transparency.  Have they made any progress?  What have they done?  None of us seems to know.  The initiative has been signed.  That is great.  We had all the fanfare but we do not know whether anything has happened in the intervening period.  I would not throw it out as being a case of wanting to go with a larger country.  We need to let it bed down.</p> <p>  That rolls very well into the cross-Border directive and what we refer to as the European reference networks.  The Commission has decreed that Europe needs to work as one when it comes to rare diseases.  There is no longer an Irish rare disease healthcare system; it is a European rare disease healthcare system.  In so doing, I would expect the likes of BeNeLuxA to work with the German and the French authorities.  They will start to work together and then to do reimbursement for drugs across Europe.  The chances are that some of these therapies will be made available, as in administered, in only one or two countries because the diseases are so rare.  There are so few patients they will end up having to travel, and that is how we will get access to it.  We will get access to it because Ireland is signed up to these reference networks.  We are still in the very early stages.  There are 24 networks.  Some countries have representations in all 24.  Currently, we have representations in two, but we understand at least 21 applications are due to be submitted by the next deadline.  The deadline has not been set, so it is not that we are behind the ball in that regard.  By the middle of next year, we expect to have the applications in and, hopefully, they will be processed by the end of the year to ensure Ireland is well represented in the European realm in terms of these reference networks.  They will provide many solutions.  The will provide some of the infrastructure we want around the registries and ensuring we have the best care pathways.  It is a major burden to put on the European reference networks, but the pharmaceutical sector is calling for it.</p><p>The challenge we face is that the pharmaceutical industry will stop coming to Ireland seeking to get drugs reimbursed because our population is too small.  If the industry is dealing with Europe, there is some hope that it will end up coming across.  It will be a challenge for our health system to equate to Germany's, but we have to address that in the years ahead.  There are positives, but in the intervening period, we need to readdress the existing system and make sure that we do not fall behind.  We must also consider the other drugs and diseases that are not termed "rare". </p></speech>

The vision for the European Reference Networks is also about data collection.  It is about harnessing the power of Europe to work for patients in individual countries.  In Ireland in particular, part of the development of a new national rare disease plan would be more emphasis and much more supports for the clinical leaders.  However, patients are playing leading roles in several of the European Reference Networks, and such a plan should also allow for greater Irish leadership in those reference networks.  We believe they will become one of the major solutions for things like pricing, reimbursement and ultimately better assessment processes.</p> <p>  I refer also to the joint clinical assessment initiatives that are going through the European Legislature at the moment.  The Commission's proposal for joint clinical assessments is something we have been looking at and of which we are highly supportive.  While there are differences in opinion in various member states as to how it affects their assessment processes, joint clinical assessments applicable across jurisdictions certainly make sense from a patient perspective and with regard to duplication.  Some 14 patient umbrella groups at European level recently released a statement about the consensus on patient involvement in that proposal.  Patient involvement needs to be a greater consideration in the overall co-ordination of efforts in joint clinical assessments. </p></speech>

Could there be a better structure for supporting people who could be provided with care but who do not know how to access it?  Does more need to be done to provide information to people who are identified as having rare diseases?</p></speech>

The Senator's point is correct.  In some cases, more visibility is needed.  To get back to the point about epidermolysis bullosa, EB, it is ridiculous that people have to pay for bandages when that is a core part of their medical treatment.  There is a kind of grey area between what is a drug or medication and what is not which definitely needs to be resolved.  Moreover, without a universal healthcare system, we just have the long-term illness scheme which was introduced in 1971.  That names about 43 conditions for which there is basically a universal healthcare system.  We are very lucky that cystic fibrosis, CF, is one of them.  However, many other conditions, including many rare diseases, are not named in the scheme but should be equivalents.  I do not advocate getting rid of the scheme but it should be expanded to cover many more conditions until we have a universal healthcare system.  That is crucial as well.</p></speech>

I refer where we are as a country with regard to orphan drugs.  The European Medicines Agency has designated 148 medicines as orphan drugs for rare diseases.  Currently we reimburse 53 of those or 35%.  The UK reimburses 68, Spain reimburses 75, Italy reimburses 84, France reimburses 116 and Germany reimburses 133.  We are at 35%.  Germany is best at 90%.  Spain, a country whose economy is not going as well as ours, is at 50%.  We are at the lower end for reimbursement for orphan drugs and drugs for rare diseases.  The NCPE is aware of this.  We have been fighting individual battles, over Respreeza for alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor deficiency, as Deputy Kelly mentioned, and Orkambi for CF.  It seems that if the lobby is strong enough, or given the unfortunate and tragic deaths of two patients, the HSE takes notice.</p> <p>  As a result of my work as spokesperson on primary care I have tried to modify the Bill.  This committee has stated that it needs to be modified.  It is being resisted at all ends.  That is the context of our dealings with the NCPE and the HSE in trying to establish a better model to reimburse more drugs and to give patients with rare diseases, who are as deserving of proper care as anyone else, some chance of either dealing with their symptoms or in some cases dramatically changing their lives.  </p> <p>  The rare disease technical review committee was referenced.  That is a welcome addition.  The key point, which the witnesses have recognised, is that this group is reviewing the decision, not making it.  Because it is reviewing a decision based on a flawed process, it will find it difficult to come up with a different decision.  The 2013 Act needs to be amended.  That is my focus and it should be that of the witnesses as well.  Unless we amend the process by which these drugs are reviewed, we will be fighting an uphill battle.</p> <p>  Dr. Mitchell made reference to Sweden.  Sweden's model is a based on quality-adjusted life year, QALYs, but it does not have an upper limit.  The Swedish model allows for situations where maybe half a dozen patients are suffering from one condition, where one could not possibly get the type of data that is needed and meet the threshold of 45,000.  Interestingly, in 2015, the proportion of health expenditure on medical goods was greater in Ireland than it was in Sweden.</p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly  raised the issue of biosimilars.  The IPU has identified a potential saving of &euro;307 million on biosimilars alone over three years.  I have met children suffering from spinal muscular atrophy.  A drug called Spinraza has revolutionised treatment.  Its total cost to the system would be approximately &euro;9 million.  Multiples of that cost are available.  </p> <p>  We need to amend the Act to give some hope of orphan drugs being reviewed.  If we do not do so, the companies will just stop applying, as Ms McGrath pointed out.  They know the answer will be "No", so why would they waste time and resources applying for something when they are going to be refused?  That will have a knock-on effect.</p><p>I met officials from Vertex, the company that makes Orkambi, recently.  After all the battling, arguments, protests, marches and so on, that drug was reimbursed, including future iterations.  I believe the next Orkambi, whatever it is called, is coming on-stream shortly without any debate.  Vertex told me it is looking for other countries to consider reimbursement in the way the agreement was made in Ireland.</p></speech>

Orkambi was not reimbursed because the NCPE suddenly saw the light, however.  Massive political pressure and patient-centred demonstration and focus made officials realise they could no longer ignore it or make the decisions they were making without being challenged.  When they were challenged, they made the decision.  I do not know if I had any question there; it was more of a statement.  I would appreciate if the witnesses' organisations could look at the Bill I am-----</p></speech>

I give an assurance that my organisation would never campaign for a drug we did not believe in or see the scientific evidence for.  Our point was that the system was flawed so that no orphan drug would get past.  That was fundamentally why we were protesting.  It is great to see some reforms being put in place, partly as a legacy of that but also as a result of the work of all the patient groups.  Our key point is that the reforms need to be broader.  A broader strategy needs to be put in place which considers issues such as cost and where the money is going to come from, rather than simply tweaking things by putting a couple of patient representatives here and there.  All that is welcome and great but it must be part of a broader change.  There is also an issue in respect of how patient representatives are picked.  We want to set down a marker that we should elect our own representatives and not have them hand-picked by the HSE and the Department of Health.  There was an election for the rare diseases committee, which was welcome, but other processes are happening daily whereby the HSE simply picks a patient or an organisation.  Those days are gone and the structures need to be much fairer and more transparent.</p></speech>

Deputy Donnelly raised this earlier as well.  Unless we have a specific budget it is difficult to make comparisons, decide how much we should spend or know how much of those savings will be reinvested in orphan drugs.  That is something else we should insist on.  Although I know they have the data, the companies keep coming back saying they do not.  In the application process for any company, one of the questions is whether there are orphan drugs ratifications.  It is in their applications so they know what is an orphan drug and what is not and, therefore, they can tell us how much they are spending on orphan drugs.  They just do not want to do so.</p></speech>

It does not specify the total amount and certainly is not viewed as a target but as a way in which we can effectively measure the spend.  It has not been touched as part of the current plan, however.  We certainly hope that as the new plan is being developed, it will be re-examined in that context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018112100002#M00700"><p>I am sympathetic to the issue of orphan drugs, particularly where it has been shown that they work and that a patient cohort will benefit from them.  The problem, which the committee has discussed many times, is where the determination as to their benefit and safety comes from.  Is it made at EU level?  There is a vetting system at EU level but, as we found out in this committee a year or so ago, we have an internal system that vets them again.  I do not see the purpose of that exercise at all.  We appear to have, and to contribute to, two systems, as the vetting system we have here is also replicated at European level.  When it comes down to it, the EU is in the best position to command a price.  If someone is negotiating on behalf of 500 million people, the case is an awful lot stronger than on behalf of three or four.  Despite the good cause, it comes down to the power of the market but we do not use that argument in this country at all.  An average of 14 member states are involved in these processes.  The Bill referred to by Deputy Brassil is a classic example.  Why could it not be the entire EU 27?  It could have been 28 member states up to recently but could still be 27 from here on in.  Whoever is vetting and dictating the going rate to individual states, no individual state can have the same power, except perhaps the larger states.  We should get to that point as early as possible.  I spoke about this issue 20 or 30 years ago in another capacity.  It has not changed over the years.  We are still engaged in procurement standing alone on our own two feet and it is not working.  It does not, and cannot, work.  Having a duplicate system where we have one system operating at EU level and another one superimposed on it here is daft and stupid in the extreme.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the benefit of patient representative groups but I would also balance that benefit against the points raised by Deputy O'Reilly.  We could find ourselves in an awkward position.  We have the telling tales of the patients and lobby groups on the one hand, while, on the other, we have this amorphous system, which we do not know how to deal with and cannot manage.  Everything comes down to cost in the final analysis.  Deputy Brassil makes a useful point about the 2013 Act.  It was framed and passed in the midst of the worst economic crisis this country or any other European country ever had the misfortune to experience.  It might be a good idea to examine it again in a different light.  However, as a note of caution, before the economic crash we believed we were one of the wealthiest countries in the world but that was a figment of our imaginations.  We were not and we are not.  There is no use pretending we are.  Wealth is made up of series of factors of which housing, goods, services and trade are a part.  They tend to float with the market and can leave us high and dry when the tide goes out.  We need to be cautious that we do not walk ourselves into trouble, not necessarily in respect of pharmaceuticals and health only but in other respects as well.</p> <p>  Diagnosis is an important issue, particularly for rare diseases.  For example, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is a rare disease.  I know five people who have been unfortunate enough to wake up and find themselves paralysed.  There is no answer to it at all and they spent considerable time in hospital while their cases were examined before diagnosis eventually happened, sometimes on a haphazard basis.  That needs to be examined.  Modern communication should make it much easier to compare cases across the country and the continent.  This condition is curable.  The same people were walking around six months after being diagnosed.  They had to go a long route to learn to walk again and needed rehabilitation but it happens.  Early diagnosis is of considerable economic benefit in that area.</p><p>I would be one of those strongly in favour of utilising it as much as possible.</p><p> I have already referred to my final point.  We need a single system of adjudication.  It is either in Europe or it is here.  We do it one way or the other; there is no use doing it twice because there is a cost involved in that.  From a safety point of view, utilising new drugs on the market is of paramount importance.  Years ago, there was considerable anxiety and questions were raised about the manner and methodology used to test the drugs and those on whom the tests were carried out.  Considerable controversy arose at the time and people remain concerned.  It must be one of the issues we consider.  We need to move on.  We need to remove the emotional situation that arises on a daily basis where it requires a significant amount of publicity or attention to be drawn to a particular condition before there is a response but that response must be tempered by the ability of the State.  We return to the question of how much a life costs, a point raised by Deputy O'Reilly.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right.  There is considerable inefficiency in that process.  It is about whether the Government is willing to put its trust in the EMA.  The question is whether it becomes a economic burden the Government is unwilling to shoulder.  It makes so much more sense.  The EMA makes the decision on a drug and all European countries can negotiate at once with the drug companies so they have far better leverage when it comes to getting a better price.  I do not think the HSE is ready for that but it is a principle worth working towards.</p></speech>

I am following two drugs in particular, namely, Translarna and Spinraza.  These drugs are what led me to the issue of rare diseases.  I am not a permanent member of this committee.  What has shocked me is the lack of transparency, which has been mentioned.  Where there is no transparency, there is no trust.  That is the real issue we need to tackle.  The issues involve transparency, the delays and blockages in the system and how quickly we can get to a European situation where the BeNeLuxA benefits kick in and people really benefit from them.  Are there specific actions we can take to bring transparency to the process?</p></speech>

The NCPE carried out an analysis of the assessment process recently, which is quite transparent to everybody here.  In respect of the reasons and steps along the process where there was a stop clock or a gap, that has only recently been done through a manual process in the NCPE.  We do not have an equivalent on the reimbursement side in Ireland.  As far as I am aware, they do not have that kind of breakdown in Scotland.  This is something we would like to see more of in terms of the reasons that the clock stops.</p></speech>

The reason there is a need for a bigger review is that these new drugs are impacting in a much more holistic way so they need to be measured in terms of four or five different end points rather than one.  Quality of life is vital in terms of that and must be taken very seriously.  We can have all the processes in place - and the Scottish system is very good - but the point Senator Conway-Walsh is making relates to the outcomes.  We would remain suspicious if all these new processes are put in place and we still find that Ireland is the only country in Europe that does not approve a particular drug.  One's suspicions would definitely be aroused if such a drug was available in most other European countries.</p></speech>

I have significant issues with the cost because it is not negotiated.  We are taking a headline cost and working out the cost-benefit analysis on that basis but we cannot hope to do so when the drug company is giving a cost expecting it to be negotiated, and rightly so - it would happen in any business negotiation - but it is not being negotiated by the HSE.

Even in terms of our experience around Orkambi, it got a significant reduction in terms of what was offered originally.  I cannot reveal the price.

That is being copied by other countries so there are occasions when it can get it right.  We need to build on that good practice.</p></speech>

I do not know.  In the very short term, as patients and patient organisations, the big thing we would like to see happen is an opening up of the relationship between pharma and the HSE.  Things go into the black box - I think "opaque" is a nice word to use - but there is no visibility and one, two or three years could pass by.  We hear anecdotally from the industry which is far more willing to discuss this issue than not that it has had a meeting, or not as the case may be, or a phone call, or that an email was sent in the intervening period.  That there is no visibility is one of the biggest challenges we face in the short term and it would be easy to address, to at least say in broad terms that there was communication, or that a meeting was held and that people promised to come back in three months' time.  That would help us a lot in the short term.  We would then look at rebuilding the systems and stuff like that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.513" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Finian Judge" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018112100002#O00900"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to discuss the report on evaluating orphan drugs.  I am accompanied by Mr. John Hennessy, national director of acute strategy and planning; Mr. Shaun Flanagan, chief pharmacist in the corporate pharmaceutical unit; and Professor Michael Barry, clinical director of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.</p><p> In March the Department of Health received the committee's report on evaluating orphan drugs.  The report included a number of significant recommendations related to the assessment and reimbursement process for orphan drugs.  Some of the recommendations concerned the policy and statutory framework underpinning the process, with the remainder focused on the evaluation and reimbursement process, including the clinical criteria deployed in that evaluation.</p><p> I note that the 2013 Act is very comprehensive and provides for a range of important matters, including the criteria to which the HSE must have regard when making reimbursement decisions on new medicines.  The Act includes provisions on interchangeable products, rules for the establishment and maintenance of reimbursement lists and provisions on reference pricing.  In its report the committee focused on that part of the Act which provided for the evaluation process for new medicines proposed for inclusion in the reimbursement list.  </p><p> Since the publication of the committee's report, the Department has been engaging with the HSE and the NCPE to address the recommendations contained in it on the framework and process for assessing orphan drugs.  In this contribution I will address those recommendations directed to the Minister for Health or the Department.  My colleagues from the HSE and the NCPE will address the recommendations on the evaluation and reimbursement process, including the clinical criteria pertaining to evaluation.  Under statute that function is vested in the HSE.</p><p> The Minister is satisfied that the Oireachtas has put in place a robust legal framework in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 for the assessment and reimbursement of medical goods.  The Act provides the HSE with full statutory powers to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of all medicines and includes detailed criteria to which the HSE is required to have regard when making those decisions.  The Act puts in place a clear statutory framework by which new products must be assessed by the HSE and ensures decisions are made on an objective and scientific basis.  It provides for a fair, transparent and rigorous process for the assessment of all drugs and has delivered tangible results for patients.  The Minister is satisfied that there are no legislative barriers to the reimbursement of orphan drugs, as distinct from any other drug, and is further satisfied that the rules pertaining to the assessment of all drugs do not discriminate against orphan drugs.  In fact, the criteria which apply to the evaluation process contained in Schedule 3 to the 2013 Act provide sufficient scope for the HSE to take on board the particular circumstances of orphan drugs.  My colleagues from the HSE and the NCPE can elaborate further on that matter.</p><p> In its report the committee, rightly, identified that drugs were increasingly being developed to target very rare conditions and that these drugs often came with a very high list price.  Under the Act, the HSE is required to have regard to the funding challenges these drugs represent.  It does so by drawing on the criteria contained in the Act, including the potential or actual budget impact of the drug in question and the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying a particular item, rather than by providing other health services.  These are difficult decisions, but they recognise the core challenge presented by the availability of finite resources in the face of ever-competing demands.  </p><p> The committee recommended the appointment of an independent person to conduct a review of the current process and its role in orphan drug availability.  The Department is preparing to undertake a review of the governance arrangements applying to the internal HSE process.  The review will examine the systems, structures and resources which support the decision-making process for reimbursement.</p><p> In its report the committee also expressed support for collaboration with other EU member states.  The Minister is very much in agreement with that notion.  In fact, the challenge of accessing innovative medicines at an affordable price is one shared by most, if not all, developed countries.  Demographic change will have to be managed, with a continually growing pipeline of new and innovative medicines, many of which will come with asking prices that risk making them unaffordable or unsustainable.  It is estimated that approximately 45 new molecules are due to receive market authorisation in Europe in each of the next five years.  It is in this high technology space which includes orphan drugs that the greatest challenges will arise in the years ahead.  </p><p> Already, expenditure under the high technology arrangements through which the majority of new high cost medicines, including orphan drugs, are funded has increased, from approximately &euro;400 million in 2012 to close to &euro;700 million this year.  That level of growth is a major challenge for the Government and the HSE and a reason Ireland is working with other countries in Europe to develop common solutions to a universal problem.  A significant development since the publication of the committee's report has been Ireland joining the BeNeLuxa initiative on pharmaceutical policy in June.  This collaboration will support the Minister's objective of co-operation with other EU member states to identify workable solutions in an increasingly challenging environment.  As the committee acknowledged in its report, this is a long-term strategy.  However, it is one we expect will complement existing domestic policy in this area.</p><p> While the Department has not undertaken a formal review of the Act in its entirety, it has, in conjunction with the HSE and the NCPE, considered in detail the committee's report and the recommendations contained therein.  There has been substantial engagement between the Department, the HSE and the NCPE on each of the recommendations.  I am pleased to note, as well as the policy developments I have outlined, that a number of significant changes have been made within the confines of the Act at operational level in the assessment and reimbursement process to address a number of the recommendations made in the report.  </p><p> I will hand over to my colleagues from the HSE and the NCPE to elaborate on the operational developments.</p></speech>

As Mr. Judge said, I am joined by my colleagues, Professor Michael Barry, Mr. Shaun Flanagan and Mr. Ray Mitchell from our parliamentary affairs unit.  Our preparations focused on the committee's report of February 2018 and the measures taken or under way to address the recommendations contained in it.  Mr. Judge has covered the main policy and legislative elements.  I will focus on the operational aspects.</p> <p>  On recommendation No. 4, I confirm that discussions have commenced with the pharmaceutical sector to provide clarity on pricing and measures to speed up the negotiating process.  The discussions have also explored the issues of risk sharing and post-approval review to ensure ongoing expenditure is justified by evidence of clinical effectiveness.  </p> <p>  On recommendations Nos. 6 and 7, there is already a high degree of communication between the HSE and the pharmaceutical sector, as well as, of course, with patient advocacy groups.  However, steps have been taken to strengthen this engagement through the provision of additional resources at both NCPE level and within the corporate pharmaceutical unit.  This is intended to enable representations to be considered at both the HTA and negotiation stages.  There is also routine engagement with the pharmaceutical industry, while the composition of the drugs group has been expanded to include patient representatives and more clinical expertise in the area of rare diseases.  Enhancements have also been made regarding medicines for older persons and medical ethics.</p> <p>  The HSE has written to hospital groups setting out the importance of having a clear understanding and informed consent arrangements in place prior to the commencement of clinical trials and compassionate access programmes.  The establishment of a specific budget for high technology and orphan drugs is also being examined.  This was also a recommendation made in the report.  To a large extent, it is already something we have in place in that high technology and orphan drugs are, by and large, funded centrally, rather than from individual hospital budgets.</p><p>The measures now under way to strengthen the representation of rare diseases in the assessment process and to involve patient representation and medical ethics should also refine the process of assessing medicines in the manner intended and recommended by the committee.  The issues highlighted in recommendation No. 10 are being pursued further with the HRB, which appears to be the most obvious route to influence research in collaboration with the university sector.  With regard to recommendation No. 12, the HSE has established a national rare disease technology review committee.  The role of the committee is to enable clinicians and other stakeholders to input into the assessment process and in the post-health technology assessment phase to review proposals, prescribing guidelines etc. for consideration by the drugs group.  This is designed to operate similarly to the National Cancer Control Programme therapeutic review committee, which has been operating successfully.  Such guidelines will, where appropriate, include recommendations relating to the prescribers who should be enabled to access orphan medicines.  I will ask my colleague, Professor Barry, to elaborate on the work of this group.  A model of care has also been prepared by the HSE&rsquo;s clinical programme for rare diseases, which aims to improve access to care for patients with rare conditions and improve value and quality in this area.<br/><br/>As the process for evaluating applications was covered in detail at our meetings with the committee in 2017, I will not repeat this other than to emphasise again that the criteria for assessment are as detailed by the legislation, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, and as set out specifically in section 19(4) of the Act.  The important point to bear in mind is that the legislation requires the HSE to have regard to the cost-effectiveness and the clinical benefits of the product being applied for.  The particular features that relate to orphan conditions are obviously considered during the assessment process and factors such as clinical effectiveness and the number of potential patients affected are clearly set out in the reports compiled.  As members are aware, the HSE currently spends in excess of &euro;2 billion per year on drugs and medicines, and on a <i>per capita</i>basis the Irish health service continues to be one of the highest spenders on medicines in the OECD area, with expenditure still increasing annually.  I will now hand over to Professor Barry for further detail on the rare diseases technology review group.</p></speech>

With regard to access to medicines and technologies for people with rare diseases, recommendation No. 30 on page 54 from the National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland 2014-2018 suggested the establishment of an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the national cancer control programme.  The HSE has implemented this recommendation in setting up the rare diseases technology review committee, RDTRC.  The aim of the committee is to facilitate the incorporation of the patient and clinician perspectives into an agreed statement, which will be presented to the HSE drugs group to aid the group's reimbursement recommendations.  It is important to remember the rare diseases technology review committee, is not a voting or decision-making forum but it merely provides advice to the drugs group.</p> <p>  I was asked by the HSE to help establish and to chair the rare diseases technology review committee and I was very happy to take on that task.  Membership of the committee includes the chair, the clinical lead for the HSE rare diseases programme, five consultant physicians with expertise in rare diseases, two pharmacists, one health technology assessor, one representative from the Health Information and Quality Authority and two patient representatives.  It is a total of 13 members.  The first meeting of the committee was held on 15 October 2018 and a second meeting was held on 8 November 2018.  Meetings were also held with patient representatives on 8 November and 30 October.  We also held a meeting with the manufacturer of nusinersen on 30 October 2018.</p></speech>

I just wanted to give the committee a flavour of what is going on.  There were five meetings in 24 days and it is testimony to the significant work done by committee members, who do such work on their own time and in an unpaid capacity.</p> <p>  The committee has focused on two medicines to date, which are sapropterin or Kuvan for phenylketonuria, and nusinersen or Spinraza for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, SMA.  As an example, the committee recommended to the HSE drugs group that access to sapropterin be considered under a managed access programme.  In other words it would occur where clinical criteria were laid down for starting and stopping the medication if it was not working.  It was taken by the HSE drugs group, which made a positive recommendation with regard to Kuvan, which is good news.  The funding issue must be decided on by leadership.  Currently we are preparing a rare diseases technology review committee recommendation for nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy and we hope to submit it to the drugs group shortly.  That is a flavour of how the new committee is working.</p></speech>

It is very much appreciated.  I thank them for all the work they do and this is clearly a very sensitive and important area.  I have various process questions as to how things are being improved.  I will first ask about both Spinraza and Translarna.  With Translarna, an application was received in September and yesterday we got a letter saying the application is now reaching the concluding stages and will be tabled for discussion at the December HSE leadership meeting.  Mr. Hennessy said he would revert on the matter.  I thank him for that.  This does not affect a large number of children but for those who are waiting, time is critical.  When is it expected to have a decision one way or another?  For those parents and the children, is the decision we are awaiting a therapeutic and clinical decision or is it a funding decision?  Is it both?</p></speech>

I would expect the decision to be immediate after the December meeting but there are affordability issues currently being dealt with as part of the service plan preparation for 2019.  There are aspects of that still outstanding.  The service plan will also be concluded by then, I hope, and it should clear up matters relating to affordability.</p></speech>

The Spinraza process has been ongoing for some time.  In May 2017 it was approved by the European Medicines Agency and an application was received in October last year.  In December last year we were told the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, completed its health technology assessment and said "No" at the current price.  My understanding is we have a "Yes" on the impact of the drug at a clinical level but a "No" on the price based on the analysis of the NCPE.  Responses to parliamentary questions from October - we are getting the same response now - was that it is now with the rare diseases review committee, the HSE drugs group and the HSE leadership.  I have the same question as earlier, as a number of men, women and children are desperately waiting for an answer and hoping for a positive reply on this.  When will they expect to hear either way from all the different groups?  If it is a "Yes", when can they expect access to the drug?</p><p>The rare diseases technology review committee first met on 15 October, when it was high on our agenda.  We met again on 8 November.  We also met patients and families, who presented well to the group and demonstrated what living with SMA is like.  The committee is putting together a report which will be sent to the drugs group within weeks and it will outline how one might decide on the prescribing areas, who would be prescribed for, what the criteria to start prescribing nusinersen would be and whether there would be criteria to discontinue it if it did not work, as some of the trials show that up to 50% of people will not respond.  That is the kind of document that is being prepared.   I anticipate that a draft will be sent to the drugs group in the next two or three weeks, and that is the task of the rare diseases committee.</p><p> Mr. Flanagan might comment further on the drugs group.  I imagine it will be taken into consideration before the end of the year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.537" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shaun Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018112100002#R00300"><p>The question the Deputy is asking about Spinraza is not one on which we can give a time limit or make any guarantee.  Our responsibility while appearing before the committee is to give honest testimony.  As context, the drugs group has reviewed Spinraza on five separate occasions to date and has not been able to accept it at the proposed cost, which is a commercially improved offer from that which was originally approved.  I am not a member of the group but rather a secretary, and I am non-voting.  As I am involved in the commercial negotiations, it is clear it is better to separate me from the vote.  It is hard to put a time limit on it because the difference is that Translarna has gone past the drugs group and is under consideration by the senior leadership team.  There is a step where the drugs group must make a deliberation, and that drugs group has a responsibility under the Act to give HSE advice but it has not yet given that advice and I cannot guarantee it will be positive, although I would not say it will be negative either.  We cannot make a comment on it.  The Deputy is asking us to make a guarantee on something that is in an ongoing process.</p></speech>

I hope the HSE can negotiate a price where it is approved, and we all hope that happens soon.  As we are all acutely aware, because we are all trying to achieve the same thing, SMA is a degenerative disease and every week and month matters.  I am cognisant that the NCPE refused the price that was offered 11 months ago.  Some 11 months have passed, therefore, and representatives from the HSE are before the committee.  While I accept that Mr. Flanagan cannot give any guarantees, it has been 11 months since the NCPE refused the price and it is not acceptable that he would say he cannot even give a broad timeline.</p></speech>

The commercial negotiations have finished and, to the best of our knowledge, the company has made it clear it has made its best offer and it will not move any further.  The drugs group has considered the drug.  In committee meetings like this, it is difficult to explain the complexity.  There is not one decision to be made but rather three separate decisions: SMA type 1, SMA type 2 and SMA type 3.  There is considerable variation in the level of evidence for each of those.  As has been communicated, the drugs group strongly want access for type 1 on the basis of the evidence, which is robust.  It made an offer to Biogen but the offer was not acceptable.  Biogen made a counter offer to the State but that offer for type 1 has not been acceptable to date.  On type 2 and type 3, it is a far more challenging issue because the evidence is far less robust.</p></speech>

If we assume the best and final offer was made by the pharmaceutical company, although that can change, can the HSE not give the parents a broad outline?  It sounds as though the negotiations have concluded and it is now a question for the State.  Surely we should then be able to indicate how long the State will take to make these decisions.</p></speech>

We can assume that the rare diseases technology review committee will provide a report relatively imminently, and there is a drugs group meeting in December which already has five items on the agenda because multiple medicines are going through the process, including multiple orphan drugs.  In the past 12 weeks, for example, there were three meetings of the drugs group and 18 drugs were assessed and reviewed at the meetings, which means that we can process approximately six per meeting.  At the moment, there are four items on the agenda.  If it can be put on that agenda, it will be dealt with on that agenda but there are steps in the process and we have multiple other drugs and patients who also deserve responsibility.</p> <p>  To give context for the challenges the State faces, in 2018 to date the drugs group has made positive recommendations for medicines that will cost the State &euro;300 million over the next five years.  A significant amount of money, therefore, is flushing through in positive recommendations through that process.  It is a very challenging position for the State to have to try to fund, and many orphan drugs with positive recommendations are included in that.  From an evidence point of view, notwithstanding that SMA is an horrific disease and everyone recognises the unmet need of the patients, not least the type 1 patients, it is very challenging due to the lack of evidence evidence and maintaining cost effectiveness, even at the commercial offer.  </p> <p>  It is public money and I would love to be able to put what the offer is into the public domain, but I am constrained by the company's constraints.</p></speech>

Professor Barry made a point, on which I fully agree with him, that the State should pay on an outcomes basis for orphan drugs.  If there is a drug, be it Spinraza or something else, which works on, say, one in five people, and if it is not cost effective to provide ongoing treatments for all five, we can identify and pay for the one for whom it works while stopping the treatment for those for whom it does not work, although that is not always easy and it can be politically and administratively difficult but it must be done.  I have put Professor Barry's point to several of the bigger pharmaceutical companies which provide some of these fantastic drugs and they were positive.</p><p>They said they want to do it as well and they gave me examples of other countries in which they are doing this.  The impression I got was that pharmacoeconomics here is not up for it.  I am not suggesting that is what I was told, rather it is what I had assumed.  However, what they said is that the problem in Ireland is that we do not have the necessary IT systems in place to track the patients and, therefore, be able to do this.  Is that the witnesses's understanding?  Is the barrier to the payment by outcomes, which hopefully would allow for more of these wonderful drugs, that we do not have in place the IT systems to do it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.559" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Michael Barry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018112100002#S00200"><p>What the Deputy is referring to is what we call managed access programmes with specific starting and finishing criteria, or stopping criteria if the system is not working.  I do not think there are IT barriers to it.  For example, in the case of Nusinersen we are not talking about a lot of patients so it should be relatively easy to track patients and their outcomes.  The focus on managed access programmes came on stream with the rare diseases technology review committee, the focus of which is not on cost effectiveness or money but clinical outcomes from the point of view of patients and patient representatives.  It is a question of the system focusing on managed access programmes.  I think they can be delivered but I take the Deputy's point that for the conditions in respect of which the patient numbers are larger there would be a challenge.  For the conditions about which we are speaking, the patient numbers are not large and it should be eminently possible to do it.  The idea of a managed access programme is that we know from the trials that, say, 50% of patients may not respond to the drug.  I do not think anybody wants to be funding expensive drugs like Spinraza at a cost of &euro;500,000 in the first year and &euro;250,000 per patient in the second year.  It is about trying to do the best we can and to ensure that people who respond to the drugs get them.</p></speech>

The witnesses may disagree but it has been put to me by patients, patient advocacy groups, clinicians and the pharmaceutical companies that relative to other EU countries Ireland is very slow in getting the drugs to market.  For example, in the case of Translarna, 22 other countries-----</p></speech>

It has been put to me by a number of people that Ireland is slower than other countries at getting drugs to the market, for whatever reason.  What is being put to me, fairly or unfairly, is that the NCPE moves pretty quickly and is transparent in what it does - whether one agrees or not with the full process that is what happens - and that the EMA at a European level is pretty good and is tipping along but when it comes to the Department of Health and the HSE the process slows.  I am not making that allegation.  It has been represented to me by numerous groups that at Department of Health and HSE level the process becomes opaque and there is not the level of interaction that people are looking for.  Is it fair or accurate that the process slows once it reaches Ireland and, if so, what three actions can we take to make it more transparent and quicker?</p></speech>

As I said in my opening statement, statutory responsibility for decision making in terms of reimbursement rests solely with the HSE.  The Department is out of loop in terms of the decision making process.</p> <p>  On the substantive issue of the perceived delay in Ireland, there are various lists of where Ireland sits in regard to other European countries.  We have no idea how these lists are put together and what is regarded as reimbursement in one country in comparison with another.  Over the last number of years a lot of medicines have been reimbursed.  Practically none has been refused.  </p></speech>

There is clearly a funding challenge for every country around the globe.  Many countries are trying to get into multilateral type arrangements, whether BeNeLuxA or Valletta, such that Ireland is not the only country struggling in that regard.  I would not argue that we are slower than other countries.  In my view, the challenge is around the availability of sufficient resources and trying to match the resources we have with the demand.</p></speech>

The NCPE and the pharmaceutical unit did have a challenge around human resources but that is no longer an excuse as over the last 18 months the HSE has given us substantial resources.  I will give a practical example, which might better explain the delay.  Commercial negotiations can take a long time.  It can be hard to get a company to the point of an offer that will be acceptable to the State.  The system is broken internationally from a pricing point of view in that we have a system whereby companies come with lists prices of, say, &euro;100, and they get involved with one country in non-transparent negotiations and reduce the price to, say, &euro;90; they then move on to the next country for which they reduce the price to &euro;80 and then for a third country they reduce it to &euro;70.  If Ireland is the first country it pays &euro;100.  It is unfortunate but true that the further down the line a country is, the better the offer it gets.  It is not possible for me to put particular information into the public domain but I will try to illustrate what happens in the case of a non-orphan drug.  The drug Pablociclib - Ibrance - is used to treat breast cancer.  It was approved by the EMA in 2016.  At the time of the pricing and reimbursement application the company in question applied for a price of &euro;3,800 per pack.  This would have resulted in a budget impact of &euro;66 million.  This was in commercial negotiation for over a year.  Eventually, a pricing decision was made in a different country.  The price offering given to us at that point was &euro;2,190 per pack.  Within three months the HSE had completed all processes and had reimbursed it.  The net difference is &euro;28 million over five years.  If we go early, we pay more which means we can reimburse fewer drugs.  The challenge is getting the balance right in terms of the right amount to be spend at a premium over other prices versus fighting as hard as we can for reduced prices.</p></speech>

We respect and appreciate the job the witnesses do and we acknowledge that very often they are portrayed as the bad guys but sometimes they do not help their own cause.  Patients come to us because they want to know the status of their approvals.  They should not have to contact their local public representatives to get that information.  It should be readily available to them but clearly it is not because if it was patients would not be making representations to us.  Patients are awaiting the approval of drugs that they believe will be effective for them but are unable to find out the status of the approval of those drugs.</p><p>What I am hearing from the Department of Health is that it is out of the loop with regard to the process.  I understand there are various meetings and so on.  Is it possible to bring transparency to this while respecting commercial sensitivity?  I fully appreciate that the Department must uphold commercial sensitivity.  Is it possible to put in place a system that keeps the families informed?  Everyone seems to be waiting.  The clock is ticking and people are told another meeting will take place.  Yet, the Department does not know if the matter will get onto the agenda of the meeting.  If it does, the Department does not know what is to happen at the next meeting.  It seems that no matter who I talk to, that person is never the person who is responsible.  It seems it is always a matter for another person.</p><p> I found it curious for Mr. Judge to say that the Department was out of the loop with regard to the process.  I would have thought the Department would have been central to or involved more in the process.  Do the officials have any suggestions on how we might be able to improve transparency?</p><p> I will bank the questions.  It will be easier in terms of time and I know others wish to come in.  Has the rare disease technology review group published a work programme?  If so, I have not seen it.  If there is a work programme, perhaps it can be shared with us.  If there is none I would be a little concerned.</p><p> The question of reviews and expected timelines is relevant.  We know that we are not dealing with things that necessarily move in a straight line but the possibility of expected timelines and sharing that information is important.</p><p> The patient and clinical engagement system in Scotland is a relevant model.  Scotland has a similar population size, profile and so on in terms of health.  It seems there are far fewer problems in Scotland and the system it has appears to work.  Has consideration been given to replicating the best aspects of what they are doing in Scotland?  It appears to be working.  Central to the system there is the involvement of the patients.  That is important.</p><p> Will the officials give us an update on or idea of what progress, if any, has been made on the BeNeLuxA group?  I apologise if the question was already asked - I may have missed it.</p><p> There are problems at the moment relating to clinician and patient input into any new assessment programme.  Will this take place before or after the health technology assessment will be completed?  I am referring to the opportunity for clinicians and patients to have input.  I am trying to understand how it works with the various committees.  The officials will know this better than I do but the problem with the HTA and orphan drugs is the low level of information available.  Often families say to us that they cannot satisfy the necessary numbers &ndash; they simply do not have them.  Some assessments may set the bar higher in terms of numbers but if they are not there, they are simply not there.  Often that leads people to believe they are excluded from the process and it seems to them as if they are not being listened to.  That is why they come back through their local representatives.</p><p> Both clinicians and patients are involved in the health technology assessment.  Is there an opportunity at that point for patients to have an input and influence over the process so that they will be there and will be able to discuss their experience?  Often we are not dealing with big groups and we do not have a large population from which to gather the information.  It seems sometimes that the information is not gathered from the people who are there because there are not enough of them.</p></speech>

The recommendations of the drugs group come to the leadership team.  The deliberations of the HSE as a public body are available as well.  The items on the agenda are public knowledge and the decisions taken at those meetings are publicly available and reported on the HSE website.  If there are ways to put more transparency around it, we would be happy to explore those and deliberate on them.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly's point goes to the issue of delay or the perception of delay.  There is no deliberate slowing down or delay factor coming through the process at our end.  What we see and hear about is access in different jurisdictions but, as Mr. Flanagan mentioned, access can mean different things from one jurisdiction to another and it is not always easily comparable.</p> <p>  We aim for a two-fold agenda.  We want to ensure access to medicines for Irish patients and to ensure as much value as we can get throughout the process.  We have been exploring ways to speed up the processing with the pharmaceutical sector.  Those discussions are productive and proactive in fairness to the industry.  We have ongoing discussions on the matter.  We have put additional resourcing into the process so that we can handle the additional numbers of applications coming through now for reimbursement.  It is a two-way process.  Getting to the final price is one of the issues we tend to struggle with in dealing with the pharmaceutical sector.  We are trying to resolve that as well.  Mr. Flanagan mentioned that the list price and the final price can often differ substantially.  It is important we get access to drugs.  It is also important that we can get value and demonstrate that as well.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly asked about the rare diseases review group and publishing the work programme.  I will ask Professor Barry to speak to that point.  Deputy O'Reilly also asked about the Scottish experience.  We have been examining that closely and we see opportunities there.  Some of the steps that have been taken so far this year in response to the committee report are modelled on the Scottish model of transparency and patient involvement.  We hope to go further on that as well.  Mr. Judge will talk about the BeNeLuxA question and I will bring in Professor Barry on the health technology assessment and patient involvement aspect.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Reilly referred to the Department being out of the loop.  That was a decision taken by the Oireachtas when it passed the 2013 Act.  The idea was that responsibility would be solely vested in the HSE.  The Minister has no role in the final decision-making process.  That is contained in statute in the 2013 Act.</p> <p>  There was a question about BeNeLuxA.  As committee members probably know, the whole concept of regional collaboration is in its infancy.  There are a few regional collaboration groups across Europe.  We signed up to BeNeLuxA in June of this year.  The BeNeLuxA grouping envisages collaboration in four domains.  The idea is to collaborate around information exchange, HTA, horizon scanning and joint price negotiations.  At this point our involvement is in its early stages, as committee members will appreciate.  The win so far for us is really around information exchange.  In fact, some of my colleagues today are at a meeting in Vienna on BeNeLuxA.  We are merely getting into the process at this stage.</p><p>We intend to work on the other domains as the initiative develops.</p></speech>

We have made many developments in regard to patient involvement with the health technology assessment, HTA, process.  There is a patient area on the website through which one can get a summary of the process and submit online.  There is also information in regard to interpreting our recommendations and a plain English explanation of them. We hold educational sessions with groups such as the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry, IPPOSI.  We are quite active in the area of patient engagement.  Using the website, people email us on a regular basis with all sorts of questions which we are very happy to answer within 24 hours.</p> <p>  On the rare diseases technology review committee, Deputy O'Reilly mentioned Scotland.  I agree that the Scottish system is a good model, but &pound;1 million sterling was invested in it.  We can improve things.  We have been up and running for less than two months, so it is early days, but I would like to think that patient groups and representatives are seeing how this group will make a difference.  I agree that it would be nice to have our publications and timelines on the website as well.  We do not currently have a website.  It would be nice to have that in order that people would know the stage at which a particular drug is and what are our recommendations.  That is a great suggestion and certainly something that we should consider.</p> <p>  Are there any other points to be addressed?</p></speech>

For example, we met children with spinal muscular atrophy and their families in regard to Spinraza.  They made a very detailed presentation involving videos of what it is like to live with spinal muscular atrophy.  Particularly in regard to drugs for rare diseases, the new rare diseases committee considers that dimension which had not previously been looked at in such detail.  That is a positive development.</p></speech>

Do they accept that notwithstanding the work that has been done to bring families into the process to some degree, the families are still experiencing difficulty with the process and their level of involvement in it?  I am not saying that the people in this room do not work hard; I fully appreciate that they do.  However, do they think the system is okay and working in spite of the views of patients and their families that it is not working?  The problems do not solely involve access, but also that the process is not working for patients and they feel left outside it.  Do the witnesses accept that improvements must be made and that there is work to be done?  If they do not, I would be concerned.</p></speech>

The establishment of the rare diseases committee speaks to and acknowledges that.  I was struck by the fact that in our first meeting with patient representatives they wanted basic information on how the system works.  When one works in the system, one takes such knowledge for granted.  The meeting was very helpful and we spent quite a lot of time explaining how the system works.  They came back a week later to present on their particular area, namely, spinal muscular atrophy.  The Deputy is correct that we need to engage in more such work and we will do so.</p></speech>

However, measures have been taken to address that, such as the expansion of the membership of the drugs group and the formal inclusion of patient representation on the group referred to by Professor Barry.  Those are genuine attempts to address that issue.  Ultimately, whether people experience a problem with the process probably relies more on the outcome of the process than the process itself.  However, if there are further steps that we can take, such as the development of websites and greater transparency, we would be happy to explore those.</p></speech>

My team enters every commercial negotiation in the hope of being able to get something over the line.  We could improve the processes.  The challenge around transparency is underestimated because it is impossible to understand the decision making unless one knows the pricing.  The problem is the lack of transparency in pricing in the industry.  It is impossible to give a coherent explanation of how a negative decision is made.  My experience is that people who have significant challenges with the process often go away when the decision is "Yes".  The key challenge is for the State to get access to as many medicines as it can.  That is what will solve this issue.  Even the fabulous Scottish patient and clinician engagement, PACE, system is experiencing a significant ongoing problem in regard to not having funded Orkambi.  Members may think there is silence around that, but there is not.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped that will happen in the next Government.  Mr. Judge stated that the Minister cannot get involved in drug reimbursement decisions.  If that is so, what happened in the case of Orkambi?  Did the Minister become involved contrary to the Act referred to by Mr. Judge or did he have no involvement?  Is there a clause in the deal with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, whereby drug cases may be referred to the Department in certain instances?</p><p>There was a case in Crumlin last week, and we heard earlier from the witnesses that genetic services in this country, which are intertwined with decision-making, are simply not up to the standard required.  Is this accurate?  I have spoken to people in the HSE who have said they have been trying to employ people for a number of years.  The case last week has caused alarm.  Is it the case that genetic services are not up to the standard required?  That is my second question to Mr. Judge.</p><p> My next questions are probably a mix for the other three witnesses.  The first concerns affordability, which is an issue in the case of orphan drugs.  What is the HSE's position on biosimilars and biosimilar penetration?  What are the expected savings in this regard for 2019?  I presume that with the budget and projections, the HSE must put in something.</p><p> Fourth, what is the typical weighting price for tenders on drugs?  How do we compare with other countries, such as Germany and the UK?  I understand that in many cases the weighting they have on price in their tenders could be up to 80% while we are generally very low at 25%.  Are we not losing money as a result of this?</p><p> My last question concerns pembrolizumab, the drug Vicky Phelan is on.  I do not expect any of the four witnesses to criticise Government policy, but has any of them ever seen a similar case in which a decision was made to give a drug such as this, which is off licence, free of charge to one cohort of women or men outside of the normal Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, procedure, which is to go two years?  Would this be in any way normal?  How can it be that &Aacute;ine Morgan in Loughrea - this is all in the public domain, by the way - is fundraising to go on pembrolizumab?  Ms Morgan has cervical cancer but is not one of the 221 women, yet Vicky Phelan, to whom I have spoken in depth about this and who is one of the 221 women, is getting the drug for free from the State.  One cohort is getting it for free.  Women in another cohort must get a clinician to say they need it, but they do not get it for free.  The drug costs &euro;8,500 every three weeks.</p><p> I put the following questions to each and every one of the witnesses.  Do they believe this is equitable and fair or discriminatory?  Do they believe it is legal?  I certainly have issues with it.  I cannot in any way justify how one can distinguish between two women who have cervical cancer such that one gets a treatment free of charge because of a decision made at Government level and another does not.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on this.  I am aware this drug is used to treat other conditions and other cancers but I want to know specifically how within our drug administration policy this is equitable or fair.  Have the witnesses ever seen this done before?  I have spoken to many of their colleagues from different walks of life and there is deep unease in the HSE and other parts of the health service about this.  Something will have to be done about it.</p><p> There are five questions to be answered.</p></speech>

What happens in the case of Orkambi is that the HSE operates within the scope of its service plan for drug applications for reimbursement brought before it.  If we can provide within the scope of our service plan for the applications that present, that is where the decision begins and ends.  If an application comes before the HSE that goes beyond our scope and capacity in the service plan, there is a route, as the Deputy said, to escalate the matter to the Department and the Minister.</p></speech>

There is a lot of information available on both, but on biosimilars in particular.</p> <p>  To respond to the question the Deputy raised about weighting and drug tenders, outside of the normal reimbursement process I am not aware of too many drugs in respect of which we embark on a tendering process with a competitive supplier.  I am aware of one or two but I will have to check further the weighting of the price within that.  The Deputy has indicated it is 25% here as opposed to 80% elsewhere.</p></speech>

The one case of which I have recent experience is the hepatitis C tender.  Clearly, before one goes into any tender, one must figure out the criteria.  If the drugs are very alike, it will be almost entirely price, but if the drugs have significant variations there will be more for the other advantages in terms of convenience, perhaps, or whatever else.  I can tell the Deputy that the hepatitis C tender was almost substantially based on price, and that delivered about-----</p></speech>

It is very rare but it does occur from time to time.  Usually, it involves life-threatening situations.  Most systems and processes would contain the capacity to respond in a life-threatening situation.  The process, which has developed and evolved over a considerable time, is designed to ensure that all the checks and balances that are required are dealt with.  As I said, though, situations can arise from time to time when an emergency response is required.</p></speech>

What Mr. Hennessy has just said is of no comfort.  This is going to explode in everyone's face.  The witnesses all know what I am talking about.  One cannot discriminate between two people on the basis that one got cancer at one point and another got cancer a year later.

It did not come through a reimbursement process.  A standard reimbursement process involves, at the start, the EMA reviewing a medicine for a particular use to decide if the quality, safety and efficacy is appropriate to support market authorisation.  After that, we have an assessment process regarding cost-----</p></speech>

In other cases, it may not help but all of these women will do anything they can, regardless of whether they are in the cohort of 221, to get a chance at life.  The drug is made in Ireland.  How can we collectively justify the fact that it is outside the process outlined by Mr. Flanagan?  I agree with him and yet we have a decision to give it free to some women who are part of the cohort of 221 .  No one can stand over that; it is impossible to justify.  We cannot distinguish between a lady in Loughrea who is crowd-funding in an effort to raise money to get this drug and to get a chance at life and those in the cohort of 221.

That is the situation that pertains.  On the role of the Minister in the context of the reimbursement process, the Deputy is correct that there is a clause in the IPHA agreement whereby if it has been identified that a medicine cannot be funded within existing resources, the HSE may inform the Department and, obviously, it gets into the Department and is brought to the attention of the Minister at that stage.  The Minister may decide, if he or she wishes, to bring a memorandum to Government on that funding challenge in respect of a particular product.</p></speech>

Professor Barry has been very open and honest about the issue.  He believes that everything should go through the same process and, in fairness, Mr. Flanagan made exactly the same point.  We have a situation whereby a Minister can intervene and that is something we must consider further.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Hennessy.

Would I prefer that the process would operate in the manner in which it is designed?  Yes, I would.  Of course, the process is designed to deal with all of the checks and balances that are necessary regarding medicines but everybody also appreciates that emergency situations arise from time to time and the system has to be able to respond and react to that too.

There were five meetings within 24 days, most of them focusing on Spinraza or nusinersen.  We are now at the stage where a document is being prepared which I understand will be including starting and stopping criteria prepared in conjunction with clinicians and also having listened to patients and their relatives.  Our task then is to get this recommendation document to the HSE drugs group so that it is not just cost effectiveness that is considered but also the other aspects.  The committee, in fairness, has done a lot of work in a short time and we are mindful of the time issue here.

The committee is really focusing in on orphan drugs, and drugs for rare and ultra-rare diseases.  Having had two previous meetings with this group, the committee recommended that the 2013 Act should be reviewed.  That was a recommendation of this committee.</p><p> In a debate in the D&aacute;il on the drug Ocrevus, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis, MS, the Minister stated that if people in this House think that the current system is broken, we could start hearing what people want to replace it with.  He stated on the record of the D&aacute;il that also he thinks it is broken and that the conundrum is how to come up with a better model.  I add to that the fact that, in 2017, of the 148 medicines that were designated orphan and subsequently received marketing authorisation by the EMA, 53 are available in Ireland, which equates to 35.8%.  That is very much on the lower side compared to Germany, which has 133 of the 148 approved.  We are right down on the lower side of things.  We have an issue around reimbursement on orphan drugs.  Earlier, Mr. Judge stated, "The Act provides for a fair, transparent and rigorous process of assessment [and] the Minister is satisfied that there are no legislative barriers to the reimbursement of orphan drugs."  What has changed?</p></speech>

The Minister has stood over the robustness of that Act on numerous occasions.  Since the committee's report calling for a review of the entire Act was published, and because the Act contains so many different provisions, we have concentrated on addressing the recommendations regarding the reimbursement process because it was that element of the Act the committee focused on in its report.  Obviously, if, down the line, the Minister decides that there should be a review of the 2013 Act, it is in his gift to decide to bring forward proposals on that Act.  I am letting the committee know that, since the publication of its report, we have, with the NCPE, been concentrating on what were essentially process issues which the committee pointed out in its report.  As my colleagues have said today, the HSE has done a lot in terms of the process to address any barriers that the committee pointed out in its report, or any areas where orphan drugs may have a problem in the process.  I think the big development is Professor Barry's new committee which, more or less, adds another layer to the process because of the special situation around orphan drugs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.657" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1321" speakername="John Brassil" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018112100002#X00300"><p>I want to put on record that I disagree with Mr. Judge's opening statement and the Minister quite clearly disagrees as well.  He says there are no legislative barriers to the reimbursement of orphan drugs.  I ask why then would the Minister make the statement he thinks the system is broken too?  They are two directly opposing views from the same Department.</p> <p>  Moving on to trying to get the best value, Mr. Flanagan gave a very good example of getting in there and batting and waiting for a particular drug that went from &euro;3,800 per unit to &euro;2,100 per unit.  I have pointed out, on numerous occasions since I was elected, that there are potential savings of multiple millions in biosimilar products.  The IPU has done a report which outlines savings of &euro;320 million over three years.  The HSE is anxious to hold out for the best price, and I agree with that approach on orphan drugs.  Why is the HSE not banging down the door for the savings it can achieve in the context of biosimilars?</p></speech>

I am quite happy to put on the record that we absolutely need biosimilars.  Deputy Brassil is a pharmacist, as am I.  We both know they are not substitutable.  We both know they actually have to be prescribed by physicians as the biosimilar, as opposed to as the biologic.  Professor Barry's team is working very hard to get what is called a best-value biosimilar document out for early in the new year to try and drive biosimilar uptake.  I am quite happy to put on the record and avail of any publicity we might get out of today to say that we need the support of gastroenterologists, dermatologists and rheumatologists to write biosimilar prescriptions.  They are less expensive to us and will deliver savings, but we need them to engage with their patient groups and get the patients to accept that a biosimilar will be used.</p></speech>

They were set out in legislation as being substitutable.  The HPRA was given the power to designate them as interchangeable.  That power is not available to us and Deputy Brassil and I both know that.</p></speech>

I dispense products every month.  I refer, for example, to Humira and Enbrel.  I am aware of the biosimilars available at significantly less cost and I have yet to see a prescription for one.</p></speech>

There are savings out there and we are not availing of them.</p></speech>

Professor Barry's team is working, as we speak, on a best-value biosimilar paper to try to deliver that.  That is out to public consultation, is it not, Professor Barry?</p></speech>

That is an area where we can make substantial savings and, in the medicines management programme, we have taken this on.  Consultation finished on Friday last.  The anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs which the Deputy mentioned account for approximately &euro;250 million.  Adalimumab, or Humira, and etanercept, or Enbrel, are the two leadings ones and are not far off &euro;200 million.  We will publish what, in our view, is the best biologic value of choice for the health service in this country.  We hope to do that in early 2019.  That will afford the HSE the opportunity then to highlight that this is the best value product and we should be using it.</p> <p>  I agree with what Mr. Flanagan is saying, that it is down to prescribers as well, but we will be issuing that guidance very early in 2019.  I agree that there are lots of potential savings.  It is about creating space in order that we can afford the other drugs that we are discussing.</p></speech>

I would love to see a budget for orphan drugs.  I have asked, again on several occasions, for a specific breakdown and I keep getting the reply that there is nothing in the Act to differentiate orphan drugs from any other drug.  That needs to be changed.  That is why I have submitted a Bill to change the legislative position in order to allow for orphan drugs to be treated separately.  If they were treated separately and there was a separate budget for them, then the savings that were made on one side could be looked at towards providing on the other.</p> <p>  With my last contribution, I want the witnesses to look at the Swedish model.  They, ironically, have the same proportion of health expenditure and medical goods as we do, yet they use a qualitative analysis in their orphan drugs reimbursement but do not set a threshold.  They take the types of things we have been talking about - patient advocacy, human value and cost-effectiveness - over a very small patient group.</p><p>When one is looking for data, particularly for an ultra-rare disease, it is almost impossible to get because there might only be half a dozen patients and the type of assessment that is being undertaken will not facilitate this.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.668" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Michael Barry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018112100002#Y00200"><p>I get the Deputy's point.  We are aware that none of the drugs for rare diseases will reach the &euro;45,000 per QALY.  However, the assessment process is valuable in that it highlights the issues, areas and clinical evidence and the pricing issue.  What price would be necessary to get to a better place?  Mr. Flanagan uses the results of our assessments to enable a better deal to be secured on these.  The fact that it underwent assessment provides the HSE with a lot more information on it rather than simply reimbursing it straight-up.</p> <p>  The new committee speaks to the additional aspect of this such as unmet clinical need and physicians' and patients' viewpoints which is valuable.  Drugs for rare diseases are reimbursed, such as Orkambi.  There is no way that Orkambi would ever reach &euro;45,000 per QALY yet it is reimbursed nonetheless.  The HSE can use the reports to try to improve the offer on the table but the &euro;45,000 per QALY threshold is not an absolute and is not used in that way.</p></speech>

Vertex are now looking to have the HSE model replicated in other countries, including Sweden, because they regard it as a good model, which has been successful and delivered value for money.  It has been agreed that down the line, iterations of Orkambi will become available.  However, was that a result of the unending political pressure and the demonstrations that went with it or the HSE process?  I suspect it is a combination of the two but not every group has the support of the people in such as with Orkambi.  We are dealing with five or eight families who do not have that political clout or do not have the ability to protest.  I would like them to get the same treatment without the controversy.</p></speech>

We never believed that Orkambi was value for money, nor do we believe that now.  Our position is unchanged.  However, there is a real world out there, so negotiations take place and the drug is made available.  That is how our reports are used.  We do the best we can and Mr. Flanagan and his group do their best in negotiations and get drugs available.</p></speech>

The agreement in place between the State and the pharmaceutical industry provides for value on the launch of the biosimilar.  Regardless of what is prescribed after the launch of the biosimilar, we get the discount.</p></speech>

However, the success in the area of generics was due to the enabling legislation that allowed substitution, which is not there for biosimilars.  That relies on prescriber behaviour, which is an influencing factor rather than a directing matter.  It would be interesting to have legislation on that to enable it to happen more quickly but altering prescribing behaviour is a slow process.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy about biosimilars.  There are schemes and hospitals.  There is a large poster promoting biosimilar uptake in the outpatients department of St. Vincent's hospital.  Work is ongoing in the area and some of it has been successful.  There are also tenders in the hospital for hospital-related drugs.  The community primary care side is more challenging.</p> <p>  I reiterate what Professor Barry said.  The &euro;45,000 per QALY is not a binary decision.  If something costs less than &euro;45,000 per QALY, the HSE will always say "Yes".  No cost-effective medicine has ever been denied.  As the cost per QALY increases, the probability reduces a little but that is offset by the magnitude of the unmet need and the magnitude of the clinical efficacy.  The drugs groups try all the time to arrive at a judgement on that.  It is honorifically challenging stuff for them, for which I do not envy them.  The &euro;45,000 per QALY threshold is not a binary "Yes" or "No".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.677" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018112100002#Y01200"><p>Mr. Hennessy referred to the possibility of legislation for biosimilars similar to that for generics 15 years ago.  That needs to be examined further than at a meeting of a health committee.  That is not substitutable and I cannot imagine a situation where we would introduce legislation to force a consultant dealing with a complex condition to change medication based on a direction by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. Judge said there would be a governance review.  Has this been sparked by anything?</p> <p>  I am very much on the same side as the witnesses.  I understand the challenge of a pharmacist or a medic trying to balance budgetary constraints.   </p> <p>  Following Deputy Brassil's contribution, it is of great concern, particularly in the case of Orkambi, that when there is a well-organised group, it can result in a situation where he who shouts the loudest gets what he wants.  That makes me uncomfortable, both as a legislator and a healthcare professional.  In light of Deputy Kelly's comments, while acknowledging the autonomy of prescribers to make decisions as they always have, it is not fair to say that a decision to jump over certain regulations can be equated to the use of exempt medicines in the normal scheme of things.  There is much talk about conscience these days, but some of us might want to examine our consciences if we were answering those who shout loudest over those with no voice.</p> <p>  When pharma and economics blend, some of the language might come across as crass.  However, ultimately, if &euro;500,000 is being spent annually on a patient, someone else is not receiving something and that must be remembered.  If we have given something to a particular group, does this committee suggest that we should give it do everybody or we take it away from those we did have given it to?  It is easy for members to come here and throw out loose statements but, ultimately, it is a question of whether we take a medication away from somebody or whether we have a free for all. </p> <p>  I must leave now.  I am in favour of there always being a level playing field, where if there must be a decision that goes outside the parameters, it should not be made in these Houses or by a Minister for Health but by a professional at the top of his or her game, namely a consultant operating in his or her specialism.  Members who make representations have a responsibility when throwing out terms such as "life-saving" and "people are being denied a chance".  Leaving aside QALY and health technology assessment, the reason many of these drugs are not mainstream is because the evidence base is not there.</p><p>People in these rooms and elsewhere talk about money for this and money for that, but there is a limited pot.  This is difficult for the families affected and they are entitled to fight for themselves and what they want, but we have a responsibility and we must be reminded of it every so often.</p><p> I must leave as I have an engagement at 1 p.m. but I will read the replies if the witnesses wish to comment.  I apologise for leaving.</p></speech>

It recommended that the HSE works with other European countries on dealing with assessments to expedite that process.  Has anything been done on using the assessment process in other countries to help people arrive at a decision?  Has there been co-operation with other countries in that area?  There is a great deal of duplication in assessments.  If something is passed by European Medicines Agency then each country examines it individually.  The idea behind co-operation is that to speed up the process in dealing with that.  Has anything been done on that area?</p> <p>  We hear every year that the cost of pharmaceuticals is approximately &euro;2 billion but we do not get a breakdown of that.  Are the figures available?  The  healthcare budget for the coming year is more than &euro;17 billion.  Is there a breakdown of what amounts are being spent on generic drugs, patent drugs and orphan drugs?</p> <p>  The other issue that arises is whether there is variation in the use of generic drugs from one part of the country to another.  If we can save money in one area, it means more money could be available for another area.  Perhaps there is an analysis of that but I have not seen it.  We must examine that issue of value for money as well as value for money in the HSE.  It is fine to say more money is being poured into healthcare but unless there are efficiencies or value for money, there will not be a benefit.</p> <p>  Can Mr. Hennessy provide a detailed breakdown in each area?  Have savings been made since the legislation relating to generic drugs was introduced and, if so, where have those savings been made?  Does a great deal more need to be done to make savings in order that more money is available for orphan drugs, accommodating the needs of people who have rare diseases and so forth and ensuring they can get the treatment they require?  Mr. Hennessy probably does not have the information with him but can we get that detailed breakdown from the HSE at some stage?  For example, last week I received a breakdown of staffing numbers in each area.  There is a significant cost because an additional 13,500 staff have been recruited.  Likewise, new drugs are being taken on as well so there is an added cost, but are savings being made in other areas?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we are in the infancy of working with our new colleagues on the BeNeLuxA arrangement.  We only signed the arrangement in June and, to date, our focus has been around sharing information.  However, as time progresses, we will certainly work with them on the other domains, which are HTA, horizon scanning and ultimately joint assessments.  Some of my colleagues are in Vienna today with their BeNeLuxA colleagues to try and progress that work.  We will work with other countries to see what we can do better together.  As I said, we are all struggling with the same issues of affordability and sustainability.  It is a universal problem.</p></speech>

The biosimilar and substitution point is fair enough but we have also seen dramatic levels of biosimilar penetration across different jurisdictions and states.  While in Ireland it is quite low at present, other countries appear to have moved ahead on substitution.  That is where we aim to go as well.</p> <p>  Mr. Judge covered the governance point.  The trigger for that governance review is probably the volume of applications coming through, particularly in the cancer and rare diseases space.  It has dramatically increased on what it was five and ten years ago.</p> <p>  On the point about who shouts loudest, we cannot control that.  At all points we try to ensure that our systems and processes are fair, transparent and equitable and, in particular, that they are evidence-based so decisions are taken on the basis of evidence rather than who is shouting loudest at any point in time.</p> <p>  On Senator Colm Burke's question about cost breakdown, we have a large volume of information on cost and the breakdown of what is happening in pharmaceuticals.  By and large, it reveals stabilisation and even cost reduction in the generic and high volume spaces.  For example, expenditure on the drugs payment and the long-term illness schemes is currently running at levels similar to those in 2000 on a cost per item basis.  We are experiencing a significant increase in the high tech, cancer, orphan drugs and rare disease areas.  There are two graph lines.  One is stable while the other is increasing.  We will be happy to share that data with the committee.  I will need to check further about local variation and uptake as I am not sure if we can get that information easily, but we will certainly look for it.</p> <p>  On the Senator's final point on whether we can do more, I believe we can do more to drive value.  It is related to the points about biosimilars and substitution.  However, it is useful to remember as well that it is difficult to move patients off a drug or product they have been on for some time and sometimes the claims of products are not necessarily that they are curative but that they prevent or reduce deterioration.  That is difficult to measure objectively in a manner that would result in the withdrawal of a drug from a patient.</p><p>I appreciate the difficulties prescribers have in that regard.</p></speech>

Getting that type of data to the Senator is possible with one constraint which is the databases as currently constructed do not capture orphan status.  It is a data field that will have to be added in.  In gross terms concerning generic uptake and cost, it is possible to get that figure, as it is for what is on patent and not on patent.  Patents are very complicated.  We have proxies in our databases that we can use as a proxy for a patent.  A patent is not a single thing.  For an individual drug, there could be 17 or 25 different patents.  We have proxies for monopoly suppliers.  We have markers for what is generic.  We can link those in our databases and give the committee data on uptake.</p> <p>  Generic uptake throughout the country runs at about 75%.  It is important to remember that within reference pricing legislation, which Deputy Brassil and Deputy O'Connell would be aware of from their previous roles as pharmacists, patients can choose to get the brand and pay a surplus or clinicians can say that on an exceptional basis a patient can be provided with a brand.  There are reasons we use brands.  In one instance it does not cost us anything but where a prescriber says there is an exceptional reason a patient should get the brand, it costs us.  I hope I have made myself clear.</p></speech>

This issue was mentioned in passing at a meeting I attended in Vienna yesterday.  I am aware it is coming up today in another context.  There are two things I want to deal with.  First is the emotional element and the life-or-death situation.  As Deputy O'Connell said, it is down to whoever can exert the most influence or shout loudest.  The problem is that individual patients who find themselves confronted with a particular condition see no way out if they cannot access treatment.  They find it particularly upsetting if the treatment is available selectively.  It is also unconstitutional.  That is the reality of life.  It is unconstitutional to prescribe something for a group of people, assuming there are no other barriers, clinical or otherwise, and not to approve it for another.  It is as simple as that.  I hope it is being borne in mind because not only is it unfair, it is subject to there being no other medical reason as to why they should not avail of it or have it made available to them.  They are entitled to it under the laws of the land.  It should be borne in mind.</p> <p>  The job this group does is a very difficult one.  I have no doubt about it.  It is torn in all directions.  There is one thing missing.  I have spoken about it many times.  Everybody else has spoken about it today.  If I were asked to find out what impact the cost of a particular drug will be on the budget, which is an issue, I would like to find out from the people who know.  I would presume I could press a button and find out where the drugs were being used throughout Europe and what the cost was in each case.</p> <p>  I do not agree with the principle of lying downwind in the negotiating process until other countries have gone ahead.  That is not the way to do it at all.  The market of 500 million people in the European Union should be used.  It should negotiate a first and last point.  We should use the weight of the 500 million people the European Union represents.  The European Union is there to back that up.  I cannot understand why it is not the first port of call.  It should be the first reference.  It should not be to the country that has negotiated successfully individually.  There is an institution for doing it so why does it not happen?  Why does it not happen in a way that is most beneficial to the patients and the cost of the delivery of the services?  The only way it can happen is by reference to the biggest single market of which we are but one.  We are only 4 million out of 500 million.  We discussed this 25 and 30 years ago and arrived at this conclusion before the European Union was what it is now.  To what extent do we now use that reference when coming to a conclusion on the suitability of the drug for all patients, the cost of the drug and recognising there may be variations in patient reactions?</p><p> I would like some clarification about biosimilar and generic drugs.  I was around at the time when this discussion initially took place.  Many patients reported that generic drugs did not have the same impact, but the clinical experts told them that they were wrong and that it was just their imagination.  Does the Chairman remember that?  As legislators, we were in a difficult position.  We did not know who was telling us what they thought was the truth and what was accurate.  Legislators can only work based on the information they are given.  As such, I would like a clear indication of the extent to which those two thought processes have been merged to give us some idea as to what we should be doing in future while also keeping costs in mind.</p><p> I cannot believe that we are still using 14 reference countries.  It is all nonsense.  It gives an average, but we know how averages are determined, so we will not go into that.  For God's sake, can someone somewhere initiate a method whereby we can have a reference to the best possible people in the drug-buying business?  The drug companies will, of course, give drugs to some people for free to prove they are effective and to make a bargaining position when dealing with people like the witnesses.  That is what they do and that is the commercial world in which we live.  There is no use in pretending that it does not exist when it does.  It is up to the HSE to set up a structure whereby it can determine which drug is the safest and most effective and appropriate and what is the best value at which it can be purchased so that patients in Ireland pay at least the same as they would in other European countries.</p><p> I have many further questions, but I will finish shortly.  How does the cost of Orkambi compare across Europe?  It is a simple question.  I know that the cost varies, but by how much?  Why does the Irish patient not have the same access to it as everyone else?  I cannot understand that.</p><p> In recent weeks, eight drugs were approved at a cost of &euro;300 million over five years, or approximately &euro;60 million per year.  Out of interest, how does that compare with the drugs that were reviewed five years ago, two years ago and now in terms of their efficacy and cost?  What is the cost per patient of Orkambi?  What is the European opinion on its efficacy, that is, its ability to treat all cases, most cases or specific cases?  Do situations arise wherein it is possible to determine, based on the analysis of the patient and his or her condition, the drugs that are most likely to work, given the patient's metabolism?  I would like to think it is possible.  Two patients with the same condition may have metabolisms that are at variance with the norm.</p><p> My final question is a general one.  I am not a medical expert, but I know of patients whose screenings for cancer have been deemed clear or not clear, whichever the case may be, but whose diagnoses have changed over a period for reasons that are not readily explicable.  Is it possible to shed some light on this?  The cervical smear test is not diagnostic, but a screening process and its accuracy can vary dramatically.  The claim that it is 80% accurate is very misleading from the point of view of the patient because the patient will always believe-----</p></speech>

We have been in formal contact with our respective hospitals and hospital groups over the course of this year.</p><p> I was asked about Orkambi and the variance in cost.

It is very difficult to describe it in simple cost terms.  Our understanding is that the Australian Government took the exact same deal as we negotiated first and we understand the UK's NHS is engaged currently in a similar portfolio deal.  The cost per patient of Orkambi is approximately &euro;12,000 per month.</p></speech>

Not every country has said yes to Orkambi.  There is no point going back to the discussions on the challenges around it and the evidence.  The Deputy asked a general question on efficacy and cost over a timeline.  It is very hard to comment on that in any scientific way because we have not done a review.  In my professional opinion, over the course of my career and in particular over the past ten years, there has been a move for new medicines to come to the market at an earlier stage than they would have previously following smaller trials.  Some of that may be a result of the fact that the low-hanging fruit is gone as the major clinical disease areas have been addressed.  Once one gets into orphan drugs, it is harder to design trials with patients.  Mr. Judge probably started a little before me, but around the time we started our careers, one would expect to have two randomised phase 3, placebo-controlled trials, namely, one big one followed by a conformity trial.  It is only then one would like to see a medicine get to market.  We have gone way beyond that now, however.  What come before the drugs group now are single-arm trials.  That means there is no comparison arm within the trial and the group is faced, like any assessment body internationally, with significant challenges.  Against that, those drugs would never get to market if a phase 3 trial were expected because those are impossible to design.  There are challenges that have to be weighed up around evidence.  The straight answer is that the evidence is less robust than it was for medicines coming to market a decade ago.  That is the nature of being into orphan diseases and smaller areas.  The cost per patient has inflated significantly.  The industry argues that it is because it has to harvest its research and development costs across a smaller cohort.  The cost has gone up for every assessment and, it is fair to say, cost-effectiveness has worsened over the decade.</p></speech>

The witnesses may be able to respond in writing.  As I said in my opening remarks, the committee stated that the 2013 Act needed to be reviewed.  Clearly, the opening statement from the Department contravened that.  I ask that the committee looks at that and furnishes a response.  The Act still needs to be reviewed.  I asked how much was spent on orphan drugs.  The legislation does not make separate provision for those.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, published a report recently, which was prepared by its deputy head and which set out a review from 2012 to 2017 of rapid reviews submitted.  I ask for a consideration of that to extract the orphan drugs from the data to inform the committee as to how much is being spent there.  The last time Professor Barry was before the committee, his organisation was very understaffed, with only 11 out of 23 posts filled.  I am glad to see that, following my representations, it now has 18 out of 23.  I will submit a further parliamentary question looking for the remaining five.</p></speech>

It recommended a review of the Act to identify potential legislative barriers to the reimbursement of orphan drugs and corresponding legislative amendments.  It was not asking for an entire review of the Act.  It honed in specifically on that aspect.  Mr. Judge seemed to think we asked for a review of the entire Act, but that is not the case.</p></speech>

It is difficult to be precise about this year compared with five years ago.  This year, we have dealt with more than 30 new applications with a cost impact or implication in excess of &euro;300 million over five years.  That indicates the scale of this year's activity.  We will have a look back at the position five years ago, although I suspect it was a fraction of that in terms of volume and numbers.</p></speech>

We appreciate the opportunity.</p> <p>  As committee members are probably aware the National Women's Council of Ireland is the leading national women's membership organisation.  We are a feminist organisation campaigning for equality and advocating for women's rights.  We have more than 180 member organisations throughout the country.</p> <p>  We believe that the gap in earnings between women and men, which stands at almost 14%, goes to the heart of economic inequality between women and men.  It has serious implications for a woman's lifetime earnings, her life and career decisions and her ability to live in older years with a decent income.  Unfortunately, there is no one solution to closing the gender pay gap.  There are many complex and inter-related factors that influence women's employment opportunities and progress at work.  These factors directly contribute to the existence of economic inequality and relate to issues of low pay and childcare.</p> <p>  We believe increased transparency and accountability around pay are vital in tackling the gap.  In that respect we warmly welcome the Bill.  Requiring employers to publish statistics on an organisational level will shine the spotlight for the first time on those organisations.  An employer may even be unaware that it has a gender pay gap until it analyses pay information.  Requiring employers to be more open about gender pay differences should bring pressure to bear on them to explain the reasons for those differences and to consider what they can do to eliminate them.  Transparency around pay will ultimately help to improve the issue of gender-influenced pay.</p> <p>  Ireland is not alone in adopting this type of legislation.  That is a positive point and to our advantage, as we have the opportunity to learn from other countries.  While we warmly welcome the spirit and direction of the Bill, we call on the committee to consider a number of matters that we believe would serve to strengthen its overall scope.  Currently, the proposed legislation will initially apply to companies with 250 or more staff.  Then, on a phased basis, the provisions will extend to companies employing 50 or more staff.  If this happens, the legislation is far less likely to have the same immediate impact on women in employment as the Private Members' Bill proposed by the Labour Party, which would have had immediate application to companies employing 50 or more staff, rather than having to wait for a given period.</p> <p>  Let us consider the threshold figures in more detail.  The National Women's Council of Ireland sought to obtain the gender breakdown of those employed in small, medium and large businesses.  It is rather difficult to get this data.  We appreciate the fact that Senator Ivana Bacik raised this matter.  The 2016 Central Statistics Office figures are from a certain sector of the business economy only.  They cannot be disaggregated by gender.  In any event, these are the figures we know.  The total number of persons engaged in active small enterprises with fewer than 50 persons was 720,000.  The number of persons engaged in medium-sized enterprises of between 50 and 250 persons is 290,000.  The number of persons engaged in large enterprises, namely, those with 250 or more, is 467,000.  Clearly, large numbers of people are working in small enterprises that will never be included within the scope of this proposed legislation.</p> <p>  We know from speaking to the members of the women's council and from speaking with women in general that they tend to be significantly represented in small and medium enterprises.  In light of this we call on the committee to be more ambitious rather than rolling out this legislation starting with organisations with more than  250 employees.  This type of legislation has long been signposted.  The threshold for reporting should commence at a much lower figure.  It should be extended to all those employers with at least 25 employees, the threshold adopted by our Icelandic neighbours.</p><p>Furthermore, organisations should be required to publish an explanation of any gender pay gap alongside the figures and, most important, an action plan for closing the gap, against which progress must be reported each year as part of normal reporting requirements.  One of the major criticisms of the UK model is its failure to implement such a requirement.  Civil penalties for non-compliance should be introduced at a level at which the cost of non-compliance is significant.</p><p> The Bill provides the ideal opportunity to address the discrimination inherent in wage negotiations.  A person&rsquo;s initial salary at an early job can affect salary at a later one because hiring managers often base their offer on previous pay.  Research has shown that those who get lower salary offers are often women.  The legislation should prohibit employers from asking about salary history or seeking that information through an agent or from other sources such as the applicant&rsquo;s former employers.  Employers should be legally required to state the minimum salary they are prepared to offer for an advertised role, regardless of whether it is advertised internally or externally, and generally prohibited from inserting terms in a contract that prevent employees from disclosing or discussing wages.  Such measures would help to ensure that salaries reflect the qualifications, skills, experience and achievements of the particular employee and help to shift the emphasis from presenteeism to the quality and output of work done such that taking extended periods of time off of work would not unduly affect future wages.  This is essential for women, who shoulder most of the burden of care and tend to have more career interruptions than men.</p><p> Increased pay transparency will, over time, improve fairness, and a more equal role for women in the workplace will contribute to equality and economic growth.  Although the legislation is not sufficient to tackle the gender pay gap or its underlying causes, it is a very important step, and one we support, albeit with those reservations.  It could be more ambitious.</p></speech>

The gender pay gap in Ireland stands at approximately 14% and is linked to a wide range of cultural, legal, social, and economic factors.  It is a far more complex issue than the concept of equal pay for equal work and requires us to tackle issues such as cultural conditioning, stereotypes and segregated labour markets; the lack of a quality, affordable early years care system; paid and unpaid parental leave; collective bargaining and salary negotiation systems; and the barriers to women&rsquo;s progression at all levels of their career.  That said, mandatory reporting of gender pay gaps in individual enterprises can make a significant contribution to tackling the gender pay gap and we therefore welcome the publication of the general scheme of the Bill.  We note the previous work on this by Senator Bacik and her 2017 Bill and hope that this new Bill will not further delay the introduction of such reporting.</p> <p>  It is clear that a broad consensus on the issue is emerging across political parties, employer bodies, workers&rsquo; representatives and civil society organisations.  We have engaged with IBEC, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and departmental officials with a view to agreeing how best to progress gender pay gap reporting.</p> <p>  We note that the Bill will essentially enable the Minister to make regulations requiring employers to publish information relating to the pay of their employees for the purpose of showing whether there are differences in the pay of male and female employees and, if so, the scale of such differences.  It is significant that the heads of the Bill include the word &ldquo;publish&rdquo;, but there is no detail as to how that will happen.  There is a central website for that purpose in the UK and such may be established here.  In addition to publication on a website or elsewhere, ICTU believes that sharing the information with the workers in the enterprises who are directly affected by this issue and their representatives could lead to useful discussion, further investigation and action.  We have, therefore, requested that gender pay gap information be shared with employees and trade unions.</p> <p>  Other issues include the fact that firms with fewer than 250 employees are initially excluded from the provisions of the Bill, although firms with more than 50 employees will eventually be subject to the requirements.  That means that approximately 50% of firms will not be obliged to report.  As the scheme develops, far from fearing such a measure, some companies may begin to disclose publicly and voluntarily as a signal of their commitment to workplace equality.  Indeed, we note the recent launch of the pay disclosure pioneers initiative under which leading businesses will commit to early pay disclosure and advancement towards workplace equality before that is legally required.</p> <p>  It is useful that part-time work is dealt with in the Bill, given the predominance of women working in that way, as is bonus pay.  ICTU has discussed the desirability of including a list of occupational categories as the best way to proceed in regard to part-time work.  We have discussed with IBEC a proposed list of four managerial and four non-managerial categories which could be considered as a workable option.  However, it is worth noting that if we were to categorise workers per occupation, we would need to know the share of workers in that occupation.  A comprehensive list such as that would be a significant improvement on the UK scheme and would lead to greater granularity in the data to be collected.  Similarly, the UK scheme does not ask for information on part-time worker pay gaps.</p> <p>  The inclusion of a narrative with the figures reported is not addressed.  One of the lessons from the UK experience is that the narrative section of reports provides context and useful information to help interpret the raw data that companies publish.  ICTU has made the point that a narrative may explain what the figures represent and include what actions companies will take to narrow it.  It also provides unions and others with the possibility of holding companies to account on their performance in regard to these actions.  We have suggested that such a narrative should be compulsory.  It is voluntary in the UK system and only approximately one third of employers provide it in their reports.</p> <p>  We note the various enforcement mechanisms proposed in the scheme, including the role of the Circuit Court, equality reviews and the roles of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and Workplace Relations Commission and are happy to discuss these further.</p> <p>  Heads 2(4)(a) and (c) of the Bill, which deal with classes of employer and employee and the treatment of proprietary and non-proprietary directors, as well as those in consultant roles whose only client is the company, will be of importance.  Some sectors are organised in terms of partnerships rather than incorporated companies, and we would hope to ensure that such enterprises are included.  Head 6(10), regarding the publication of the complainant&rsquo;s name, seems an extreme measure to disincentivise vexatious complaints.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to raise these issues and look forward to the discussion.</p></speech>

IBEC welcomes the introduction of gender pay gap reporting in Ireland and commends the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and the gender equality division of the Department of Justice and Equality on their tireless work in developing the general scheme of the Bill.</p> <p>  Gender pay gap reporting will encourage effective discussion and action to tackle the challenges facing business and society in regard to gender balance.  Members will be aware that this challenge relates to the difference in the average hourly wages of men and women across a workforce and comparing the pay of all working men and women, rather than only those in same jobs, with the same working patterns or the same competencies or experience.  It does not indicate discrimination, bias or even an absence of equal pay for equal value work, which is illegal, but it does report a gender representation gap.  For example, if women hold more of the lower-paid jobs in the organisation than men, the gender pay gap is usually bigger.  Although great strides have been made over recent decades to see greater numbers of women progressing, the starting point was low and the improvement is not yet consistent with our ambition.</p> <p>  Pay disparity as measured by the gender pay gap is not solely an organisation level issue, but rather is symptomatic of how we think of men, women and gender and how society has evolved.  Several complex factors typically lead to a gender pay gap, including pre-labour market areas such as education and skills acquisition and issues surrounding caring responsibilities and how these impact on labour market outcomes.</p> <p>  This is timely legislation which will contribute to the tackling of gender imbalance in Ireland, an issue that is a strategic imperative for many employers.  Its success, however, will ultimately be judged in terms of how it delivers.</p><p>As is set out in other submissions, employers are but one actor in the gender pay gap process, yet they are the only stakeholder who may receive unfair reputational damage from the publication of their gap.</p><p> This is a complex challenge which no country in the world has yet fully conquered.  We have one opportunity to get this important legislation right to achieve the buy-in of the Government, employers, civil society and individuals and to enable solutions to be identified and implemented.  To achieve that requires the right methodology, strong coherent communication regarding the conclusions that can and cannot be drawn from a pay gap figure and support to address the challenges that have created the gap, many of which require action from stakeholders other than employers and solutions outside the employer&rsquo;s control.  Fundamental to solving a problem is knowing where the problem exists and what is causing it.  As such, IBEC welcomes the publication of the general scheme of the gender pay gap information Bill and the aims set out therein.  However, we have some concerns over how the general scheme envisages the introduction of reporting and believe that some amendments would ensure it provides for a useful method of reporting.  As currently drafted, the general scheme provides for a hybrid of multiple methodologies so as to be administratively burdensome and costly to the employer.  It calls into question issues of privacy and data protection, yet fails to yield certain information that would enable solutions to be identified.</p><p> While an in-depth commentary is impossible in a five minute statement, I wish to highlight where we believe the most significant challenges exist from a business perspective.  First, there is the issue of quartiles.  The general scheme quite correctly emphasises the importance of examining where males and females are located throughout the organisation as gender pay gap reporting is, in reality, a measure of representation.  However, reporting on quartiles requires dividing an organisation's workforce artificially into four equal bands.  This can result in two employees on exactly the same pay being placed into different bands to fit the quartiles.  IBEC has proposed the use of occupational categories akin to the Australian model of gender pay gap reporting.  Should a gender pay gap be calculated, this model would allow the data to be further interrogated to identify where and often why the gap is occurring, enabling real solutions to be sought.  Unfortunately, the general scheme alludes to both of these measures under subsections 6(xi) and 7 of head 2.  This appears to require employers to engage in double the administration for no real gain.  As such, only one methodology should be required.</p><p> Second, IBEC has concerns regarding the inclusion of head 6 in the general scheme.  The purpose of this legislation is not to create employee rights but to provide a diagnostic tool to help address barriers to the full socioeconomic equality of women.  Involving the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and giving employees entitlements to make claims before the WRC introduce the prospect that this becomes rights-based legislation which was never what it was intended to be.  IBEC is concerned that head 6 risks pitting employees against employers, and encouraging employees to take claims to the WRC will increase the likelihood that attempts to address an organisation&rsquo;s gender pay gap will become an adversarial process.  This is not in the interests of either party and will certainly not facilitate solutions.</p><p> Gender pay gap reporting alone cannot change the imbalance of males and females within organisations, but measurement and reporting tend to be key drivers of change.  This can either be a box-ticking exercise which will not realise our common aims or we can use this opportunity to tackle gender balance.  A renewed focus on the gender pay gap and its roots in the representation of women offers business and society an opportunity to move the dial substantially if we are serious about addressing this problem.  I thank members of the joint committee for the opportunity to present IBEC's views on this important issue.</p></speech>

It is unacceptable that in 2018 we have a gender pay gap of 14% so the members of the committee welcome the legislation that is being advanced.  The representative of ICTU mentioned that there is a concern about the publication.  Obviously, the legislation requires disclosure.  What would his preference be for publication?  Should it be something that is retained in the Companies Registration Office or should it just be available on the website of the company concerned?</p></speech>

There is no reason that we could not do something similar here.  The additional point we would make is that rather than just sending it out to this public arena it should be shared internally with employees and their representatives.  These are the people who can negotiate solutions to this.</p></speech>

That is easy in the case of Deputies, for example, where we all do the same work or where there is a difference between a Deputy and a Senator.  However, how will it arise in organisations where people do different tasks and it is difficult to categorise them in similar groups?  Will that be a problem?</p></speech>

There are four categories for managers and eight categories for non-managers.  The definitions are quite clear as to who would and would not fit in.  An employer would have to put down who fits into which type of category and why.  For data protection reasons where there are very few in a particular category there might be a reason for them being in a different area.  However, it is quite straightforward and most of the employers who have road tested it, as it were, have found it is quite accessible.  It offers the opportunity to see exactly where the gap is happening and why it is happening there, as opposed to a more global figure that does not tell us why.  It therefore offers the opportunity to put focused solutions in place.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Bill is not just to depict the trend but to understand the causal factors behind the gap or why the gap exists within the organisations.  In that regard there is an issue with just stating the proportions of workers in each of the quartiles.  We believe the criteria set out under head 2, section 6, need to go further.  The section refers to the difference between males and females in terms of hourly pay, bonus pay and those who are part-time and on temporary contracts.  That is welcome.  However, it does not refer to the proportion of workers in those categories.  The Bill requires the proportion of workers who are paid bonuses and benefit-in-kind but it does not seek the proportions of those in part-time and temporary work.  That is important.</p> <p>  It is also important to understand the definition of part-time work.  There are two definitions.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, typically defines part-time work as working less than full-time hours and then there are those who might be called marginal part-time workers who typically work less than half of full-time hours.  That is an important feature to understand particularly if women are trapped or certainly working marginal part-time hours and the share of women in the organisation who are in that situation.  That ultimately informs the bigger picture or the narrative as to why the gap may or may not be big.  In addition, while the average hourly pay gap across Ireland is approximately 14% the weekly pay gap is well in excess of 30%.  Again, that is because of the differential between the hours worked between men and women.</p> <p>  When we look at the factors that are driving the gap we know that sector and occupation are important as is employment status in terms of part-time work.  Another thing that is very important - it is not discussed here but should be acknowledged - is that there is lower wage dispersion within organisations and less of a pay gap when there are strong systems of collective bargaining within the organisations.  This Bill is obviously important in terms of pay transparency but it does not fix everything.</p></speech>

That is why we believe the narrative is so important.  In many companies that offer part-time working it is very much at the request of employees.  It allows employees, particularly female employees, to remain within the labour market.</p><p>We certainly do not want to discourage that or demonise employers who offer family-friendly working practices to their employees.</p></speech>

In this case, do the witnesses believe that employees within organisations will be the real beneficiaries?  If people are outside, they will not have the full picture.  Will the advantage of this legislation accrue to a woman working in an organisation?  If she can see pay gaps in the organisation, will it be of assistance to her?</p></speech>

It is not just a pay gap but a representation gap and we need to tackle gender balance across the board, in the business community and beyond.  It is a societal issue and it requires a whole-of-society approach to tackle it.  This will be a good diagnostic tool, as it will shine a spotlight on the issues and get conversations going but the actions to solve it are what is important.</p></speech>

It will certainly benefit women who are working in the companies in question to have transparency but, from a wider viewpoint, it will help women returning to work and applying for new positions because they will have a clearer picture of the employer they are dealing with.  It will also help all of us who make decisions about policy and will enable us to get deep into the causes of the gender pay gap.</p> <p>  The narrative is important because it is how we explain what is happening within a company.  The action plan is also necessary, however, because we have to ask what people will do to reduce the gaps in their companies.  It needs more than an explanation and the legislation needs to put some obligation on an employer to say what they are going to do about any gaps that exist.</p></speech>

Across Departments, we have been trying to redress the imbalances for the past 20 years.  We have a workforce that is predominantly female but where male and female colleagues enter the workforce at the same time with the same qualifications and have the same length of service, the chances of the female progressing any further than middle management are 24% of those of the male.</p> <p>  Many combinations need to be addressed.  This is an important Bill but we also need to fix the problems as we go forward.  Great strides have been made in the public service but there are still some issues.  One of them is flexible working, which is not always available.  At lower grades, flexibility is available but it is predominantly females who take time out of work for childcare or elder care and, when they look to move on, flexibility is not an option so they tend to stay where they are and where they can avail of it.  By the time their responsibility for caring is over and done with, they are on the back foot and their male counterparts, who joined on the same day with the same qualifications, have gone ahead of them in leaps and bounds.  They also lose the confidence to challenge.</p></speech>

Once it is controlled for all other factors, the research shows that females do far worse than their male counterparts.  There are opaque negotiation structures and females do not negotiate as good a package as males.  The benefit is that the provision will shine a light onto the practices around promotion in organisations.</p></speech>

Years ago, people in lower paid jobs could have been confident that, when they retired, they would have a pension and they could try to get their kids through university, even though they may have hard pressed to do so.  What other solution is there to deal with a pay gap that exists generally in society, than a legislative solution in the form of a minimum wage ?</p></speech>

Women are certainly affected by low pay but exact pay is one issue, while other issues include the possibilities of moving up.  Many women remain stuck in low-paid jobs and that interacts with our welfare system.</p></speech>

Dr. McGann expressed some concern around the involvement of some of the enforcement architecture.  Perhaps she might comment on that.  The letter to the Minister reflected concerns about GDPR data aggregation and how we balance that in any legislation we bring in.  Ms O'Connor mentioned civil penalties.  What civil penalty regime does she envisage to ensure compliance and enforcement?</p></speech>

It is taking it to a further level.  It could see us in a position where we have vexatious claims.  Whether the employer is found to fall foul of the regulations, it takes time and has a cost every time that has to be challenged.  We believe it is a less appropriate measure than going through the process with IHREC.  It also has the potential to open up a rights issue in legislation that was never meant to go down that road.</p></speech>

That is why we need to drill down into each piece of information required and ask if it will help or if it is just additional information.  The privacy issue becomes even more acute as the thresholds become lower.  For many employees, their salary details are private and it is sensitive information to them.  For the purposes of reducing the gender pay gap, there is an issue with opening that sort of private information within the public domain.  We need to be conscious of people's rights to privacy and the serious data protection regulations that we are all now subject to due to GDPR.</p></speech>

Sorry about that.  This is interesting and is part of a bigger picture.  We are here to discuss what is, in some ways, a small aspect of the overall area that should be relatively easy to implement.  I am struck by people's points in that regard.  We want to fine-tune some of those practicalities to get it moving.  I am impressed that the witnesses in ICTU and IBEC seem to have had a great deal of dialogue on this behind the scenes.  There should not be a barrier to us getting this up and running relatively quickly.  We would be motivated in doing that and pushing it along.</p> <p>  The points about the numbers that will be excluded by this legislation if it is enacted in the manner in which it has been put forward are striking.  The NWCI suggested 25.  I am interested in the opinion of IBEC and ICTU on that.  I do not see any basis for the staggered approach.  Starting at 250 employees means not starting at all.  What are the views of other organisations on that?  I ask IBEC to respond to some of the points made by ICTU on part-time work.  I note the points about being family friendly.  Does everybody agree that there should be a narrative?  I ask for some commentary on that.  This Bill is only about information.  Information is important.  All policy should be evidence-based and getting accurate information is key and presumably in everybody's interest.  Deputy O'Callaghan said it relates to particular workplaces.  It does but it raises the sights of all of society about where we are going with this.  We do not have the time today but the Deputy said that a 14% gap is shocking in this day and age.  It is but, in reality, it is far more than that because of the differential in hours.  That is a discussion for another day.  Will the witnesses address the narrative?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.807" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kara McGann" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018112100002#J01000"><p>I will address the matter of 25 or more employees.  With regard to the staggered approach, while it looks like a straightforward calculation on paper, it is not, due to resources required when one looks at regulation and what is included or excluded in the bonus definition or total remuneration.  For example, a person on a period of unpaid leave is not counted, overtime is counted and shift work is not counted, using the UK model.  This has added a layer of complexity.  We have said that starting with companies of 250 or more allows us to work out all the bugs in the system with companies that have resources to do that.  When we have fine-tuned that, cascading it down layer by layer will allow it to be something that we learn from with larger companies before we get to smaller companies which often do not have dedicated human resources or financial employees in place in-house.  It would be a much greater burden on them to start off.  That is the reason for the cascading approach.</p> <p>  With regard to the narrative, the gender pay gap figure, without both organisational and sectoral context, is meaningless.  The narrative allows one to understand where that figure is coming from, why it has come about and what factors in the organisation and perhaps external to it are at play.  There may not be enough graduates coming through in a particular area to even start a balanced pipeline at the entry stage or people may not be returning.  The organisation has to look inside to see what policy issues or bias exist but equally we have to look outside and ask if there is an issue with the cost of childcare, so that we can approach this from all angles to solve it.</p></speech>

I know from speaking with many of our members that part-time work is becoming an increasingly requested element from employees and many companies do it to keep female workers in the workforce.  I would be conscious of painting part-time work as somehow precarious work.  It is high-paid for many people and keeps them in the workforce.  It is a choice and we need to be careful not to disregard that fact.  I am always conscious of that in respect of many of the issues that are coming up with the gender pay gap.  Having spoken with members which offer salary sacrifice measures, that can impact their gender pay gap.  We need to be careful not to disincentivise measures that companies are bringing in to have a more inclusive workforce.  I take the Deputy's point that the task seems simple but, having spoken with members, we have had meetings for three to four hours trying to figure out how some of this will feed into their gender pay gap reporting.  It is simple for companies that pay on an hourly basis and that have strict pay regimes within the workforce.  For companies which offer more salary sacrifice measures and different benefits, it is more difficult than one would think and we need to have regard to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-21a.809" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Sherlock" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018112100002#J01200"><p>We have no desire to speak negatively about the availability of part-time work if a worker requests it because there should be a choice.</p><p>However, there is an issue that we know from the research that those who remain in part-time work for a prolonged period suffer a pay penalty over their lifetime.  There is an issue here about access to pay progression.  We know that part-time workers, in particular, in certain organisations do not access the same pay progression measures that are available to full-time workers so there is an issue with that.  We would certainly share the view that there needs to be a narrative but I think we also need to be clear that it is very important that we recognise that some part-time workers become trapped in a low paid, or lower paid, situation relative to their full-time peers.</p><p> The second thing relates to the number of employees to whom this Bill applies.  There would be a certain sympathy to a staggered, or a phased-in process for this Bill, starting with the bigger employers and moving to smaller employers.  Ultimately, in terms of the destination here, it needs to be far lower than organisations with 50 employees.  Certainly when we look at the business demography which Ms O'Connor talked about earlier, the vast majority of employers in this country obviously employ around 20 people.  We think that for this legislation to have any real impact, the number needs to be less than 50.  If we look at the international experience, in Sweden the minimum number is ten employees, in Lithuania it is 20 and it is below 50 in other countries.  There is no excuse but to reduce it below 50 here.</p></speech>

We are talking about perhaps three years before we see any figures at all.  The experience from the UK was that companies waited until the very last minute to publish, so the earliest we will see anything, if we go with this timeline, is three years.</p> <p>  If we look at the experience of other countries, Australia started with 100, Austria started with 150.  The UK started at 250 but they have 67 million people living in their country.  We think a much lower figure is much more reasonable and would be much more immediate.  Then again, there have been questions raised about data protection, but Lithuania is in the EU and has managed to start at 20 and is meeting the same requirements as are we.</p> <p>  It is important that the idea of the action plan is not lost.  It is not enough to provide information as to why the numbers are the way they are.  We want to see companies saying how they will fix things and what they are going to do in the intervening years between publication of their figures.</p></speech>

Basically I am hearing that nobody is really objecting to the staggered approach but there is a serious concern about the timescale on this, particularly as the legislation has been bandied around for quite some time now.  Would it not be the case that in smaller organisations, the pay arrangements will be less complicated anyway by virtue of the arrangement and that all of these big, mad bonuses and special bonuses and arrangements diminish when the employment is small?  It is not as complex and presumably, if there is learning curve to be had, the fact that we are coming late to this issue means we have the advantage of international experience.  We do not need to make the mistakes that were made in the other jurisdictions.  I am not convinced on the need for a staggered approach at all, but I am hearing that nobody has a huge problem with that, although there does seem to be a general agreement that it should move quicker and go down.  If I am wrong on that, I would like to hear more.</p> <p>   Maybe it is me, and it is early, but I do not get the point about part-time workers, I really do not.  What would the problem be from IBEC in that?  Part-time workers, in terms of gender pay gap, is key.  This is an information provision.  Particularly given the significant levels of under-employment that are now being revealed, many relating to women, is the problem that, when the information is gathered, the employer might be worried about looking bad or something?  I do not really get it.  If that is the case, then the points the witnesses made that the reason this is here is because they had all these requests, can be explained and made look as though it is not a problem.  The bigger picture for women and gender equality is that part-time work and underemployment are huge contributors.  Any information we can get that assists in impacting on policy has to be key.</p></speech>

What Deputy Clare Daly is saying about employers being concerned that they might look bad is interesting.  I think that probably feeds into the issue that we have here.  If one looks at the press coverage of the gender pay gap publication figures in the UK, it very much focused on the employer, the company and the gender pay gap within a company and employer.  We can all agree there are some things employers can do but there are other things they cannot do.  The gender pay gap has in some ways been caused - not completely, but in some ways - by the cost of childcare and the number of female graduates coming through in STEM subjects.  There is only so much employers can do to actually fix that.</p> <p>  There is some a concern from an employer's point of view that there will be reputational damage from this measure, even in circumstances where employers may be doing everything in their power to address the gender pay gap but in which, because of factors outside their control, they are still constrained and still have a gender pay gap.  That is a genuine concern of employers and it is why the general understanding on the causes of the gender pay gap is important.  It is useful that everyone here has accepted that there is a multiplicity of factors which feed into it.</p></speech>

Everything we are talking about will apply to trade unions as employers as well, so we will have our own issues in complying with this legislation.</p></speech>

It actually makes very good sense that there would be follow-on action.  In many instances, the action may be outside the hands of the employer.  All these reports are coming and there is evidence that we have a significant problem with childcare in this society.  There is nothing to fear here.  As I say, I was glad to hear the co-operation but we need to move more.</p> <p>  I refer to the points made by IBEC about a sort of misunderstanding, of this being rights-based and about access and the WRC.  What do other of the witnesses think about that point?</p></speech>

It would just be a ruling from the WRC that the company has not been complying with the requirements of the legislation.  Equally, of course, from our point of view, it is important that the victimisation measures in the Employment Equality Act would apply here also.</p></speech>

Many questions have been asked but I have a few general questions to help reflect on the importance of this issue.  According to the World Economic Forum, it would take until the year 2186 to close the current pay gap globally.  This type of legislation is being introduced in more and more jurisdictions.  It is of value and all speakers have reflected that in and of itself, it is not a silver bullet or anything like that.  The gender gap within individual companies will not necessarily capture the gender gap that exists within society as a whole.  There could be a large childcare provider with a favourable male-female balance in terms of pay but that does not reflect the fact that childcare workers are very low paid in general in the context of society as a whole.  There are numerous elements such as that.</p> <p>  While I take on board the points that were made on part-time work, nobody is making the argument that people should not have the option of part-time work.  If it is the case that disproportionate amount of women rely on part-time work when they would rather not, as compared with men, that is also a problem that must be addressed.  In the same way that there are narratives around reporting pay gaps in companies, perhaps an organisation such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, could produce a narrative on the gender gap within society as a whole, across all employers.  Perhaps there is some scope within the legislation for that.</p> <p>  I have looked at the scheme and while this point may be addressed within it, I have not seen it.  Agency workers could be a potential way around it for employers who do not necessarily want to comply.  Is it the witnesses' understanding that an agency worker should be reported as part of the agency's responsibility to report on the gender gap or is it the responsibility of the place of employment where the workers are located?</p></speech>

If we understand the amount of workers who are in part-time work, in temporary contracts and in agency work, then we will be able to remedy that.  The responsibility should not be on the agency itself but on the employer which takes on the agency workers to be able to identify the share of workers who are agency workers and how that pay compares with the permanent workforce.</p></speech>

We need to be careful that we do not muddy the water in new legislation around where the employment relationships lie and that particular legislation to protect agency workers provides that the employer of the agency worker is the agency.</p></speech>

He noted some sectors are organised in terms of partnership and not incorporated companies and raised the question as to how they will be treated.</p></speech>

Our understanding is that this legislation applies to incorporated firms.  There are obviously a significant number of organisations that exist in the Irish economy which are not incorporated.  It is like partnership.  If we take the legal sector or dentistry, for example, they do not incorporate as a firm but they remain as a partnership.  As there are other employment structures which may not fall within the ambit of this legislation, it will be important to ensure we have as broad and inclusive a definition of possible of the organisations that are covered within this legislation.</p></speech>

It is not the responsibility of anybody in this room but I note that it is a bit unfortunate that the Government has decided to start another Bill from one direction when there is a Bill that could have been worked with that started in the Seanad and has finished Committee Stage.  I am not sure why Senator Bacik's Bill could not have been worked with.</p> <p>  IBEC raised the point that it is expected that there will be an obligation to report on quartiles and on an occupational basis.  It is the view of IBEC that this is an administrative burden that does not tell us very much and is unnecessary.  Do the other organisations have any sympathy with that view or do they have a contrary view on it?  Do the witnesses believe there is a need to report on both of those bases?</p></speech>

To return to the earlier point that head 2(6) needs to be expanded upon in terms of the categories where they seek information on the proportion of workers - that needs to cover those who are in the occupations as well.</p></speech>

We feel the occupational categories piece would be a superior way of doing it as it would give us more information than the quartiles would.  To do both, however, would be a futile exercise and would double the work without giving a more meaningful result.  We see it as being one or the other and in our view the categories would give us more detail and robust information.</p></speech>
