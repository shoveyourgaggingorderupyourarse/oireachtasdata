We will now discuss the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme that aired on 5 June 2019.  I welcome the following representatives from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU: Dr. Paul McGowan, chairperson; Ms Karen Trant, director of energy networks and legal; Mr. Robert O'Rourke, electricity networks manager.</p><p>Before we begin, I draw their attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any submission or opening statement witnesses have made to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Once again, I remind members to turn off their mobile telephones or place them in flight mode.</p><p>I invite Mr. McGowan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul McGowan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019070900002#J00300"><p>I am chairman of the CRU, which is the economic regulator for the energy and public water sectors in Ireland and safety regulator in the energy sector.  Our mission is to protect the public interest in water, energy and energy safety.  My colleagues and I welcome the opportunity to meet with the committee to discuss our role with respect to the regulation of ESB Networks and, specifically, the CRU's role as regards ESB Networks' environmental obligations.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Karen Trant, director, and Mr. Robert O&rsquo;Rourke, regulatory manager within the CRU.  I will now provide some background and context to the CRU's role with respect to this issue.<br/><br/>The CRU's role as the economic regulator of ESB Networks and other network companies is to ensure that customers and network users receive value for money while the network companies earn a fair return on their activities to make the necessary network investments.  Those investments go towards the efficient operation, development and maintenance of the electricity networks.  The mechanism by which the CRU sets revenue allowances for ESB Networks is through a five-year revenue allowance process.  For ESB Networks this is called a price review.  The process involves an assessment of ESB Networks' expenditure over the previous five years to assess it for efficiency and to ensure the outputs agreed were delivered by the network company.  The current price review for electricity, referred to as PR4, runs from January 2016 to December 2020.<br/><br/>In PR3, which ran from 2011 to 2015, ESB Networks requested funding for the replacement of &quot;110kV and 38kV Cables programme&quot; and was allowed a sum of &euro;20.5 million for this programme, which included replacement of high voltage, HV, fluid filled cables.  Within the period ESB Networks spent approximately &euro;6.2 million on the overall &quot;110kV and 38kV Cables programme&quot;.  The CRU notes that a significant level of PR3 capex or capital expenditure was deferred to PR4, primarily due to financial constraints in the PR3 period due to the economic downturn.  In PR4, the current price control, ESB Networks requested approximately &euro;28 million capex for the &quot;110kV and 38kV Cables programme&quot;.  The CRU allowed &euro;25.8 million, which includes an efficiency challenge.  As per normal practice, the CRU will review the implementation and efficiencies of this capital expenditure on an <i>ex post</i>basis in 2020 within the PR5 revenue process.  That process is just commencing now.<br/><br/>ESB Networks is the licensed distribution system operator and owner and, as such, takes independent decisions to prioritise infrastructure investment based on its statutory function to operate, maintain and develop the network.</p><p>Given the statutory role of the CRU, we do not become involved in the day-to-day decision-making or management of ESB Networks.  Our role is to challenge ESB Networks to ensure efficient delivery of capital expenditure and ensure positive outcomes for consumers in continuity and quality of supply.  The CRU measures and incentivises its performance on metrics such as customer minutes lost and customer interruptions.  We do not specifically measure or incentivise ESB Networks performance in environmental outcomes.<br/><br/>The ESB Networks environmental reports provided by it to CRU, a copy of one of which we have provided to the committee, enable us to ensure that sufficient funding is allocated to ESB Networks to meet its environmental obligations.  ESB Networks has obligations which sit outside of the remit of the CRU, such as occupational health and safety and environmental obligations.  Our role is to ensure that ESB Networks has the necessary financial resources to meet those obligations. We do not have the legal <i>vires </i>to monitor or enforce obligations that fall under these areas.<br/><br/>My colleagues and I are happy to take the questions of members.</p></speech>

Only &euro;6.2 million of it was spent.  What further action was taken by the CRU regarding the non-spending?  Was it happy with the response it received in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul McGowan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019070900002#K00700"><p>We will revert to the committee regarding the total amount of leakage since the review commenced.  On the non-spending, one of my colleagues may contribute further once I have provided an overall view.  There were significant reductions across the capital programme for ESB and ESB Networks at that time because of the financial crisis.  There was a very significant reduction in its capital expenditure because of ability to access capital markets.  In addition, capital programmes have impacts on tariffs and every effort was being made to contain any price-increasing effects.  At the end of the overall PR3, we reviewed whether, in spite of the fact that it spent less in capital expenditure across the board, the amount that was spent was spent efficiently.  That is our normal approach.  In broad terms, we accept that during PR3 there were significant capital constraints across the economy and the ESB was affected by that and, as a result, its capital programme was scaled back.</p></speech>

It was all about the borrowing of very significant sums.  Typically, multi-billion euro programmes over five years were in question.  It was all about the ability to borrow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019070900002#K01000"><p>Dr. McGowan stated that the role of the CRU was to allow the capital spending to fix the leaks.  Was there any communication with its fellow regulator, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, regarding the number of leaks that had taken place and the concern that they had not been dealt with?  Was it of concern that the leaks had occurred and the money that was allocated was not spent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul McGowan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019070900002#K01100"><p>We did not enter into direct dialogue with the EPA on this issue because there were no red flags from our perspective regarding the environmental programme of the ESB.  Typically, the ESB came to us and we identified whether it had justified the spending.  For example, in PR3 we gave it an allowance which we considered sufficient for it to meet its environmental and safety obligations.  We saw no requirement to liaise with other sectoral regulators.  The ESB reported to us that it was substantially in compliance with its environmental obligations.  Those reports were in respect of our role as economic regulator.  We are aware that ESB Networks, like any other network operator, answers to the relevant environmental and safety regulator in respect of its statutory functions.  At the time, there was no perceived need for us to liaise with the EPA.  That said, we have a memorandum of understanding with the EPA regarding our respective roles and are aware that it is carrying out an investigation.  In support of that, we have shared information we have with it.  We will liaise with it to determine whether any further exchange of information is required to support its role or ours.</p></speech>

If I understand Dr. McGowan correctly, it told the CRU that it was compliant environmentally.  Am I correct in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul McGowan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019070900002#K01300"><p>Yes.  It advised us in its environmental reports that it was in substantial compliance with its environmental obligations.  We took that at face value because we are not an environmental regulator.  We took its statements on its environmental and other obligations at face value.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019070900002#K01400"><p>I thank Dr. McGowan for his presentation.  Knowing what he knows now, does he consider the ESB to be in compliance with its environmental standards obligations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul McGowan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019070900002#K01500"><p>It would be premature of me to offer an opinion in that regard because I am not an environmental regulator and the CRU does not regulate the ESB from an environmental perspective.  We want to see what comes out of the EPA investigation.  Given that the matter has come to public attention, clearly, we will examine it in the course of our look back on expenditure over the current price control period, which ends next year.  As I stated, there were no red flags from our perspective in terms of the reports we were receiving.  The typical message in the reports was that the ESB was in substantial compliance with its environmental obligations, had carried out external and internal audit of them, and there were no major concerns.  From time to time, it may have been in breach of a particular environmental obligation, but it dealt with such matters along with the relevant environmental or safety regulator at the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019070900002#K01600"><p>In light of the information contained in the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme, does Dr. McGowan now believe there is a red flag?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul McGowan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019070900002#K01700"><p>As I stated, in the look back we will pay particular attention to whether the ESB has spent efficiently the moneys for which it applied, as is normally the case.  According to the environmental reports provided to us by the ESB between 2014 and 2017 - the 2017 report is the most recent we have and we provided a copy of it to the committee - the amount of leakage from the fluid-filled cables reduced from 54,600 l per annum to 15,201 l.  On that basis of analysis, the ESB was making progress in its programme to reduce the level of leakage from the cables.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019070900002#K01800"><p>Is there a necessity for a greater level of co-operation between the CRU and the EPA?  I am not suggesting that there is no co-operation currently.  Is there a need for a more clearly defined communication path, transfer of information, regular dialogue and some kind of a forum such that the red flag referred to by Dr. McGowan would not be required and there would be a method of verification and closer level of auditing for the next wave of investment or approval of required investments?</p></speech>

I would characterise the relationship between the CRU and the EPA as very constructive.  We have a memorandum of understanding and regular dialogue, particularly regarding water, because there is a significant overlap between its functions and ours as a regulator and there are many environmental programmes associated with water.  Up to now, the need for such dialogue regarding ESB Networks was not identified.</p><p>We certainly have a good relationship with the EPA, however.  That dialogue will take place.</p></speech>

The investment profile I mentioned was price control 3, which ran from 2011 to 2015.  In that period, as noted, the ESB was given a certain allowance and spent considerably less.  We were fully aware of that and we have looked back.  We have concluded that what it spent, it spent efficiently.  That has fed through in respect of tariffs.  In the current price control-----</p></speech>

It might be worth looking at what the chief executive was paid then.

It was actually a very narrow point.  It was a narrow point in regard to the allowance that ESB had been given for its safety programme and the fact that the allowance it had sought was not adequate enough.  The second point raised was that it had perhaps overspent the allowance.  It is not unusual for management to prioritise decisions in the day-to-day running of the business and move budgets between one area and another.  We do not regulate or manage ESB Networks or any of the networks we regulate to that level.  We did not, on the face of it, see any issue with this but we determined that we would consider it in the look back associated with PR4, which we will conduct later this year and into next year.  It was not until some time in June that we were advised that there was a programme airing on the matter.</p></speech>

To do that, however, the commission must have some expertise in the areas of health and safety and environmental risk.  He might talk to us about that function within his organisation.  While the commission does not have primary responsibility, and bearing in mind that managing the risk is such an important part of what ESB and ESB Networks do, how are responsibilities discharged?</p></speech>

What we typically do is take in expertise for a period.  I refer to those with specific expertise right across the capital programme we envisage ESB would have.  These experts examine the various aspects of ESB's capital programme for us, be it the construction of wires, the operation of substations, or meeting various safety obligations.  They, along with our internal staff, led by people such as Mr. O'Rourke, carry out the overall analysis and determine whether the sums being sought by the network company are sufficient to carry out its statutory functions or whether they need to be adjusted.  It would not be unusual for us to do some form of adjustment.  For example, a network utility might say it needs money for X but might not provide us with the evidence we would say is necessary to support it.  In any event, we may challenge it to deliver what it wants to deliver more cheaply.</p></speech>

At that point, did the ESB alert the commission regarding the leaks?  When did it happen?  Dr. McGowan outlined the commission's role in the opening statement and clarified that in the discussion some moments ago.  If there were works to be carried out that would incur a great cost, surely the ESB would alert the commission because it would make a submission to be given approval for capital expenditure.  If the ESB knew about the leakage in 2009, did it tell the commission in that year?  When did it raise the issue?  It is a very expensive problem to fix, by all accounts.</p></speech>

The fact that slightly less than 30% of what was granted was actually spent, while at the same time we had the problem of cables leaking fluid and oil into the environment, especially in the Dublin area, seems to indicate a mismatch.  How much did the ESB look for at that point?</p></speech>

We adjusted that primarily because we expected the ESB to do the programme more efficiently.  It was not that we did not agree with the programme.  As with any utility that we regulate, the utility needs to present us with evidence that the programme is necessary.  If it presents that evidence, then we make the funds available.  At the end, if it presents evidence that it carried out the programme efficiently, then we allow those funds to flow through to prices that consumers ultimately pay.</p></speech>

That may be the case but I was frantically trying to find the legislation on my telephone because I will have to look at it now as it may need to be amended.  I could not believe that a modern regulator of an energy or water business would say it is not an environmental regulator and just does economics.</p></speech>

If that is what the Deputy has taken from it, that is not what I meant.  I will separate two things.  First, if one takes the example of the transformation that is required in the energy system, of course we have a substantial role to play in respect of the achievement of targets for renewables on the system, the introduction of renewable gas or any of those matters.  We obviously have a key role to play as a utility regulator in that regard.  Through the price controls we make very substantial amounts of money available, from the analysis we carry out, for the utility companies to deliver those environmental obligations.</p> <p>  With regard to the particular topic of the cable leaks that we are discussing, I am talking about a narrower focus there in terms of ESB Networks' obligations under environmental compliance legislation in respect of its discharges to the environment.  It is important to separate those two.  Of course, we have a key role to play in the delivery of the clean energy package and the climate action plan.</p></speech>

When it comes to ESB Networks, however, if this oil fluid is going into the Royal Canal, it is not as much of an interest.</p></speech>

In the case of Irish Water, it is broadly accepted that a massive programme of investment is required in order for the company to meet its environmental obligations.  They are at two totally different stages in terms of environmental compliance.</p></speech>

We would have been aware that there were leaks from the fluid filled cable network and that it had been identified that these cables needed to be replaced over time.  Our role was to ensure that ESB Networks had adequate financial resources to fund that programme and we carried that out through the price control.</p></speech>

Our role with regard to safety is public safety risks, not occupational health and safety.  There is a distinction.  That would sit with the relevant authority, which would be the HSA.  ESB Networks would report to the HSA as an employer.  On the gas and petroleum sides, we have a specific safety function for public risk that is enshrined in legislation.  There is a lengthy provision of the 1999 Act that sets out our functions, enforcement powers and so forth and we have a well developed framework to allow us to do that.  When talking about the environmental aspects with regard to ESB Networks, we do not have the same enforcement powers or the same expertise that the EPA or the local authority have to monitor that, but we have an interest and we take it into consideration.  As Dr. McGowan said, when we take it into consideration we allow the utilities the money to make sure they meet their environmental obligations.</p> <p>  By contrast, there is our safety role in respect of gas.  We keep environmental experts on retainer who would review EIAs and other environmental assessments that Gas Networks Ireland would carry out before it lays a gas pipe.  We review that to ensure it is in line with environmental obligations.  Again, however, that is a function and power we have under legislation.</p></speech>

There was an OECD review of regulators and, by and large, the CRU came out with flying colours.  My experience, as a former Minister, is that one cannot act as a regulator if one does not take the environment into account as well as public safety.  If the legislation is at fault in this regard, then we must amend it.  One cannot act a regulator where one states that one is only an economic regulator and that one does not look at the environment.  That has to be one of the most valuable lessons of this process.  How would the regulator know what we are to do in respect of the climate?  If anything, in that three-way process, the environment comes first because the one physical certainty we know about is that we must stop putting carbon in the atmosphere whereas competitiveness or security can be devised in a range of different ways.  To discount the environment and state that one is only an economic regulator, is a valuable lesson out of what has come out today.  I do not see how a regulator can do its job if it is coming at the matter in that way.</p></speech>

Given our statutory functions, the main means we have by which we ensure that the utilities we regulate discharge their environmental obligations is to ensure that they are adequately funded to do so and it is through the price control that we achieve that.</p></speech>

Knowing that the ESB had not spent the money, and I take Dr. McGowan's point that a recession occurred, does he feel that CRU has adequate environmental expertise in house to be able to assess such spending and to understand the environmental impact of leaks like this so that when it sees that capital investment has not been made to fix these leaks there is somebody in house who will raise a red flag and say that there was a recession but this has a serious environmental impact?  Does the CRU have staff in house with that expertise and environmental knowledge that it is necessary to bring to bear when it is giving the go-ahead in respect of a capital spend and then seeing that it is not spent?</p></speech>

When doing a price control and looking at a capital programme, we take on experts to advice us on that.  Because we do not have, for example, powers to prosecute or investigate in environmental incidents and safety incidents in respect of the electricity network side, we typically would not have significant expertise in that area.</p></speech>

The CRU is handing that over to the EPA.  Given there was &euro;20.5 million and only &euro;6.2 million was spent, is there any look-back or follow-up in respect of this because it has an environmental impact?  The big question relates to why red flags were not raised even after that.  This was a serious environmental issue.  Even if the CRU could not deal with the matter, it could approach its fellow regulator and discuss this, even informally, through the memorandum of understanding with the EPA.  If there is a recession or financial or outside forces, it is still a serious environmental issue that needs to be dealt with.  Should it not have been flagged with the EPA?</p></speech>

As stated, when we look back, we look at whether or not they have spent efficiently.  At the time, in PR3, right across the utilities, the capital programmes were being cut because of the recession and access to capital markets.  It is fair to say that once the EPA has concluded its investigation, we will look at how we might bolster our memorandum of understanding with it in order to ensure that we have dialogue with them on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

At last Thursday's meeting, a first draft of the report on the committee's detailed scrutiny of the Bill was circulated, with a request from members to submit written comments by noon yesterday, 8 July.  On Friday, an amended version containing the views of the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, IMHO, and certain other changes was also circulated.  A further draft, which attempts to incorporate the comments of members has now been circulated.  We now have to deal with the matter.  The Minister is present with us.  We have substantial amendments to the Bill.  For the information of members, we had invited in a representative of the Garda to deal with insurance fraud.  The witnesses are waiting outside.  I hope we will deal with the issue at 2 p.m. because our meeting must finish by 3.30 p.m.  We may not be able to deal fully with this matter but we must make a start on it because of the amount of information we now have.</p></speech>

The Garda fraud unit was due to come in at 1.30 p.m.  The witnesses are waiting outside.  I am told that it will be 2 p.m. or a little after when we commence that part of the meeting.  We can begin our consideration of what is before us now.  The meeting itself must finish at 3.30 p.m. or 3.45 p.m. because this room is booked by another committee.

It is something I wish to say and I do not care whether it is in public session or private session.  I do not think the way the committee is handling this issue reflects well on it.  I do not believe it is satisfactory and I do not believe the procedures have been fair.  A hard copy of the draft report was circulated at our meeting on Thursday morning.  A soft copy of that draft was issued later on Thursday morning, then on Friday at about 4.15 p.m. another email landed in the inbox with a significantly revised draft and a deadline of noon on Monday for amendments to be submitted.  I do not believe that is a fair timeline for all of us who rely on staff and the goodwill of others to get our work done.  I do not believe the time for amendments was adequate.  The report itself looks rushed.  I have done my best to add key amendments, as I see it.  Coming here today I was aware the deputy Garda commissioner was lined up to come in but I was not sure of the sequencing, and whether we would stick at this until we finished it.  I was fearful that the deputy Garda commissioner would not be brought in over the course of today's meeting.  We should have a general discussion on where we are going with this, procedurally.  With all due respect to everyone, we are not going to get very far in 20 minutes.  What happens when we park the issue for the day?</p></speech>

I have no difficulty if the Deputy wants to change the decisions that were made, but that is up to the members.</p></speech>

He made some fair points.  I tried to tease out how those would be added in.  It seemed to me that there would be an addendum and that we could start preparing amendments to the first draft of the report, but the second draft is significantly different.  I had to park the first draft and start looking at the second draft and making amendments to it.</p></speech>

The first draft contained only the views of the Department and the Central Bank, so I welcome the efforts to ensure the witnesses' core sentiments were captured in the report.</p> <p>  The point the Chairman made is a valid one.  There was agreement and unanimity that the report would be circulated and that we would agree amendments on Monday.  I can understand where Deputy Michael McGrath is coming from.  I naively thought that there was a majority view in this committee that sales to vulture funds should not happen without the consent of borrowers.  However, I now see clearly that Deputy McGrath's amendment is about scuttling this Bill.  That is what it is.  Let us call it as it is.  It is about scuttling this Bill and ensuring it does not go through.  If the Deputy does not support the principle of no consent, no sale he should say it outright, because the amendment he has placed before this committee is about making sure that this Bill never sees the light of day.  It is a stalling tactic.  He knows the clock is ticking for this year and he also knows, as do other members of the committee, that banks are lining up many vulture sales of family homes.  They are looking to us to act, and I am very disappointed.  I was probably naive in thinking, when the principles of this Bill were supported by the majority of the D&aacute;il on Second Stage, that politicians would see that through and allow it to go to Committee Stage where appropriate amendments to address any concerns could be tabled if need be.</p></speech>

The aim of the process we are involved in here is to assess the evidence we heard and come to a view on it.  The Bill passed Second Stage, and anyone can read the speeches I and others made on that occasion.  The purpose of a scrutiny phase is for people to listen carefully to the evidence and test it.  We are getting into discussion of the amendments themselves at this point, but as far as we are concerned, this is not a political game.  It is about getting the right outcome for the country, for mortgage holders, and for our financial system as well.  That is why the evidence that has been given has to be tested.  None of the people proposing the Bill should fear their assertions being tested in an independent and time-bound manner.  That is what we are suggesting.  We are not trying to thwart anything, but given the significance of the issues and potential consequences that have been raised, we want the evidence to be tested.  I stand over that.</p></speech>

However, I challenge the bona fides of what Deputy Michael McGrath is saying.  He should allow this Bill to progress to Committee Stage, with the independent analysis concluded before that Stage in order that we could then shape our amendments.  If he wishes to vote against the Bill at that point, so be it.  The reality, when one cuts through everything, is that this is a stalling tactic.  If the Deputy stalls this Bill for another three or four months, we will run out of time to bring this legislation in.  I give the Deputy the opportunity to show his bona fides by allowing this Bill to go to Committee Stage, but not taking Committee Stage until the independent analysis is done.  That would show that the spirit of the Bill is being supported, but we could also examine further evidence if need be before we deal with the committee amendments.  We could decide at that point if we wanted the Bill to progress to Report Stage.  Otherwise, this is nothing but a stalling tactic and an attempt to scuttle this Bill and stop it in its tracks.</p></speech>

I believe it will pose the greatest of difficulties for those who are paying mortgages at the moment because of what could happen to their mortgages in the future, and the rates of interest on their mortgages.</p><p>At a time when the economy, small companies and families need credit, including citizens who need credit to buy homes, this Bill, if passed, could have a highly detrimental effect on the ability to supply new rates of credit to the economy at affordable rates of interest.  Given the number of times this committee has acknowledged the need for strong, independent regulators, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Ireland raise a variety of profound concerns in respect of this Bill and, perhaps most significantly from a Central Bank point of view, indicate that if our banking system was to ever get into difficulty, the passage of this Bill could affect the ability of the Central Bank to support Irish banks in times of difficulty.  That is the gravest of issues to be raised in respect of any Bill like this one.  It is for all of those reasons that I oppose the Bill, which will not come as a surprise to Deputy Doherty.  I want to ensure that people get treated fairly and those who are in debt distress are supported.  I also have a duty to people who depend on our banks for credit and affordable mortgages.  This Bill does not recognise the need to find that balance.</p><p> From a process point of view, I am eager to get the Chairman's guidance regarding how he wants to move this forward.  In that regard, I will simply say that if the Government treated any member of the Opposition in the way I believe this committee has been treated in having two different reports issued on one day or if I, as a member of the Government, attempted to treat this committee like that, the committee would be apoplectic with me, and understandably so.  We are not talking about slightly different reports being issued.  They are materially different and they require materially different amendments that would have very different consequences in respect of what the D&aacute;il could do.  For those reasons, I believe this Bill should not proceed to Committee Stage.  At the very least, the course of action proposed, namely, an independent analysis of the Bill before it goes to Committee Stage, is essential.</p></speech>

My understanding was that it was an addendum.  The report we got on Friday was significantly different from the report we got on Thursday.  I made known to the clerk of the committee my view that this was not proper procedure.  We were told amendments were to be submitted at the same time.  In terms of the  change in the report, I believe the deadline should have reflected that.  I fundamentally disagree with what this Bill proposes but on the procedural side, we required further time.  If one reads through the report, one can see it has been changed significantly in various areas.  Members were not given sufficient time.  Yesterday's 12 noon deadline was grossly inadequate considering the magnitude of the topic we are dealing with.  Our role as a committee is to scrutinise issues in great depth.  If we are doing a report, careful consideration is required, and if a new report issues, that will require further careful consideration.  We have not had adequate time.</p></speech>

They decided they would agree to the timing of the amendments.  I undertook to speak to the clerk, add to the report the members already had and issue a draft report.  That draft was to reflect the views expressed by two other groups of witnesses who appeared before the committee.  I changed my opening remarks in the report because I wanted to change them.  Other parts of the report were added to and new parts inserted.</p><p>It was up to the members then to take that draft - it is only a second draft - and to decide on the changes that they want.  They could come back here today and decide that they do not want to do it this week and we will postpone it until next week.  That would have been fine.  The reason we are caught in this time issue is because I presumed we were coming in to look at the amendments which I did not expect to be as complex as they are, but given that they are, we do not have the time to deal with it and it is a matter of postponing the consideration of those amendments and of the report itself to another date.  The amendments are extensive and need consideration but it is in the hands of the members to decide.  They are to decide what to do.  If the decision is to postpone this and debate it on another day, which can be tomorrow, after the break, or whenever, the members can make that decision.  To break the deadlock and to facilitate the other witnesses who are coming before us, I suggest that we put consideration of these amendments and of the report back to another day.</p><p> Apart altogether from what is contained in the amendments or the report, I suggest to Deputy Doherty that we will not be able to consider this today in the short time that we have.  It is as simple as that.  There was no indication on the day of our last meeting that the amendments to the report would be as extensive as they are.  The question is whether the members agree to postpone consideration of the report until such time as we have considered every angle and aspect of that report and the amendments to it?  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

This does not take away from the fact that what is happening here at this meeting is a clear attempt - and Fine Gael has been consistent in this, I welcome the largest attendance ever from that party at a finance meeting here - to protect the vultures and not ordinary people.  I nonetheless welcome all Fine Gael members in their attempt to stop this Bill.</p></speech>

Deputy McGrath has made a point about independent analysis which could have happened at any time.  There is a clock ticking on this Parliament.  We all know this, as does the public.  There is also a clock ticking for banks.  My view is that this should be allowed to go to Committee Stage, we should be reporting, and an independent analysis should be carried out which would be allowed to shape our amendments.</p> <p>  I have made it clear that this Bill is not designed to impact on securitisation.  If that is an issue, and if the independent analysis shows that - we have heard this from the Central Bank - it will be dealt with on Committee Stage.  Committee Stage is where one allows the spirit of the Bill to go ahead and one then fixes it.  I am concerned about timing.  There is an amendment here which will scuttle the Bill because of the timing issue but it is fixable if there is a willingness to allow this Bill to go to Committee Stage and concurrently have the independent analysis carried out.  We have just finished the scrutiny, having spent months on it, and now people are asking for more scrutiny.  If there is willingness to support the concept of this, there is a way forward.</p></speech>

If we agree to nothing today, then nothing will happen.  No assessment will be done.  We will come back in the autumn and will still be looking for an independent assessment to be done.  The best way for Deputy Pearse Doherty to advance his Bill is for him and the committee to agree today to have an independent impact assessment done on the Bill, so that over the course of the summer recess, that work can be advanced.  That is the most important step that can be taken to ensure that time is not lost.</p><p>While I think agreement to send a motion to the House would be a matter for the select committee, even if it did, nothing would happen until mid-September.  Let us use that time to agree collectively that an independent economic assessment of the Bill should be done.  That is the most practical way to ensure that this issue does not go flat and die over the summer months.</p></speech>

This Government and my party have overseen significant change to reduce mortgage arrears in our country to help those who are in difficulty and distressed with debt.  We have overseen a substantial number of restructures in our economy and, quarter by quarter, we have seen a reduction in the number of mortgage arrears.  That is our track record and I do not need Deputy Pearse Doherty to impugn it in any way.  That is what this party and Government have delivered.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty is consistent in putting forward ideas that he pretends will solve all difficulties while not acknowledging the substantial consequences of what he is looking to do, which were acknowledged as risks by the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Central Bank.  At a time when poor policy and ill thought-out regulation caused such harm to our economy, Deputy Doherty is perpetrating the same behaviour.  My colleagues and I are here to be clear that we want to ensure that those who need protection receive it and that those who need our banks for credit to buy a home or support the family business are present in this debate too.  At the very least, an independent cost-benefit analysis needs to be done before this Bill can be allowed to move forward, which my Department would be happy to fund but which would be independently chosen.  I will not play any role in who will do the work.  That is a decision for the committee.</p></speech>

What can be seen here is classic politics, with Fine Gael's open defence of the vultures and Fianna F&aacute;il's slightly less open approach, although it still attempts to be effective.  There is an idea that we will just kick this into the long grass.  Everybody knows where that goes.  There is a clock ticking towards a general election happening.  We know that even if we pass pre-legislative scrutiny, it is likely that the Government will refuse to give a money message, as it has just done for the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018.  We should meet on Thursday and agree a report on scrutiny at that stage.</p></speech>

Many amendments have been proposed by the Minister, Deputy Pearse Doherty and Deputy Michael McGrath.  If we do not do anything today, then we will come back in September and look for independent analysis then.  I welcome that the Minister has agreed to fund any independent analysis that this committee wants to do and for which it will choose who does the analysis, if I understand the Minister correctly.  The Minister would pay for it and we would get to pick who would do it.  Let us get on with the independent analysis to look at this Bill because there are clearly concerns from the European Central Bank and Central Bank of Ireland.  There is clearly support in these Houses for protecting people as well as we can in what we are doing.  Let us get this show on the road so that when we come back in September, we do not then decide to do this independent analysis which could take until Christmas.  If anything, Deputy Michael McGrath's amendment about independent analysis speeds up the process rather than us kicking it to touch, bringing in the Garda deputy commissioner now, and not doing anything until September at the earliest.  That would mean we would not even be considering this going to Committee Stage until Christmas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019070900002#G00100"><p>Let me make two points.  First, on what the Minister said regarding who needs to be present in this debate, his point is correct.  I have been present for all of this debate.  If the Minister was in attendance at the debate, he would have heard the Central Bank state that dealing with the issue of securitisation allays the majority of its concerns.  That is first and foremost.  It has been repeated time and again that the drafting of the Bill is not intended to have an impact on the issue of securitisation and that it would be amended or the position clarified on Committee Stage.  The Minister can throw out accusations that I am reckless, not aware of potential consequences and all the rest and state that the Department is paying for this.  That is fine.  I am sure we could ask that an independent analysis be carried out in respect of the effect vulture funds have had on people who have lost their homes.  Perhaps he would not be so willing to have such an analysis.</p> <p>  With that parked to one side, the question is how we find a way forward.  As stated, I do not fear anything in the context of testing this.  However, it has been months since this passed the D&aacute;il and we have had a process of scrutiny in regard to it.  The concern I have is that the independent analysis is linked to allowing this to proceed to Committee Stage.  I have no problem with the proposal from Deputy Michael McGrath to the effect that the committee agree to an independent analysis and we can look at the type of analysis we carry out, which is something I would support.  However, I would also ask the committee to allow this Bill to move to Committee Stage on the understanding that it will not proceed further until the independent analysis has been completed and we have had time to reflect on it in order that we might shape whatever amendments we wish to bring forward in respect of the report.</p> <p>  Otherwise, and let us call a spade a spade.  What is happening here is about scuttling the Bill.  That is the reality.  There is a divergence of opinion and, obviously, Fine Gael has stated clearly and consistently that it is opposed to this Bill.  That is its entitlement.  We can do two things.  We can agree to carry out an independent analysis, within a timeframe of two months to look at what the analysis needs to cover.  Deputy Michael McGrath has captured much of that.  We can also complete this report, which would allow us to report to the D&aacute;il with a recommendation that we proceed to Committee Stage, on the understanding that Committee Stage will not happen until the independent analysis, which allows us to be more informed, has been completed.</p> <p>  The independent analysis is post scrutiny.  Scrutiny is complete.  Otherwise, this is stalling.  In my view, this is a fair compromise.  Although it is up to Deputy Michael McGrath to suggest whether he supports that.</p></speech>

The select committee must meet to agree it before it goes to committee.  Given the timeframe, we have to set aside time to consider the report anyway before we can trigger a meeting of the select committee to decide on it.  Within the few days that are left in the session, that is what we are now faced with.  As a result, we are back to square one in terms of the timing and for the members to agree to that timing.  If the Minister has offered that the Department would fund it, and we can then select someone who will carry out that analysis of the full Bill, not just the impact on one side but the impact on the other side, both vulture funds and customers, it is for the members to decide.  However, we have a decision to make about finishing the report.  That is the first decision that has to be made.  We cannot follow on, as I understand it, unless that is done.</p></speech>

As we can see in the suggested terms of reference that I put forward in the amendment in respect of the independent impact assessment, it relates to, among other things, consumer protection, the protection of mortgage holders and so on.</p><p>Given that the report will not be completed this side of the recess, the question upon which the committee must decide is whether it wants anything at all to happen in the next two months.  I say this in good faith.</p></speech>

Deputy McGrath had hoped the legal advice would come back stating the Bill was unconstitutional.  It has not.  He had hoped the Bills Office would say the Bill would need a money message.  The office has said the preliminary decision is that it does not.  It is therefore now in the Deputy's hands as to whether we are going to allow banks to sell family homes to vultures willy-nilly, as we saw last week.  I am happy with an independent analysis.  I am not happy that the Deputy is using that as a stalling mechanism.  There is a sensible solution here.  Allow the report to go ahead and allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage but without having that Stage until the independent analysis is done.</p></speech>

We would finish the scrutiny and pass a report which would include reference to the need for an independent report.  The Minister has said he will finance that, which means the authors of the report could get working on it.  Then, before having Committee Stage, we would have the report in front of us and it would inform our work.  What is the rationale to delaying agreeing a scrutiny report until we have this technical report?  One would only do that if one wanted just to delay it and delay it and delay it.  We can agree both things today, tomorrow, Thursday or whenever else.</p></speech>

This independent report will inform us in that regard.  That finding was taken out of the second report.  That is a fundamental change in the reports.  I put it to Deputy Doherty that if we are serious about acting collectively as a committee, we should do our work in a constructive manner.  Deputy McGrath has put forward a very reasonable suggestion, that is, that over the summer an independent economic analysis on the impact of this report be allowed to take place.  Deputy Doherty's suggestion puts the cart before the horse in saying we start building a house and apply for planning permission later.  That cannot be done.  What is proposed here will inform our decision-making as a committee.  I have pointed out one fundamental change, a significant shift, in the two reports.  The first report states that it is not possible for the committee to come to a definitive position on competing considerations.</p><p>I regard that as a reasonable representation of the collective views of some committee members.  If we are serious about working collectively, what has been proposed by Deputy Michael McGrath is a reasonable suggestion and one that I would wholeheartedly support.</p></speech>

It lays out at the bottom of page 10 that the D&aacute;il select committee must consider, taking account of the scrutiny report, whether the Bill should continue to Committee Stage.  Examples of grounds on which a Bill could be considered unsuitable to progress to Committee Stage include the need for further detailed policy analysis, the identification of major technical or legal issues, and the presence of drafting issues that cannot be remedied by way of amendment.  All three of these grounds obtain with the current report.</p></speech>

They are: further detailed policy analysis; major technical or legal issues identified; significant implementation issues identified; drafting issues that cannot be remedied by way of amendment; and an outcome that does not require legislation.  This information is contained in the first appendix to the memorandum of understanding on Private Members' Bills.  On at least three of these grounds, there is a clear argument as to why the Bill requires further work before it proceeds to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

The report we are considering is a draft report.  There are significant amendments to it.  Regardless of its contents, the important word is "draft".  There are amendments that we have to consider.  The first decision that has to be made is when we will consider them and the report to complete it.  A select committee cannot make its decision based on these five points unless it has the report.  For example, we could make a decision to consider the report in full next Tuesday or any other day this week.  It would be whenever the members decided.  Once that was done, we could proceed with finalising the report.  The select committee needs that report to make its decision.  From a procedural point of view, that is the way forward.  If members agree, we could begin the process of completing the analysis that the Minister referenced while that work was being done.  As such, it would not hold up the process.  It would allow us to get into perfecting the report for the select committee.  That is the only decision that we have to make.  There is no final report - it is a draft report, which can be changed by anyone on the committee and agreed by us all.  We still have to make that report.  Otherwise, the select committee cannot make its decision.  As such, can we decide on a date for consideration of the report and the amendments?  That is all we can decide.  Do members wish to do it this week or next week?  I would not mind sitting any day of this week, next week or the week after if it helped to get this matter sorted.</p></speech>

It was section 7, but it seems to have disappeared into thin air.  According to paragraph 24 of that section in the first draft, the committee noted that a detailed impact assessment of the Bill had not been carried out, thus hindering us in our consideration of the Bill.  That was a reasonable conclusion.  As such, is it not reasonable to say that the committee can make a decision to defer our consideration of the report and the Bill pending the preparation of an independent economic impact analysis and the committee's receipt of same?</p></speech>

We can decide later who is going to do the work and let them at it.  Whatever comes out of that work will ultimately influence the committee's report.  There is no benefit in the committee issuing a press release that the Bill has been approved for Committee Stage because nothing is going to happen before mid-September.  The committee might sit a week before the D&aacute;il returns but it will certainly not sit three weeks in advance of that.  It makes sense to agree to the independent economic assessment because that seems to be the view of most members.  The report arising out of that work will influence how the joint committee compiles and finalises its report.  The select committee can then make its decision.</p></speech>

This is ridiculous.  It is a massive stalling tactic to try to scuttle the Bill.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell spoke about being reasonable.  He is being reasonable in the context of doing everything he can to stop the Bill.  Let us call a spade a spade.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019070900002#K00400"><p>No.  We agree with a lot of what is in it.</p></speech>

He is entitled to the opinion he holds in respect of the Bill.  I have a different opinion.  I want the Bill to proceed, although it does need to be amended.</p> <p>  On Thursday, the select committee will take Committee Stage of another piece of my legislation on insurance contracts.  There is further analysis needed on the part of the Department of Finance regarding that Bill but there is reasonableness in the approach of the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, in respect of the Bill.  We have agreed that the Bill to which I refer will go to Committee Stage.  If it passes Committee Stage, it will fall to Sinn F&eacute;in to take Report Stage in its Private Members' time.  I will not take it to Report Stage until that analysis has been done.  We work together to get things done.  That is the approach we should be taking in this committee.  The reality is that for some members here this Bill has proceeded further than they expected.  There is no money message required.  The legal opinion is that it is not unconstitutional and, therefore, it now falls into the laps of Deputies and Senators to decide which side they are on and how we balance all of this.</p> <p>  There are issues in terms of timing and delays.  The Bills Office has to make a final determination, which it cannot do until scrutiny is done and the report is laid.  If we do not lay a report until September, the Bill is further stalled.  Scrutiny is completed.  If we wanted an independent analysis we should have asked for it three months ago.  I do not mind if we have an independent analysis.  I have nothing to fear in that regard.  In terms of scrutiny, we agreed on witnesses, who should give written statements and who should come before us and so on.  We now have an obligation to report.  The fundamental problem is in regard to progress to the next Stage, which is Committee Stage, which we all know is where the principles of the Bill are dissected and amended, some of it fundamentally and some of it in a minor way.  I agree that we should have the independent analysis before that but what is being proposed here is that this Bill cannot progress until the independent analysis is complete.  I do not accept that.  I think that it is wrong.  It is a cute way of trying to scuttle the Bill while at the same time trying to sound reasonable because certain members do not want to be the ones who are blamed for doing nothing while thousands of people are being thrown to the wolves in the form of banks selling to the vultures. </p> <p>  Let us finish the scrutiny, following which a report will be produced.  The scrutiny can make recommendations in regard to the Bill.  By the way, the three observations by the Minister are only his observations.  They are not my view and they are not the view of the legal team either in terms of issues being unsurmountable.  There is a key issue here.</p><p>We need to lay it before the House.  The memorandum of understanding clearly states that the scrutiny report may make recommendations on, for example, what should be amended on Committee Stage.  That is why I have argued that the issue of securitisation needs to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  It also allows the Minister to recommend an independent analysis, which is fair.  The problem is that the Minister is suggesting there be no more progress on the Bill until that analysis has been completed.  In my view, the reason is that he wishes to stop the Bill now rather than at a later stage.</p></speech>

Every member of this committee is entitled to table amendments to that report and have them duly considered in the normal way.  To be fair, the Chairman is upholding the rights of members in that respect.  We have that right and no report can be agreed until those amendments have been adjudicated upon.  To answer Deputy Pearse Doherty's point, if an independent impact assessment concludes that his Bill will have a negative impact on interest rates, mortgage lending or the availability of credit for small and medium enterprises, I will not support it progressing to Committee Stage.  That is the reality.  That is why I want this report done.  Whether we deal with it now, on Thursday or next week, my position is that an independent impact analysis should be completed before the decision is made.  I do not care when we have that debate but I believe my position is very reasonable.  The question that must be adjudicated upon is whether we want to waste two months and do nothing.  I am proposing that the committee agree today that an independent impact assessment get under way as soon as is practicable.  That is what we need to agree today.</p></speech>

The question is whether the committee is happy to accept it and to agree that the independent assessment should proceed before the Bill moves to Committee Stage.

The committee will now take the opening statement of the deputy commissioner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.254" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Twomey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019070900002#N00100"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee for their invitation to attend today.<br/><br/>By way of an introduction, I reiterate that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is determined to tackle insurance fraud.  It has and will continue to invest significant time and resources in doing so.  I have provided an opening statement and propose to run through it in summary form. <br/><br/>By way of background, we have been actively involved in the Government's cost of insurance working group.  Commissioner Harris has met the Minister of State<b></b>at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, on a number of occasions.  Also, senior officers from the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau have actively engaged with industry groups and individual companies for several years.  I am joined here today by Chief Superintendent Pat Lordan who is in charge of the bureau and leads our work in the area.<br/><br/>For our part, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is focused on identifying anyone involved in the making of bogus insurance claims and to maximise the potential to initiate prosecutions.  We believe that the best way of doing this is through a co-ordinated approach on a countrywide basis.  This can best be seen from recent activity under Operation Coatee.  We launched the operation in April of this year and it is focused on the prevention and detection of insurance related fraud and associated crimes.  Recently we had a specific day of action that focused on more than 20 insurance claims that we believed may be fraudulent and which, in some cases, had already involved payment being made to claimants.  Investigations carried out by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau indicate that a number of targets in this operation have submitted multiple claims and in many circumstances while using false identities.  The suspected bogus claims result from false claims of injury sustained through slips and falls.  During the course of the searches additional evidence was gathered with a view to submitting files to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The detectives from GNECB also seized high-value cars and jewellery worth more than &euro;300,000 along with a substantial amount of documentation and financial records.  Additionally, on the same day, a number of search warrants were executed at other locations.  All evidence gathered on the day of action continues to be analysed as we speak.<br/><br/>On an ongoing basis we work to continue to make improvements to our processes, systems and resourcing.  Working closely with Insurance Ireland, updated guidelines for insurance entities on how to report insurance fraud to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were developed, co-signed and published by the GNECB last year. <br/><br/>In October 2018, the Police Using Leading Systems Effectively, PULSE, was updated and insurance fraud and other categories of economic crime were introduced as separate crime categories.  This will enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to monitor trends in the area of economic crime and plan an appropriate response.  <br/><br/>At meetings between Commissioner Harris and the Minister of State, Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy, both parties agreed that private funding of a specialist insurance fraud unit was not the preferred option.  However, discussions have commenced on possible opportunities to provide additional support in the areas of IT software, training and analysis.  Commissioner Harris has also informed the Minister of State that, in line with the overall Garda strategy, the GNECB will focus on major organised frauds, including insurance cases and individual insurance frauds at the centre, and the more complicated investigations will be conducted by the national unit while divisional units will focus on the less complicated cases with either support from the national unit or additional training being provided to them.  <br/><br/>This division-led approach that we talk about is currently being trialled as part of our divisional policing model that is being rolled out in four Garda divisions around the country.</p><p>In addition, the national unit will co-ordinate all ongoing investigations throughout the country.  As the work is ongoing, we can begin to get an idea of the information available and the extent of ongoing investigations.</p><p> It is important that there be sufficient expertise at divisional level.  This year an additional 50 garda&iacute; have been trained.  In the past two years over 130 have been trained throughout the country.  An additional six sergeants and six garda&iacute; were provided for the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau to work in this and other areas related to fraud.  We will extend the competition for places in the bureau and expect it to be run in the second half of the year, with additional resources provided for Chief Superintendent Patrick Lordan and his team.  In the meantime, we continue to develop in-house expertise in investigating insurance related fraud and provide training for the additional garda&iacute;, detective garda&iacute; and detective sergeants.  They receive fraud training as part of their induction training.  Throughout the course experienced fraud investigators provide presentations on both legislation and fraud investigation techniques relevant to economic crime investigations, including the investigation of insurance related fraud.  Representatives from the private sector, including the insurance industry, are also invited to contribute to the course, thereby providing specialist insight into relevant insurance sector related topics.</p><p> The report on the cost of motor insurance recognises that preventing insurance fraud is not the responsibility of one party alone.  This was re-emphasised at the fraud round-table discussion hosted by the Department of Finance.  At the discussion An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na committed to engaging closely with the insurance industry and meet regularly with Insurance Ireland's anti-fraud forum to discuss and act on ongoing issues.  The enhanced co-operation will be very important in the future.</p><p> I will conclude by reiterating my opening comments.  I reassure members of the committee, the insurance industry and the members of the public watching that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to deal with insurance related fraud and that we continue to take this matter very seriously.  I re-emphasise the importance of insurance companies and individuals reporting potential fraud to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As I said, we are determined to identify insurance fraudsters and seek their prosecution.  We commit to doing everything possible to achieve that objective.</p></speech>

Why has the Garda Commissioner not supported such a proposal?  Why is he going with a divisional-led model?  Will Mr. Twomey expand on that?  When he is talking about that, will he expand on the number of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have skills in investigating insurance fraud?  He has made reference to such personnel, but what is the level of expertise within the organisation in respect of accountants and forensic people who have the skill sets to carry out such investigations?  What form do these investigations take?  On the more specific macro point, why is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not establishing a specific unit to deal with the scandal of insurance fraud?</p></speech>

First, the proposal was for a privately funded insurance unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wants to provide a policing service to all members of the public, not just those who provide funding.  We believe our obligation is to provide the service that is needed and not necessarily a service just to those who come forward and pay.  That is as much an ethical issue as anything else.  We in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na need to police the country and we will meet the demands, whatever they are.</p> <p>  This leads me to the second point.  We apply resources depending on the demand.  We are satisfied that there are sufficient resources to deal with the demands we have talked about or the number of claims we have talked about.  As I said at the outset, this area of demand is not the largest of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  The chief superintendent dedicates the resources in that area.  Resources are constantly kept under review.  I talked about the additional resources that would be provided before the end of the year.  These are constantly under review.  The chief superintendent, through his assistant commissioner, will come to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and make a business case for additional resources.  That is why the decision has been taken that somewhere in the region of 35 to 50 additional personnel will be provided to the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau between now and the end of the year.  This is to meet the demand that the chief superintendent has identified.  I refer to the number we are satisfied are required to meet the additional demand.</p></speech>

I refer to the particular issue we are dealing with today.  There may be other cases in consideration in respect of which we have information but have not yet completed our assessment, but I would not expect the number to increase to any great extent over what we are talking about here today.</p> <p>  I will go on to the other part of the question.  It is important to try to understand the structure we use.  We have a national unit that sits at the centre.  It deals with the more complex cases.  There may be an international element or various strands that involve people throughout the country.  In these types of cases, the chief superintendent and his team will direct and lead.  They will provide assistance and expertise to a chief superintendent or superintendent at a divisional level in the less complicated cases.  The more straightforward ones are investigated by individual detective sergeants or detective garda&iacute;.  All of our detective sergeants and detective garda&iacute; are trained on fraud.  They get basic training on fraud.  Over recent years, in the region of 180 garda&iacute; have got specific training on insurance related fraud.  Therefore, we have a tiered response.  We have detective garda&iacute; at the basic level.  At the next level, the figure is in the region of 180.  At the national unit, Detective Chief Superintendent Lordan has in the region of 100 resources available to him.  As I said earlier, the business case for increasing the resources has been approved.</p></speech>

Representatives of the insurance companies were before us last week.  Some of them stated they reckoned up to 20% of claims were fraud related, yet we find that the fraud related complaints referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na account for only 3% of what happened since last October.  There were 1,500 in total, and only 50 of those related to insurance fraud.  There is inconsistency between what we are told by some of the insurance companies and the reality of the complaints.</p><p>Deputy Commissioner Twomey might respond on whether it could arise that it was decided to not allow complaints on fraud received to be regarded as fraud.  Does the figure of 50 fraud matters comprise the cases An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deemed to be fraud?  What is the total number of fraud insurance complaints that were received, some of which might not be deemed to have been in the category of insurance fraud?  I am looking for the total number of reports here.</p></speech>

I do not imagine that there is a considerable increase over that number because the threshold is on the balance of probabilities.  If it is probable that a crime has been committed, we will accept and record it as a crime committed and will commence investigation.  That is different to the investigation, which is on a different balance of probabilities.  The threshold for the recording of a crime is a different threshold than that for the prosecution of the crime.</p> <p>  We have a lot of liaison with the insurance industry and have a very good working relationship with it in dealing with all these claims because we are as intent as is the industry on ensuring that there is no fraud committed.</p></speech>

Going back to the original question of looking for a privately funded unit, the answer to that would be "no".  We would, however, be looking to provide additional resources in the specific area.

The view of the insurance industry is the same.

They have to suspect that a crime has been committed and that they have information to show that.</p> <p>  In fairness to the industry, the 50 cases we talk about could involve quite a substantial number of claimants in each one, as was pointed out by Deputy Commissioner Twomey.  There could be four or six.  We have, for example, one case in which 14 people are involved in one claim.  That could bring the figures up closer to what has been quoted recently as being 600 or 700 cases.  It is still a long way, as the Deputy states, from the 20% figure.</p></speech>

What about the cases we hear of where someone is in court, he or she has been involved in an accident - or may not have been involved where it may have been staged or whatever or he or she has exaggerated the claim - where the judge does not award any compensation or money to him or her and her or she walks out the front door?</p><p>People will state that such individuals were chancing their arms submitting claims which, in fairness, the industry challenged and the judges involved found for the industry by deciding that they were not valid.

There were different versions of how it was reported.  In some cases, it was reported to the Director of Public Prosecutions and other times to the local Garda station.  We told the industry that if the insurer's solicitor is in court and is aware of the facts, the company should be reporting it as a fraudulent claim.  We do not have a garda in court to witness what goes on there.  The onus should be on the solicitor or representative of the insurance company who is in the court to identify a potentially fraudulent case.  We are getting some of those.</p></speech>

I take the point that the Garda does not supervise the courts and so on.  The Houses of the Oireachtas place the onus on the insurance industry and the companies involved to pass the relevant information to the Garda.  In cases where it is beyond the balance of probability and where there has already been adjudication in a court of law, is failure to report not contrary to section 19 in terms of open disclosure?</p></speech>

Our burden of proof is that something must be beyond reasonable doubt in order to allow us to prosecute a criminal case.  We have a couple of those cases on our books at the moment.  When they arrive as complaints, the feeling we get is that they are very easy cases to prosecute.  However, when we dig into it we find that in the civil court in which the insurance company is dealing with it, the complainant is more than likely obliged to get into the witness box and can be challenged on the evidence he gives in court.  In a criminal case, he is not obliged to say anything to us when we knock on his door.  I know of cases where garda&iacute; have called to somebody's door and have been told that the person has nothing to say in respect of the case.  Often, there is not sufficient evidence to make an arrest.</p></speech>

These are cases are dealt with in the civil court, which is different, as we all know, from the criminal court.  An assessment has to be made by the insurance company as to whether, on the balance of probability, it believes that a crime has been committed.  In those instances, the company involved must forward the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  In the context of our ongoing liaison-----</p></speech>

The onus is on the insurance company according to the legislation, which states, "A person shall be guilty of an offence if he or she has information which he or she knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by any other person of a relevant offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any other person for a relevant offence."  The word "person" in that context can refer to a company.  A relevant offence is defined as fraud.  Where a judge adjudicates that a claim is not valid and the insurance company representatives just go back to the office and continues working, the company in question has information that it knows or believes might be of material assistance in the prosecution or apprehension of an individual.</p> <p>  We need to be careful here because they are crimes, obviously.  However, this needs to stop.  We cannot have this revolving door system.  There is also a responsibility on the Garda to impress on the insurance industry that it has a responsibility and that if it is not reporting those cases, it is committing an offence.  The Garda needs to be willing to step up and prosecute the individuals or companies in that regard.</p></speech>

I immediately objected to it.  Regardless of who is paying, private money and the Garda should not mix because of the independence of the Garda and everything that goes with it.  I am glad that is off the table.  We wasted a lot of time in respect of it.  However, I am very concerned at Mr. Twomey's statement that discussions are commencing with the Department of Justice and Equality on possible opportunities where the insurance industry may be asked to provide financial support in areas that could assist insurance fraud investigations, such as IT, software, training and analysis.  Is that not just another version of private money mixing with the Garda?  Why are we going down this road?</p></speech>

Using our crime database, we do a lot of work through analytics to help us be more intelligent and smarter in how we go about our business.  That is really what we are talking about here.  We are considering whether we can use the information currently available to enable us to be more effective in terms of reducing the opportunity to commit crime and improving the possibility of bringing people to justice.</p></speech>

They are not all dedicated to fraud 100% of the time.  That is the world we live in.  We must accept the challenges in front of us.  The economic crime bureau cannot dedicate them to one type of fraud 100% of the time.  Tomorrow morning a company might lose &euro;2 million, in which case we will try our best to get that money back overnight or in the next few days.  We have to prioritise what is in front of us.

It has been impossible to get any data from the Courts Service or the Minister.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, has referred to some cases anecdotally.

I am keen to clear up one point.  There was a sense from some private businesses that they could not report to the Garda in the same way insurance companies could.  At a recent meeting I clarified the matter.  There are plans in place to draw up guidelines for other industries to report if they need to report to us.</p></speech>

He said it represented approximately 4% or 4.5% of gross written premiums, which is a substantial figure, but something does not quite match up, given the low number of referrals.  Perhaps the companies have no confidence that cases can be taken through the system, but that is not necessarily the fault of the Garda.  It could be because of the judicial system or the legal framework or that the burden of proof is so high.  In any case, there seems to be an extraordinary mismatch between the level of fraud in the market about which the companies are telling us and the low level of cases being reported to the Garda.  Does the Garda deputation have any observation to make in that regard?</p></speech>

Many of the insurance companies are utilising their expertise in establishing that a claim may be exaggerated or fraudulent but they may not believe that they have reached the threshold whereby they need to report it to us.  They may figure they will not succeed when they go to the Garda.  Sometimes these cases are four or five years old by the time the companies establish that there is fraud.  There may be no CCTV or telephone records.  They may be relying on someone to talk to us as a witness.  That is difficult to get.</p></speech>

There is a dramatic gap regarding what is reported to the Garda or any other police force throughout the world.  In the statistics worldwide, fraud is one of the most under-reported crimes.  This is primarily because the level of fraud has increased dramatically.  Even in Ireland, the figures for the first three months of this year show an increase of 28% in the amount of fraud reported.</p></speech>

Would companies not like those involved to be publicly accused in court and eventually convicted of insurance fraud?  Would it not be in the direct financial interest of the companies to ensure this happens?  Yet, those companies are referring few cases to the Garda.  After last week's events, I suspect that may change in the period ahead.  They might need to look at extra resources in this area because of a sense of obligation to refer more cases in the aftermath of this meeting and that which took place last week.  It is difficult to understand why they have not done so up to now.</p></speech>

A threshold is required even to start an investigation never mind getting to the stage of preparing a file for the Director of Public Prosecutions and succeeding with a prosecution.  It is difficult for the insurance companies, banks or anyone else dealing with the financial world to reach that threshold.</p></speech>

The figure quoted earlier was approximately 3%.  It is there or thereabouts.  However, there are other areas of fraud in the insurance world that we deal with as well.  Ghost brokering is prominent at the moment.  This is an area in respect of which we deal with insurance companies on a regular basis.  We have dedicated people in our traffic unit in Dublin Castle and they are dealing with hundreds of cases of such fraud or ghost brokering.</p></speech>

I am referring to the case of someone having an insurance claim for a trip or a slip in a nightclub while at the same time it is the talk of the town that the same person is going on holidays and bungee jumping.  Insurance companies use private investigators in some cases like that.  What can an ordinary member of the public do in the case of a known insurance fraud?

There is no mechanism to disclose concerns about somebody anonymously.</p></speech>

We have to have a statement of complaint.  There are some cases where we have become aware of information ourselves.  In those cases we will go and investigate.  Primarily, however, the simple method for investigating a complaint involves a complaint being made to us.  There are opportunities and times, however, where we will pursue evidence and information that we come across ourselves.  A balance needs to be maintained between complaints being made to us and anonymous complaints.</p></speech>

If someone is aware of information, however, he or she will often not want other people to be aware that a complaint has been made.  The insurance companies have told us about examples, and I am sure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has examples, of one family being incredibly accident prone, to put it mildly.  That could also apply to certain parts of a city or the country being much more involved with accidents.  We hear of "Prime Time" type scenarios where 30, 40 or 50 accidents have been staged by or at least involved one family.  In that case, there is no way for people to make complaints without being brought to court.</p></speech>

Those are some of the investigations about which we have been talking.  The day of action in April that we spoke about earlier focused on some of the very issues to which the Deputy has referred.  The information and databases the insurance companies have provide the opportunity for those particular cases to be notified to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and those are the analytics of which I have spoken.</p></speech>

If an insurance company is aware of these things and does not bring that information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is that company guilty of an offence?  I am referring to the company not bringing the information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and allowing it to make a judgment concerning how far to go with a complaint.</p><p>If an insurance company has 60,000 claims and rejects 10,000 of them, it has rejected them for a reason.  They have been rejected because it does not believe them.  In many instances, the people who made them have walked away and lived with it.  The insurance company is aware of the situation and has made a decision not to pay out.  The people involved have walked away, but should all of the 10,000 claims not go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for assessment?  I appreciate that there would be an administrative and staff burden, but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should investigate many more cases of fraud.</p></speech>

If companies are of the view that there is a breach, they are obliged to report it to us.  That is the purpose of the section.  That is a consideration the insurance companies have to make.  I will flip it the other way around and pose the question as to what is the rationale for the companies not forwarding the information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Are they satisfied that the cases are not beyond the threshold set out in section 19?</p></speech>

We hear of cases involving diligent business owners who are facing claims where someone claims to have slipped.  Video footage then appears which shows one friend hitting another in a fight and that was how a tooth was knocked out, for example, and all of a sudden the people involved in the claim walk away.  Should not all such cases be investigated?</p></speech>

We do not see the details of cases that are settled or those that go to court.  The one thing about CCTV footage is that if a person trips or falls and he or she states he or she has hurt his or her leg, unless he or she does something to make a claim, the incident will not reach the stage of prosecution.</p><p>The person has to progress to putting in a claim or doing something to make the effort.  Often, if it is called out at a very early stage, one is left with a scenario where a person states that he tripped on the footpath but actually he may have had a few drinks, tripped on the footpath and then walked away.  The person will not have made an affidavit, a statement or a complaint at that stage.  Some of those are quite difficult.

The majority of these cases are not even reported to the Garda when the accident occurs.  It is reported, maybe as a minor accident, and then a couple of months later the five or six claims are submitted to the insurance company.  In most of these cases, there is no camera because it will be the culprit's car.  If the driver is working together with another party, they will make sure that they do not have any cameras in their cars.  They will also make sure that the accidents will not occur where there is any CCTV.  Historically, they were not as good at that.  Operation Nascar in Cork covered that fairly well but now we find that they are careful about selecting the location of where they will have their accidents.</p></speech>

There are a number of areas that the revised divisional policing model has focused on.  It has streamlined the administrative process to free up garda&iacute; to be redeployed to the front line.  It has also streamlined the investigation of serious crime.  There is now a detective superintendent in that area who has responsibility for the investigation of serious crime.  Heretofore, that crime was investigated by each of the individual superintendents.  Now, the more serious crime is allocated to a detective superintendent who co-ordinates the investigation.  That enables the district officer to focus on providing the front-line response service to local communities.  It is making the whole process within the community more efficient.  As part of that, the resources are reporting to the detective superintendent.  Additional training is being provided from the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau with that support coming from the centre.</p></speech>

In areas such as Cork, there is a dedicated unit to investigate fraud, such is the demand there.  In other areas, such is the demand that it is believed there are sufficient resources to investigate without having to dedicate people full time.  It varies from case to case and in every Garda division.  It varies dependent on the demand.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to discuss with the committee the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (Specified Bodies) Regulations 2019.  My officials have provided committee members with briefing material for use at this meeting.</p><p>These regulations will support an important anti-money laundering measure, the central register of beneficial ownership, which will identify who is behind a corporate entity.  The regulations prescribe the new position of registrar of beneficial ownership of companies and industrial and provident societies as a specified body for the purposes of Schedule 5 to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  This will enable the registrar to collect personal public service numbers to verify the identity of persons who have ultimate control of a company, ensuring that the central register is accurate, and to prevent individuals who would think of trying to conceal their identity for the purpose of money laundering or financing terrorism from doing so.  The PPSN will not be visible to the registrar, staff within the registry of beneficial ownership or any member of the public.  The PPSN will never be shared with any State or non-State competent authorities or with any third party.</p><p>Members will be aware of company law and the concept of directors of a company.  A beneficial owner is the natural person who ultimately owns or controls a legal entity through direct or indirect ownership or through control via other means.  Thus, simply because someone is a director on paper does not mean in practice that the person ultimately controls the company.  Recital 25 of the EU fourth anti-money laundering directive highlights the importance of beneficial ownership information.  It states:</p><blockquote>The need for accurate and up-to-date information on the beneficial owner is a key factor in tracing criminals who might otherwise be able to hide their identity behind a corporate structure.  The globally interconnected financial system makes it possible to hide and move funds around the world, and money launderers and terrorist financers as well as other criminals have increasingly made use of that possibility.</blockquote> <p>To prevent this criminality the EU fourth and fifth anti-money laundering directives, also known as 4 and 5 AMLD, legally oblige Ireland to establish and maintain a central register of beneficial ownership of companies and industrial and provident societies.  This central register, known as the RBO, is the first in a series.  Others are currently being finalised for trusts and for Irish collective asset management vehicles or ICAVs.  Crucially, Article 30(4) of 4 AMLD means there is an EU law obligation on Ireland to ensure that the central register is accurate.</p><p>PPSN use is seen as critical to the success of the RBO as it will prevent multiple variations of the same person's details from being entered in the register.  While a mechanism will be in place for beneficial owners who do not have a PPSN, the vast majority of beneficial owners already have a PPSN, particularly for tax purposes.  A practical example of why such verification is needed is the charity Console.  In 2016, when concerns were raised over the governance and financial management of this particular charity, it was identified that the former chief executive and his wife were connected to 12 companies.  However, in official documentation submitted to the Companies Registration Office different dates of birth and signatures were provided at the time, along with use of a maiden name for some entries and a married name for others.  I expect members will agree that this is not something we want to see recur.  The online register, combined with PPSN verification, will ensure that such scenarios are prevented.  To ensure personal information is protected the PPSNs are encrypted, not visible to RBO staff and are used only at a specific point in time, that is to say, the point of filing, to validate the PPSN and date of birth against the data that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection holds for that personal public service number.</p><p>Where there is not a match, whether by accident or intent, that beneficial owner information cannot be filed.  The PPSN will not be visible to staff within the RBO or the CRO because it will be stored in encrypted form.  RBO staff and officials from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation have worked closely with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect personal information and that there is a lawful reason for processing the PPSN data.</p><p> While the obligation to file with the RBO is new, relevant entities have been required to hold such beneficial ownership information since the introduction of the European Communities (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations in 2016.  The RBO and filing requirements are provided for in S.I. No. 110 of 2019 -  the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019.  Under this statutory instrument, the RBO has been established since 22 June last.</p><p>While the staff and ICT infrastructure of the CRO have been utilised in the technical development of the RBO, S.I. No. 110 of 2019 provides for a new statutory office of Registrar of Beneficial Ownership of Companies and Industrial and Provident Societies.  Therefore, while the CRO is a specified body under Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, following legal advice and to ensure legal certainty, the current regulations designate the Registrar of Beneficial Ownership of Companies and Industrial and Provident Societies explicitly and separately as a specified body for the purposes of PPSN.  As such, the opening of the RBO has been postponed to allow for the necessary consultation to be undertaken with both Houses of the Oireachtas and, following referral, this committee.</p><p> This is a matter of urgency.  Already we are facing fines from the European Commission, which has referred the matter to the European Court of Justice, so it is imperative that we get this through as quickly as we can.  Almost all European states are working on this; some of them are delayed as we are.  While all previous designations have been done by way of primary legislation, given the need to resolve this issue as a matter of urgency, to allow the central register to open, the most appropriate course of action is for the RBO to be designated by means of a statutory instrument.  The 2005 Act allows for a "specified body" to be prescribed by statutory instrument and these regulations provide the most appropriate course of action to facilitate the opening of the central register in order to minimise the impact of wider infringement proceedings against Ireland for failure to transpose all aspects of the anti-money laundering directive, 4AMLD.  I wish to advise the committee that this statutory instrument will be temporary and that the regulations will be confirmed in primary legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.</p><p> The collection and maintenance of beneficial ownership information is an EU requirement and part of larger efforts by Ireland internationally to combat money laundering, organised crime and terrorism.  Beyond this, the RBO is a mark of Ireland as a global, modern and open country promoting best international standards in transparency, business and the globally interconnected financial system.</p></speech>

A number of colleagues have questions.  We will start with Deputy O'Dea.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-09a.552" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019070900002#D00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  We live in an era when our privacy is under constant threat but sometimes we have to make concessions in that regard for the greater good.  The Minister of State made a couple of points that are fairly central to why we should not oppose this.</p><p>On the second page of his submission, he states: "Article 30 paragraph 4 of 4AMLD means there is an EU legal obligation on Ireland to ensure that the Central Register is accurate".  The experts tell us that personal public service, PPS, numbers are necessary in order to ensure the accuracy of the central Register of Beneficial Ownership, which is an anti-money laundering device.  The Minister of State also states: "To ensure personal information is protected, the PPSN is encrypted, not visible to RBO staff and is used only at a specific point in time (i.e. at the point of filing) to validate the PPSN and date of birth against the data that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection hold for that PPSN".  I am glad he has given that assurance and I hope it will be honoured.</p><p> The Minister of State went on to say at the end of his presentation that this is a temporary device to prevent the EU from fining us and will ultimately be confirmed in primary legislation.  As such, the best time to have a detailed debate on this is in debates on the primary legislation.</p></speech>

The data-sharing agreement has been put in place with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It includes an encryption process.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has been informed of this and has carried out an impact assessment.  I must emphasise that all Register of Beneficial Ownership, RBO, staff are trained on the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  Further information is available in the privacy statement.</p> <p>  On the primary legislation, we are trying to get this through as quickly as we can because we are under serious pressure from the EU.  I know we allocated half an hour to this.  The Commission itself has criticised us for not getting this through.  We will bring primary legislation to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  All Members will be allowed to debate it in its entirety and move amendments if they wish.  I, or probably some other Minister, will have detailed information on all aspects of this legislation.</p></speech>

We are working on it and our intention is to put it before the D&aacute;il as quickly as possible.  The basis of the legislation is a short agreement on the issues I have outlined.  It must be more detailed and address personnel, what other countries are doing and the definition of beneficial ownership.  It is likely to be part of a larger piece of legislation.  We are working as feverishly as we can to get this to the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

To be honest, I have not seen it.  It pertains to the larger piece of legislation.</p><p>I will say that the only certain way of finding beneficial ownership is through a person's liability to tax and their PPS number.  This information gives a name and address and verification and that is why we are putting such emphasis on it.  There are difficulties around the privacy of a person's PPS number but we have done an assessment on it.  We collaborate with the Department to verify who a person is and where he or she lives.</p></speech>
