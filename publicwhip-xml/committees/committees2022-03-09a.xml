    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1570" speakername="Patrick Costello" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#A00300"><p>No apologies have been received.  Once again I welcome the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, and his officials to today's meeting.  I will start with the usual note on privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contributions, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  Please note that in order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19 the service encourages all Members, visitors and witnesses to continue wearing face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others.  We ask them to please be respectful of other people's physical space.  They are also asked to adhere to any public health advice.</p> <p>  I remind members that, should a vote be called, they must physically come to the committee room in order to vote.  We will now resume consideration of the Bill on amendment No. 140.  As the discussion on the amendment has already taken place, we will go straight to putting the question in a moment.  I remind everybody, including me, that as we move through amendments I will hear from the group of proposers of the amendment and then input from any members of the committee who wish to comment before getting a response from the Minister.  We can then move to putting the question on the amendment.  Amendment No. 140 was discussed with many other amendments.</p></speech>

In such a case, this new insertion in the Bill would seek that the authority would seize all records relating to the relevant person's adoption or an illegal birth registration and open an investigation.  It is crucial that adoptees know what transpired and that the authority should make every attempt to keep those persons informed.</p></speech>

The amendment seeks to include a definition of personal data in the Bill.  As we already have a definition of personal data - the definition used in the general data protection regulation - we do not propose to accept a new and different definition of personal data.  I do not accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The amendments are intended as a safeguard to ensure that Tusla provides records and not just information from the records.  It is a key concern for people that they may not be given the actual record but information extracted from it.  We are concerned that categories of information are open to a range of different interpretations.  Given people's experiences in the past and how this has been handled in the past, there is a fear that personal data will be held back.</p><p> Amendment No. 151 seeks to change the language so that data controllers are not given a get-out clause under the legislation.  Amendment No. 152 is very similar to amendments Nos. 148 and 150.  Amendments Nos. 153 and 154 concern the provision in the Bill to provide a statement setting out the information contained in records, as opposed to a full schedule of records as required under GDPR.  If a person is not provided with a full schedule of records, he or she will not be able to ascertain what is being held back.  This, in turn, may inhibit the person's ability to know about records that have been withheld.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#B00300"><p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 148 to 154, inclusive, collectively.  The first issue is around the discussion on the release of records as opposed to information.  I seek to reassure Deputies now, as I have on a number of similar amendments previously, that we are not just releasing information; we are releasing copies of the records.  This is provided for in relation to birth information, care information and medical information.  It will not just be a summary of what is on the records available but copies of those records.  I do not believe the sections of these amendments seeking to insert the word "records" is necessary, as that issue is already provided for.  Copies of records will be provided and that is already provided for throughout the legislation.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 154 proposes the provision of a schedule.  Again, I argue that this is covered by section 11(2)(b), which sets out a statement outlining the records and categories of information to be released and which will be issued.  As I understand it, this is the same as the intention of amendment No. 154.  I believe, therefore, that this point is already covered in the legislation.  On that basis, I do not believe these amendments are necessary and I cannot accept them.</p></speech>

The amendments are very similar to the group we discussed previously in the context of people's personal data and people having the fundamental right under EU law to access those data, not merely the information contained in a record.  The amendments seek to strengthen the Bill to ensure every effort is made to provide adoptees with their records and not just the information contained within the records, which are two entirely different things.</p><p>Apart from the fact that this restriction is in breach of GDPR, there is also a real danger of vital medical information being withheld by not providing a full schedule of records, and instead only providing information that is in the records, to the affected persons.  We also consider it inevitable that complaints will be made to the Data Protection Commission.</p><p>There is concern that the Bill seeks to set out the information contained in records as opposed to a full schedule of records, as required under GDPR.  If a person is not provided with a full schedule of records, he or she will not be able to ascertain what has been held back and this will inhibit the person's ability to know about records that have been withheld.</p><p>Amendment No. 164 seeks to broaden the scope of the data controller and requires that the data controller make every effort to locate, and provide the applicant with, all information relating to him or her.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.50" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#B02300"><p>I will deal with amendment No. 164 separately.</p> <p>  My response is the same as that to the previous set of amendments.  The Bill provides for copies of records to be supplied to anybody who applies under this legislation.  The proposed provision is not necessary because the goal, one that we share, that people get full copies of their records and not just information is already provided for in the Bill.</p> <p>  Amendment No 164 seeks to put an obligation on a body to seek out records that it does not have.  If Tusla does not have information about a relevant person when the person applies, this proposed provision would place a statutory obligation on Tusla to look for that information elsewhere.  Tusla's focus needs to be on getting the information it has and providing that to adopted people.  Thousands of people will seek that information.  To provide a statutory obligation on Tusla to look for information it does not have and which it does not know even exists is incredibly uncertain.  To make this a statutory obligation, when there is no certainty that the obligation could ever be fulfilled, is not the best use of Tusla's resources.  For this reason, I cannot accept this group of amendments.</p></speech>

Recommendation 14 states:</p> <blockquote> 	All information is part of an adopted person's history and heritage and must be included in the records provided to them, including: information relevant to treatment, including medical records and evidence of possible abuse[.] </blockquote> <p>The proposer may correct me but I read the amendment as saying that persons who apply should have made available to them all medical records, regardless of whether they have explicitly requested a particular medical record.  That is of value because persons seeking medical records may not know, for example, that they had a vaccine test administered to them as children.  Unfortunately, that is often the case and I have met individuals for whom that has been an issue.  They may not know that and they may not know to request that record.  This amendment seeks to ensure they would get access to particular aspects of medical records they may not have known to apply for.</p><p>There may be a better way to draft the amendment to ensure that is its effect.  It should not be read as denying agency but as ensuring that a person gets the fullest of information available without needing to apply for specific types of information.  I am thinking specifically of vaccine trials.</p></speech>

The Bill currently uses the words "relevant to the health" of an affected person.   In cases where you have a diagnosis of something, you understand what you are looking for, but many people will just want their or their family's medical history and will not know specifically what they are looking for.  The fact that it is restricted to what is "relevant to the health" is our difficulty.</p></speech>

It does not provide for forcing records on anybody or insist they see them.  It sounded like the Minister took it like that.  Does he agree that all records should be made available at that time?  Is there a better way we could word the amendment in order that he would be agreeable to it?</p></speech>

Vaccines are covered either under the medical information category or the early life category.  The amendment states "When a relevant person applies under sections 11 and 12 for information".  Section 11 deals with the "Relevant body to provide early life, care information or incorrect birth registration information".  Section 12 again concerns early life or care information.  The amendment seeks to ensure that when adopted persons look for early life and care information, they also get medical information, whether they applied for it or not.  There is already a right to apply for information in the legislation.  That will provide all medical information about the person that is on file.  This seeks to tie the release of medical information to other categories of information when the person has not sought it.</p></speech>

I do not think people distinguish medical information from care information in the instance of, for example, an illegal vaccine trial being carried out on him or her while in care.  That is what adopted people are calling for.  They would see it as part of their early life or care information if they were subject to something like an illegal vaccine trial while in an institution.  Making their medical information available when they seek information is the purpose of the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#D00700"><p>The debate is touching on the important issue of the degree of overlap between different categories of information.  For people who were adopted or held in care, we tried to capture in the report that early life and care information encompasses so much about a person's medical history, from vaccine trials to, for example, abuse, genetic background and circumstances of birth.  It may be difficult in practice to distinguish between those categories of information.  That is the issue here.</p> <p>  We sought in the report to ensure that people would have access to and be provided with all information about themselves.  That is part of respecting and giving effect to a person's right to identity.  It would cover not just names of their birth parents, but also all the other early life and care information.  The Minister is also trying to capture it in that definition but the amendment seeks to ensure that all that information is covered and the person is not inadvertently blocked from receiving particular information because he or she thinks it is in one category when, as the Minister said, it could be covered under early life and care information rather than medical information.</p></speech>

It is clear that it covers all elements of such information.  When we undertake the information campaign about what material people can apply for under this legislation and particularly when we provide the documentation for people to make an application, we can make it clear what is set out under the categories.  We will make it clear what medical information is.  Where adopted people wish to get their medical information they will be able to see it.  We will make it simple so that people can tick the boxes for medical information, birth certificate, birth information and care information.</p> <p>  There may be circumstances in which people do not wish to get all their information.  This amendment ties medical information to release of other categories of information so that people do not have a choice.  We should give adopted people the choice of what sort of information they apply for.  In the vast majority of situations, adopted people will apply for all the categories of information but it is their decision and we should not tie the release of one sort of information to another, if it is not what they seek.</p></speech>

The information campaign and the guidelines may well clarify the issues but in the section 2 definitions of "early life information" and "medical information" there is a clear overlap.  It will be important, as we said in pre-legislative scrutiny, for adopted persons seeking to access records on early life information and medical information that the guidelines are accessible and that everyone seeking to apply for information would be clear on what was meant by early life information as distinct from medical information.</p> <p>  Early life information clearly covers medical information.  The definition in section 2 includes "information on any medical treatments, procedures or vaccinations".  As the Minister said, that would cover vaccine trials and information relating to his or her medical history.  There is an overlap and medical information is included in early life information.  It will be important that the information campaign and the guidelines make clear what is covered in each category and what people are applying for.  There should be a box which somebody could simply tick for all of the information.</p></speech>

My understanding from the initial work the team has done is that there is an all information box that can be achieved there.  The Deputy is correct that there is overlap in the definitions.  Throughout all our discussions here I have said that we have designed the definitions expansively.  We are keeping them wide so we can take in as much information as possible in order that adopted people are entitled to as much information as possible.  We designed them to be wide on purpose, and I believe that is positive.</p></speech>

Information that is relevant to a person's health is subject to change over time.  The affected person should not have to wait until he or she is seriously ill before seeking out relevant family medical history.  Amendment No. 198 is similar.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 183 and 184 propose to delete the wording &quot;to which the application relates only&rdquo; from the information that should be provided to affected people.  We believe this represents a restriction on the information provided.  For example, if someone has cancer and as a result applies for a family medical history, according to the Bill only medical information relating to cancer will be given.  What if information relating to heart disease or another medical condition is available on the file?  This is particularly relevant for hereditary conditions that an adopted person may have, and would not know to ask for.</p><p>Amendment No. 186 proposes to delete the requirement for the information to be provided to a medical practitioner.  The Department's data protection impact assessment states that this measure is necessary in order to mitigate the risks of a genetic relative being identified.  Any identifying information, however, will have already been removed, so the requirement to release the information to a medical practitioner is completely unnecessary and an unnecessary breach of the affected person's privacy.</p><p>Amendment No. 188 seeks to give children under the age of 16 the right to their medical information through an application made by their adoptive parents.</p></speech>

It speaks to one of the key issues raised by adopted people, namely, that they are denied information about their medical history that could be relevant to their health and that this occurs because they do not know who their parents are and they do not know their family medical history.  It is very important to remember what we are providing for here.  We are providing for a person to have a legal right to somebody else's medical information, which is the medical information of a third party.  In the discussions on this, we all understand that the equivalence is drawn by saying we would know if our mothers had heart disease, a hereditary cancer or something like that.  In most cases, that would be the case but none of us here has a legal right to our mother's or father's medical information.  If a parent chose to withhold something from us for whatever reason, bizarre as that may seem, he or she has a right to do so.</p> <p>  We are providing for an adopted person to have a legal right to the medical information of somebody else.  That limits the privacy rights of the other person.  If we are to allow that interference with another person's privacy rights, some protections must be provided.  The protections are that the information being given to the adopted person about his or her parent is relevant to the adopted person's health.  Let us be very clear, "relevant" is not limited to a question about one illness or disease.  "Relevant" means it is relevant to the person's health.  Any genetic or hereditary condition that is on file about the parent falls within the definition of relevant and would be conveyed to the adopted person.</p> <p>  The second protection, which we will also cover later, is that this information is not conveyed directly to the adopted person but it would be conveyed to a medical practitioner in order that there will be an intermediary in the provision of such information.  This is not the case when we are talking about the adopted person's own medical records, for which full release is provided, as we discussed earlier.</p> <p>  This provision is a dramatic but necessary interference with the privacy rights of the parents in these circumstances.  When the medical information of the parents is shared with somebody else without consent or permission being given, there must be protections around that.  We have engaged significantly with the Office of the Attorney General and the Data Protection Commission, and we have also spoken to mothers.  The mothers who spoke to the committee raised their concerns about their medical information being released.</p> <p>  The protections provided are that the information conveyed must be relevant to the adopted person's health, with the word "relevant" being interpreted broadly, and that the process will involve the information being given to the adopted person's medical practitioner.  I believe these two safeguards are necessary and will allow for the limitation of the privacy rights of the parent.  This is what we have been advised legally from a data protection position.  It also reflects the concerns about this particular point raised by the mothers who appeared before the committee.</p> <p>  I am not able to accept these amendments.  To do so would put at risk the entire goal we are trying to achieve, namely, to enable adopted persons to get health information that is relevant to them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#G01600"><p>I move amendment No. 189:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 24, line 2, to delete &ldquo;to which the application relates only&rdquo;. </blockquote> <p>This is similar to what we were discussing, so I do not wish to be repetitive.  One of the key things in this regard, however, is what people might interpret as information &quot;relevant to health&quot;.  As Deputy Ward said, when I read this provision I see it as potentially restrictive.  The Minister, though, has said that he sees this as referring to the health of the person concerned and that he or she should be able to access all of his or her information.  Since the subject access request forms have been available, I have found that my constituents seeking information have achieved a good level of success with them.  I have encountered one or two cases, however, and I have contacted Ms McGarrigle a few times in this regard, where people have received documents where everything has been redacted.  I have come across people who had been looking for records for 40 years and got them and it was fantastic and great that they were able to get that information.  I have also met people, however, who were left much more frustrated when they got ten or 12 pages of information, but where only three or four lines were intelligible because so much was redacted.  In those cases, people tend to ponder what information exists about them because they wonder why so many pages have such little information.</p><p>I gave that example to show what can happen when something is potentially left open to interpretation and how one group of officials can respond to a request by deciding to agree to give all the information, while others can refuse and decide they do not believe the person making the request is entitled to the information being sought.  That is why we are so focused on the language of &quot;relevant to the health&quot; of a relevant or qualifying person and this is important.  It reads to me and others as if information may only be relevant if people know what they are looking for.  I refer to a situation where a person might potentially have a diagnosis of cancer or could be going for a battery of tests, but is not yet 100% sure of the prognosis.  It is for that reason that we are so focused on this aspect of the legislation.</p><p>The Minister might say something different about this phrasing, but I think it is still open to interpretation.  I do not want to go over everything we have said again, but this is why, similar to what Deputy Bacik said earlier, we believe the provision of information should not be restricted to it being &quot;relevant to the health&quot; of a relevant or qualifying person.  It is, unfortunately, open to interpretation and it would be possible to have very willing and accommodating officials, but, equally, other officials who might think very differently.  That is why we believe this is the opportunity to ensure that the legislation is strengthened in that regard.  If the Minister is of the same belief, I do not see why he could not accept some of the amendments in this grouping.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#G01700"><p>As I read them, what this group of amendments is seeking to do is to remove the requirement to provide the relevant medical information to the relevant medical practitioner, who will then provide it to the relevant person.  I see that as what this set of amendments aims to do.</p> <p>  Turning to the Deputy's point concerning consistency in this context, she is right that it is vital and that is why there is the ability to publish guidelines under this legislation and for those guidelines to be revised if elements of inconsistency are seen to be creeping into the application of the legislation.  This aspect is fundamentally important.  A later set of amendments seeks to limit the power to issue guidelines and I will be opposing those as well.  Guidelines are the manner in which we can see the achievement of the required consistency.</p> <p>  This set of amendments is concerned with deleting the second level of protection in respect of interference with the privacy rights of a parent.  The first level of protection is the provision that the information requested is relevant information about the adopted person's health and the second level protection is that the information is conveyed to the medical practitioner.  We have been advised that these are the necessary measures to balance the significant interference in the privacy rights of the parent.  It is worth repeating that we are giving the adopted person a legal right to access the medical information of another person, without that other person's consent.  It is a big step.  It must be taken, but it is a big step and some level of protection must be put in place.  This aspect of the legislation is one of those protections and therefore I cannot accept amendments seeking to delete it.</p></speech>

It is part of the difficulty when amendments are grouped and we are limited to just discussing those in the group.  This group, though, is very much linked to the previous group, namely, amendments Nos. 182 to 188, inclusive.</p> <p>  Regarding the proposed guidelines, because this topic has come up a good bit in recent meetings, I request that we be able to have a look at those guidelines before Report Stage, if that is possible.  It would mean that we could know exactly what is in them and, as the Minister said, perhaps some of our concerns might be addressed in them.  It would be useful and helpful to us if we could be provided with a copy of those proposed guidelines before Report Stage.</p></speech>

The team has been focused on addressing the significant body of work in front of the committee now.  We can look perhaps at getting some draft heads of the guidelines for the committee, or something like that.  We will do our best for the committee in that regard, but a significant body of work is ongoing in this context and we were going to use the three-month period of the information campaign to finalise the guidelines.  We will, however, seek to get a draft copy of the guidelines to the committee to give some indication of the level of detail we are seeking to implement in them and, hopefully, that will provide some element of reassurance.</p></speech>

We are all conscious that a significant workload is involved in doing that, but, at the same time, the issues we have been debating in many of these amendments could well be addressed through the guidelines.  Therefore, it would be of great assistance to us and, more importantly, to those who are concerned to see this legislation enacted for their own use and application.  It would be of great benefit to have even some idea of what the guidelines will include.</p></speech>

As I said, however, we will endeavour to get drafts of the guidelines to the committee.  It must be recognised, though, that those will only be drafts of the guidelines and that they will be subject to change, but we can listen to the views of the committee in that regard as well.  To reiterate, what we will be providing will be the heads of the proposed guidelines rather than the detailed information.</p></speech>

That provision does not restrict the Minister in deciding who to consult regarding drafting the guidelines and, therefore, the amendment is not necessary.  Section 16(7) already gives the Minister the power to consult widely in drafting the guidelines.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for an information meeting with adopted people aged between 16 and 18 years who have applied for their information.  Our position is that this meeting must only be provided if requested by the adopted person in question.  It must be provided by a service of the adopted person's choosing.  It should not be conducted by a social worker and the person holding the meeting should not attempt to influence the adopted person in any way.  If the adopted person requests emotional or psychological support, it should be provided by a service of his or her choosing, as we have set out for section 18.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#J00800"><p>We made a decision when bringing forward this legislation that we did not want to define just for those people aged 18 and above and we wanted to recognise that younger people who were adopted also have an interest in their birth and early life information.  We wanted to make provision for that.  Issues are different when we are not dealing with adults and we engaged quite significantly.  In particular, we consulted with the Ombudsman for Children to ensure the appropriate provisions were put into the Bill and the section we are discussing here has been developed in consultation with the children's ombudsman.  The Ombudsman for Children has confirmed that the supportive meeting we are proposing in this Bill that allows for the release of information for those who are aged 16 and 17 is a necessary protection for younger people.</p> <p>  Under section 18 of the Bill, a person aged 16 or 17 seeking identity information will have that information released through a supportive meeting with the help of a suitably qualified person.  In addition, the applicant - the adopted person seeking the information - may be accompanied by a person of his or her choosing.  The meeting can take place in person or virtually as preferred.  This mechanism is designed to ensure there is an additional layer of support available to younger applicants and those who are not adults at the point of receiving and assimilating the information.  Given the clear opinion of the Ombudsman for Children on the provision, I will not accept an amendment that seeks to remove such a meeting.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 204 suggests that nobody in the meeting should try to influence the relevant person in any way with respect to his or her view on the adoption.  This language is very imprecise and it is unclear what constitutes influence.  It is defined in such a way that virtually any interaction between the younger person and the suitably qualified person could be construed as influence.  Again, matters relating to the conduct of these meetings can be dealt with through guidance and guidelines rather than through statutory provision.</p> <p>  A second element of amendment No. 204 requires that a person facilitating a supportive meeting should provide details of emotional or psychological supports upon request.  Again, that provision of support to relevant persons is already provided for under section 57 of the Bill.</p><p>We do not feel it necessary to repeat it.</p></speech>

This group of amendments removes the phrase &quot;to which the application relates only&quot; from the information that should be provided to relatives of deceased adopted people as this represents a restriction on the information provided.  For example, if a relative of a deceased adopted person has cancer and as a result had applied for a family medical history, according to the Bill only medical information relating to cancer will be given.  What if information in relating to heart disease or another medical condition is available on the file?  I believe I have discussed this already with the Minister and I am repeating myself.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 232 to 234, inclusive, concern the provision that only information that is relevant to the health of the relevant person will be released.  Amendment No. 233 removes the requirement for the information to be provided to the medical practitioner.  The Department's data protection impact assessment states that this measure is necessary in order to mitigate the risks of a genetic relative being identified.  However, as any identifying information will already have been removed, the requirement to release the information to a medical practitioner is completely unnecessary.</p><p>Amendment No. 235 ensures the location of all medical information that is available on file.</p><p>Amendment No. 236 ensures that a person with expertise in reading documents is involved in the process.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 240 and 241 widen the definition of a record by including that which relates to any relevant person and in section 2 the Bill defines a relevant person as someone who may apply to Tusla for information.  These two amendments further strengthen the Bill's ability to ensure that records, data and information are not withheld by any means.</p></speech>

Again, this section was designed in consultation with both the Office of the Attorney General and the Data Protection Commissioner.  That is important in the context of making provision for what we want to achieve here, which is the release of information.  We get the release of this information but it is conditional on the medical history being relevant to the applicant's own medical history.  We have discussed earlier on the definition of relevance and how relevance can be expanded upon in guidelines, but it is relevant to hereditary conditions and not relevant to one specific illness or disease.</p> <p>  Second, this information will be conveyed through the relevant person's GP and that is again a necessary protection put in to recognise the sensitivity of providing a person with somebody else's medical information.  I am not in a position to accept this set of amendments.</p></speech>

Without getting caught up in semantics, we know without doubt who the relevant person is.  It is the applicant who is looking for this information.  I repeat the point that we still do not know what is deemed relevant to the health of that person.  I hope the guidelines and all of the other matters that are laid out will make that a great deal clearer.  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

This originates in the understandable distrust adopted people and survivors have for State bodies.  They are seeking the assurance of as broad a definition as possible to prevent the lack of access they have been presented with for decades.  These amendments seek to insert such broader definitions.  </p><p>Amendment No. 247 seeks to remove the entirely inappropriate and ambiguous term &quot;to the extent that it is practicable to do so&quot;.  We must call that phrase out as a get-out clause.  It is a worrying element of the Bill, which does not provide unfettered access, as everybody keeps claiming it does.  It is a barrier, plain and simple.  At a previous meeting, the Minister assured us that all of this Bill was carefully fine-tuned in accordance with engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General, which was integral to the Bill.  The phrase &quot;to the extent that it is practicable to do so&quot; is far from finely tuned and it is important to point that out.  I hope I am wrong but there is no doubt in my mind that such a phrase in the legislation will be used as an obstacle for people using their personal information.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 248 and 249 seek to remove another restrictive aspect of the Bill.  The amendments remove the option for the relevant body to provide what is essentially a summary or list of information and insist on the provision of the full range of records held about the applicant.  If this Bill is about enabling full and complete access, this is another section that needs changing.</p><p>Similarly, amendments Nos. 250 and 251 remove the relational statement &quot;a record of such class as the Minister may prescribe&quot; and replace it to provide for absolute statements that allow full access to records and personal data.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#M02000"><p>This group of amendments relates to section 27 under Part 4.  That section provides for the release of the birth information of a child who died in an institution to a qualifying relative.  This speaks again to an issue that came up during the pre-legislative scrutiny process about information relating to children who died in institutions.  That was not provided for under the original draft that was recommended in the pre-legislative scrutiny and we are providing for that now.</p> <p>  Section 27 relates to birth information about children who died.  The amendment seeks to expand the definition of "birth information" to include the other categories but it is important to remember that those other categories are all covered by the next set of sections.  Sections 27 to 30, inclusive, provide for the release of birth information, early life information and care information, the successive types of information about children who died in institutions.  The type of information the amendment is seeking to insert into the section is addressed in subsequent sections and, therefore, we do not feel it needs to be repeated by including particular definitions in this section.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 248 and 249 relate to issues we have addressed previously.  We are looking for a statement to be released along with the documents explaining the documents as they are released.  The alternative that has been proposed in a number of places is the idea of a schedule.  We believe that the statement, which is not just a list, like a schedule, but actually gives some context to the documents being proposed, is a better way forward.  That is why on each occasion the issue comes up, we believe the provision of a statement alongside the release of documents is better than the provision of a schedule.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised concern about the use of the term "to the extent that it is practicable to do so".  That is a term of art in legislation.  It is intended to convey an obligation to provide copies of all records unless there is some significant obstacle to the provision of those particular records.  An example would be where an original record is lost.  We know there are situations where information will not be with Tusla or the AAI and that is going to be a difficulty when it comes to certain adopted people for whom there will be no information to provide them with because of historical circumstances.  </p> <p>  I will give the Deputy another example of the use of the term "to the extent that it is practicable to do so".  During the pandemic, electronic records were easily provided to people but hard copy records were not as accessible because people were not attending to collect them.  The SARs we have been issuing from our Department have meant the release of the electronic document which, for the commission's archive, is the vast majority of the information.  However, in answer to each SAR, the Department has stated it will also undertake a search of any physical documents that are in the commission archive.  It is in such a situation that "to the extent that it is practicable to do so" is used.  The core goal and intent behind this legislation is for the full release of information.</p></speech>

Why not just strengthen the point in this section if he is already on board, along with the rest of us, on this point?  We can add it to this section, given the unique circumstances we are in when considering this legislation.  For four decades, people have been refused access to their information by these State bodies and, therefore, there is an understandable level of distrust.  That is what we are dealing with and that is why all these amendments have been tabled.  People understandably do not believe they are going to be given this information because they have been wrongly denied it for so long.  Instead of always trying to discredit the amendments we have tabled because people have come to us in good faith and asked us to table them, can the Minister not strengthen the legislation to assure them that they will be provided with the information we are seeking to ensure is available through this amendment?</p><p>If it is already in another section why not strengthen it in this section too?</p></speech>

This is about reassuring relatives on access to information held by relevant bodies regarding that person's relative.  Amendment No. 263 works in accordance with this, removing the limitation on information concerning only the adoption of a person and the restriction to records from only the institutions listed in the schedule.  As we know, there are many other bodies and organisations involved in illegal adoptions.</p></speech>

Section 30 provides for the release of medical information of a child who died in an institution to his or her qualifying relative.  Amendments Nos. 261 and 263 are similar to each other and proposed the deletion of section 30(4), which sets out the categories of records to be used in the search for the medical information of the child who is deceased.  Amendment No. 262 proposes to expand the category of records to any that relate to a relevant person.</p><p>This subsection provides clarity and consistency for relevant bodies.  It cannot be deleted and does not require expansion.  It also serves as a key data protection safeguard for the release of this special category data of a third party by ensuring specificity and limitation on the records that come into scope.  Furthermore, it is expansive.  It covers all records held or created by a mother and baby or county home institution.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 268 concerns the justifiable opposition to the Child and Family Agency having access to and processing personal data.  Tusla is the default tracing service provider under the Bill, which is unacceptable given the agency is dealing with affected people.  People should be given a choice of service provider, at the very least.</p><p>Amendment No. 269 removes the capacity of the Minister to intervene in the tracing process.  This needs to be an absolute right that individuals can avail of themselves and not require ministerial interference.</p><p>Amendment No. 274 has a comparable purpose in removing the reference to section 33 and the role of the Minister in seeking information from individuals.</p><p>Amendment No. 270 adds a caveat to section 34(2) that requires the agency or the authority to first and foremost conduct reasonable research before seeking access to information from the person.  Similar to amendment No. 268, this is about protecting adopted people and their relatives from any unnecessary request to divulge further information to these State bodies which have treated, and continue to treat, them disgracefully.  There should be an overwhelming obligation on the authority and agency to carry out the tracing functions under this Bill without interfering in the lives of people affected.</p><p>Amendment No. 288 is significant in adding a much broader range of bodies to which the Minister can issue guidelines for the purposes of tracing.  Currently, this only applies to the agency or the authority whereas our amendment will incorporate the range of State and religious actors outlined in section 34(6), such as Departments, the HSE, the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland.  It is both prudent and desirable that the Minister be permitted to issue such guidelines to those bodies, all of which have had substantial involvement in illegal adoptions.</p></speech>

That will be in Report Stage amendments I will bring forward.  I am just notifying the committee of that at this point.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#O02100"><p>It will support the delivery of certain specialised tracing services in respect of suspected instances of illegal birth registration.  It is, in part, to respond to some of the recommendations of the special rapporteur's report on illegal birth registration and to give additional powers to respond to that.</p> <p>  In respect of the set of amendments that have been proposed, the provisions of the Bill allow for a tracing service and provide a statutory underpinning for a tracing service, a statutory underpinning that has been missing up to this point.  It has meant that tracing is far more difficult for anybody, be it Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, to undertake.  First, it is important to say that by giving tracing a statutory underpinning we will significantly improve the ability of these bodies to engage with other State bodies.  Right now, GDPR is immediately used as a barrier to the exchange of information.  The statutory obligation to share information with Tusla and the AAI will facilitate the provision of this information.  It is also important to recognise that these are the bodies that have expertise and skill in tracing.  We are very clear that we want people to be able to get the benefit of a tracing service immediately.  It is important to say that these are the agencies with that level of expertise at present.</p> <p>  In terms of the specific amendments, we believe what is proposed in amendment No. 269 is already sufficiently provided for under this section.  In response to amendment No. 288, our view is that it is unnecessary as the guidelines are only relevant to the authority and agency in providing tracing services and they do not need to be expanded to include bodies from which the authority and agency can request information.  Those bodies do not have functions under this Part, only an obligation to comply with a request for information made in the context of a trace.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 274 is contrary to the policy intention of the legislation.  Section 33 is an important provision to cover a potential situation where people must be traced and contacted with important information.  To remove that reference could be detrimental should that situation arise.</p> <p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 268 and 270, I cannot see the necessity for those amendments.  They would actually hinder the ability to provide a timely and efficient service.  Amendment No. 268 seeks to remove the ability to refer to the contact preference register in the provision of a tracing service by either the agency or the authority and it does not provide for an alternative process.  The decision to include this provision in the legislation was carefully considered.  The ability to check a contact preference on the contact preference register is a very important part of how the tracing service will operate.  First, in a scenario where a trace has been initiated and the preference for contact is found to be on the register, then it is possible to immediately and efficiently proceed to the facilitation of whatever level of contact has been proffered by both parties, including up to a reunion or a sharing of information.  It would avoid the need to go through a protracted tracing process if they can immediately refer to what is set out by parties on the contact preference register.  Second, in a situation where a trace has been initiated and the preference for no contact is found on the register, this information is conveyed to the person who requested the trace and the person can decide whether or not to proceed.  In both scenarios, by providing that the data on the register can be processed as part of the trace, the process is made more efficient.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 270 seeks to place restrictions on the manner in which the tracing service operates.  During the drafting process, my officials and I engaged with the organisations currently providing tracing services.</p><p>We requested their assistance in identifying the bodies from which information requests would be crucial to the provision of an effective and timely tracing service.  As far as we are aware, the current non-statutory tracing service encounters very significant difficulties, delays and obstructions in the provision of its service due to the fact it cannot request key information from other bodies such as those listed in this legislation.</p><p> The purpose of section 34 is to ensure the tracing service provided under this legislation can operate in the most efficient manner possible and, therefore, accepting this amendment would be contrary to that goal and it would undermine that particular intention.</p></speech>

The aim is not to slow the process for people getting information, and this is something we have discussed at great length in the committee.  When witnesses came before the committee we heard that people were not just traumatised by interactions with Tusla but really retraumatised as well.  There were stories of people sitting in front of social workers with their information in front of them, including birth name and the name of a mother and father.  This is information that people have wanted to know for their entire life but even though the staff could have several pieces of information, they would not tell these people any of it.</p> <p>  We spoke about this a lot because none of us wanted to delay the process of people accessing their information.  I request that the Minister and his Department give this consideration before the next Stage.  Something must change in the way Tusla interacts with people who have been affected.  Perhaps it could be a different department.  Could we give this some consideration before the next Stage because it is really important?  We must figure out a way that does not slow the process but we really cannot ignore it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#P00300"><p>As the Minister stated, we support the statutory underpinning of a tracing service and the provision of that statutory underpinning.  The need for that was made clear.  As Deputy Cairns said, the experience of Tusla of many of the witnesses who came before the committee was very negative.  I look again at our recommendations Nos. 56 and 57 in the pre-legislative scrutiny report, where we indicated the dissatisfaction in experiences with Tusla and the AAI, and the need to ensure improvements in resourcing, culture and legal structure.  There was also a recommendation that a new agency would carry out functions assigned and that interim arrangements would be made.  These amendments are proposed in that spirit and in recognition of what we heard at committee meetings.  The amendments deserve consideration.</p> <p>  The Minister has made a very significant indication that he will table amendments on Report Stage on the delivery of specialised placing services in the context of illegal birth registrations.  We probably all want a little more clarity on what those amendments would look like.  Is it envisaged, for example, that there would be any provision for a criminal investigation or is it much more about the tracing of the birth?  From the brave testimonies of people who have come forward and been the subject of illegal adoption, we are all conscious that the tracing in the context of these adoptions would be a much more difficult process because there were falsified records in some cases.  Attempts were made to cover up in others.</p> <p>  Will the Minister outline exactly what will the specialised tracing look like at this stage?  If anybody is affected by this, what should they expect in the context of Tusla's specialised tracing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#P00400"><p>I agree with Deputy Cairns.  I have also heard from and met people who were adopted and subject to illegal birth registration.  I have heard their very real and deep frustration with processes and how they were treated as individuals.  I am very aware of that.  I have said in these hearings on a number of occasions that we must change the culture in these organisations.  We will do this in a number of ways.</p> <p>  First, we must amend the law because the law does not facilitate the proper release of information.  That is why we are bringing forward this legislation and we believe it crucial in beginning that change.  We are bringing forward guidelines to ensure and copper-fasten that culture of release of information and the presumption of release.  That culture will be reinforced through the process of the implementation group led by my Department, ensuring alignment between our departmental review of the open release of information and that this is replicated across Tusla and the AAI.</p> <p>  This is also supported by resources.  We have discussed in the context of the budget an extra &euro;3 million for Tusla specifically to support the implementation of the information and tracing Bill this year and an extra &euro;1 million for the AAI, again to do that work.  Both of those bodies are hiring relevant staff and securing new expertise within their ranks to implement what is happening here.</p> <p>  there is also the provision in the legislation for a review of its operation.  It is entirely possible that in future a decision could be taken to entirely remove the provision of tracing from certain bodies.  The point I made in particular when we discussed this on Second Stage related to the suggestion of a creation of a new agency.  I know the recommendation was made in good faith by the committee but to attempt that now would delay the availability of the provisions in this legislation.</p> <p>  In changing the law and culture and by providing the resources, we can change the experience that adopted people have in terms of their engagement with Tusla.  I know the committee has had Mr. Bernard Gloster before it but I do not know if members discussed this particular point with him.  I regularly discuss this matter with Mr. Gloster both in the context of our quarterly meetings and, for various reasons, when I am on the phone to him regularly.  This is a core matter.  It may be useful for the committee to hear from him as chief executive on the work he is doing within the organisation to bring about this culture change.  I know many adopted people are not reassured and will not be reassured until they see change.  Perhaps it is the same for the committee.  It might be useful, rather than hearing it from me, to hear it directly from the chief executive.</p> <p>  I made a point regarding the tabling of an amendment on Report Stage and Deputy Bacik is correct.  Illegal birth registration is extremely hard to prove.  The reason is it is an illegal act and the person or persons perpetrating that act would have done their best to cover their tracks.  I do not know why but the people who engaged in this illegal act in St. Patrick's Guild did not cover their tracks but drew attention to the acts on the cover of the files by indicating adoption for birth.  That allowed the investigation to take place.</p> <p>  We will table an amendment that will expand section 33, allowing a Minister to request the review of files in certain circumstances.  This is primarily dealing with cases where an individual has no idea he or she is subject to an illegal birth registration.  As the Deputy knows, the legislation provides a route for people with a suspicion to go through but where Tusla, in particular, identifies a file about which it has very significant concerns, the amendment will allow a Minister direct the agency to undertake further tracing.</p></speech>

The inclusion of church representatives in section 34(6) is particularly egregious considering that the Bill fails to name religious orders for other entities as data controllers.  Moreover, it does not seem to have occurred to the Minister or the Department that some of the church representatives whom Tusla and the Adoption Authority Of Ireland are authorised to approach may have been involved in adoptions, both legal and illegal.  Section 36(6)(g) and (h) need to be deleted and these data controllers must instead be obliged to furnish the AAI with all adoption records they hold in order that they can be made available to persons affected.</p><p>While my party appreciates that there may be some instances where a person is difficult to find, in the vast majority of cases a trained genealogist will be able to locate someone through discreet measures using public records and other information in the public domain.  While social workers have a fundamental role in society, they do not have the skills or training required to undertake tracing research and to ensure the confidentiality of affected persons is protected where interactions such as those described in section 34 are genuinely required.  A person who receives a request for information must be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement.</p></speech>

The amendment proposes to remove the ability of these agencies to engage with a diocese or parish of the Roman Catholic Church or the Church of Ireland.  The proposal is to remove those organisations from the process.  They were added to the bodies that could be consulted in the context of a trace because of the existence of marriage and baptismal certificates.  These documents, particularly baptismal certificates, are valuable sources of information, including names that can be used to facilitate a trace.  Baptismal certificates were not included in the original draft of the Bill but they are included now.  They can be a very good source of information.  Guardians or godparents can also be identified on a baptismal certificate.  This is also valuable information.</p> <p>  The process of consulting church records is invaluable in the context of the provision of a tracing service.  To remove the ability to engage with churches for the purposes of requesting such important information would limit the ability of the tracing services.  We do not see any benefit in that and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister is acknowledging how much relevant and important information they have but they have not been included as data controllers.  Has consideration been given to the fact that the tracing services could be engaging with people in the religious orders who were potentially involved with adoptions, illegal or legal?</p></speech>

This means they can be designated as secondary information sources.  What we are talking about here is the ability to engage with a parish church in Blanchardstown or Kilkenny to see if we can look at its register to find out if there is information available on a particular individual.  Restricting the type of valuable information the tracing service could secure from that would negatively impact on its ability to undertake tracing.</p></speech>

The application form will make provision for one box to be ticked to get all information, but in a situation where an adopted person seeks certain types of information but not other types of information, that is their choice and this amendment would have the consequence that they would receive all information, even if there were categories they were not seeking.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 290 states: &quot;In page 37, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following: &ldquo;(a) safeguard and maintain existing registrations on the National Adoption Contact Preference Register,&rdquo;.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 289 is to provide clarity on the function of the contact preference register, which is an important aspect of the Bill in an area of personal and technical complexity.  It is important that the purpose is clearly articulated for the benefit of those who avail of it and who would be impacted by it.  Amendment No. 290 ensures that existing registrations on the national adoption contact preference register are preserved.  No ambiguity should be allowed concerning the role of the new register in relation to former registers.  We believe this amendment clarifies the relationship and protects current records.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.454" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#S01600"><p>I cannot support amendment No. 289.  The objective of it would appear to be to elaborate on the purpose of the contact preference register.  However, the people for whom the register provides a service is already clearly outlined in section 38(3) and, as such, we feel this amendment has no material effect.</p> <p>  I also cannot accept amendment No. 290.  The objective of the amendment is to maintain the existing national contact preference register.  Again, we consider the amendment is unnecessary, as the transfer of the existing information that is on the existing register to the new contact preference register is already provided for in section 42.  Section 42 enables the existence of a single contact preference register once the existing data have been transferred and six months have elapsed after the date on which the section comes into operation.  Rather than creating no ambiguity, as was suggested, it would copper-fasten ambiguity, as we would have two contact preference registers in existence at the same time, so that would cause confusion, but it would also be a clear breach of the GDPR, in particular Article 25 on data protection by design and by default.  Article 25 is clear that unnecessary data should not be retained.  That is why we oppose the amendment.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 293, 294 and 301 seek to allow a person who was the friend of a parent or the friend of a deceased relevant person to make an entry on the register, although the amendment would prohibit them from making an entry stating a no-contact preference.  If I understand and accept the spirit of this amendment, it speaks to the importance of found family and the bonds people build outside of traditional family structures and it seeks to make it possible for information to pass on from the closest of friends.  I cannot accept the text that has been put before us here, but I will ask my officials to consult with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consider whether an amendment can be made.  I cannot guarantee it, but I understand what is being attempted here, so we will look and see if something can be done.</p></speech>

Given the very restrictive interpretation of GDPR rights by Departments and State bodies, it is necessary to clearly state that these sections do not interfere with GDPR.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 312 ensures that all relevant records will be transferred to the national memorial and record centre when it is established.  It is important to include this obligation to ensure that all bodies impacted will be aware of their obligations when the national memorial and record centre is set up.  Currently there is no provision in the Bill for this.  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 313 removes the potential restrictions under section 443 that limit the capacity of bodies holding information to make it available.  It is a very prescriptive approach that could lead to limitations of individuals accessing data.</p></speech>

The amendments spoken to by the Deputy relate specifically to adding text regarding not interfering with the GDPR rights of relevant persons or parents.  I reassure members that it is not the intention of the Bill to, and, more importantly, the Bill does not in any way, interfere with a person's right to apply for their information through a subject access request.  The Bill does contain a limited limitation of GDPR rights.  That is inherent in what we are trying to do here because the right of another party to not accept the processing of their information, which is provided for under GDPR at the moment, will not be available to people seeking to prevent the release of their information to an adopted person.  It is that limitation that is provided for.  If these amendments are accepted to say GDPR applies as normal at all times, it will undermine the very limited exception to GDPR that we have provided here, which ensures no one can prevent an adopted or boarded out person getting access to their information.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 327 relates to Part 9, which provides for an information campaign.  It relates to the right to access information and the right to rectification for mothers and fathers.  It is a response to my consultation with parents but particularly with mothers.  I know that some of that group also engaged with the committee.  The amendment will ensure that a mother or father's right to access information about themselves held by an institution and, importantly, the right to rectification of inaccurate or incomplete information under GDPR is highlighted to them as part of the information campaign that will be run for three months on enactment of this legislation.  When I spoke to individuals they were not aware of some of the existing rights available to them under GDPR.  There was a particular concern if, say, derogatory comments or untrue information about the context of their pregnancy were placed on the file.  This mandates within the information campaign that these rights of access but also rectification will be conveyed.</p></speech>

To do otherwise could result in a glut of records arriving at the door of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, many of which may not actually relate to matters covered under this Bill.  It is a more practical approach whereby the authority has control over the types of records being transferred and the timing of that transfer.</p></speech>

In deleting this section, we are removing the restriction on people whose births were illegally registered before 31 December 1980.  The general scheme of the Bill states an affected person is someone whose birth was illegally registered before 31 December 1970.  How was this date arrived that?  It seems arbitrary and flawed.  Although the State is clearly aware these practices were not restricted to one agency or a single timeframe, instead of ensuring each and every affected person can access his or her information in the Bill, it merely changed the original cut-off from 1970 to 1980 instead of removing the time limit altogether.  We feel strongly there should be no time limits on this.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for the new register that will reflect and give legal protection to an individual's lived identity.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 323 seeks to delete "an entry in the register of births relating to his or her birth was made on or before the 31st day of December 1980" from the definition of "affected person".  This definition was created in careful consultation, having engaged with the groups, and understands the time period within which the St. Patrick's Guild illegal birth registrations took place.  The cut-off was set at 1980 to ensure all known illegal birth registrations would be captured and would benefit from the provisions of this Bill.  At the same time, the cut-off point in respect of legal advice was that the definition should not be open-ended such that it would encompass children and young people under the age of 24 years.</p></speech>

They may also have a different age by a matter of days, weeks or, indeed, months than that recorded on their incorrect birth registration.  As we know, as members of society, we are all often asked to complete a declaration when applying for services or engaging in contracts with both the State and private organisations.  This kind of declaration will also often ask the applicant to ensure the facts provided in the form are true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge.  Through consultation and engagement with those impacted by illegal birth registration, I understand that for some people this declaration now poses a challenge and causes discomfort given they know about their birth of origin.</p><p>Amendment No. 325 seeks to address this directly and is in line with the recommendations from the interdepartmental group on the St. Patrick's Guild incorrect birth registrations.  The amendment will provide assurance that contracts, legal documents and any acts undertaken in good faith will not be invalidated or that the persons affected will not experience any adverse consequences simply because they were the subject of an incorrect birth registration.  This assurance will apply both retrospectively and prospectively.  It does apply retrospectively, however, which is important; that is, prior to the passing of legislation and before the affected person discovered his or her birth was incorrectly registered.</p><p> I also intend to bring amendments on Report Stage to deal with the issue of succession in respect of persons affected by illegal birth registration.  This issue was raised by the interdepartmental group I established last year to address issues arising for people affected by illegal birth registration.  Since then, I have been liaising with the Minister for Justice on amendments to the Succession Act 1965, which falls within the competence of the Department of Justice.  These amendments will ensure that people affected by illegal birth registrations would, for the purposes of succession and inheritance, be deemed to be the children of their social parents.  It is proposed that the amendments will be carried in the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, again, so affected persons can benefit from them as quickly as possible.  That amendment will be brought forward on Report Stage.</p></speech>

People feel it is staggering, after everything we know, that the lesser category of assistance and support is suitable.</p><p>Similarly, amendments Nos. 333 to 335, inclusive, are about ensuring that relevant people are provided with assistance rather than the lesser category of support.  Adopted people and their relatives need help and the removal of barriers.  That has been the paramount function of this Bill.  Amendment No. 333 removes the paternalistic &quot;as it considers appropriate&quot; sentence.  Adopted people should decide what is appropriate and necessary and not State bodies.  Amendment No. 335 provides specifically for trained archivists to be involved in the process.  They can provide the expertise that people need in accessing records and information.  Amendment No. 336 removes a restriction on when counselling services can be offered.  Amendment No. 337 ensures that.</p><p>We are coming to the end of this process.  The whole purpose of this legislation is to provide unfettered access - the officials keep using that terminology - but after going through 300 amendments and not one of them being accepted, are we completely confident that people will get unfettered access to their information?  We have discussed over and over again, at great length, why people do not feel that will happen.  One reason is distrust of State agencies and bodies, and people's experience for decades of being treated in that way.  A second reason is that they had very many concerns about the specific language in this Bill and none of the amendments dealing with that have been accepted.  As we come to a close, reassurance that people will have that unfettered access is appropriate.</p></speech>

This legislation has developed from heads of Bill.  Changes were made between the heads of Bill and the introduction of this draft legislation.  Since the publication of the draft legislation, I have brought forward a set of important amendments, which have been agreed by this committee.  In the context of the significant number of amendments that we discussed, I have agreed to go back to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the wording and implementation of a number of them where I believe they strengthen the Bill and chime with the view we all have of bringing about better legislation.  Where I did not agree with the provisions of the amendments, I put forward clear arguments for that, primarily on the basis that the issues concerned were already addressed in the Bill.</p> <p>  There are one or two important areas where there is a clear disagreement.  We had the opportunity to discuss that and we will have the same opportunity on Report Stage, but I have carefully considered every amendment here.  I have given them fair consideration and answered the concerns that have been brought forward as to why those amendments were not implemented.  As I said, my officials and I will go back to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on a number of the points raised and we will continue to strengthen this legislation.  I have also indicated that I will bring forward new amendments on a number of points, again, with a view to strengthening this legislation and making sure that all information is available to adopted people and to those who are the subject of illegal birth registrations.</p></speech>

It relates to the review period.  As I understand it, the legislation currently provides that it will be reviewed after four years.  My party believes that is far too long and a one-year period would be much more beneficial.  If there are difficulties or issues with the legislation, a review after one year will provide an opportunity to make changes.  I do not see how anyone would disagree with that.  It was one of the issues the committee discussed, particularly in relation to the idea of a new agency.  We understood that would not happen overnight and we did not want to delay the process.  We believed, however, that having a review after a year could at least identify if the legislation was working.</p><p>I feel strongly that this amendment should be accepted.  It is not unrealistic to seek to have the period changed from four years to one year.  Four years is a long time if something is not working, particularly when we are dealing with people who have such distrust.  We have spoke about that and everybody acknowledges it.  If the legislation was reviewed after a year, at least people could see whether it was working.  Four years is a long time to wait before rectifying a problem.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, I agree with Deputy Funchion that four years is a long time.  We will discuss this and bring an amendment on Report Stage to reduce the period from four years.  We need to consider what we believe to be an appropriate time but we will reduce the period from four years.</p></speech>

Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or unofficially by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, Dublin, in order to participate in the meeting.  I cannot permit a member to participate where they are not so located.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming.  He is single-handed and has no officials with him.  He will fight this one out on his own.  There are more to come, I suspect.  </p> <p>  In order to provide for a smooth running of the meeting, any member acting in substitution for a member of the committee should formally notify the clerk.  Divisions may be taken as they arise and members must attend in person in the committee meeting room for divisions, although they can attend the meeting remotely.  However, for a vote, they have be in the chamber.  Members attending this meeting in substitute for others should be aware of the provisions of Standing Order 106(3) relating to the moving of and voting on amendments.  </p></speech>

This Bill was published back in 2018.  It is an ambition of my party's and mine that the excessive charges that are being applied by moneylenders to, in some regards, very vulnerable people are dealt with.  We should not be allowing the type of rates that are applying.  While we have had support at different levels, including on Second Stage, there is a clear kind of cat-and-mouse game, which I think is disappointing for the body politic, because sometimes this committee works well.  We have a piece of legislation that was published four years ago, it comes to Committee Stage and, just like that, we have the Government then publishing its own piece of legislation and taking it to Second Stage before this week is out.  That is disappointing because we hear sometimes that we all work together and all of this, but it does not always work like that, at least when it comes to a Bill that we have produced.  It is not the first time.  We have seen the same with the lobbying Bill and we have seen it with other pieces of legislation.  That being said, I am very grateful to all of the people and, particularly, our witnesses, who contributed during pre-legislative scrutiny to this piece of legislation, which has improved and shaped the amendments that we put forward.  I note that some of the issues that were discussed in relation to my Bill in pre-legislative scrutiny have found their way into the Government&rsquo;s Bill.  As we go through the amendments, we will come to those in time.</p></speech>

Section 93 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 is amended, in subsection (10), by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (g): <blockquote> 	&ldquo;(g) in the Bank&rsquo;s opinion, the cost of credit is usurious, excessively high or any of the terms or conditions attaching thereto are unfair, or&rdquo;. </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 1 is a definitional amendment.  It amends the definition by which the Central Bank may refuse to grant a moneylender's licence under subsection 10(g) of section 93 from the existing text, which is: &quot;the cost of credit to be charged is excessive or any of the terms or conditions attaching thereto are unfair&quot; to the new text that this amendment proposes: &quot;the cost of credit is usurious, excessively high or any of the terms or conditions attaching thereto are unfair&quot;.</p></speech>

It replaces &quot;the cost of credit to be charged being excessive&quot; with &quot;the cost of credit being usurious or excessively high&quot;, terms which are then defined under amendment No. 3.</p><p>I oppose amendment No. 1 first on the basis that, taken on its own, it does not add any value to the Act of 1995.  I have a note that combines this amendment with amendment No. 3 and if the Vice Chairman is happy to do it, I can deal with amendments Nos. 1 and 3 together because they are connected.  When taken with amendment No. 3, I must oppose amendment No. 1 on the basis that it does not represent the most effective way to cap the interest charged on moneylending loans.  I do not say this to be obstructive but because officials in the Department of Finance considered this approach of tying the cap to the licensing framework, and this method was included in the general scheme of that Bill last July.  Essentially, the Government's approach last July was similar.  However, in the meantime, and with the benefit of the involvement of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the drafting, the Government Bill published recently refined its approach. </p><p>Section 93(10) provides for the grounds for refusal to grant a licence only and it would therefore have no effect once a licence has been granted.  The rates proposed to be charged in the licensing process must accord with the caps under the Government Bill, but it also goes much further.  The Government Bill now makes the cap a standalone requirement in respect of each loan offered, as opposed to the original licence application, and it makes it an offence for a moneylender to provide a loan above that rate.  This is more straightforward and meaningful for individual customers as it is a requirement in respect of each loan and not a general matter considered with regard to the licensing process. </p><p>From the consumer's perspective - many of these people are vulnerable people who have had to borrow in a difficult position - in dealing with the loan and asking people with an issue to go back to how a licence was granted to the institution in question is very complex and it would be a very difficult process.  We are linking the interest rate to each individual loan, saying that under the licence it would be an offence to charge above the rate in respect of that loan.</p><p>The setting of the numerical values of the rates in subsections (1) and (2) is also at odds with the power of the Minister to adjust the rates by regulation under subsection (7).  We also consider this significant as asking the Minister to adjust rates by regulation would not conform with original numerical values set in primary legislation.  There could be a difficulty if regulations were not in exact conformity with primary legislation.  Again, I say this as the Government's drafting process has benefited from engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and there is a risk that the method proposed by the Deputy would constitute an amendment of primary legislation by way of secondary legislation, which would be <i>ultra vires</i>the authority of the Minister under secondary legislation.  We have had the benefit over recent months of refining and examining what we think is the most legally sound basis to deal with the matter.</p><p>With regard to the level of the rates themselves, while lower interest rates are of course the preference for consumers, there is a need for balance in setting the ceilings to ensure consumers do not face the difficulty of having to go without credit where providers leave the market either suddenly or en masse.  We have had some withdrawals from the market.  The moneylending industry remains an important source of credit for a significant number of people.  The rates proposed for the first three years and the period thereafter set a rigid approach, which presupposes the level of reduction that the market can take in three years' time without any analysis and which would require primary legislation to amend in any event.</p><p>The Government Bill, in contrast, sets ceilings above which the cap can be set and provides for the Minister to have regard to a number of principles and policies set down in the primary legislation when making regulations to set the specific caps.  This provides more flexibility to amend the caps in response to relevant policy factors while ensuring that the rate can never be set at such a level as to make it an artificial cap.  The Government Bill also incorporates the consultation with the Central Bank which the Deputy and the committee favours.</p><p>The legislation passed Second Stage in December 2018 and in May 2021 there was a consultation process.  In June 2021, Deputy Doherty made a submission to the committee outlining that he would move away from the annual percentage rate cap to an index cap on the total cost of credit over a timeframe of three years.  In November the Oireachtas committee published a report of detailed scrutiny of the Bill.  Deputy Doherty has proposed amendments to the Bill to cap interest rates, including a similar calculation method but at a lower level than what the Government is proposing.  His method of implementing the cap does not make it an offence to offer credit above the rate and it links to the licensing process rather than the individual loans.  It is one of the key issues and it is something we want in the separate legislation that has been published and will be discussed in the D&aacute;il separately later today.  We will deal with the interest charged on loans during the lifetime of a licence rather than referring back to the licence.  People should be able to understand the interest rate they are being charged on a loan but asking people to go back and check the licence as issued by the Central Bank several years earlier, and them trying to work it out on that basis, would be very difficult for many people.</p><p>I commend the Deputy on raising this matter and there is consensus in dealing with this but because of the passage of time we have had the advantage of input from the Parliamentary Counsel, scrutiny provided by the Oireachtas and the involvement of the Central Bank and Attorney General.  It is about improving what is a very important issue and everybody agrees with the principle of what the Deputy is proposing.  We hold the view that enhanced legislation published by the Government is more comprehensive.</p></speech>

If the Government was willing to work with me as the sponsor of this legislation over the past four years, there would have been a different approach.  A contracts Bill was passed unanimously by the Houses of the Oireachtas and I was a sponsor of that, and there was also legislation relating to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, which saw real engagement.  Through all the process, and even when the Government put forward its proposals, we offered amendments to try to sharpen the legislation.  Often, these are rejected but on a number of occasions amendments have been accepted or the Minister has agreed to sharpen the legislation as a result on Report Stage.  That approach was not taken by the Government with this legislation and the Government is more interested in having its moneylender Bill.</p> <p>  That said, I do not give a damn whose stamp is on the legislation at the end of the day.  The Minister of State speaks of dealing with drafting issues and the benefit of the Attorney General or other advices, which we do not have.  As an Opposition party, we nonetheless expect the process evident in two other pieces of legislation that have been enacted would be seen here.  Unfortunately, that did not happen over four years with this legislation.</p> <p>  That said, outside the drafting issues there is a core issue in the Government's Bill, which is that it does not do enough.  It barely scratches the surface on the question of moneylending.  The Minister of State mentioned that people would not have credit and all the rest.  The largest moneylender in this country left the State, as it had hundreds of thousands of customers and many of them were intergenerational.  What did the Government do to create awareness in those consumers about where they could get credit?  Point me to one initiative or press release.  Point me to anything the Government did.</p></speech>

One loss is significant because it was a substantial company but there are still 100 different registered products out there and available to people outside of those offered by the company that has left.  It is important to point that out.  We want to ensure the majority of the companies lending here to continue, although some might leave after we introduce a cap that is not there now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.689" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022030900002#C00100"><p>That sums up the Government's approach, which was not to do anything because there was another hundred licensed moneylenders in the market.  Many of them are unique and catalogue operators and not lenders that provide loans to cover the communion or birthday party costs.  I am glad the officials are starting to brief the Minister of State on this big issue.  The Government did not do anything on this.  It should have introduced an initiative to encourage the customers of that largest moneylender in the State to go to the credit union where they could get lower cost loans at a fraction of the cost charged by the moneylenders.  That has not happened.  The Government took a hands-off approach in that regard.</p> <p>  As amendment No. 3 is being discussed with amendment No. 1, amendment No. 3 proposes to delete section 103 of the principal Act, which sets out collection charges, which would be abolished under amendment No. 2, if they were to be administered.  That is what the original section provided.  The proposed new section 103 would provide for a cap on the rate of interest moneylenders are permitted to charge.  The interest rate cap would be based on simple interest with an initial cap which would then be reduced further after a period of three years.  It would also separate cash loans from loans provided on a running account.  The new interest rate cap as it applies to cash loans would be as follows: a simple interest rate of no more than 0.75% per week up to a maximum of 36% per annum for a period of three years, which is the initial cap in the proposed amendment.  It is proposed there would a simple interest rate of no more than 0.35% per week, which is a reduced rate, up to a maximum of 18% per annum after a period of three years.  That would be the secondary reduced cap.</p> <p>  The impact of this cap for borrowers with reference to a &euro;1,000 cash loan over a 12-month term by a credit union compared with the largest moneylender in the State, which the Government should have done something about when Provident pulled out of the market, would be that the total repayments on the loan would be &euro;1,060.  The borrower would be charged &euro;60 in interest.  A moneylender would charge the borrower &euro;1,560, which is &euro;560 in interest.  The ratio of interest charged by the moneylender compared with the credit union is nine times more.  The initial cap proposed in the amendment would be mean the &euro;560 in interest that would be charged would be reduced to &euro;360.  The ratio of interest charged compared with the credit union would be six times more, which is still an very expensive type of credit.  The secondary cap we propose would reduce the initial moneylender's interest from &euro;560 to &euro;180, bringing the ratio between what a credit union would charge compared with a moneylender after three years down to 1:3.</p> <p>  Crucially for the moneylender, the total interest payable does not include the impact of collection charges, which we deal with in amendment No. 2.  Those collection charges push up the cost of credit much further.  Therefore, this cap would slash the total cost of credit a moneylender can charge by more than one third and the further cap that would be in place after three years would slash it by more than two thirds.  That would radically reduce the cost of credit moneylenders can charge, thereby protecting consumers, many of whom are vulnerable to vicious cycles of debt, and reduce the interest they are charged.</p> <p>  Further provisions of amendment No. 3 require the Central Bank to produce a report at least every three years assessing the cost of credit in the moneylender market and to make recommendations to the Minister for Finance, where they are warranted, to protect the interests of consumers.  There is a requirement for the Central Bank to produce a report within three years.  This is about sending a very clear signal that we are reducing the cost of credit moneylenders can charge, including abolishing collection charges and, after a three-year period, that cost will reduce further.  That is what is necessary to protect people.  It is not what the Minister of State has just told the committee, namely, that if your moneylender has gone, you should go to one of the other 100 moneylenders.  That is not what we need.</p> <p>  Most of the reports that comprise studies that have been done in this sector show people who go to moneylenders can access credit from credit unions.  A large number of them also access credit from credit unions.  The issue is the convenience, the door-to-door sales, the fact the operator knows Sheila has John and Mary at home and John is about to make his first holy communion, or that people are asked on their doorstep if they are going on holidays.  The issue is the in-your-face sales because of the convenience and short-term nature of the loans, as a result of which people get trapped into a cycle of high interest rate debt.  I strongly commend amendment No. 1 to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.690" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022030900002#C00200"><p>I understand what the Deputy has said.  One of the key elements of what we propose builds on the original legislation, the Private Members&rsquo; bill drafted some time ago.  It goes without saying that the longer the period a person has a loan from one of these moneylenders, the more interest he or she will pay over time.  One of the proposals we suggest is the loan would be restricted to 12 months.  That would reduce the amount of interest people would pay over a period of time rather than having loans with a significant high interest rate running for a period of two or three years.</p><p>Second, we believe the issue of the credit unions in this regard is vital.  I think we are all <i>ad idem</i>on that with respect to credit unions providing more unsecured loans, which they are very good at doing.  It is the biggest sector in the economy providing unsecured loans.  I will be meeting the credit union movement tomorrow to encourage it to lend more in that area given it has such a big footprint with approximately 400 branches around the country.</p><p>Up to now, many moneylenders have charged for the door-to-door collection of money.  Every time a moneylender sends somebody out to collect money, that incurs an expensive charge.  The moneylender can charge &euro;40, &euro;50 or &euro;60 for a visit.  We are banning that practice.  All the operator's costs will have to come in under the interest rate.</p><p>The views behind the Private Members' Bill are well motivated and are all in the right place, but there are significant extra items that could and should be taken into account regarding this issue and that is why the Government published its legislation.  The Government approved the heads of the Bill last year.  It is not something that has just emerged now.  Pre-legislative scrutiny of the Government's proposed legislation was carried out by this committee last October.  Having completed that process last autumn, we listed it as priority legislation on 21 January of this year.  The final text of the Bill was agreed with the Attorney General in mid-February.  It was approved by Government quite recently and has now been published.  The Second Stage debate on the Bill is scheduled for later today.</p><p>Overall, the theme behind what the Deputy and the Government are saying is similar but the Government probably has had the advantage of the extra time and extra pre-legislative scrutiny, the excellent paper produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service on the Government's proposal, and the benefit of the Attorney General, the Central Bank and the various organisations that made submissions to the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  We believe our legislation, as proposed, is the best way to move forward.</p><p>When this committee considered the detailed scrutiny of the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018, the Bill before us, some time ago, it was clear in its report when it stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Based on its consideration of the Bill, the Committee is of the opinion that there is a need to cap the interest rates which are currently being experienced by often financially vulnerable users of moneylenders.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The provisions contained in the Bill are a possible approach to affording borrowers necessary protection in this regard. </blockquote> <p>The committee went to state: &quot;The Committee therefore recommends that the Bill, if proceeded with, be amended to include a provision that caps such fees and additional charges&quot;, which is happening.  This committee was highly supportive of the Bill and of a cap but it did not come down on what that cap should be.  I have just read from the committee's report on the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  There is general agreement across the House on the introduction of a cap and the issue is the precise level of that cap  The annual percentage rate, APR, of interest was mentioned.  While that is not appropriate in this legislation, we are proposing a maximum period of 12 months for loans.</p></speech>

It is not appropriate when we are dealing with loans of a duration of fewer than 12 months, which are covered in the Bill we will be discussing later.</p><p>Some loans might only be for three months or six months, and one cannot do the equation of an annual interest rate on a loan that is not an annual loan.  Generally, and the Deputy has the same approach, that is why we are sticking with the simple rate based on the original amount, depending on whether the loan is for two months, six months or three years.  We want to limit the loans to 12 months.  That is why APR will never apply.  The Deputy agrees with what I am saying.  It will not be part of the legislation even though it is part of common currency when people talk about these matters.  On that basis, we are not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.694" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1553" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022030900002#D00200"><p>I commend Deputy Doherty on bringing forward this legislation.  It is important that the select committee appraises and considers legislation that comes from the Opposition.  I remember when I was in the Opposition not long ago I managed to get many legislative measures to the justice committee but, unfortunately, I could not always get them through that committee because we did not get a money message.  In fairness to the Government, at some stage it must have provided a money message.</p> <p>  Everybody here is agreed that the most important thing is that we get the legislation right and that rates of interest for moneylenders are applied properly and fairly.  It needs to be properly regulated and controlled.  Amendment No. 1 is proposing to amend section 93(10)(g).  Subsection (10) deals with the grounds on which the Central Bank may refuse a moneylender's licence.  It can refuse it on one or more of the grounds set out in the subsequent paragraphs.  At present, section 93(10)(g) states that in the bank's opinion the cost of credit to be charged is excessive or any of the terms and conditions attaching thereto are unfair.  Deputy Doherty's proposed amendment is that we would leave in the word "excessive" but that we would change and enlarge it by inserting that "the cost of credit is usurious, excessively high or any of the terms or conditions attaching thereto are unfair".  When I looked at this first, I wondered how a court would interpret "usurious" or "excessively high".  In fairness, Deputy Doherty has included that in section 103, but that requires us then to consider amendment No. 3.</p> <p>  My view, and I say this with respect to Deputy Doherty, is that the definition set out for "usurious" and "excessively high" is quite difficult to assess and evaluate.  In the first instance, section 103(1), paragraphs (a) and (b) set out what should be the rate of interest for the first three-year period and in subsection (2) the intention is to refer to a second three-year period but it states "no later than three years after the coming into operation of this section" that the terms shall be defined.  I interpret "no later than three years" is that it must be within the three years, so there is some overlap between subsections (1) and (2).</p> <p>  I also believe we are better off with a situation where the Central Bank can, by regulation, specify exactly the rate of interest that can be applied by moneylenders, and it should be small.  We cannot have situations where exorbitant or usurious, to use Deputy Doherty's word, rates of interest are being applied.  However, once one stitches it into legislation, it is then very difficult to change.  One must go through the process of the Houses changing the legislation whereas if the power is given by regulation to the Minister or the Central Bank in this instance, that can be changed just through statutory instrument.  My view is that we should be careful in terms of the manner by which legislation is enacted.  This will be considered at some stage by a court and lawyers will be arguing about the meaning of usurious and whether it comes within subsections (1) and (2).  I know from my experience introducing Private Members' legislation, and I am sure Deputy Doherty will accept this, that there is an advantage in having the back-up of the Department of Finance, its endless number of advisers, the Office of the Attorney General and all the apparatchiks of the State working on it.  Ultimately, political credit will be decided elsewhere, but the most important thing we have to do is to get it right and make sure the legislation is correct.  For that reason, I go along with what the Minister of State said.</p></speech>

He rightly pointed out that subsection (2) deals with that issue and defines it as the rates, the simple interest rate or the nominal interest rate.  He made the point then that there is the second step which has different rates and has the term "no later than three years", which would mean that the transitional arrangement would cease to exist after three years.  However, the issue of "no later than three years" raises the question of whether it could go before that.  Deputy O'Callaghan made the point about having to come back to the House to deal with this.  That is why subsection (7) is in the amendment.  It allows for the Minister to make regulations to adjust restrictions to the cost of credit to the consumer under a moneylending agreement, including those specified in subsections (1) and (2), which are the two subsections the Deputy referred to.  We have tried to deal with that there.  That allows the Minister, if he or she so wished, to change subsections (1) and (2) in terms of the rates or in terms of the period that they take effect.</p> <p>  The wider issue here is to get the legislation right, and there are ways of doing that.  As I said, I have been here and done that.  I recognise the Government has legislation now that is going to the House for Second Stage debate.  I am not a fool.  For three years when I was pursuing this legislation, that was not happening.  There was a vehicle here which we put to the Government.  The Government could amend this and do whatever is required, not tie us up with two separate sets of pre-legislative scrutiny and two sets of Committee Stage.  This is going to pass.  There is no way to stop this passing Committee Stage today.  That is the problem we are involved in.  I presume the Minister of State is going to vote it all down, but there is no final vote on Committee Stage of the Bill.  We differ significantly on the rates, but both legislative measures have similar proposals in terms of the amendments.  The Minister of State talked about collection charges, which we will come to momentarily.  The issue of collection charges, as the Minister of State recognises, emanated from the consultation that happened in respect of this legislative measure.</p> <p>  There is a big fundamental difference between this Bill and what the Government has before the House, and I am sure the Minister of State is well-briefed on the legislation he is taking before the House.  I will give an example of what my legislation would do for a borrower who borrows &euro;1,000 over a 12-year period.  The interest rate would go from &euro;560 down to &euro;360 in the first three years and down to &euro;180.  What will the Minister of State's legislation do for the same level of borrowing?</p></speech>

It amends section 102(1), which currently provides:</p> <blockquote> 	A moneylender shall not make or attempt to make an agreement with a borrower who has borrowed or intends to borrow credit from that moneylender for any sum (other than a collection charge), account of costs, charges or expenses incidental to or relating to the negotiations for, or the granting of, the loan. </blockquote> <p>Basically, the amendment takes the words &quot;other than a collection charge&quot; out of the original text.  The amendment to abolish a collection charge in moneylending agreements is made in response to concerns and recommendations of stakeholders prior to and during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill in November 2020.  For example, in their submission and opening statement during pre-legislative scrutiny, Dr. Olive McCarthy and Dr. Noreen Byrne recommended that any interest rate restriction be coupled with a limit on other fees and charge to avoid circumvention through other or higher fees and charges.  In her opening statement, Dr. McCarthy noted that although the highest rate currently being charged by moneylenders is 187% APR, collection charges can increase the cost of credit to 287% APR.  Similarly, in its opening statement during pre-legislative scrutiny the Social Finance Foundation, which has done a significant amount of work in this area, recommended that imposing a cap on interest rates charged by moneylenders be coupled with the prohibition of fees and charges.  The amendment acts on these recommendations made in November 2020 by prohibiting collection charges under a moneylending agreement.</p><p>As a footnote, I recognise the legislation brought forward by the Minister also incorporated the recommendation that arose during the scrutiny of this legislation in that Bill as published.</p></speech>

I am in agreement with the Deputy that collection charges should be prohibited.  However, from a practical and procedural point of view, I object to the changes being framed as they are here and favour the more comprehensive Government Bill which also addresses the issue and is scheduled for Second Stage this evening.  I think we are all agreed the exception in respect of collection charges should come out but the Government believes that should be done under the more comprehensive legislation that is currently on its way through the Oireachtas in parallel with this Bill.  The Deputy acknowledged we have agreed on that and it is in the Government legislation.  The Government believes it should be included in the more comprehensive legislation even though we are in complete agreement with the principle behind the amendment.  It is a question of getting it into the more comprehensive legislation that will make its way through the Oireachtas.  For that reason, I have to oppose the amendment.</p></speech>

That is what moneylenders currently charge - &euro;560.  The Minister of State did not even know what the impact of his own legislation, which I presume he is taking through the House, will be or what is at the core of the legislation, which relates to requiring a cap.  What his legislation will do is reduce it to &euro;480.</p></speech>

This Bill would reduce the cost of credit for borrowers by a far more significant amount.  That is the form, however.  The Minister of State just voted down a section with which he completely agrees.  It is disappointing.  Let us be clear that the Government's Bill will reduce the cost of a loan of &euro;1,000 by &euro;80 over the period of one year, still leaving interest of &euro;480.  This amendment would reduce the figure by &euro;200 in the first three years and &euro;380 thereafter.  That is what the amendment does.  This is the real effect we need in the context of interest rate caps.  The Government has been forced into dealing with this issue.  I have been putting it on the agenda for the past four years.  I published the Bill four years ago.</p><p>The Government has refused to act on this despite the fact that so many vulnerable customers are being fleeced.  We have forced the Government, through public opinion, to produce its own legislation which is before the House.  However, the legislation does as the Government does, the bare minimum.</p><p> Even the Minister could not give recommendations to the public about shopping around.  He would not even give recommendations to the public who were in the grip of moneylenders when they withdrew from the State.  There was no advice, agenda or strategy to make sure that hundreds of thousands of people who were availing of high-cost credit, which should have warnings and all the rest attached to it, could avail of credit at a far cheaper rate, despite the fact that some of the initiatives being rolled out by the credit union are supported by the Department.</p><p> The Minister of State was of the belief that the Bill actually kept the rates at the same level that they were.  It is very disappointing that the Government is doing so little.</p></speech>

It is one of the worst examples of parliamentary practice I have seen in the 13 years I have been here.  It is legislation that has a commencement and a Title but nothing else.  It is ridiculous.  It just shows the Government is unwilling to deal with issues that are of benefit to consumers in a real and meaningful way.  In this case, unfortunately, it is unwilling to co-operate with the Opposition to improve and enhance a Bill.  Instead, it is now going through a whole new process of bringing in its own legislation.  I thank the committee and all those who facilitated the Bill through the past four years.</p></speech>
