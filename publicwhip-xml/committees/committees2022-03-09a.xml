It is not sufficient to put phones on silent mode because this will maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.  The committee will hear from several experts, officials from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and representatives from Teagasc.</p> <p>  On 28 February, the legal requirement for mask wearing in all settings was removed.  However, it is still good practice to continue to use a face mask cover, in particular in crowded areas.  The service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear a face mask when moving around the campus or in close proximity to others.  While the easing of restrictions has removed the general requirement of maintaining a 2 m physical distance, the public health advice continues to state that maintaining a distance from other people is good practice.  It is important that everyone in the parliamentary community continues to respect the physical space of other people.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means that a witness has full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make any charges against any person outside of the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply just to members participating online in this committee meeting when their participation is within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no insurance in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of this when they are contributing.</p><p> During the first session today members will hear from several experts on CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.  Dr. Thomas McLoughlin has worked as a research scientist with leading biotechnology companies and in universities in Ireland and the United States of America in the areas of soil microbiology and molecular genetics for 20 years.  Dr. McLoughlin later worked as a senior scientist for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and is now retired, on the implementation of GMO regulations of Ireland.</p><p> Dr. Barbara Doyle Prestwich is head of plant science and principal investigator at University College Cork, UCC, and her research area includes plant science, biotechnology, sustainable agriculture and genetics.  Dr. Doyle Prestwich was appointed the first female president of the International Association for Plant Biotechnology in 2015.</p><p> Dr. Raghuram Badmi is a molecular biologist, and a postdoctoral scientist in Dr. Doyle's laboratory at UCC, funded through the Career-FIT PLUS programme.  Dr. Badmi is working on generating a disease-resistant strawberry using CRISPR gene editing.</p><p> Dr. Patrick Harrison is head of the cystic fibrosis gene editing group at the department of physiology in UCC.  The main research focus of this laboratory is the development of CRISPR gene base and prime editing to study and potentially treat human genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis. </p><p> I now call on the witnesses to read their opening statements, commencing with Dr. McLoughlin.  The witnesses have been instructed to keep their opening statements to a maximum of five minutes.</p></speech>

I wish to thank the committee for the kind invitation to come before it this evening.  In particular, I wish to thank Senator Paul Daly for getting this important subject on the agenda.</p> <p>  Gene or genome editing is also referred to as new genomic techniques and new breeding techniques.  I will use the acronym GE.</p> <p>  The world faces enormous challenges in producing sustainable food for its growing population, given the escalating pressures of climate change and biodiversity loss.  There can be no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic reminded us of our vulnerability and the need to be prepared for potential future pandemics.  The same can be said of how we produce our food and the potential for food shortages due to drought, floods, forest fires, the advent of more aggressive plant and animal diseases or pests, and the threat due to war.</p> <p>  The EU&rsquo;s farm to fork strategy is the cornerstone of its green deal.  Its objective is to contribute to a more sustainable food production system by reducing, among other things, dependency on pesticides by 50%.  The strategy refers to GE, which may play a role in increasing sustainability.</p> <p>  I shall turn now to mutation breeding.  Over the past 70 years, mutations in plant genomes have been induced by plant breeders using ionizing radiation or chemicals to increase genetic variability.  This method of modifying genetic material is called random mutagenesis and the resulting organisms are technically genetically modified organisms, GMOs, and are exempt from the scope of EU GMO legislation on the basis that they have a long history of safe use.  Much of the food we eat today originated from the use of this technology. </p> <p>  What is gene editing?  GE, which can be defined as all techniques to alter the genome of an organism developed after 2001 - when the EU's legislation on GMOs was adopted - has rapidly developed over the last two decades in many parts of the world, with some applications already on the market.  The most recent addition to the breeder&rsquo;s toolbox, discovered in 2012, is a GE technique called CRISPR-Cas9, which is what we are talking about this evening.  It is described as a genetic scissors that can be used by scientists to change the DNA of animals, plants, and microbes with extremely high precision.  Two scientists, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the 2020 Nobel Prize in chemistry for discovering this technique.</p> <p>  In 2018 the European Union Court of Justice, ECJ, ruled that organisms obtained by induced or classical random mutagenesis constitute GMOs, and that these are exempt under the GMO directive.  However, the ruling also stated that organisms obtained through techniques of directed mutagenesis involving techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 are not excluded from the scope of the directive.  Since that ruling, there has been much debate about its implications.  Industry, breeders, farmers and academia were alarmed at the court&rsquo;s decision.</p> <p>  The ruling prompted many European plant and life science companies to submit a paper to the EU Commission outlining the negative consequences for agriculture if all organisms developed with GE will have to comply with EU rules on GMOs.  This prompted the EU Council in November 2019 to request the Commission to submit a study in light of the ECJ ruling regarding the status of GE techniques under Union law.</p> <p>  Contributing towards this process, 12 legal and scientific experts - including myself - published an article in January 2021.  In this article we analysed the court&rsquo;s judgment and concluded that the ruling merely sheds light on the court&rsquo;s general thinking but did not address the legal status of organisms developed through GE techniques in general, nor was it asked to do this.  Also, the precise implications of the ECJ ruling are far from settled, as is also highlighted by the Council&rsquo;s request to the Commission.  Furthermore, in November 2021, the French authorities took a second case to the ECJ seeking further clarity on the 2018 judgment.</p> <p>  The EU study was published in April 2021, following stakeholder consultations.  The main findings were that GE technology has the potential to contribute to sustainable food systems; and that the 2001 GMO legislation is not fit for purpose and needs updating.  It is more than 20 years old and the science has moved on but the legislation has not moved on.  Concerns were also raised over potential impacts on biodiversity, coexistence and labelling.  The European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, concluded that targeted mutagenesis techniques that modify the DNA of plants, like some CRISPR technologies, do not pose more hazards than conventional breeding or techniques of GMO.  The executive summary states that organisms obtained through GE are subject to the GMO legislation.  In a submission to the Commission in May 2021, a number of EU regulatory experts, including myself, concluded that this statement was not substantiated by the report and we urged the Commission to elaborate on the points raised in our analysis in order to reduce the ambiguity in the regulatory status of organisms obtained with GE.</p> <p>  With regard to the next steps, the EU Commission is working on a targeted policy action on crop plants derived from targeted mutagenesis.  This policy aims at a proportionate regulatory oversight to maintain a high level of protection of human and animal health and the environment, and to achieve the goals of the farm to fork strategy, which is of paramount importance.  An impact assessment, including a public consultation, will be carried out by the Commission to examine potential policy options this year and a proposal for legislation by the middle of 2023.</p> <p>  We can ask whether EU attitudes are changing on GE.  There is certainly an increasing interest in GE technology worldwide.  This was driven by the part played by modern biotechnology in the identification of the vaccines, PCR and antigen tests, and genomic sequencing that are enabling the world to protect us against the Covid pandemic.  These are all examples of advances in modern biotechnology over the past 40 years.  I put it to the Chairman that these are of paramount importance.  Science is taking us out of this terrible pandemic. </p> <p>  Will GE technology be used in the EU?  GE technology has the propensity to revolutionise agriculture, environment and medicine for the benefit of people worldwide.  It is of paramount importance that this technology is regulated in a proportionate manner at EU level and harmonised with other countries.  We hope that the intransigence regarding GMO adoption in the EU for the past 30 years does not continue to blight the adoption of GE technologies like CRISPR into the future.  This message needs to be communicated by the Irish Government at EU level.  Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Barbara Doyle Prestwich" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030900002#B00400"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak on CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in plants.</p> <p>  As Dr. McLoughlin outlined in his opening remarks, we face enormous challenges in producing sufficient food to feed a growing population, estimated to be 10 billion by 2050.  It cannot be business as usual in terms of crop food production.  The most recent IPCC report paints a damning picture of our collective inaction in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.  Ireland is currently ranked first in the world in terms of global food security in the Global Food Security Index, but the index is dynamic and we cannot afford to become complacent.  Unexpected external shocks can have a huge impact on a nation&rsquo;s food security as evidenced by the ongoing situation in eastern Europe.  In addition, under the European green deal and to meet the United Nations sustainable development goals, we in Ireland must make changes in how we produce and manage our crops.</p> <p>  My colleague Dr. Raghuram Badmi will focus more closely on the actual technology.  For my part, I will focus on the international scene and why I believe we cannot afford to ignore CRISPR technology in Ireland, and more broadly across the European Union.</p><p>The constraints we face in terms of sustainable food production include, but are not limited to, land use, water availability, drought, heatwaves, flooding, disease control and soil health, coupled with an ever-diminishing list of available agri-chemicals.  Some might argue that Ireland is not quite at the coalface in terms of impacts of climate change on food production, but it would be a grave mistake to ignore the writing on the wall.  At present, we have a toolkit that includes new genomic techniques, also known as new breeding techniques, NBTs, which Dr. McLoughlin referred to and which are continually being rolled out in many countries around the world.  These techniques offer precision genetic engineering capabilities that can introduce discrete changes in a plant&rsquo;s DNA in order to make improvements such as disease resistance and drought tolerance, as well as many others.<br/><br/>What is the international experience of this technology, including CRISPR?  As Dr. McLoughlin pointed out, this is a relatively new technology, but already we are seeing its adoption in many countries to great effect.  Argentina has been a leader in the regulation of these NBTs since 2015.  Data gathered there offers us some insight into the potential of this technology and its impact, not just on crop production but on technological innovation and its democratisation.  What I mean by democratisation is that SMEs and the public sector have an opportunity to participate in product development and commercialisation.  According to Whelan in 2020, &quot;As a source of codified knowledge, regulations have a direct impact on technology diffusion because they affect the generation of new technologies, as well as decisions on their adoption by potential users&quot;.  This is very important for both Ireland and the EU.<br/><br/>Over the past 30 years, one of the main criticisms levelled at the plant biotech industry globally has been that the production of biotech crops is in the hands of approximately four multinationals, leading to issues connected with food sovereignty.  To a large degree this has been due to the huge cost and time involved in the regulatory and commercialisation process, with no guarantee of subsequent product approval.  Due to delays caused by over-regulation, some biotech industries have left Europe - BASF in 2012 is a case in point.  Compare this with the development of crops via NBTs over the past three years.  I have included a table in my report, Table 1, taken from Eriksson in 2018, where already we are seeing a diverse range of traits being produced.  Some have been produced from within the public sector.  One can see in the table crops such as soybean, maize, mushrooms and potatoes and the traits vary from drought and salt tolerance to oil content, anti-browning and so forth.  Among the players in that table are places such as the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in the United States and Pennsylvania State University, among others.<br/><br/>Safety and regulation must be top of any country&rsquo;s list when it comes to the introduction of new technologies.  A regulatory process needs to be effective and efficient, and enabling of technological innovation, which should be a major consideration of policy makers.  Again, if we look to Argentina, its regulations do not include a list of named techniques <i>per se</i>.  As a consequence, they can be agile and are able to respond quickly to small incremental steps in technological innovation.  This has led to more innovation.  At least seven countries, so far, exempt genome edited products from genetically modified organisms, GMO, regulation where there is no additional DNA incorporated into the plant.  Those countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Japan and the USA.<br/><br/>What are the challenges for Ireland?  The European Commission&rsquo;s farm to fork strategy is recognised as a cornerstone of the European green deal.  This green deal has committed to no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, a decoupling of economic growth from resource use and no person or country being left behind.  However, in realising these ambitions, Ireland will face some serious challenges in terms of crop food production.  Under the farm to fork strategy, there is an ambition to halve chemical pesticide use by 2030 under the sustainable use of pesticides directive.  However, what are the alternatives on offer with this diminishing use of agri-chemicals?  I refer to the technological toolkit, the NBTs that I mentioned earlier, which we cannot afford to ignore.  In fact, last month the recently elected chair of the EU Parliament&rsquo;s agriculture committee, Norbert Lins, called for progress on NBTs.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we in Ireland and Europe cannot afford to ignore the technological advances that CRISPR has to offer in terms of addressing our commitments under the European green deal, specifically climate, biodiversity and food systems.  We must also be cognisant of how different national regulatory standards will impact international trade.  The EU imports over 32.5 million tons of soybean and soybean meal from South and North America and approximately 5 million tons of rapeseed and rapeseed oil from Ukraine, Canada and Australia.  I am not mentioning wheat in that figure.  Finally, it was originally thought that the EU Court of Justice ruling that limited access to this technology would also have a large impact on Africa.  However, it is now accepted that China, whose five- year plan prioritises new breeding techniques, could fill the gap if the EU fails to engage with the technology.  For consumers, food producers and European economies, this would be a grave mistake.  I thank the members for listening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Raghuram Badmi" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030900002#C00200"><p>I wish to convey my sincere thanks for this opportunity to share my views on the CRISPR-Cas9 or, more generally, genome editing technologies.  Genome editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats - CRISPR associated protein 9, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, TALENS, and zinc finger nucleases, ZFNs, are all, in their basic forms, a pair of specific DNA scissors.  They are specific for a particular DNA code, meaning that they can only recognize one specific stretch of a DNA sequence.  If these scissors encounter a DNA sequence that does not match with their own DNA binding code, they cannot bind or cut that sequence.</p> <p>  These scissors scan the DNA, recognize and bind to their specific DNA sequence and perform the cut.  Once there is a cut in the DNA, the cellular repair machinery recognizes the cut and initiates the repair process.  Any cut in the DNA is a signal to the cell for recruiting the repairing tools at that site and completing the repair process.  When the cell decides to repair the DNA, it mostly chooses a repair mechanism called non-homologous end joining, NHEJ.  During the NHEJ repair process, a different DNA base - A, T, G or C - is added to the DNA 30% to 70% of the time, thereby changing the DNA code.  The part of the DNA with the changed code loses its function and the plants that have these different bases are selected.  This is how the editing of the genome or genome editing is achieved.  This type of editing comes under the site-directed nuclease type-1, SDN-1, technology where it does not require an outside DNA and occurs as a result of an error-prone DNA repair mechanism of the cell.  This method would be the first-choice for any researcher because the only aim here is to break the DNA at the desired location, then the cell takes over for the rest of the process.  One example of SDN-1 is soybean oil with no trans-fat, with high oleic oil and low linolenic oil content developed by Calyxt using TALENS.  This is the first commercially-available gene-edited plant product in 2019.  The second example is camelina, the plant in the mustard family used for oil with enhanced omega-3 oil.  It was developed by using CRISPR by Yield10 Bioscience and cleared by the United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, in 2017.</p> <p>  However, sometimes only breaking the DNA is not enough.  When there is a need to improve the function of a certain gene, a stretch of DNA which is functional, it might require adding, deleting or changing specific DNA bases at a particular DNA location.  To do such precise editing, a repair DNA template is introduced, along with the scissors - DNA scissors plus repair DNA template.  The repair DNA template has the correct bases that we want to add or delete and the DNA address for where it should go and stick to.  When we do this, the cell chooses a different repair mechanism called homology directed repair, HDR, about 5% to 10% of the time at best.  During HDR, the cell copies the DNA bases present in the repair DNA.  The copied DNA segment replaces the original DNA segment and completes the repair process.</p> <p>  A modified version of CRISPR-Cas9 known as base editing is emerging.  Base editing, as the name suggests, is used to convert the specific base in the DNA from A to G or from C to T, without the need for a repair DNA template.  These types of editing come under the category of site-directed nuclease type-2, SDN-2, technology that includes making small but precise edits to the DNA in the order of a few bases, which in most cases are sufficient to improve functions of the gene.  Examples of base editing are high nitrogen use efficiency in rice by changing one base cytosine, C, to thymine, T, using cytidine base editor, and high yield in rice by changing adenine, A, to guanine, G, using adenine base editor and simultaneously C to T at specific places of SPL genes.</p><p>Site-directed nuclease type-3 technology involves inserting entire genes or DNA fragments, which can comprise more than 1,000 base pairs.  SDN-3 is used to provide novel functionalities to the plants that are not present before.  An example of SDN-3 is golden rice, a variety of rice engineered to produce beta-carotene, pro-vitamin A, to help combat vitamin A deficiency.</p><p> SDN-1 and SDN-2 both mimic natural mutations caused by chemicals or irradiation.  However, unlike other mutations that occur randomly in the entire genome of an organism, SDN-1 and SDN-2 are very precise, which is almost everything we could ask for.</p><p> On the next sheet of my written opening statement I have some additional information for all the members to go through.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Patrick Harrison" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030900002#D00200"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity.  As mentioned in the Chairman's prefatory comments, my interest in gene editing is for medical purposes.<br/><br/>Sixty-five years ago scientists discovered that a single specific mutation in the sequence of our DNA was enough to cause the genetic disorder sickle cell anaemia.  The same is true of cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy and 4,000 other inherited disorders.  Collectively, these diseases affect 7% of the world's population.  It is not rare to have a rare disease but it is extremely rare to have an effective treatment.<br/><br/>In 1970 the concept of gene therapy was proposed.  The idea was to add a corrected copy of the defective DNA sequence into cells of an affected individual.  In 1993 the technology finally caught up with the idea and the first clinical trials began.  However, three decades and 5,000 clinical trails later, with remarkable advances, we still have only two gene therapies that have been licensed.  Peter Marks of the Food and Drug Administration recently stated that it would take 600 years to increase that number to 100 approved medicines if we were to continue with existing tools at the current rate.<br/><br/>Rather than paper over the cracks in the genome, can we delve into the genome, find those mutations and fix or edit them?  Yes, but I ask the committee to consider for a moment the magnitude of the problem.  The book I am holding up contains about a million letters or bits of information; our genome contains 3 billion bits of information, or 3,000 of these books stacked on top of one another.  That is the height of the Spire of Dublin, which, by coincidence, is overlaid with the double helix pattern of DNA.  However, the mutation we need to fix is just one letter in those 3,000 volumes, and all that information is in the DNA of a cell that cannot be seen without a microscope, so it is quite a challenge.<br/><br/>In 2005 scientists in California described one of the techniques already mentioned, with the first precision gene-editing technique to correct a mutation in cells from a patient with severe combined immune deficiency.  The symptoms of that disease are as bad as its name suggests.  A few years later my lab in Cork became the first to use that technique to correct the most common cystic fibrosis mutation in cells.  However, progress with these early editing techniques was slow and we really needed a paradigm shift.<br/><br/>The breakthrough, as mentioned, came in 2012 with CRISPR-Cas9, a programmable RNA-guided DNA endonuclease.  It was the missing piece of the puzzle.  CRISPR-Cas9 could target any mutation in any gene in any organism.  For academic labs it was free and easy to use.  Within a year a new CRISPR study was being published every day.  Currently, a new CRISPR study is published every 60 minutes.  These research publications are describing proof-of-treatment studies for hundreds of rare diseases in animal models and in human cells.  The first ethically approved clinical trial of CRISPR reported its results in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>, the most prestigious medical journal in the world, for a handful of patients with a rare liver disease just last summer.  There are many more clinical trials ongoing as we speak, and more sophisticated and refined CRISPR strategies are constantly emerging with improved specificity and safety.  We require additional tools to target specific tissues in patients, and those will need to be underpinned by appropriate medical, regulatory and access frameworks to pay for them.  However, for individuals with these diseases - cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, muscular dystrophy, certain types of cancer and thousands of other conditions - there is now real hope and real prospects because of CRISPR.</p></speech>

This topic is unusual for the committee - we usually deal with more mainstream topics - but what the witnesses have said is extremely interesting and thought-provoking.</p> <p>  I invite Senator Paul Daly, as he was the instigator of this discussion, to ask his opening questions.</p></speech>

I have already had contact with Dr. McLoughlin, which aroused my interest in this area, so I asked for its inclusion on the work programme.  I thank the Chair and the committee for accepting that.  Today is a beginning and more an educational process for us.  In the second session, in which we will have Teagasc and the Department before us, we will be able to carry on and query them based on the information we will have gathered from the witnesses in this session.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  To the witnesses, who are all professionals in this area, they might sound very naive.  I am starting from square one on this and educating myself as much as anything else.  The kernel of the issue I see, from reading the witnesses' opening statements and from their presentations, is that, based on the European Court of Justice ruling, the GMO directive, in the witnesses' opinion, should not include CRISPR-Cas9 because, in layman's terms, as I read it, GMO technology involves bringing in outside DNA or combining two unrelated organisms, whether plant, animal or whatever else, whereas with CRISPR there is no outside influence.</p></speech>

CRISPR could be used such that there would not be a need to introduce any foreign DNA, but the CRISPR technique could also be used such that a gene from another organism is inserted.  It depends on what is used.  Dr. Badmi mentioned SDN-1 and SDN-2.  They are deregulated, if you like, in other jurisdictions.  They are CRISPR techniques that, in our view, should not be regulated as GMO.  A number of other countries in the world, such as the United States, Argentina and now the UK, can see this technology as hugely important rather than bulking everything together in the GMO regulations.  As for the definition of GMO, our argument against the ECJ decision was that it has to involve something that occurs naturally.  Mutations occur naturally in plants and micro-organisms.  They are not included in the GMO regulations.  The ECJ has bulked them all in together.  The 12 people who wrote that article, including me, and other people since have argued that that decision was probably not the right one.  Even the Council of the European Union was not happy with it either.  We might have another chance with the French going back and asking for more clarity.  As for the decision and the EU study, that is where the Department of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will come in.  It is the policymaker in Ireland.  However, if we lose this technology in Ireland and if both techniques are treated as GMOs, they will never see the light of day.  That is the concern I and my colleagues have.</p></speech>

If we had a magic wand and if the directive or the EU's attitude were to change, it would not be a <i>carte blanche</i>CRISPR-Cas9 that would be acceptable to the witnesses.  They would want to see it defined as non-crossing of genes.  They would want it to stay within the gene of the specific plant or animal.</p></speech>

As for the technologies that are evolving in the countries that have accepted CRISPR, how far behind the curve are we compared with those countries on specific production yields, use of pesticides, etc.?</p><p>Were the directive to change, how long would it take us to catch up?  Could we piggyback on advances that others have made or would we need to make specific modifications, given our soil types, climate and the types of crop we are sowing?  If so, how long would it take?  Would we have the labs and expertise if we got the green light in the morning?</p><p> While reading the submissions, I thought about how we had had many meetings on the forestry sector, during which ash dieback was often discussed.  One of the solutions proposed to us had to do with how people were in the process of trying to develop ash trees that were resistant to ash dieback.  If we start interfering like that by developing a new ash, when will the new ash stop being native Irish ash?  Could this technology be used to develop an ash dieback-resistant ash that was still a native Irish ash so that we would not have to import anything?</p></speech>

As to the Deputy's question on the technology that is available on the island of Ireland, Dr. Badmi is a molecular biologist working in my lab in UCC.  His project &ndash; he can say more about it himself &ndash; involves looking at the strawberry plant to develop a strawberry that is resistant to a particular disease using CRISPR.  The technology is there to generate disease-resistant varieties that will have very few changes compared with the unmodified plant.</p></speech>

They do not insert or delete genes.  Rather, we are targeting just a few letters among a billion base pairs.</p> <p>  My project involves identifying certain genes that can make strawberries resistant to diseases.  Making those changes in the strawberry plant could just involve a couple of letters in its entire genome.  We can see great results with this approach.  Other countries have done this.</p></speech>

For example, one letter in the genome could be changed to make it tolerant to some disease.  It is a major issue in the EU right now.</p> <p>  This train has left the station.  Other jurisdictions are already using this technology and are moving ahead.  The main question is, if we do not use this technology, what will our farmers be doing?  We will be importing apples but we will not know how they are produced.  With a GM variety, we can identify it because there is a new piece of DNA in the apple.  With some gene editing techniques, however, we cannot identify the relevant varieties.</p> <p>  In light of the Commission's study, it is of paramount importance that a decision be made in 2023.  This matter is dear to my heart.  I retired five years ago, having worked in the area for 40 years.  If we lose this technology in Europe, it will be a crying shame.  This is the science that is taking us out of the pandemic.  It is just another tool of modern biotechnology.</p></speech>

Their contributions have been informative.  This discussion is probably much more highbrow than what we are used to, but it is good to have it.  What is happening in Ukraine has put a focus on food sovereignty.  Covid has been mentioned.  There is probably no more pertinent a week for the witnesses to appear before us on this issue.</p><p>Teagasc will be appearing before us later.  I am unsure as to whether the witnesses before us now have seen its opening statement, but Dr. O'Mara's submission reads:</p> <blockquote> 	However, since the European Court of Justice ruling in 2018, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that editing techniques do not pose any more hazards than conventional breeding.  A multitude of scientific organisations across the EU have arrived at a similar conclusion. </blockquote> <p>We agree, Teagasc agrees and the witnesses agree, but this is a battle that we will have to take to the EU.  Of EU countries, we seem to be the most adversely affected in terms of farm to fork and our ability to produce.  Where the witnesses' peers across Europe and the experience of European academics are concerned, is there an appetite to take this on at European level or are we swimming against the tide?</p></speech>

I am part of a European Cooperation in Science and Technology, COST, action and we have more than 300 members from all EU countries.  Ireland is not swimming against the tide at all.  We have a project of work to do in terms of communicating with the public.  Senator Daly alluded to that in his example of ash dieback and how different a modified plant would be from the original.  In our business, we are still hearing the same or similar arguments that were out there 20 years ago about the technology and the public's fears, so there is definitely a communication project to be done in that regard.</p></speech>

Should we have done more as a country, ideally through Teagasc, research and our universities, to take a greater role and put more investment into it?  Academics will always say that we should have given them more money, but with the benefit of hindsight, is that something that each European country should have done?</p></speech>

Those four big multinationals have been at the forefront because of the cost of regulation.  That has been the real problem.  We have been doing this kind of work in our labs for years through undergraduate and postgraduate projects, but when we reach the stage of wanting to commercialise a product, it could cost up to an estimated &euro;20 million.  Even where the older version of this technology is proven okay on safety grounds, it might still be blocked in Europe.  CRISPR is different, though.  A different kind of scene is emerging.  I cited a number of examples in table 1 of my submission, which references some universities that are now able to be in the game and be competitive doing it.  We are moving away from domination by multinationals.  That was purely on financial grounds, not because of technology or expertise.</p></speech>

Is it fair to say that we have evolved and come a long way in terms of licensing and producing new drugs and modified treatments for human health but we are probably light years behind in terms of licensing the same for food production?</p></speech>

There have been great changes in clinical gene editing.  I remember the first studies being published 16 or 17 years ago, which piqued my interest in this field.  Something that is interesting is the way that CRISPR is used in the medical sense compared with how it is being discussed in the food sense.  If the committee approaches the EU about this, it is important that it be clear about all the different things that CRISPR can do.  It can make small deletions and change individual base pairs, but it can do much more sophisticated things that we need to do to treat some of these horrible diseases.  That is not necessarily what people are proposing in respect of food, though.  The things that we are trying to do in cells for patients would be more similar to what could be regarded as GMOs.  One of the main differences in humans is that we use somatic gene therapy &ndash; we treat a person and he or she cannot pass it on.  The exact opposite is the case in the food industry where we have to produce lots of seeds so that we can produce more crops.</p> <p>  If we are having an honest conversation, then CRISPR can do all sorts of things.  We need it for medicine and my colleagues are using specific aspects of it for gene modification in crops.</p><p>That is a very different thing.</p></speech>

I must admit that, like Senator Paul Daly, I am not clear on how it all works.  I wish to have a few points clarified for my own understanding.  Under the ECJ ruling, GMO products are largely banned across the EU but there are some exceptions, of which Spain is the most notable.  Where does CRISPR fit in?  Is the ruling of the ECJ interpreted and implemented across the EU on an equal basis or are there anomalies, as there are with GMO?</p></speech>

Many people, including those I have been working with, came to the conclusion, when we deciphered the ruling, that it was only speaking in a general sense.  We must remember that those are legal people who have no idea about molecular biology or science, although I have no doubt they would probably have consulted people.  Academia, farmers and plant breeders were amazed at the decision.  When we submitted a report on the Commission's study, which was published last April, we said we believed the Commission had also taken the ECJ's side.  The consultation, which has already started, will hopefully be finalised this year and there may be a decision next year.  All is not lost, but at the moment nothing is happening as regards putting products on the market.  Deputy Carthy is right that in Spain an insect-tolerant maize plant is being used that protects the plant against the European curved corn borer.  We do not use it here because we do not have that pathogen.  Portugal is also using that plant, which is very small.  In 2019, worldwide-----</p></speech>

This is not easy for the committee members to decipher - it is hard enough for us.  As we tried to explain, we cannot identify a wheat plant or soya bean coming in that was produced used CRISPR.  There is no technology available to identify it, whereas it was produced using a GMO, that would involve taking a piece of DNA and putting it into that plant and we could identify it.  We cannot do that with some CRISPR techniques and that is the crux of the issue.  It would not comply with EU legislation and we would not be able to enforce the EU legislation.  The Commission is very well aware of this.  It has spent a lot of money to see if it could get any techniques it could work with, but it is nearly impossible.  It is akin to looking for a needle in a haystack.</p></speech>

What is the biggest distinction between GMO and CRISPR in terms of the specifics?  I understood that one technique involved two different organisms, but Dr. McLoughlin is saying that CRISPR could also use two organisms.  What is the biggest distinction in terms of process and outcome?</p></speech>

Reference was made to Spain and Portugal.  Those crops, using what I will call the previous technology, which is still very much operational, would have genetic information from another organism incorporated in them.  I think Deputy Carthy understands that.</p></speech>

It is the latter that we are talking about when it comes to the regulations.  As Dr. McLoughlin indicated, with CRISPR, we can make changes that cannot be detected.  They are minute changes in the genome.  We are not incorporating any foreign DNA, if I can call it that.</p></speech>

Basically, the CRISPR-Cas9, which we are talking about, is a pair of scissors.  We can tell the CRISPR where to go and bind and it then goes and binds at that specific sequence in the millions of base pairs in the DNA.  It goes specifically and binds there and it cuts the DNA.  That is what CRISPR basically does.  Then the cell recognises that there is a cut in the DNA and it has to repair that, as it cannot be left unrepaired.  When the cell tries to repair the DNA, that is when it introduces a different DNA base.  Let us say there is a piece of DNA we want to change, when it tries to repair the cut DNA - we call it ligating - by trying to glue the different pieces, the cell itself changes the base from A to C, for example.  When it changes from A to C the DNA core is changed.  The single letter change out of millions of base pair changes will lead to loss of function of the gene which harbours this changed nuclear type.  It stops functioning.  What we are trying to do is to stop the gene from functioning by asking the cell to introduce a mistake or perhaps it is not a mistake to the cell.</p></speech>

The obvious concern, which is the one that is raised most often, both in terms of the older GMO technology, as it has been described, but it will apply equally here, is that changes made to one crop might have an unforeseen implication either for other crops, biodiversity, climate or something else.  There could be some knock-on consequence for the animals that eat the product, including humans, or whatever the case may be.  Do the witnesses share those concerns or are they mitigated with the protections that could be put in place?</p></speech>

I do not see how single base or multiple base changes can affect the environment, other than the plant itself.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.64" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Thomas McLoughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030900002#G00200"><p>To follow on from that, we have spent more than &euro;300 million of EU taxpayers' money on safety research into GM technology over the past 30 years.  In 2010, the then European Commissioner M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn published a study that stated GM technology per se was no more harmful than conventional plant breeding.  As a case in point, if we look back to Teagasc and the GM potato, which I am sure we will hear more about, that DNA that came from a wild variety of potato made it blight tolerant.  That was done using GM technology and the same could have been done using plant breeding.  What was done in Teagasc and Wageningen University was to speed up the process.  Senator Paul Daly mentioned the resistance to ash dieback as well.  The power of this technology can be used to speed up the plant breeding process.</p> <p>  As for safety, EU studies have concluded it is no different, and I imagine the same will be said about gene editing.  As Dr. Badmi said, some of the gene editing techniques happen in nature, and that is why we cannot differentiate between some CRISPR techniques and what happens in nature.  There is no technique to evaluate that change.  In the case of many of the GM products on the market at the moment, such as in Spain, there has been a reduction in the use of pesticides.  That must be good for both climate and biodiversity, two very important issues.  Of course, the European Green Deal seeks to reduce the use of plant-protection products but, as Dr. Doyle Prestwich asked, if we reduce their use and get rid of them, how will Irish potato farmers farm their potatoes without the use of some of these techniques?  This is why we are arguing that CRISPR-Cas9 could take the place of some of the chemicals we use to control potato blight in Ireland.  We have to be very careful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030900002#G00300"><p>One of the main arguments traditionally made against GMO relates to corporate influences, as Dr. Doyle Prestwich mentioned in her opening remarks.  We have all heard stories of the power of companies such as Monsanto and the control they have over farmers in particular.  Farmers are penalised for seed leakage, for example, and there is a significant level of control whereby farmers and the wider food chain become beholden to one big corporate enterprise.  How can that be mitigated?  Will our guests describe how they would foresee circumstances playing out?  Dr. McLoughlin gave the example of potato growers in Ireland.  How would they operate if we were using this system?  Would they annually have to get seeds from a particular company and be bound by contract to that company?  How would that relationship evolve over time and how would farmers be protected?  Dr. Doyle Prestwich mentioned democratisation whereby smaller companies would play a part, but the nature of global capitalism is that large companies come in and take over successful small companies and sometimes they can become monoliths.  How would that be mitigated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.66" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Barbara Doyle Prestwich" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030900002#G00400"><p>I might take that first.  One of the reasons I mentioned democratisation relates to the fact that the biggest difference with CRISPR technology in the context of regulation relates to the fact that what happened, say, 30 years ago will not happen again.  We are seeing this already within the public sector and among SMEs.  If we correctly regulate this and do not classify it under a GMO, we can democratise the process.  People such as us in academic labs around Ireland will have greater access, and access to commercialisation will be a more level playing field.</p> <p>  Furthermore, more than 30 years ago, two of the main traits in genetically modified crops were insect resistance and herbicide tolerance.  In the few years in which CRISPR has been used in this way, however, we are seeing a much more diverse range of traits that will suit smaller holdings as well.  I refer to resistance to drought, for example, or, in the context of health, the issue of increased oil the Deputy mentioned and so on.  Certainly, in terms of democratisation, there will be significant changes if CRISPR is regulated in the right way such that we do not push towards the large multinationals.  As I said, it has been well documented that the regulation of crops is very expensive.  Applying to get a product onto the market can cost up to &euro;20 million.  As universities, we cannot afford this, and neither can SMEs, which are being pushed out of the market in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.67" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Patrick Harrison" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030900002#G00500"><p>I might return to an earlier question.  It struck me when Dr. Doyle Prestwich and Dr. Badmi were talking that there is a massive parallel to gene editing in humans.  We knew how to edit mammalian cells in the 1980s but we could not do it for therapeutic purposes because a marker had to be added.  The breakthrough in 2005, which I mentioned earlier, was that cells could be edited with CRISPR without adding that marker.  This is something Dr. Doyle Prestwich and Dr. Badmi touched on.  With CRISPR, there is a choice.  Editing can be done without the marker, which is what they are arguing should go forward, or with a marker, which I think they are arguing against.  If that distinction is made, we cannot hide the fact that certain things can be done with CRISPR that people may not want, but there is much that can be done with CRISPR that people could be quite happy with and that could have many benefits for people.</p></speech>

I do not think four doctors have ever appeared together before an Oireachtas agriculture committee.  That does not mean we are daunted by them; we are an incorrigible bunch.  There has been much bad publicity about this issue in the past.  There is no Green Party member of the committee in attendance at the moment, although perhaps he is attending remotely.  Nevertheless, there are fears of a loss of control in regard to production, issues with seed production and scaremongering in regard to whether there will be plants that do not have valid or high-quality seeds.  Another member mentioned Monsanto and there has been much international publicity about that company.  This is very powerful technology.  There was a reference earlier to how similar technology has been used in the context of human healthcare and it does not seem to present the same problem.</p> <p>  Will our guests elaborate on the issue of sustainable agriculture and the European Green Deal?  How does this all fit in to the bigger picture and architecture of the European Green Deal?  It is a very current issue that everyone is buying into.  It is part of the CAP discussions and wider environmental issues.  This country has a coalition Government including the Green Party, which has expressed strong views on the issue.  Even so, when I ran a quick search within the programme for Government in advance of this meeting, I found no reference to the issue.  It does not seem to be a commitment for the Government one way or the other.  The then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, stated that Government would keep it under active consideration but there were no commitments.  Clearly, there have been advances and it is a developing technology, but there genuine concerns and, in the absence of facts, people are somewhat frightened by it all.</p> <p>  How do our guests foresee the European Green Deal fitting in with all this aspiration, vision and planning?  It is very important.  In Ireland, responsibility for GMO policy and regulation comes under the Departments of the Environment, Communications and Climate Action, Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health, the EPA and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Do our guests have views on that?  Should it be more centralised?  I appreciate there is overlap and I can see why, but they might outline their views.   In the interests of reassuring people, how can all this be squared up?  We have to make the language simple for people to understand.</p><p>I again thank the witnesses for coming in and for providing their papers in advance which we have all had an opportunity to read.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Thomas McLoughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030900002#H00200"><p>There have been concerns.  The technology is more than 30 years old and has been used worldwide, especially in North America and South America.  Most of the soybean that we import is GM and the corn is GM.  In fact, a good argument for the GM potato is whether consumers in Ireland would eat a potato that was not sprayed ten or 13 times during the year?  The other question I have is that organic farmers in Ireland and elsewhere in the European Union are allowed to use copper sulphate to control potato blight fungus.  Copper sulphate is actually a heavy metal from copper.  It is crazy that such products are on the market.  To have consumers using a GM potato has to be much safer but, as Dr. Doyle Prestwich said, communicating that message to the public is hugely important.</p> <p>  One of the Deputies asked whether there were any concerns over the years.  The big concern 30 years ago with herbicidal tolerant plants was that those plants would become invasive within the environment.  That did not happen.  However, we have a lot of invasive species in the west of Ireland.  In my own part, Achill Island, there is gunnera.  There are rhododendron and Japanese knotweed all over the country and no one is doing anything about it.  They are not even on the list at the EU because they are out of control, yet we are worried about something that probably will never happen with a GM crop, let alone CRISPR.  I think the CRISPR technology is much safer again and, as I have stated, is the same as traditional plant breeding and GM technology.  Communicating it to the public is very important.  An example is the GM potato and perhaps the Teagasc representatives will mention that when they come in later.</p></speech>

For farmers in Ireland, I honestly do not understand how we can efficiently and effectively reduce our pesticides by half by 2030, which is the commitment.  We may well reduce our pesticides but the disease is still out there, so what do we do to treat the disease?  Dr. McLoughlin referred to copper sulphate in the organic sector, which is banned in a conventional setting, but what do farmers conventionally use?  What is available to them?</p> <p>  Again, coming back to communication, this is something we have suffered from within this industry for a very long time because other groups will get out ahead of the scientists and say certain things.  Those are real concerns that we have to take on board as well but, sometimes, the truth gets lost in the story.  A quick sound bite gets out there and it is run and all the rest, so the real science gets lost.  We definitely have a battle in terms of the communication.</p> <p>  This could be one of our solutions, although I do not think any of us would say that this is the only way forward.  As stated earlier, and we all alluded to it, what we are talking about is a toolkit.  From that toolkit, there are certain things we can take, and this is just one of them.  For example, we have the integrated pest management strategy.  This does not take from maintaining good soil health, crop rotation or good agricultural practice, but what it does is give every farmer in the country the possibility to reduce their spraying regimes and, as a consequence, reduce emissions as they do not have to spray with fossil fuel-based chemicals.  I see huge advantages with this technology.  Communication is going to be our stumbling block but we can get it right.</p></speech>

Are we going to reduce the acreage of food?  Are we going to be rewetting given biodiversity and climate change is very important?  He has questioned it.  I am sure all of the committee members have read the editorial, and I see the Cathaoirleach is smiling.  It is a very good editorial and a timely intervention because we need to be using all the tools in the toolbox, but we also have to be very careful of what is happening because Ukraine and Russia produce a lot of wheat for the world market.  On the European Green Deal, we need to b&iacute; c&uacute;ramach.</p></speech>

In many ways, I can see the benefits of controlling herbicides and it is clearly better than spraying all the bits and pieces.  Will Dr. Doyle Prestwich explain that technology because there are people listening in here and those who will be looking at &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; tonight and saying this is very interesting.  Herbicide intolerance is bred into many crops under this technology.  It is used in other places in the world, so we know it works.  Can she explain some of that technology, how it works and how it all happens, in very simple language, if possible?</p></speech>

Herbicides have been around for a lot longer than genetic but, somehow, that argument has become kind of confused, if we like.  Generally, and very briefly, the science behind herbicide tolerance is that herbicide tolerance is a trait that is exhibited both by plants and by microbes in the soil.  With some of the stuff we see in terms of what is happening in the United States, like herbicide-tolerant maize, for example, it may be that a gene has been taken from a microbe and inserted into a plant, and that is one way.  There are different strategies and I will not go into all of them, but that is just one way.  Again, herbicides are not around because GM crops are around, but the two have been conflated.</p></speech>

This is where we come back to the good communication strategy.  The Senator might remember that, in 2018, we ran an international biotechnology conference at the Convention Centre Dublin.  We tried to do as much public outreach on that as possible but we have to address the communication, which is key, and that is what we are here today to do.  We are very grateful to have this opportunity to talk to all of the members here and to try to get the message across that some of those old arguments that are still being rolled out are not relevant to this technology.  That is not to say there are not real concerns as well and that is what we are hoping to discuss.</p></speech>

That did not happen.  However, as I said, we have invasive species that came in, such as Japanese knotweed and others, and no one is concerned about them at all.  I would call that the irony of ironies.</p></speech>

I have several questions.  Perhaps these are myths but these things need to be talked about.  I have heard that in America, going back many years, companies would have modified corn.  The farmer had to sew it under licence and if some of it was brought to the next field on the wind, the farmer was tied into having to pay a fee even though they might not be involved in it.  I have read that but is it correct?  On top of that, on the European green deal, unfortunately, they probably did not listen to the most important people in all of this, the farmers.  In academia, they were doing this up but they will have to go back to the drawing board because we are now in a wartime era, although we had talked about having food nearly coming out of our ears, with all they were telling us.</p><p>There was talk of cuts and different things being done in Mayo, in the west, or in Donegal, and that there would be rewetting and that the sheep, cattle or whatever would be taken.  They have got this very wrong and, in my opinion, Europe must become self-sufficient.  I say that because of what have we tended to do in Europe, and I mention the Green Deal.  We are becoming the sales people.  If it is dirty, we get Brazil or some other country or continent to produce it.  We will sell it on as long as it does not produce carbon emissions.  It should be brought home to us now that heat and food are two of the most important things.  We are stuck at the moment.  We are like birds in the nest with our beaks open because we are waiting for oil and different things to arrive.  We have left ourselves high and dry.  Do the witnesses have a problem with that?</p><p> I listened with interest to Dr. Patrick Harrison.  He talked about the different problems people have in health and that one can change a plant to perform better.  Blockages were mentioned.  Is the big blockage EU regulation?  Reference was made to member states.  Do member states make independent decisions or does everything hang on a European decision?</p></speech>

The Government or the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will be involved in those debates.  It is at EU level.</p> <p>  I will answer one other question.  The Deputy mentioned what happened many years ago in the States.  There were a number of cases but that was in the early days of crops of GM technology.  A few farmers took a case against a neighbour for cross-contamination.  I think there were a few court cases and cross-contamination was found to have occurred because pollen will flow but the question was whether it caused environmental harm.  If one grows oil-seed rape on the border of County Mayo and it went into the Deputy's county of Galway, then the question would be whether it caused environmental harm.  I believe that would not.  Those are the key things.  There were a few court cases but we have not heard of any in years.</p></speech>

Only one crop has been approved for use in the European Union, which is the maize crop that is tolerant to the European corn borer and that would not pertain to Irish agriculture because we do not have that.  I would imagine there are some sort of technologies that farmers might have to pay for but I suggest the Deputy addresses his question to Department officials when they come in.  I am not very <i>au fait</i>with the matter but I think there are some royalties or whatever.  Let us remember that in Ireland, the Teagasc potato breeding programme has been very successful over the last 70 or 80 years and it gets royalties from some of its technologies.  One can see that happens with company State bodies as well.</p></speech>

I suppose that is where part of that comes from.  The Deputy mentioned Ukraine and food issues.  We cannot say that tonight CRISPR is going to solve the problems that have come about with the most recent shocks in the food system.  I really think it would be a mistake on our part if we ignored this technology.  We are not talking about today or tomorrow.  In the near term we need to embrace this technology, and we need an increase in research and development.  We have the expertise in our universities.  We must increase that expertise and growth facilities to make sure we are ready for the next shock that is going to come along.  In my paper I referenced how Ireland is currently comfortably ranked No. 1 on the global food security index but last year it was Singapore and that is now relegated to 17th place.  Therefore, this is a very moveable and dynamic index so we should not become complacent in this country.  If we are to realise the Government's ambitions in terms of the Green Deal and the farm to fork strategy, then it cannot be business as usual.  That is just not possible.  The diseases that farmers are faced with are not going to disappear overnight because we have some ambitions in terms of the climate and all the rest.  We really need CRISPR technology and, therefore, we need to invest in research in Ireland to make sure we are ready to go.  CRISPR is not an overnight solution.  We can be doing CRISPR in our laboratories but we need to know how these products will perform at field trial level.  Field trials take a little bit of time to develop in terms of proof of concept, conduct analysis and so we need to be ready.</p></speech>

Most of those vaccines were produced using GM technology but many people in Ireland or, indeed, across the European Union did not realise that happened so the European Commission had to expedite the whole thing.  If it had not done so, or we could be still waiting for vaccines.  Ironically, it is the same GM technology that produces plants as produced the Oxford-AstraZenica vaccine.  Science and gene editing are hugely important.  If we do not use it in the European Union, then we will have to import all of their food and our farmers will be doing nothing and that will be an awful shame.  That is why I am adamant about this matter.</p> <p>  Again, I thank the member for raising this topic and suggesting that we come in.  I also appreciate that the members have listened to us.

I am principal officer of the environment policy division in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Susan Fleming, assistant principal officer.  In my role as principal officer, I lead the division with responsibility for environmental policy matters, including in relation to the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms, GMOs, into the environment, the transboundary movement of GMOs and the contained use of GMOs.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is the competent authority in this area.  Responsibility for regulating seed for cultivation and animal feed in relation to GMOs falls under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Department of Health has responsibility for policy matters concerning food safety with respect to genetically modified food.</p> <p>  A GMO is any organism whose genetic material has been modified using genetic engineering or transgenic technology, for example, by insertion of genetic material from another living organism or through gene editing.  This modification confers certain traits that are considered advantageous, such as increased productivity for crops or resistance to disease.  No genetically modified crops are commercially cultivated anywhere on the island of Ireland and the only GMOs approved for cultivation in the EU are not suitable or relevant to Irish agricultural conditions.  International policy on GMOs is governed by the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.  The protocol is an international treaty governing the movements of GMOs from one country to another.  The treaty is an agreement under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which is the main international instrument for addressing biodiversity issues.  The protocol recognises that modern biotechnology and the cultivation of GMOs presents the potential to enhance human well-being while also recognising the need to protect human health and the environment from the potentially harmful impacts of GMOs.  The protocol also sets out how risk assessment and risk management procedures should be conducted, to assess and control any potential risks arising from the importation of GMOs.  All EU member states and the Union itself are parties to this protocol.</p> <p>  To implement the provisions of the protocol, the EU has put in place a comprehensive legal framework to deal with all aspects of the cultivation, transportation, labelling and use of GMOs, including the assessment and authorisation of genetically modified crops for cultivation; the assessment and authorisation of genetically modified products for use in food and animal feed; the cultivation of authorised genetically modified crops alongside conventional and organic crops; and the transboundary movement of genetically modified crops.  The main aim of this legislation is to protect the environment from potential harm arising from the cultivation of genetically modified crops or other genetically modified organisms, as well as giving the consumer a clear choice, through labelling, between genetically modified and non-genetically modified products, and the confidence that all genetically modified products can be traced back to source.</p> <p>  Given the multifaceted nature of GMOs, an inter-agency meeting is held yearly between relevant bodies to support inter-agency working and policy positions while a statutory EPA advisory committee on GMOs is in place, providing advice to the EPA board on GMO matters.  This committee has a broad remit and may be consulted on any aspects of its functions in relation to GMOs which the EPA considers appropriate.</p> <p>  I return to the Department's two main policy areas.  The deliberate release of a GMO means any intentional introduction into the environment of a GMO or a combination of GMOs for which no specific containment measures are used.  Deliberate release includes the placing on the market of genetically modified products or cultivation of genetically modified crops, including, for example, field trials in the case of genetically modified plants or any experimental release into the environment and clinical trials involving human medicinal products containing or consisting of GMOs.  Deliberate release is governed by Directive 2001/18/EC at EU level and regulated at national level through SI 500 of 2003 - Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 2003.  The EPA is the competent authority.</p> <p>  Contained use refers to the use of GMOs or genetically modified micro-organisms in a controlled setting and for which specific containment measures are used in order to limit their contact with, and provide a high level of safety for, the general population and the environment.  As well as being physical, barriers can be chemical and-or biological.  In Ireland, the contained use of GMOs is predominantly carried out in laboratories in colleges, universities and hospitals and by industry, for example, by biopharmaceutical companies.  Contained use is governed by Directive 2009/41/EC at EU level and regulated at national level through SI 73 of 2001 - Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2001, as amended.  The EPA is the competent authority.</p> <p>  On this evening&rsquo;s discussions on CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.  It differs from traditional genetic modification methods as CRISPR is able to resequence an organism's DNA without the insertion of DNA from another organism.  This technique, in the main, does not involve the transfer of genes or DNA from another variety or species but alters the existing DNA sequence of the organism.  These new mutagenesis techniques are referred to as new genomic techniques, NGTs.</p><p>In July 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that organisms obtained using NGTs are GMOs and are subject to the full rigour of GMO legislation.  In the EU this is likely to slow the development of GM crops produced using these techniques and make research using CRISPR more costly to undertake.</p><p> In particular, for member states, difficulties arise with the identification and quantification of the products produced using these techniques making enforcement more difficult.  Many of these new mutagenesis techniques have been developed since the introduction of the GMO legislation.</p><p> The EU will need to address this matter through inter alia revising EU GMO legislation.  The 2018 ruling prevents the EU from benefiting from the technological advances and competitiveness available to societies elsewhere, for example in the USA, China, Canada and in post-Brexit UK.  This ruling has been also criticised by industry and a number of breeding companies are considering relocating their advanced mutagenesis breeding programs outside the EU.</p><p> Subsequent to the European Court of Justice ruling, a number of member states expressed a desire to amend EU legislation to facilitate the registration of NGTs for possible cultivation and use in the EU.  As a result, the EU commissioned a study on the regulation of NGTs, which was published on 29 April 2021.  There were a number of expert contributors to the study and some of the main conclusions included the following.</p><p> Many NGT products have been developed over the past 20 years with some already on the market in third countries and many more expected in the coming years.  Regulation at trade level is problematic as detection and differentiation of NGT products that do not contain foreign genetic material is extremely difficult.  A different regulatory regime for NGTs in the EU versus third countries will lead to disruption in trade between member states and their trading partners, potentially leading to trade disputes.  The current regulatory regime in the EU, where NGTs are regulated in the same way as GMOs, restricts research and development and has a particularly negative impact on research and development work emanating from research institutions and SMEs.</p><p> The study concludes that NGTs can contribute to the objectives of the European Union Green Deal and the farm-to-fork strategy by developing plants more resistant to diseases, improved tolerances to environmental stress due to climate change, improved agronomic and nutritional traits, reduced toxins and allergens and reduced use of inputs such as fertiliser and plant protection products.  In the pharmaceutical sector, NGTs would afford faster development of medicinal products, including vaccines, which could address unmet medical needs.</p><p> Negative aspects are identified, such as concerns regarding potential safety, potential negative impact on biodiversity, concerns regarding cross-contamination when cultivated beside conventional and organic crops, as well as regulation of labelling and consumers' right to information and freedom of choice.  Stakeholders have different and often opposing views on these aspects.</p><p> The European Food Safety Authority concluded that plant products derived by conventional breeding techniques, which are not currently classed as GMOs and which target mutagenesis and cisgenesis, can have similar risk profiles.  Thus, a different regulatory oversight for products with similar levels of risk would not be justified.  The current risk-assessment procedures are rigid and not open to adaptation to evolving scientific progress, as will inevitably occur with further development of NGTs.  The study indicates that the risk-assessment procedure employed for traditional GMOs is not fit for purpose for NGTs and their products and it needs adaptation to scientific and technological progress.  Any new legislation needs to be resilient, future proof and uniformly applied, as well as contribute to sustainability objectives.</p><p> Following the publication of the study in April last year, the European Commission proposes to develop a policy action on NGTs which will facilitate a proportionate regulatory oversight, while at the same time maintaining a high level of protection of human and animal health and the environment and, allow the Community to reap the benefits from innovation.</p><p> Inception impact assessments aim to inform citizens and stakeholders about the Commission's plans in order to allow it to provide feedback on an intended initiative and to participate effectively in future consultation activities.  In this regard, the Commission published an inception impact assessment on a proposal on the introduction of legislation for plants produced by certain new genomic techniques in September 2021 and received more than 70,000 responses.</p><p> The Commission is currently carrying out an impact assessment, including a public consultation, to examine potential policy options and a wide-ranging communication effort to share the results of the study and to discuss its outcome and next steps with the EU institutions and stakeholders.  The impact assessment will also ensure policy consistency with other initiatives, for example food sustainability.  It is expected that the legislative proposal will be available for public consultation in the second quarter of 2022 with a final adoption in 2023 and aims to tackle the issues I have highlighted.</p><p> GMO crops are not commercially cultivated anywhere on the island of Ireland.  In addition, there was a Government decision in 2018 to transpose Directive 2015/412, which has been completed and enables Ireland to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of GMOs, and to change Ireland's voting stance from abstention to voting against the cultivation of GMOs.  This currently sets the direction of GMO cultivation policy in Ireland.  However, it is important that the GMO area be kept under review as it is ever evolving and has potentially wide-reaching socioeconomic and environmental implications.  The legislative proposal which is due from the European committee in the second quarter of this year will be carefully examined by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other relevant Departments, Government agencies and stakeholders once published.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank O'Mara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030900002#L00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for his good wishes.  I have two colleagues to assist me this evening Dr. Ewen Mullins and Mr. John Spink.</p> <p>  The process of breeding high-performance varieties is dependent on the ability to generate and exploit genetic diversity within breeding populations.  The more diverse the population the greater the chance of identifying a highly valued trait for farmers, processors and consumers.  For over 70 years mutagenesis has been an established method of generating that diversity.</p> <p>  By treating seeds or plants with radiation or chemical mutagens, mutagenesis changes the function of thousands of genes in a plant.  Consequently, this changes how the plant performs.  By evaluating tens of thousands of plants over several years, new varieties with enhanced performance or quality can be identified.</p> <p>  A key problem with mutagenesis is that the process is purely random and induces thousands of other unwanted genetic changes in the variety, which are not required.  In contrast, gene editing is a precision breeding technique which makes it possible to enhance the performance of an organism via a targeted approach that changes a single gene at a time.</p> <p>  This is achieved using a molecular technique termed CRISPR-Cas, which is composed of two parts, a "molecular scissors" used to cut the DNA an, a molecular "satnav" to guide the scissors to the specific gene.  Together these two parts form the CRISPR-Cas machinery that can be used to modify a single gene or indeed if necessary, tens of genes at the same time.</p> <p>  What does this mean in practical terms?  Looking to crop breeding for example, editing now allows breeders to deliver a range of traits such as yield enhancement, disease resistance or quality improvement.  An important point to make is that editing an existing variety enhances the value of that variety for the farmer or the processor, without changing any of the other traits of the original variety.</p> <p>  For example, many existing potato varieties meet the requirements for processing and baking but lack durable resistance to late blight disease.  Because of this susceptibility to late blight, the potato crop requires approximately 12 fungicide sprays per year.  Editing provides breeders with the toolbox to make precise changes to the potato DNA and increase resistance to late blight and other potato diseases, without compromising any of the important qualities of the variety.</p> <p>  Another recently reported example describes how editing a single gene in wheat, the MLO gene, can deliver a wheat variety with resistance to mildew.  In its natural state, this gene makes wheat susceptible to mildew, which can decrease yield potential.  By editing the MLO gene, the researchers turned off the MLO gene and hence enhanced the existing variety giving it resistance to an important disease, without affecting the variety&rsquo;s yield potential.  This is simply not possible using conventional breeding techniques, such as mutagenesis, when every step in the breeding process will alter thousands of genes at a time.</p> <p>  This highlights the precision of the editing technique.  Compared with humans, who have approximately 24,000 genes, there are more than 300,000 genes in wheat.  Having the ability to precisely disrupt a single gene among 300,000 is groundbreaking and illustrates the power of editing as a breeding tool.</p> <p>  As members know, in 2019 the European Commission published the Green Deal.</p><p>As part of that, the farm-to-fork strategy aims for a 50% reduction in the use of chemical inputs and a 20% decrease in nutrient inputs on cropping systems.  As it takes on average ten years to develop a new cereal variety and up to 13 years for a potato variety, if we are to meet farm-to-fork goals, all available innovations, technologies and tools must be considered.</p><p> The potential of new breeding techniques is real.  For example, I point to the field experiment carried out at Oak Park from 2013 to 2015 as part of an EU-funded project led by Dr. Mullins.  That work assessed the impact of a blight-resistant potato variety generated using a new breeding technique.  With this novel potato variety, fungicide applications were reduced from 12 sprays to two sprays per season, hence maintaining the sustainability of the crop and demonstrating how farm-to-fork ambitions can be achieved.</p><p> An important remit of Teagasc is to investigate the potential impact of novel technologies on the performance and sustainability of the agrifood sector.  Editing is but one application of technology that has the potential to assist in the breeding of novel crop varieties and animal breeds.  Currently we are using several genomics-based techniques within conventional breeding programmes to improve productivity and underpin farmer returns.  One of these is marker-assisted selection, which is much like the economic breeding index, EBI, in cattle.  However, although these can improve the rate of genetic improvement, it is still a slow process.</p><p>A judgment of the European Court of Justice in 2018 ruled that organisms generated through editing must be regarded as genetically modified organisms, GMOs, within the meaning of EU Directive 2001/18.  At a practical level, this means a novel crop variety developed through editing is technically defined as a GMO and hence must pass through the regulatory system within the EU prior to its commercialisation.  As has been well documented, this process is both lengthy and extremely expensive.  However, since the European Court of Justice ruling in 2018, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that editing techniques do not pose any more hazards than conventional breeding.  A multitude of scientific organisations across the EU have arrived at a similar conclusion.</p><p> To conclude, Teagasc is not in the business of commercialising or promoting genetically modified crops.  We are responsible for supporting the profitability and environmental sustainability of the sector.  To achieve this, it is incumbent on us to investigate and assess the impact of new scientific developments, be they positive or negative, so that the relevant sectors and society as a whole can make a decision based on objective information specific to Ireland.</p><p> We are happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Deegan for his opening statement.  I have a couple of questions on it.  I am trying to get my head around where the Department and the Government currently stand.  He mentioned the Government decision in respect of GMOs, whereby Ireland's voting stance has moved from abstention to voting against the cultivation of GMO.  Leaving aside the ECJ ruling, what would the Irish position have been with regard to new genomic techniques, NGTs?   Does Mr. Deegan believe that position with regard to the ban on cultivation of GMOs would also have incorporated NGTs?</p></speech>

My understanding is that if the ruling was that NGTs were outside the GMO legislation, the matter would not arise, so to speak.</p></speech>

There is a voting process there.  I will have to defer to my colleague Ms Fleming but I am not aware of a specific issue on CRISPR-associated protein 9, Cas9, that it would have been dealt with as a GMO issue.  Our policy on that at the moment is to avail of a derogation under the EU legislation.  Obviously, we always act within the EU legislation and the framework policy that is there, but we, along with 19 member states, have taken a stance that we reserve the right not to allow GM crops to be cultivated here on a case-by-case basis.</p></speech>

The first question was whether our stance would have been different if NGTs were included in that Government decision.  NGTs are GMOs.  The 2018 ruling of the European Court of Justice clarified that situation.  It was a clarification based on a request from France because there was confusion regarding whether they should be treated as GMOs.  There was certainly no means of identifying them as GMOs and that would cause significant problems in the context of the current legislation so there had to be clarification.  The clarification from the ECJ was black and white.  It ruled that these are GMOs and are to be treated as such within the current GMO legislation.  That clarified the situation but it did not help because there is no way of identifying these new breeding techniques as GMOs.  It is clear the science is such that these new breeding techniques are not as sensitive or dangerous to the environment as more commonplace GMOs.  The Commission has been seeking a more light-handed regulation to be put in place to treat new breeding techniques and get around those difficulties.</p> <p>  As regards the position of Ireland, they are GMOs.  They were not GMOs prior to the 2018 ruling but Ireland did acknowledge that if there was no way for us to identify these or treat them within the EU regulatory system, it was a problem.  That is the position we put back to Europe.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Fleming.

If something is harmful to the environment in Europe, it would also be harmful to the environment in the United States or Argentina, for example, but I accept that the officials cannot deal with that issue.</p> <p>  I want to move on to Teagasc now.  Professor O'Mara has been unequivocal in stating his belief that this technology is a route that needs to be pursued.  I am not sure if he had the opportunity to hear the earlier presentations.  I asked previous witnesses about some of the concerns around GMO.  It is not the case that some EU commissioners woke up one morning and decided that GMO technology would be banned.  The ban came about because there was huge public demand for it, in line with the precautionary approach.  I have mentioned some of the concerns that have been raised with us previously, including the potential effect and impact on biodiversity, on associated or neighbouring crops and on the wider environment, as has already been mentioned.  Other concerns centre on the ownership of the technology and the seeds associated with it.  Has Teagasc carried out any research into those concerns and is it satisfied that they can be addressed, as our previous guests indicated, through a regulatory approach?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank O'Mara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030900002#N00900"><p>I will ask Dr. Mullins to come in on the detail of that in a moment but in relation to the contribution it could make, we have very challenging targets in the farm-to-fork strategy which reflect the very challenging objectives of society.  We want to produce our food in a way that has less impact on the environment.  We want to use less fertiliser and pesticide but we also want high quality food and plenty of it.  To do all that, we need every tool that we can get.  We need to find ways to bring innovation and advances to the food production system and these new genetic technologies are one extra tool to enhance our ability to close the circle.  It is not that they are the be-all and end-all but they certainly could be a help to us.  As I outlined in our opening statement, work that we did some years ago, on which Dr Mullins will expand, demonstrated that really clearly, where we were able to grow a potato crop with a lot less pesticides, resulting in a lot less of an impact on the environment.  The farm-to-fork strategy calls for less pesticide use because of the potential impact of pesticides on the environment and if we have a technology that can allow us to do that safely, then that is a good thing.  I will ask Dr. Mullins to expand on some of the safety aspects of the work we have done.</p></speech>

We have looked at the impact on biodiversity and co-existence, or the issue of pollen-spread across the landscape.  In terms of biodiversity, in our potato study we took a gene from a wild potato which gives a conventional potato resistance to late blight.  The overwhelming majority of our potato varieties are very susceptible to late blight so by giving them that resistance gene, we effectively gave the crop immunity.  We used a new breeding technique which was not editing but a different type of technique which still comes under the umbrella of new breeding techniques.  Over the three years of the EU study, we grew the potato in the field in Oak Park and looked at the biodiversity impact below ground on soil microbes and also on insects above the ground.  There was no difference between the conventional variety sitting 6 m away in other plots versus what we were seeing with this new-bred variety of potato.  What we did see was that it reduced the fungicide load on the crop by approximately ten sprays.</p> <p>  That was purely a proof of concept and it just illustrated the fact that with new breeding-----</p></speech>

The control which had no resistance required ten sprays to maintain the crop.  It really depends on the environment, including weather, humidity and the various factors for late blight that we know.  We used an integrated pest management approach that included modelling the weather.  Our default position was that we would not spray unless we absolutely had to.  At the moment, that is not necessarily the practice because farmers must protect their crop from late blight.  We reduced the sprays from ten down to two but those two sprays were purely precautionary.  What we could see is that in another year we might have one spray or three sprays but we are getting the spraying down below the 50% target, which is what is needed for farm to fork.</p> <p>  The key issue, as I said, is that there was no impact on biodiversity relative to what we would see with a normal potato crop.  That is exciting at one level because, as I said, it is a proof of concept.  However, the key point is that it takes a long time to breed new varieties.  We are talking a decade or up to 13 years for a potato variety.  We know that because we have been breeding them in Teagasc for over 50 years now.  With the new breeding techniques, we are accelerating that breeding process.  We are effectively halving the amount of time it takes to get a new variety.  It ticks all of those boxes.  We could still cross a wild potato with a conventional potato to get resistance but when we do that, we are mixing all of the genes from the wild potato with all of the genes from the conventional one and we get a lot of traits that we do not want.  It takes many years to dilute out that background of genetic material that is there.</p> <p>  On the issue of co-existence or the pollen spread, we looked at ways to minimise that.  There are very practical ways to minimise pollen spread within a crop.  We looked at oilseed rape, which produces a lot of pollen that can travel for up to 150 m from the crop.  That tails away very quickly away from the crop, which is not surprising.  Measures such as isolation distances, keeping the crop in the centre of the farm and farmers working together in a co-operative environment all help.  With the latter, farmers communicate with each other and provide information on when they are growing material and where.  All of these very practical measures can ensure effective co-existence.  The important point about co-existence is that it is preserving the identity of the crop that is being grown but for organic growers it is extremely important that they can grow their crop on their farm and know there is no risk of the organic thresholds being exceeded.  That is very important for certification of organic systems.</p> <p>  Deputy Carthy also asked about seed ownership.  Basically, in North America, Canada, and Argentina, farmers go to the seed co-op and they sign an agreement that if they purchase genetically modified seed and grow it, they are prohibited from saving it.  Farmers do not have to grow it if they do not want to in that scenario.  When they go back to the co-op each year, as is the case in Ireland, they want to purchase the best seed.</p><p>As is the case with farmers in Ireland when purchasing seed, they want to purchase the best seed.  Putting the best seed in the ground lays the foundation for a good crop.  That is typically the approach taken in North America, Canada, etc.  There are ownership rights when someone purchases a genetically modified seed, obviously outside Europe as GM crops are not grown in Europe.  That is well documented.</p></speech>

I wish Dr. Frank O'Mara the best of luck.  I presume our paths will cross fairly often.   Dr. Mullins and Dr. O'Mara spoke about genetics.  Dr. O'Mara might be able to answer this question.  We have been able to make progress with genetics on the cattle side, although some might say it has gone too far.  We have bred better cattle in many cases.  Can Dr. O'Mara explain why this area is such a stumbling block on the crop side when we have been able to make progress with it on the animal side?</p></speech>

I have no doubt we will see a good bit of each other in the coming years, please God.  On the cattle side, with the economic breeding index, we are basically using the performance data of the cattle to select the next generation.  One measures the progeny of a bull and identifies which is the best bull and breeds from that bull.  That is conventional breeding.  We have used genomics or genomic selection in cattle breeding in recent years.  We have used the DNA profile of the animals as a additional way of identifying, and doing so at an early stage, which of them might be the best but we are not using any technique to alter the DNA of the animal.  In conventional plant breeding we do all the same things.  We are talking about a technique that could improve that process of getting better genes in an organism.  We are talking mainly about plants.  The same could happen with animals.  The CRISPR-Cas system could be used in animals.  Some of the applications for that discussed in the scientific world would include eliminating the need to dehorn animals.  The trait of animals producing horns could be removed.</p></speech>

In the study in question, we were linked with an EU consortium in the Netherlands and were using a modelling app from our Dutch partners.  We would get a ping on the app five days beforehand indicating if there was going to be a high, medium or low threat of blight.  It was very insightful at the time because it allowed us to plan ahead.  For example, if the temperature gets beyond 20&deg;C and there is no rain or wind, that is an opportunity not to spread.  It is important to point out this was a research project that spanned three years in the field from 2012 to 2015.  It was not a commercial crop.  Farmers growing potato crops will not take that risk.  They will be risk averse because they have invested in their crop.  Since that project concluded, we have been developing with Met &Eacute;ireann a new way to inform farmers on blight risk.  We hope to be able to publish and launch that in the next two or three months.  It is to give people more confidence about when there is a blight risk.  As the Deputy said, the default position is that Met &Eacute;ireann will advise when there is blight risk but farmers have probably already sprayed once the crop grows up through the soil.</p></speech>

When speaking about GM crops grown outside the EU he referred to a licence or different systems.  Is be concerned about the licence system in America we read about many years ago?</p></speech>

As Deputy Carthy said, at that time there was a precautionary approach because the technologies were new in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Things have evolved.  As far as I know, farmers currently sign a contract or an agreement.  If there was a development in Ireland or Europe in that regard, we would be talking about standard GM crops, those that are grown in North America, whether they be insect resistant or newer crops that are drought resistant.  On editing, from listening to the European Commission, and to use the language it used, the Commission has said the current legislation is not fit for purpose and is too rigid relative to how science has advanced during the past ten years.</p></speech>

I have raised waste issues and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has been considering them for the past two and a half or three years and it does not seem to be bothered about them.  It appears the EPA will be the guiding light for Ireland on nearly everything but no results have emerged on most of the issues with which it is dealing.  Does Teagasc have to feed the information on this to the EPA?  I note the EPA, the Departments of Health and Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department with responsibility for climate action will be involved.  Off the top of my head, I noted five different parties would be involved.  It is hard to get the family to sit down on many an occasion to discuss an issue but if we are trying to get five different crowds to sit down, it is no wonder there is frustration about moving things on and trying to get results.</p> <p>  I spoke to Dr. O'Mara and I note Teagasc is doing research on different areas.  Has Teagasc been appointed to do the research on X, Y or Z and report back?  Who is making the call on all of this or doing the research?  I presume it is under licence when there is a European programme or that a few countries would do it to find out what the results would be in different climates and soils.  I am trying to find out who is feeding the information to whom.  There are five different groups involved.  It is similar to our discussion on hemp growing last week when we seemed to be going around in circles.  Is there a cohesive way to feed information into the middle in such a way that we would get a decision to confirm it is good?</p> <p>  I could not believe what I heard Deputy Carthy say.  Am I correct in believing that genetically modified soya can be imported on the basis that it is a sound product and would not do harm in the food chain but we cannot grow the same crop here?  Did I hear that right?  Is Europe such a bureaucracy that this is what we are now facing?  I heard about the VAT issue this morning but every time the committee meets, we hear something else about Europe.</p></speech>

Our goal is to investigate the technologies and carry out an impact assessment.  That is very important.  The Deputy asked if that has an impact on policy, etc.  There has been a clear impact from the all the research organisations across Europe during the past 18 to 24 months on foot of the European Court of Justice ruling.  The Commission's science advisory mechanism and multiple institutions in Europe have published studies on new breeding techniques.  All of that has fed into the Commission's considerations and that, in turn, has fed into what has happened as well as the current process, consultations, etc., mentioned by Mr. Deegan.  That seems to have traction.  The Commission has made it clear and set out a pathway down for where it wants to see this going.</p></speech>

The policy draft should be published by the end of this year.</p><p>I am not aware of when or what will be in it.  There is no doubt that would not happen without the public-funded research from Teagasc but also the universities and all of the other public institutions around Europe.  There is a weight of evidence then.  There is not just one study in one field in one country; it is multiple studies across Europe and multiple perspectives.</p></speech>

I am not questioning that.  I am trying to establish who contacts Teagasc in regard to research on this or that.  Is that done by the EPA, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of Health?  Is Teagasc asked to carry out research over, say, a two-year period, and to feed all of that information back to the relevant agency or Department or does Teagasc simply publish that work in a journal and hope that everyone looks at it?</p></speech>

There was some suggestion it might happen in quarter 2 of 2023.  At this point in time, we do not have a draft of what the EU is going to propose.  It is very aware that there is an issue with the CRISPR-cas9 issue.  We have discussed a lot of those here this evening.  The roadmap sets out a potential change to the legislation at EU level.</p> <p>  To return to a point made earlier by the Deputy, we are bound by that legislation.  It is legislation at EU level that allows for the importation of GM feed if it passes the authorisation standards and at the same time allows member states to take a stance that they do not wish to cultivate genetically modified crops on an opt-out basis.  In terms of a timeframe for legislative change, the Commission has indicated it hopes something will be adopted in 2023.  </p></speech>

There is an inter-agency group that meets.  There is the issue that there are different responsibilities assigned to different Departments.  There is expertise within the EPA on the GMO front and, depending on the particular issue, in regard to food, health issues and the cultivation of crops and its potential impact on the environment.  There are structures in place to make sure that Departments are aware of the developments on different fronts across different GM techniques and in different GM areas.

I would like to be associated with the good wishes to Dr. O'Mara.</p> <p>  Speaking hypothetically, if CRISPR was allowed, do the witnesses think it would enhance the role of Teagasc?  In other words, is Teagasc being held back by virtue of the fact that it cannot use CRISPR?  In talking about CRISPR, we are all talking about non-transgenic and the modification of the indigenous DNA of the specific plants or products we are discussing.  This is trans-European but as we are Irish we will worry about the green jersey.  How far behind the curve are we and are we in a position where we can turn up?  In terms of Teagasc's research, has it ever provided feedback to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine specifically to the effect that it is being hamstrung by virtue of the fact that there is need for a change in Europe?  Teagasc's Marginal Abatement Cost Curve, MACC, was adopted.  The witnesses will often say that they only do the research and we formulate the policy, but the Teagasc research carried out in that regard has almost become policy.  Does Teagasc have any leverage in terms of being able to say to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in particular that it is hamstrung and that it will never be able to keep up?  Food security is in danger if we do not get a change in European law or the European directive such that we can start using the CRISPR-cas9.  Is it ever the case that at meetings within the organisation there are people asking for the use of this to be allowed and saying that there is so much they could do with it?  Is it holding Teagasc back?</p> <p>  Before Teagasc responds, I have a question for the Department.  What seems to come across from the Department is the enforcement of the directive almost with blinkers on.  The message that came across is that the Department is trying to ensure no environmental damage through the cultivation of GMO or whatever.</p><p>When looking at that, does the Department ever do a balance sheet and look at the negatives of not having GMOs?  As part of the European green deal, there is a goal to reduce the use of chemicals.  When the potential environmental damage of cultivation is being analysed, is the other side of the balance sheet taken into consideration?  If reducing the use of chemicals by 50% were to negate environmental damage, is it considered whether it might be more advantageous to the environment to use these alternative technologies?  Following on from that, is it suggested to the Minister that he should be knocking on doors in Europe?  We are following the pied piper but, if we are going to achieve the targets the Department is the main instigator in setting, we need to get things changed in Europe.  Should we just wait and hope that the next judgment or ruling is better or that the new legislation or directive being proposed in Europe suits us or are we trying to influence these discussions in a way that will suit us?  That is a question for both parties.</p></speech>

There has been very little movement in terms of crop cultivation and files coming forward at EU level in recent years.  It has been very quiet on that front.  Perhaps that tells a story in itself.  We look at any potential crop cultivation issues on a case-by-case basis.  It is very timely to bring up this issue as there is now an opportunity to address it through the legislative proposal that is to come back from the European Commission.  We will be in a better position when we see what that legislative proposal entails.  It will give us an opportunity, in consultation with all of the Departments, Government and State agencies and research bodies that are involved, to see whether we need to rethink any of our policy positions.  It is just very timely.  We will get that opportunity once we see what proposals come forward from the European Commission.  It is acknowledged that the system is not working particularly well at the moment in respect of CRISPR-Cas9 techniques.  Let us see what the Commission will put forward and we can evaluate it then.</p></speech>

I would say "Yes."  Not only Teagasc, but also Irish agriculture is being held back.  I say that as a scientist and through the lens of having a tool or technique that could advance things.  With due regard to the legislators and regulators, they may have to take account of issues such as those raised by Deputy Carthy, including the public's attitude to things and so on.  The scientist's view is sometimes a bit narrow with regard to some things.  Sentiment can often be very powerful and also has to be factored in.  However, specifically from a scientific point of view, if we had access to this technique, we believe we could do better breeding.  We breed three field crops in Ireland: potatoes, clover and grass.  We do not breed wheat, barley or other cereals in Ireland.  While we do have access to this technique, if we could use it in our breeding programmes, we feel we could improve those programmes and develop better varieties of grass, clover and potatoes for Irish farmers.  Wheat, barley and oats are generally bred in other European countries because our market is not big enough to support a breed programme.  If those countries had access to this technique, they would be breeding better varieties for us and we could feed into them the types of traits we would like to see enhanced in the crops they breed.  I will hand over to either of the experts here to talk to the Senator a little bit more.</p></speech>

We enabled our capacity when CRISPR first came to the fore and have maintained it since.  We use it as a functional tool to study how genes behave in plants and whether knocking out certain genes impacts on certain traits in plants.  It is very important as a research tool.  This research has left us with capacity to capitalise quite quickly if the policy environment were to change.  That is important because, as Professor O'Mara said, breeders across Europe are going to be doing that as well.</p></speech>

In our breeding programmes, we use all of the genomic techniques we are allowed to use, which are those that are classed as conventional breeding.  If gene editing was deemed to be a conventional technique and if there was not a great cost attached to complying with the regulations, I am certain we would use it.  We have used genomic selection to stack disease and pest resistances within newer potato varieties.  If we could do that faster and more efficiently, we certainly would.</p></speech>

We have known for a number of years that not only because of the European green deal targets to reduce the use of crop protection products, but also because of the rate at which we are losing such products because they do not comply with regulations or because pests or diseases are overcoming them, we are going to need better varieties with better pest and disease resistance to maintain productivity.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to keep pace with the loss of crop protection products and the rate at which pests and diseases are overcoming them.  It will be very hard to keep winning the fight.</p></speech>

Its representatives can answer much better than I can because they know the system much better than I do.  However, there is a very complex European framework in this area that Ireland is part of.  The Department also has to balance other views.  We come at the issue from the science and technology point of view.  As Deputy Carthy said earlier, if you go back 20 or 30 years, there was a very strong fear among consumers about these types of new technologies.  That has changed to some extent.  The whole Covid crisis was quite instrumental in building people's trust in science and in what science can do.  We saw the rapid development of a vaccine based on mRNA, which brought that kind of language into people's daily use.  I hope and actually do believe that there is a more mature attitude among people to the use of technology in dealing with the types of problems we are trying to address.  They are difficult problems, such as the Senator has outlined.  We want to increase food production, to reduce the impact on the environment and to improve livelihoods while we are doing so.  Those three things can often pull us in different directions.  If we have a technology that can help us get in the bullseye where they meet, it is a shame not to use it where appropriate.</p></speech>

Its representatives were invited in on a different pretext so are entitled not to answer it, but it concerns the debate this week on the ongoing emergency with regard to food production, potential food shortages, input costs and all of that.  Teagasc will have a critical role in advising Government, farmers and all of us on meeting those challenges.  There has been a question about the capacity to increase grain and other feed production, in particular.  Are the witnesses free to comment on our capacity and ability to meet the challenge in the short period available around feed stocks, particularly grain?  How do we do that in the context of shortages and substantial cost increases regarding fertiliser, as well as fuel costs and all that is encompassed in those dual crises?</p></speech>

The witnesses may not have all the facts and figures but will they give a short synopsis regarding that question to the committee?  There are issues with the pig and poultry industries at the moment.  I had a couple of pig farmers on to me this week.  They are caught in a perfect storm and are under huge pressure.  A man was on to me today who cannot get feed for his pigs.  He was told the barley is not available.  How do the witnesses see those two sectors surviving this?  For dairy, beef and grain, the farm gate price looks like it will respond to the prices that are there but in the white meat sector, the response seems to be the opposite way.  There is a negative price response.  I do not understand, given this food scarcity, why those sectors are under such pressure price-wise.  I understand the increase in the cost of inputs but not the prices they are getting in the marketplace.  How will those two sectors survive, even in the short term, given the way input costs have gone and their prices?</p></speech>

It is a rapidly evolving situation.  First and foremost, a major humanitarian issue has captured all our attention and sympathy for the people of Ukraine.  On top of that is the impact that will have on our food system.  Over the last six months, we have had a significant challenge for the sector.  We have had rising prices for fertiliser since late last year.  That was a significant challenge, particularly for dry stock farmers.  Dairy farmers' incomes and the price of milk are reasonably good so they are better positioned.  That challenge is being exacerbated and, in addition, feed prices are increasing significantly.</p> <p>  The pig sector was already in a significant price-cost squeeze, in that the price of pig meat had fallen and the price of feed has risen quite a bit not only in recent weeks, but in the last few months.  The pig industry has been under serious pressure regarding profitability in recent months and that will be exacerbated with current developments.  We will see increases in the price of grain-based feeds in the coming weeks and have the worry of availability because Ukraine and Russia are big grain-growing and, in the case of Ukraine, grain-exporting countries.  What impact will the war have on short-term supply and product moving out of those regions and getting to Ireland and other countries?  What will be the impact in the medium and long term on next year's harvest in Ukraine.  They are big growers of wheat and maize.  Most of the wheat is sown already.  It is a winter crop.  Will it be harvested?  Will the crops be minded in the growing season?  Will the maize crop that is due to be sown in a month or so get sown?</p> <p>  We have huge uncertainty about the global supply of grains and how that will play out in the food and feed markets.  Not too long ago - 2005, I think - we had a spike in grain prices around the world and it led to much civil unrest and regime change.  A huge issue is building.  We need as a country and as individual farmers to make sure we have a secure supply of feed for our animals.  Every farmer needs to look at the number of animals he or she will have next winter and whether there will be sufficient food for them.  That is a big part of the work we will do with farmers to plan the resilience of their feed supply at an individual level for the next year.</p> <p>  We are heading into a critical period for livestock farmers in relation to the silage-making season.  Before the Ukraine crisis arose and we were just dealing with the fertiliser issue, we told farmers to make better use of organic manures to reduce the amount of fertiliser they might have to buy, and not to cut short fertilisation, whether organic manures, slurries or chemical nitrogen for their silage crop.  We will double down on those messages with livestock farmers.  </p> <p>  We will encourage tillage farmers to see if we can grow more grain in this country.  I will let Mr. Spink come in on this in a minute.  We have a short window left in the sowing season and many of our crops are winter-sown and already in the ground.  Within the remaining period and depending on the availability of seed and the likelihood of having fertiliser to grow those crops, is there an opportunity to grow more grain?</p> <p>  Poultry producers and especially pig produces are in the hot seat.  It will be a difficult period for the coming weeks and months, initially regarding affordability of feed and, in the medium or long term, the potential disruption to supplies of feed.  On top of that is the potential disruption to supplies of fertiliser through manufacturing capacity in Russia, which we rely on to a reasonable extent.  Of the order of 30% of our fertiliser, or maybe not quite that high, came from Russia last year.  The price of gas, which is a big component of fertiliser making, went through the roof a long time ago.  I do not know what it has gone through at this stage.  That is all impacting on the fertiliser business.  In my time in the industry I have never seen as much uncertainty around those issues as we have now.</p><p>Allied to that uncertainty, I have never seen as high a risk for us.  If things go wrong, they could go very badly wrong in relation to our food supply and the feed supply for our animals.  It is a situation that will require very close monitoring and action and working closely with farmers.  There is a big job to be done to support farmers in terms of securing their fodder supply for the coming year.  Does Mr. Spink wish to come in on the tillage end of it and the possibilities there?</p></speech>

There has to be the combining capacity, which we would probably have if we have a decent harvest.  However, if we get a very wet and broken harvest, would we have the capacity?  In addition, there is the cleaning and drying.  We have the storage capacity, but the cleaning and drying would be another issue.  If there were good harvesting conditions and you were bringing it in dry, there would not be a problem.  However, if we hit a bad harvest, we could be bunched.</p></speech>

However, committees are taking a graduated approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online, through Microsoft Teams.  All those attending the committee room and its environs should continue to wear masks throughout the meeting.  They may only be removed when addressing the committee.  Members should continue to wash their hands, avail of sanitiser outside and inside the committee room, be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  Those with any Covid symptoms, no matter how mild, should not attend.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  Members who are participating in today's meeting remotely are well aware that they must do so from within the Leinster House complex only.  So far, apologies have been received from Senator Marie Sherlock.</p> <p>  I thank everyone for attending to discuss the impact of Brexit on trade in Ireland.  Last year was the first full year of trade following the UK's withdrawal from the EU.  Recently published figures appear to indicate that there has been a substantial increase in cross-Border trade in both directions.  While imports from Britain have declined, there is a suggestion that some Irish firms that traditionally relied on imports from Great Britain may have switched supply chains last year to firms in Northern Ireland.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to consider this matter today.  To assist the committee in this regard, I am pleased to welcome, from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Ms Anne Coleman-Dunne, Mr. John Hughes, Ms Fiona Kilcullen and, remotely, Mr. Andrew Colgan.  I am pleased to welcome from InterTradeIreland, by remote connection to the meeting, Ms Margaret Hearty, CEO, Ms Kerry Curran and Ms Deirdre Maguire.</p> <p>  Before we start I must mention some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses with regard to references that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with all such directions.</p> <p>  The opening statements have been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration of the matter I invite Ms Hearty to make her opening remarks on behalf of InterTradeIreland.</p></speech>

In doing so, InterTradeIreland provides a comprehensive range of supports for businesses focused on growing trade, innovation and strategic partnerships across the island.</p> <p>  Following the UK's referendum vote to leave the European Union in 2016, InterTradeIreland moved to support existing and new cross-Border traders to protect and grow new trade opportunities in the face of uncertainty.  InterTradeIreland was very quick to respond with the development of a Brexit advisory service, which has supported thousands of firms on the island to prepare for Brexit in advance of the end of the transition period.  We have significant ongoing demand for our vouchers and advice on areas of customs, rules of origin and understanding VAT regulation and people.</p> <p>  Our extensive efforts in preparing firms trading across the Border resulted in 45% of firms trading in the opposite jurisdiction having plans in place to address the changes in advance of the transition period.  That was more than double the level of preparedness of the general business population, of approximately 20%.</p><p>However, the UK&rsquo;s formal departure from the EU at the beginning of 2021 has resulted in businesses across the island operating in a much-changed market environment.</p><p> In 2020, cross-Border trade in goods and services was valued at &euro;7.3 billion, which represents a decrease of 8% on 2019.  However, this is set against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic and is 7% higher than 2018.  The year 2019 showed an exceptional rate of growth before the pandemic.  For 2021, the latest official trade data from the CSO show how trading patterns between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Ireland and Great Britain, have changed during the year.  The figures for cross-Border trade in goods for the full year of 2021 between Ireland and Northern Ireland show an increase of &euro;2.8 billion.  Imports to Ireland from Northern Ireland were up 65% to &euro;3.9 billion, a rise of &euro;1.5 billion compared with 2020.  The value of Irish exports to Northern Ireland increased by 54% in 2021 to &euro;3.7 billion, an increase of &euro;1.3 billion compared with 2020.  Meanwhile, exports from Ireland to Great Britain also increased by 17% during 2021 to &euro;14.4 billion.  Imports to Ireland from Great Britain fell by 13% during 2021 to &euro;15.4 billion.  The impact on cross-Border trade in services is less clear as those data for the year are less accessible.  We will have to wait and see there.</p><p> At a broad sectoral level, Irish imports and exports to and from Northern Ireland are up across all categories.  Substantial growth can be seen in Irish exports of minerals, fuels and lubricants, which are up 118% on 2020, and in machinery and transport equipment, which are up 106% on 2020.  By value, the food and live animals sector has had the largest growth with a &euro;435 million, or 47%, increase in exports to Northern Ireland in 2021.  Within this category, dairy products made the largest contribution towards growth.  These large rates of growth are unprecedented in some sectors.  However, it must be noted that the changes taking place in cross-Border trade value in 2021 are the result of a complex mix of factors.  Contributory factors to rising value include, but are not limited to: the de-risking of supply chains in response to Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic; logistical moves and changes in warehousing practices post Brexit; the rising cost of energy and its inflationary impact; and a shortage of supply due to global demand and supply pressures, such as on timber.  There are also demand-side pressures.  For example, plastic exports from Ireland to Northern Ireland are up 68%.</p><p> On a positive note, the latest InterTradeIreland all-island business monitor survey, released just last week, found that 85% of firms on both sides of the Border are currently either stable or in growth mode, which is welcome.  This is an indication that the resilience of firms has been maintained in both economies within the new trading environment as they emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic.  However, the pandemic and the rising costs of energy and overheads continue to present significant issues for most firms on the island.  The impact of Brexit is still being felt by a number of businesses on either side of the Border, with 46% of businesses in Ireland reporting it as an issue.</p><p> Our top priority as an organisation is to continue to help businesses adjust to the new trading environment and potential impacts on supply chains.  Work in this area cuts across a number of supports aimed at increasing the growth of exporting firms.  We know from our research that 73% of indigenous SMEs that trade off-island began their exporting experience with trading cross-Border.  InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s Brexit advisory service will transition to a new cross-Border trade information service in 2022, with work under way to ensure the service continues to meet the needs of businesses in both jurisdictions as the new rules and regulations evolve. </p><p> Considering all of this, and in the context of the impact of Brexit on trade in Ireland, it is important to recognise that the rise in trade value across the Border does not all result from new sales or supply chain activity.  Many firms trading across the Border on the island, particularly those with complex and integrated offshore supply chains, are finding adjusting to the new market rules challenging.  Continued uncertainty with regard to the final agreement on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is having a dampening effect on investment.  The removal of Northern Ireland from the EU's Single Market for services is also having an impact on firms with an all-island outlook or aspirations.  Many firms are continuing to work through the impacts on service delivery and it is likely that further challenges will arise in a number of areas for services firms in the coming months and years.  These challenges will likely be centred on areas such as market access, data sharing and skills.  Looking to the future, our research shows that while there are challenges, there are also significant opportunities to grow cross-Border trade and innovation opportunities for the benefit of both economies.  Our efforts during the coming months and years will be focused on realising these opportunities for firms throughout the island.</p><p> I thank the committee and our sponsor Department in Ireland, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, for the opportunity to present on InterTradeIreland's work, as well as our perspective on supporting trade and business development on the island throughout this Brexit process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Coleman-Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030900002#B00200"><p>We are delighted to be here to speak to the committee this morning.  One of my areas of policy responsibility was Brexit preparations for the Department, its offices and its agencies and we continue with the implementation of those preparations.  I am joined by Mr. John Hughes and Mr. Andrew Colgan from our trade policy area.  Both colleagues have policy responsibility for the broad trade agenda, ranging from the EU level to the multilateral level.  Joining us online is Ms Fiona Kilcullen from our access to finance unit.  She had particular responsibility for the Brexit loan schemes.</p> <p>  It has been almost 15 months since the first trade impacts of Brexit took effect following the entry into force of the trade and cooperation agreement, TCA.  Throughout this period, businesses have managed to navigate the increased administrative burdens and non-tariff barriers that Brexit has presented, and to carry on trading.  In large measure, Brexit was not the calamitous event we all feared.  This can be attributed, in no small measure, to the level of preparedness of Irish businesses for the changed trading relationship with the UK in the aftermath of Brexit.  This is a huge tribute to the determination, hard work and resilience of Irish businesses, at a time they also faced the enormous challenges of Covid-19.</p> <p>  While the seamless trading relationship that existed prior to Brexit has certainly come to an end, businesses have faced the realities of the new trading relationship to continue trading with Great Britain, and to diversify into new markets.  Businesses were actively assisted in their Brexit preparedness by the Government through advance Brexit contingency planning, involving a range of State agencies and bodies, which provided support for businesses and traders throughout.  Support came in the guise of advisory clinics, targeted customs training and upskilling, as well as a range of enterprise supports, including voucher schemes like the one InterTradeIreland just mentioned.  Financial loan schemes such as the Brexit loan scheme and its successor, the Brexit impact loan scheme, were introduced to provide financial assistance to businesses and assist them with liquidity.</p><p>InterTradeIreland played a key role as part of the Government's wider Brexit response with initiatives such as its Brexit Advisory Service to assist companies, both North and South, to prepare for Brexit.  ITI's Brexit Voucher scheme was also used extensively to assist Irish SMEs in areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues.  </p><p> While for many businesses, Brexit is done, this is not the case for those in the agrifood sector and businesses in this sector need to continue preparing for the UK import controls.  The UK postponed import checks on goods from Ireland due to come into effect from 1 January 2022.  For this reason, the full impact of our new trading relationship with the UK has not truly been felt yet as full customs controls are not yet in place.  This temporary reprieve, and it is temporary, for goods from Ireland allows for the ongoing technical discussions between the EU and the UK on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  These discussions continue.  There was a meeting yesterday of the Specialised Committee on the implementation of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  These discussions are focused on finding durable and realistic solutions under the protocol to difficulties that present for businesses and citizens in Northern Ireland.  </p><p> As the committee will know, Ireland has very significant economic ties with the UK, our closest neighbour and one of our most important trading partners.  With the UK now outside the EU Single Market and customs union, inevitably trade with the UK is not now as frictionless as it once was.  In 2020, which was the final year of trading as partners in the EU, Ireland exported &euro;49.8 billion in goods and services to the UK with total imports of &euro;40.4 billion.  The UK accounted for around 11% of total Irish trade in 2020.  This is a very significant share and for certain sectors of the economy, our trading relationship with the UK is even more important.  For example, approximately 40% of Irish trade in food and beverages takes place with the UK.  </p><p> Brexit has changed forever the trade relationship between the UK and Ireland and the full extent of these changes will only become fully evident over time.  The EU introduced customs and border procedures and checks under the trade and co-operation agreement from the beginning of 2021 and the resulting impact on EU-UK trade has been substantial.  There was a significant fall in Irish goods imports from the UK last year decreasing by 4% with imports from Great Britain specifically down 13%, primarily driven by a reduction of 36% in food imports from Great Britain.  On the other hand, as the UK has delayed implementation of customs checks, Irish exports have yet to see the same negative impacts and indeed Irish exports to the UK actually rose by 23% last year mainly driven by an increase in exports of chemicals, which were up by 40%.  </p><p> A further phenomenon was that trade with Northern Ireland increased last year as both exports and imports recorded very strong growth of around 55% and 65%, respectively, although it should be noted this is from a very low base.  Trade has increased across virtually every sector.  These increases are likely the result of trade with Northern Ireland not being subject to the new customs and regulatory checks and the possibility that businesses on the island sourced new supply chains outside of the UK, which would be encouraging for the all-island economy. </p><p> Overall, the trade data for 2021, particularly on exports to Great Britain and on trade flows North-South, is encouraging.  However, uncertainty for the future of the UK-Ireland trading relationship remains.  Some notable shifts in trade patterns were evident in 2021.  What jumps out is that chemicals exports to the UK increased by &euro;1.5 billion or 40% to &euro;5.3 billion.  Imports of food and live animals from Great Britain declined from &euro;3.1 billion in 2020 to &euro;2 billion in 2021, which is a 36% decline.  Imports of mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials increased by 69% or by &euro;1.1 billion from &euro;1.9 billion in 2020 to &euro;2.8 billion in 2021.  This increase is due mainly to gas.  It is not clear if these shifts represent a trend or if they are more linked to global issues such as energy supplies in the case of gas imports. </p><p> To get the measure of the full ex-post impact of Brexit, it would be optimal to conduct research at the point at which agreement on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol has been reached and full UK import controls are operational on an EU 27-UK wide basis.  In December 2021, the Department of Finance and the ESRI jointly published some early analysis of the impacts of Brexit using monthly trade data up to August 2021.  It noted some early effects, including the increase in North-South trade and the asymmetric decline in imports from Great Britain.  The study confirmed the increase in trade between Northern Ireland and Ireland but concluded that product substitution away from Great Britain by Northern Ireland firms cannot be estimated without data on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  As trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is internal UK trade, it is not captured in the collection of international trade statistics.  Furthermore, firm level activity data for Northern Ireland that identifies sales to Great Britain is collected on an annual basis.  This means that the question of product substitution and the impact of the Northern Ireland protocol on trade is a potential avenue of further research once such data becomes available.  The Department of Finance leads on monitoring the overall macro-economic relationship between Ireland and the UK and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will liaise closely with the Department of Finance regarding future research on the impact of Brexit.  </p><p> I think we have covered the issues of logistics, transport and routes to market so I will skip over them.  The analysis of trade data available at this point indicates the asymmetric impact of Brexit on imports and exports.  This divergence between exports to and imports from the UK suggests that the divergent non-tariff barriers to trade have had an impact on bilateral trade.  Brexit is still unfolding and the phased implementation of UK import controls means that the full impact of Brexit has not yet been felt.  The years 2020 and 2021 gave rise to unprecedented changes due to Covid-19 in terms of supply chain issues, depressed demand and inflationary costs as a result of Covid-19.  The final outcome of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland will also be a determining factor on the manner on which this impacts on trade in Ireland.  </p></speech>

This is a tiny bit off topic but it is a bit current so I would not mind getting the view of the witnesses.  If it is not possible here, perhaps we can talk afterwards.  Does Ms Coleman-Dunne think there is any value at some point in the Department and specifically the T&aacute;naiste reissuing the work from home advice given the rapid increase in the cost of fuel and the likely impact on the pocket of people going in and out to work but also given that we read in the newspapers that there is a possibility, however remote, of fuel shortages?  Does Ms Coleman-Dunne think this should be on the agenda?  I know the advice was lifted in line with the restrictions, which is fair enough, and we are working on the remote working Bill as well.  That Bill will come but what about the here and now?  If it is too far off topic, that is fine.  We can discuss it afterwards but it has been in my head since I was driving in this morning.  I knew I was going to be talking to officials from the Department so I thought I might just throw it out there.</p></speech>

I was driving in the same traffic.  I think we all see the benefits of working from home, particularly now with the cost of fuel.  All I can say is that the T&aacute;naiste is pushing forward with the working from home initiative.  I am sure that the Government is looking at it.  Obviously, some announcements are due today regarding excise duty so that is as much as I can say.</p></speech>

It came into my head and I knew I was going to be here so I thought I would not let the opportunity go.  I will pick it up with the T&aacute;naiste in any event.  In her statement, Ms Coleman-Dunne indicated that Brexit was not the calamitous event feared, which is good news, due to the preparedness of businesses.  Is there now a concern among businesses and the Department about how the current crises - inflation and energy and fuel prices, shortages of goods and raw materials and the impact of the war in Ukraine - will interact with Brexit?  I appreciate the optimism, which is good as is the analysis, but while we have survived that one, another one is here so how will that impact us along with Brexit, which, as Ms Coleman-Dunne noted, is ongoing?</p></speech>

We saw that it morphed into that.  In our enterprise forum where we met with businesses and stakeholders, originally it was all about Brexit.  We were meeting with them throughout to 2018 and 2019.  Suddenly, in 2020, that was subsumed by Covid-19 and the committee became about looking at that.  The Brexit supports the Department offered then morphed into Covid and Brexit supports.  The committee members may see the data we published on the website, which are about Covid and Brexit.</p><p> Again, who anticipated the current situation in Ukraine?  In that way, our Department and the T&aacute;naiste are always looking at reviewing the schemes we have and asking whether they are responsive to the particular needs of the day.  That is as much as I can say on that at this stage.  The Deputy will see that, in the trajectory from Brexit to Covid, the Department has made the quantum leap to assist businesses in that way as well.</p></speech>

I am sure colleagues in the Department and in that enterprise area will be looking at what revisions are needed.  We saw that the Brexit supports changed to Covid during the course.  Again, as the Deputy has said, the Government is reacting with regard to excise duties and other ways in which businesses can be helped, including with direct supports.</p></speech>

The Minister for the Economy in the North is still refusing to bring forward an economic strategy to maximise the dual market access that is afforded by the protocol.  What benefits does Ms Hearty believe a plan like this could bring if it were published and implemented?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.210" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Hearty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030900002#D00500"><p>Currently InterTradeIreland is funded one third by the Northern Ireland Executive.  As the cross-Border trade body, our <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>every day is to promote cross-Border trade and economic development.  This aligns very much with the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland, and its 10X Economy strategy to grow exports and innovation and the policies to support cross-Border trade development.  We all help to bolster organisations like ourselves and trade.  We enjoy good continued support from the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland firms, as supported by the statistics, are achieving a significant increase in cross-Border trade.  We see the opportunity for that continuing as we go further.</p></speech>

I was asking for Ms Hearty's view on whether the economic strategy that possibly should be published would have a positive impact if it were implemented with regard to maximising the benefits from the protocol.  If it is Ms Hearty's view that the benefits are as maximised as they can be, that is fair enough, but I am not disputing in any way the support that is there.  I feel, however, there is a piece of the policy missing in delivering those benefits.  While Ms Hearty has outlined some of the benefits, there could be increased benefits.  I was not suggesting there was any difficulty with the funding.  I feel there is a little area of the jigsaw missing, which could be quite big, if Ms Hearty sees what I mean.</p></speech>

I appreciate what the Deputy is saying.  Yes, the publishing of any policy is always beneficial.  Businesses, however, are always one step ahead of policy.  Businesses in Northern Ireland are taking full advantage of the opportunities the Northern Ireland protocol is presenting.  The one thing that really impacts on business is uncertainty.  Uncertainty is not good for business.  The greater clarity and certainty businesses can get will only help to grow the economy and support the wider business base.  Yes, that is a fair point.</p></speech>

The Executive has been down in the past and we have continued to operate.  I go back to my previous point, which I mean wholeheartedly, that business continues to fight despite what happens within politics and we continue to support businesses.  Demand has never been higher for our products and services.  We have never been busier, which is a good place to be.  Businesses must rise above whatever is happening in politics.  They do that daily, and we are there to support them daily.</p></speech>

It is about the decrease in imports.  The Department has outlined some of them.  Looking at the Central Statistics Office, CSO, data, we can see food, live animals, beverages, machinery and some other categories have decreased.  If they are decreasing, is there an indication of where this is being fulfilled now?  Is it coming from imports from the North, is it coming from the EU, or is it a mix?  I am aware that not all of the data are available but perhaps the Department has a sense of where it is coming from.  I know there is a difficulty recording the cross-sea data.</p></speech>

These went from &euro;3.7 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.4 billion in 2021, which is a decline of &euro;288 million.  On the other hand, our exports North-South have increased by &euro;435 million, which is 47%, from &euro;919 million to &euro;1.4 billion in 2021.  This is higher than the decline of &euro;288 million in exports and live animals. Overall, our food and live animal exports are up 3% in the year to the UK.  There does seem to be some reorientation of food exports to the UK, but it is not possible to know if this is a trend that is going to continue.  It is too early in the application of the trade and co-operation agreement, especially given that the full import controls on an east-west basis are not fully in effect at this time.</p></speech>

Has there been a consequent benefit of that in reduced transport costs, because people are not travelling as far, reduced emissions, or an increase in trade and jobs?  Does InterTradeIreland have a view on that and what the implications have been around percentage and contribution to trade?</p></speech>

It is difficult to understand in the year the changes that individual businesses are making within their supply chains.  We know from our all-island business monitor that many businesses are telling us that during 2021 they increasingly started to trade outside of their jurisdiction as a result of the restrictions and difficulties they had in getting supplies they need to fulfil their business needs.  We are seeing greater cross-Border trade in the business monitor as a result of that.  With regard to statistics, it is not possible to give a figure for the number of businesses that have adjusted their supply chains accordingly.  The changes that took place in 2021, which has seen a substantial uptick in cross-Border trade, is part of a trend that began in 2016.  Over the past two decades the average cross-Border trade grew at a rate of 4% per annum but since 2016 this upticked significantly.  We have seen substantial growth in 2016, 2017, 2018 right up to 2021, which in itself has seen a 65% increase in the value of trade North to South, and a 54% increase in trade South to North.  Businesses are undoubtedly adjusting their supply chains and this is reflected in those values.  It is not the only issue that is increasing the value of cross-Border trade of course.  There are inflationary pressures within certain sectors and factors that are very particular to our times.  The growth in pharma across the Border has contributed significantly to the growth in cross-Border trade value.  Much of that is in vaccine and in Covid-19-related products that are particular to the pandemic and not necessarily a feature of cross-Border trade going forward.  However, aside from having strong figures that outline the number of businesses that have adjusted their supply chains we can see in the trade data that it is a strong number and a high value being reflected in the CSO's figures released recently.</p></speech>

I have just one question for our guests.  I have been told that some companies are finding it difficult to get export credit insurance as a result of Brexit.  Has the Department looked into this?  Is there an ongoing review?  With regard to the impact of difficulties with getting export credit insurance, this would put some Irish companies under pressure.  If they did not have this, they would take a big risk.  If they cannot get it, and need it, then they are going to be under pressure for obvious reasons.  If a response is not available today, I would appreciate a written response to the committee on this issue later.</p></speech>

The last time I had sight of it, this issue was with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, presumably because of the nature of the exports.

I have been told by some companies that they are under pressure and it is a very serious matter.  We are one of the few countries in this part of the world that does not have a state-backed export credit insurance scheme or, in fact, a strong private scheme either.  A briefing on that would be useful.  I am told that Brexit is having an impact on this and, therefore, more information would be useful.  Have any of our guests anything to say on this?</p></speech>

It shows extraordinary resilience for a country that is the most export-exposed and the most energy-exposed country in Europe that we have been able to demonstrate the adaptability to deal with Covid-19 and Brexit.  Now we face into another challenge.  What do both InterTradeIreland and the Department believe have been the most effective tools that they have developed in the face of Covid-19?  Following on from that, what has been learned about tools that help enterprise to adapt in these very uncertain times?  I am aware that supports such as vouchers, loans and online trading vouchers were used.  There have been supply-chain diversification initiatives, de-risking supplies and energy and commodity arbitrage as companies have sought to come to terms with these changes.  Have the tools that are more effective than others and that might arm us for the next period been identified?  Specifically, is work under way on lean energy mechanisms so that new enterprise can look at its cost base in terms of the energy dimension?  For example, in food, which is a major sector, 20% of food is wasted through the supply chain beyond the farm gate and probably more within.  To what extent could resilience be developed to avoid that level of wastage in our supply chains, that could help fortify us against the challenge ahead?  Specifically on Brexit, leaving aside the politics of this, which I acknowledge is intense on all sides, are there any messages or experiences from what the witnesses have seen that we should convey to those who are negotiating the next phase of the protocol?  What are the lessons that we have seen so far that could perhaps be useful input into what is obviously going to be a tricky period but, as Ms Coleman-Dunne said, carries significant risk for the Irish food sector as import controls come in?</p></speech>

InterTradeIreland may also have an input on this.  In regard to the question on what the most effective tools are, it is horses for courses when looking at the small enterprises that are well serviced by LEOs.  There was quite a way to go in building awareness and education.  We found that one of the most effective tools was probably the customs upskilling because for 30 years, unless they were trading with other third countries, it has not been a big aspect of the way in which businesses do business.  We found that was one of the keener and most-needed interventions.  Ms Kilcullen might want to say something about the loan schemes that were brought in to assist with liquidity.  On the Brexit journey we were lucky.  We had a couple of years and, therefore, we started building the awareness, the education and the softer skills and working with businesses.</p><p>The harder interventions would have been in terms of the customs intervention.  Enterprise Ireland, EI, operates the lean initiative, which aims to get companies to diversify away from the UK.  We can take it back to the enterprise side of the Department to see if it learned or looked at the lessons.  I am not sure it has had an opportunity to do so because we moved directly from Brexit into Covid.  However, I certainly agree it would be a good look-back to do.  </p><p> We were informed by the needs of businesses through the Enterprise Forum, which was initially chaired by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and subsequently chaired by the T&aacute;naiste.  That was a great focus for us to hear at first-hand the immediate needs of businesses and how we could best address those.  The retail forum chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy English, was a great sponsor of online vouchers to get businesses online.  In the Covid situation, that has really helped businesses to manage, survive and, more than that, to do well.</p><p> I will have to go back to the Department on lean energy.  In our Department, the climate action plan has been recently launched and I know that different sectors have different targets to meet, no more than I suppose in the food sector.  I will need to come back to the Deputy on that issue, if that is okay.  </p><p> As regards the messages and experiences from the negotiating period for the protocol, again, we are on the sideline.  Obviously, the negotiation is between the EU and UK.  Every member state is informed by the Commission as to what is going on.  It is fair to say that the Commission has given a great ear to the interests of Ireland and the particular persuasions and influences as to what would work.  For example, if one looks at the Commission paper from October last, when it came forward with four papers in different areas, it had very good input from all member states but particularly Ireland.  This was shown in the case of medicines.  A real issue for citizens in Northern Ireland was accessing medicines they would be able to get if they were on mainland UK.  We have had fantastic support over the years from all of the EU members and we still have a very good listening ear in the Commission.  However, at the end of the day, it is the EU, specifically the Commission and the UK service, which now forms part of the Commission, and the UK that are actually doing the negotiation.  We will influence where we can.</p><p> Perhaps InterTradeIreland will add to that.  Ms Kilcullen from the Department may also wish to speak about the loan schemes and how they have assisted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.228" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Kilcullen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030900002#F00200"><p>I apologise as my connection is not very good.  In terms of supports assisted to small and medium enterprises, it is early days yet, so we will have reviews and evaluations in time.  However, it would seem at this stage that a good array of supports - grants, loans and equity - have been popular and availed of across the different sectors.</p> <p>  In terms of Brexit, what occurred was that there was planning and preparation for Brexit and then firms with hit with the dual impact of Brexit and Covid.  That was why the Brexit loan scheme was replaced was with the Brexit impact loan scheme, which provided for longer terms and some element of refinancing.  When the Brexit journey started Covid was not on the horizon.  We are seeing that, depending on sectors, some are availing of grants and then topping these up with a loan, be it either a Brexit or Covid loan, and others are looking to equity as well.  It would seem at this stage that a combination of supports has been very helpful and there are sector-specific needs depending on the nature and size of the business, in terms of its exposure to Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.229" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Hearty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030900002#F00300"><p>I will give an InterTradeIreland perspective, after which I will invite colleagues to add comments.  On Brexit support, it was mentioned earlier that uncertainty is one of the main factors that negatively impacts business.  There was much noise around in terms of Brexit and Covid.  Businesses need good information and tailored advice.  Under our Brexit voucher scheme, a company can avail of tailored specialist advice which was matched to the company by InterTradeIreland.  The scheme gives unique advice bespoke to the individual business and situation and demand for it continues.  It has been evaluated and proven to be very effective.  It also allowed us to then signpost to the loan schemes and the various other schemes the Government had in place.  That, too, was very effective.  However, businesses needed somebody to talk to who understood their specific needs.</p> <p>  In terms of Covid, we were focused on cross-Border traders, so when Covid struck and many channels to market closed down we introduced another voucher scheme.  This was focused on getting help in businesses to access new channels to markets online.  What we all realised was that there was a low level of awareness in companies.  They had websites and an online presence but did not actually have the mechanisms in place to trade.  Covid has certainly accelerated that experience.</p> <p>  The other agencies focus on lean energy.  In terms of feeding into the negotiations, both our policy team and Brexit advisory team feed into both Departments and Brexit teams on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  I invite my colleagues to add to that, whether Ms Maguire from the Brexit advisory service or Ms Curran from a policy perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.230" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kerry Curran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030900002#F00400"><p>I just want to touch base on the most effective learning tools, which was the Deputy's first point.  As Ms Hearty described, the key theme in respect of the supports we have put in place both for Brexit and Covid-19 is that they have been business-led.  We asked businesses what they needed and we responded flexibly.  We have received positive feedback from businesses that have availed of our services on the individual support and solutions we have provided to the problems and concerns they are experiencing in their business.  We have not told them what they needed; they have told us what the problem is and we have found a solution.  That is the recurring theme here.</p> <p>  If I may, I will touch briefly on the engagement with the UK and the EU in the current negotiations and the build-up to where we now.  As the cross-Border body representing SMEs across the whole of the island, since 2016 we have been deeply engaged at the policy level with the ongoing work on the development of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol.  We have certainly been given every opportunity to feed in the extensive research we have undertaken on the potential impact of Brexit into a wide variety of forums.  We have engaged with the Irish Government directly with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his work, but also with ministers in Northern Ireland and the Cabinet Office in London.  We sat on the Joint Customs Consultative Committee in the UK and we have been working very closely with the Trade Remedies Authority and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, HMRC.  We have hosted ministers and MEPs from across Europe at our offices in Newry in recent years to support the dissemination of information on the potential impacts of Brexit and different outcomes and scenarios on businesses on the island of Ireland.</p><p>We certainly have had the opportunity, which we have taken, to feed into the evidence base in order that the outcomes of the negotiations will not be without the evidence to support them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030900002#G00200"><p>I thank our guests.  I would not say we should have feared Brexit less than we did but I agree with colleagues that it has turned out to have been managed very well for a whole range of reasons.  The Department and InterTradeIreland must be commended on that.  I want to highlight a few points, to which the departmental witnesses might respond.</p> <p>  I have a particular concern about the agrifood space.  In their submission, the departmental officials highlighted that the agricultural cross-Border checks probably are not yet being fully implemented.  For instance, we send milk from the South to the North to be processed, which then goes back to the South.  We send meat up to the North to be slaughtered and processed before it returns here.  As the protocol gets further defined and the agricultural checks become expansive, will the witnesses say what they are doing in this regard?  This issues has two effects.  First, it has a potential impact on supply in that it will change our route pathways to market and, second, it definitely will have a price impact.  How is that being examined?</p> <p>  Another issue I ask the witnesses to address is that of transport links.  When I came into the D&aacute;il two years ago, the discussion was about the loss of the UK land bridge and how we were going to manage it.  I have to say the Government response at the time was very tardy.  It was largely left to private operators to look at getting routes out of Rosslare, which has been done successfully.  It appears the land bridge is not coming back into play any time soon.  The officials said they are liaising with the Department of Finance on macroeconomic issues.  Are they promoting further expansion of the likes of Rosslare and Waterford ports, the former having ro-ro facilities and the latter having lo-lo capability, to try to develop further export and import pathways?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.233" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Coleman-Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030900002#G00300"><p>I will take the Deputy's last question on the land bridge.  We are seeing from the trade statistics that there is quite a move away from that.  The traffic using the UK land bridge to Europe, and <i>vice versa</i>, is down by approximately 20% and does not seem to be going back to, say, the 2019 levels.  The Deputy said the Government was tardy in this matter.  It is the case that our colleagues in the Department of Transport at the time were working with the shipping operators, logistics companies and so on that were using the land bridge.  In advance of any change, they were trying to get operators to move over to other options.  Shipping companies will not put on services unless there is a reason, that is, where there are volumes of traffic to justify them.  Once that became a reality, the shipping operators responded very quickly and we now have 13 services, compared with six back in 2019, with some 60 sailings a week directly to Europe.  It has been a good success.  Sometimes, people will not vote with their feet until the need is there to do so.  The additional checks, controls and delays involved in going through the UK land bridge have put people off that route.  Our understanding is that drivers really are finding the benefits of the new routes in terms of well-being, having the rests they should be having and so on.<br/><br/>I might call one of my colleagues to come in on the Deputy's question about the agrifood space.  On the cross-Border point, the whole issue about the protocol is that we are not anticipating that there ever would be any checks.  I do not know whether the Deputy is getting into the issue of rules of origin in terms of products moving north with inputs.</p></speech>

To be clear, the whole intention with the protocol is that we will not have any regulatory checks or controls on the island of Ireland.  That has been very hard fought for by us, feeding into the Commission etc.  There is an issue around goods inputs from both parts of the island and whether they can meet the origin requirements under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and benefit from EU free trade agreements.  Mr. Hughes is better able to speak to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.236" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030900002#G00600"><p>On the rules of origin issue, where that is having an impact at the moment is in regard to the trading relationships with third countries such as Canada, Japan, Singapore and so on, under the EU free trade agreements from which Ireland benefits.  They key issue that has arisen at this time is that in respect of those third-country trades, significant inputs from Northern Ireland can take us below the threshold needed for a product to be deemed an EU-origin product.  That is impacting on the dairy and beverage sectors in particular.  We are engaged with the European Commission on possible solutions in regard to free trade agreements we are currently negotiating at Commission level with, for example, New Zealand and Australia, to see whether the existing approach on rules of origin can be adapted to accommodate an all-island approach as distinct from the 26-county aspect.<br/><br/>That requires engagement with third countries, of which I namechecked a couple, which obviously would be looking for a concession in return.  It requires a new approach in our relationships and trade with third countries.  We are engaged with the Commission on that at the moment but we do not yet have a solution.  We have potential landing zones that could assist us, but that does not have any impact on Ireland-UK or Single Market trade.  It is about third countries with which we have a free trade agreement.  We are looking to work with the Commission to see whether there is a way of having Ireland considered on an all-island basis within those third-country agreements.  Ultimately, that will require an engagement with those third countries to see what concession they may be looking for as a normal <i>quid pro quo</i>in negotiations.</p></speech>

We have all heard Prime Minister Johnson speak quite a lot about the ability of the UK to go off and make future trade deals once Brexit is done.  Has the Department been looking at forward game-planning for what might happen in this regard, particularly for our agrifood sector?  The UK still is our largest export market.  What happens if it does a significant deal with, say, New Zealand and we start to find a lot of beef or lamb from that country coming into Ireland?  Is the Department doing any kind of war gaming in terms of advising the Irish farming sector?  That sector is very challenged at the moment but prices are up because of market demand, which will lead, we hope, to further productivity.  Is the Department advising farmers of what could happen in the future if the UK gets a trade agreement whereby it pivots to taking in far more meat from other countries than it does from Ireland?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, it technically relates to other jurisdictions but it is creating increased competition.  In a recent meeting An T&aacute;naiste had with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, there was dialogue on preparing for the increased competition in the UK marketplace and how we can assist in working with the sector, principally through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to prepare for that situation.  The competition will not arise from day one because most concessions in free trade agreements in the agriculture sector tend to be in the form of quotas introduced over a number of years.  There is a lead-in time to get ready for that.</p><p>However, work in which the likes of Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia are engaged as to where we position ourselves on the market in terms of green production and moving up the value chain is part of the preparatory work we are doing, anticipating the challenges that the UK's free trade agreements with third countries will present for us.  That is some of the preparatory work ongoing with the agencies and cross-departmentally to raise awareness in the first place and then to try to respond to that competition.  It is coming, it is a reality and we have to prepare for it because, clearly, we have no influence on what concessions are agreed between the UK and third countries.  What we need is information and knowledge, and we need to work between the agencies and the stakeholders to prepare for that competition.</p></speech>

I wish to put on the record my thanks to InterTradeIreland and the witnesses from the Department for attending.  I sat in this room six years ago, when we were really worried about Brexit.  I think we were the first committee to do a report on Brexit.  We called for special status for the North, which is basically the protocol we have now.  That has protected the island economy as best we can.  Nobody would have sat here two or two and a half years ago and thought that Brexit would not be the biggest issue we would be dealing with.  We have since had the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine.  We have done particularly well to protect our economy, so I congratulate both organisations, the Department and InterTradeIreland.  I visited InterTradeIreland's outfit in Newry a couple of years ago, and a very impressive outfit it was.  I thank InterTradeIreland for its help and its presentation to the committee.</p> <p>  That concludes our consideration of this matter and concludes the committee's business in public session.  I propose that the committee goes into private session to consider other business.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

To limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all Members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others and to be respectful of other people's physical space, and they are also asked to adhere to any other public health advice.</p><p>Before we begin, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to the constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p><p>Today's meeting is an engagement with representatives from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and I thank them for their presence.  The stability programme update, SPU, report is due to be published in mid-April by the Department of Finance and it will set out Ireland's medium-term economic outlook and fiscal plans.  Its publication indicates the beginning of the budgetary preparation for budget 2023.  The committee will undertake <i>ex ante </i>scrutiny of the SPU to understand the current fiscal context, to engage with stakeholders on these issues and to allow for greater parliamentary engagement and transparency on the budgetary process.  Today, the committee will meet with the ESRI to discuss medium-term fiscal and economic outlooks, Exchequer and general government developments and outlooks, general government debt risks facing the economy and the long-term sustainability of the public finances.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Kieran McQuinn, research officer, and Dr. Conor O'Toole, assistant researcher, and I thank them for their attendance.</p><p>I invited Dr. McQuinn to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Conor O&rsquo;Toole.  We are grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee to provide our views on the present economic and fiscal situation and to discuss some key issues and risks that the medium-term fiscal strategy should consider.  Obviously, events are changing day by day as far as economic issues are concerned in regard to the awful circumstances in the Ukraine, so some of our forecasts have not yet incorporated the exact implications of that.  We will address that in our next quarterly economic commentary, which is out at the end of the month.  We will endeavour to discuss some of the issues today in terms of how we see them impacting the medium-term outlook.</p><p>The economy has emerged from the pandemic in a robust manner.  Work conducted in the ESRI suggests that the economy grew by approximately 4.5% to 5% per annum between 2013 and 2019.  This meant that the economy went into the pandemic in a strong position, which provided economic space to deal with the economic shock and emerge in a resilient fashion.  However, a number of challenges are set to confront the domestic economy and these have been exacerbated by the fallout from the recent invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.  We will discuss the potential fallout from the invasion in the risks section later.</p><p> I will turn to the fiscal and economic outlook.  The improved situation with regards to the Covid-19 pandemic enabled the Government to lift almost all of the public health restrictions as of 28 February 2022.  This has allowed for a re-normalisation of economic activity similar to that which operated before the onset of the global pandemic.  The unwinding of public health restrictions through 2021 did result in strong recoveries in both consumption and underlying investment, while the export sector of the economy performed robustly throughout the pandemic.  In 2021, we estimate that GDP grew by 13.6%, with modified domestic demand, MDD, increasing by 6.2%.  For the present year, this trend is set to continue with MDD expected to grow by 7.1%.  It will continue to grow strongly.  This reflects strong contributions from both domestic and external sources of growth.</p><p> The labour market experienced a sustained improvement throughout 2021.  Unemployment, which peaked in February 2021 at 27%, fell to 7% most recently in February of this year.  This strong recovery is set to continue and by the end of the current year, we expect the unemployment rate to fall to 5%.  The rapid decline in the unemployment rate, coupled with the strong domestic economic rebound, gives rise to the possibility of labour supply bottlenecks and associated risks for overheating in the economy.  The strength of the economic performance is reflected in the improvement in the public finances.  This year, 2022, is likely to see the first positive general government balance, GGB, since 2019; this reflects both increased Exchequer receipts and lower expenditure given the fall-off in unemployment during the pandemic.</p><p> With regard to the public finances, 2021 witnessed significant growth under almost all tax headings, with particularly large takings of income tax, VAT, and corporation tax.  These three tax headings saw annual growth of 17.4%, 24.3% and 10.3%, respectively.  The overall tax intake was &euro;68.4 billion in 2021.  Expenditure for the year was 2.6% higher in 2021 compared to 2020, however, it was &euro;1.4 billion, or 1.5%, lower than had been allocated for 2021.  The lower-than-allocated spending as well as the substantial tax intake produced a general government deficit of -3.1% of GNI*, or -&euro;7.3billion, for 2021.  This is significantly smaller than was expected at the onset of the year.  Debt levels have increased substantially over the past two years due to the large State intervention in response to the pandemic.  However, the strong performance of the economy has resulted in Ireland's debt-to-GDP and debt-to-GNI* ratios being somewhat lower in 2022 than they were in 2019, just before the pandemic.  It should be noted that the suspension of the Stability and Growth Pact has also contributed to the ability of governments to intervene during the public health crisis.  At the moment, reforms of the European Union fiscal rules are being debated, with some proposals suggesting that expenditure on climate-related matters should be excluded from the new rules that are proposed.  The return of the public finances to a sustainable path so soon after the significant costs of the pandemic gives rise to important policy questions concerning fiscal policy going forward.  Given the Government's stated plans for expenditure levels over the coming years, improvements in the public finances are likely to see a persistent fall in the debt-to-output ratio, whether output is classified as GDP or GNI*.  Indeed, if the current trajectory of the public finances were to continue, the debt-to-GDP ratio could, quite soon, fall to rates not seen since the mid-2000s.  However, should Government policy be aimed at achieving as low a debt-to-output ratio as possible or should a certain target be set, as suggested in a well-known contribution by economists, Jason Furman and Larry Summers in 2020?</p><p> I will now turn to risks in the medium term.  Despite the significant upturn, a number of factors pose challenges to the economy and living standards in the near future.  In the short-term, rising inflation and the cost of living are particularly pressing.  The most recent data indicates that the annual inflation rate was 5% for both the CPI and the HICP in January 2022.  This inflation is largely a result of international factors, with energy and transport costs being the main driver of the rising cost of living.  This is due to supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and a faster-than-expected economic revival globally.  The rising energy costs are putting pressure on households and on lower-income households in particular.  It is believed, however, that these inflationary effects are temporary, with many expecting the supply chain issues and other pressures to ease through 2022.  We have forecast an average inflation rate of 4% in 2022, with a peak in spring followed by decreases as base effects subside and supply chain issues are resolved.  However, we will revisit that forecast soon.  The forecasts were published before the recent crisis in Ukraine and the price of oil and gas has already risen since the actions taken by the Russian Federation.  Sanctions have been placed on the Russian economy and although no sanctions have yet been placed on the energy sector of the country by the European Union, this has been discussed as a possibility.  It seems likely that energy prices are set to increase further.  Indeed, recent research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, NIESR, in the UK suggests the global inflation rate could rise by 3% this year alone.  This could have significant implications for the recalibration of monetary policy by the European Central Bank, ECB.  To date, the general assumption has been that the recent increase in inflation was temporary and, hence, policy rates have been left unchanged in the short term.  This policy may change if higher inflation rates are expected to persist, although the ECB will also factor in the impact of the crisis on the growth performance of the euro area.  Over the medium term, western authorities may decide to reduce European consumption of Russian gas and oil.  This would almost inevitably lead to higher energy bills over the short to medium future.  There has been significant research, even in recent days, on this matter.  More generally, the radical shift in the geopolitical landscape will inevitably result in a sharp rise in international business uncertainty.  This uncertainty is likely to drive growth lower in the general precautionary savings channels.  The Irish economy, owing to its small and open nature, is particularly sensitive to significant changes in global economic activity.  Preliminary estimates from the ECB indicate that the conflict could reduce economic output in the euro area by up to 0.4% this year.  Previous modelling work done using the COre Structural MOdel, COSMO, the large-scale macro-econometric model of the economy, indicates a 1:1 relationship between global and domestic economic activity.  The aforementioned study by NIESR in the UK indicates that the potential impact on global growth of the Russian invasion could be in the region of 1%.  Most of the key drivers of the recent surge in inflation, such as the increase in energy costs, have been external to the domestic economy.  However, one key element of recent increases in the cost of living, which reflects domestic challenges, is the cost of housing.  Recent estimates from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, indicate that house prices are now growing by 14% per annum, while rents are growing by 8%, according to indicators from the ESRI and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  These increases are on top of sustained increases in both categories over the past six to seven years.  The pandemic, which had a negative impact on the supply side of the housing market, has exacerbated the pre-existing imbalance between supply and demand in the economy.  While a number of affordability-related issues are associated with these increases, one area where it may have a direct impact on domestic economic performance is through a loss of competitiveness.  The lack of adequate housing supply has been identified by a number of domestic and external agencies as being one of the biggest challenges to our competitiveness as an economy.  The recent Housing for All initiative by the Government is welcome in terms of its multi-annual targets and expenditure commitments, and the State must continue to focus on the delivery of social and affordable housing to tackle this issue.</p><p> Another significant challenge facing the economy over the medium term is that of climate change and the green transition.  Through the recent Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the State has committed to an emissions reduction path of 51% by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.  The importance of such a commitment is widely recognised, but it is also acknowledged that meeting such targets, along with tackling the housing issue, will require significant investment by the State going forward.</p><p> The economy has recovered strongly from the pandemic and both it and the public finances are on a firm footing at present but international factors could have a large effect on the domestic economy.  Inflation has prompted a policy response from the Government in the form of energy credit payments and it is not inconceivable that other policy responses will be required if these international circumstances worsen further, with particular attention being paid to the conflict ensuing in Ukraine.</p></speech>

On page 2 of his opening statement, there is reference to labour supply bottlenecks.  Which areas does he expect will be the hardest to address in this regard and what actions does he recommend?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.250" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022030900002#C00300"><p>There probably are a number of sectors that may suffer from bottlenecks as we move forward.  One area we are particularly cognisant of, and pay particular attention to, is the construction sector.  The Housing for All plan sets out quite significant targets for meeting housing supply over the coming years, with which most of us would agree and wish to see occurring.  However, there is no doubt it will pose a significant challenge in achieving those targets and the ratcheting up of supply.  We are looking to increase housing supply at a time when the unemployment rate is heading towards 5% this year.  That will pose a significant challenge in getting the workers necessary to achieve that output level.  This is one sector of the economy that is likely to experience difficulties in achieving that.</p> <p>  On what can be done, some of the issues are more long term, such as improving training programmes and getting people back into the supply side of the construction sector.  Net immigration and migration may also play a very important role.  We have in the past seen a large influx of workers into the country who were targeted more at the construction end of the scale in terms of where they could contribute.  That probably is the most pressing area in which we would envisage bottlenecks arising but there are others within the economy.  My colleague, Dr. O'Toole, may want to comment on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.251" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor O'Toole" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022030900002#C00400"><p>Coming into 2020, our expectation was for quite a rapid recovery in the domestic economy, particularly as the public health requirements were stood down over time.  The outturn of the abatement of the public health restrictions would lead us to assume that this rapid recovery will happen in the domestic economy.  Our expectation was that the expenditure we expected to happen this year would go into the types of activities households were unable to do during the pandemic.  For example, the expectation was that it would be targeted towards entertainment, recreation, hospitality and accommodation.  We expected that these really hard-hit sectors, which required public interaction, would see a recovery.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the geopolitical tensions, if the recovery does materialise in those sectors, there may also be capacity constraints in getting the labour in there, particularly in the short run.  These are sectors where people may have been laid off for long periods during the public health restrictions and who may have taken up other employment.  A number of frictions may have caused the traditional labour pool for those sectors to have moved away a little.  The construction sector certainly is a key issue but there may be other domestic non-traded sectors in which, if the demand comes back following the easing of restrictions, there could be bottlenecks.</p></speech>

I only have a couple more questions as I have to go to the Chamber.  What is their opinion on excluding climate-related matters under the fiscal rules?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.253" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022030900002#C00600"><p>This is a very interesting development that we have seen being discussed over the past number of months as part of a general discussion around a revisiting of the fiscal rules.  Potentially, excluding climate change expenditure is a good idea and there are a number of reasons to argue for it.  Obviously, this is an issue that is confronting nearly all countries in the European Union and there is a possibility to get agreement across many of them.  Investment is required.  One advantage of having climate measures excluded from the rules is that, arguably, it will enable the Government to commit to them on a multi-annual basis.  With the crisis emerging in Ukraine, we have seen domestically that there is always a danger that the climate change agenda could be derailed by the issues that are pressing today.  However, we all agree that, in the longer term or even the medium term, climate change is the hugely important issue.  Having measures in that area excluded from the fiscal rules would give them a certain degree of security of funding by domestic governments and ensure this funding is not thrown off course by urgent issues that might arise on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>  There also is the possibility for other areas of expenditure to be excluded from the fiscal rules.  Housing is an area that could be considered.  The housing issues and difficulties we have in Ireland are not specific to the Irish market.  We see constant reference right across Europe to difficulties that are being experienced in this area in other jurisdictions.  I would argue that we could even look to exclude expenditure on housing.  We know there is an overlap between climate change and housing in terms of the retrofitting issue.  There clearly are areas that could be developed in that regard.</p></speech>

What impact do the witnesses see the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the sanctions imposed on Russia as a result, having on the Irish and European economies?  This probably is not something the ESRI has done much work on at this time but I would like to get a feel for the witnesses' views on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.255" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022030900002#C00800"><p>We are actively considering this issue.  Our next quarterly commentary will come out at the end of this month, in which the matter will very much be addressed.  When there is major geopolitical tension or an actual conflict like we currently have, there clearly is huge uncertainty around that.  We do not know how long the conflict will last, how widespread it will be, the danger of proliferation to other countries, etc.  That leads to a massive degree of uncertainty and, generally speaking, business does not like uncertainty when it comes to making investment decisions.  Investment will be impacted in a global sense.  Likewise, generally speaking, households do not like to make significant financial decisions when there is a considerable degree of uncertainty.  Consumption levels will be impacted, as will trade levels generally.</p> <p>  There will be direct trade impacts through the sanctions against Russia and because it is a huge exporter of grain.  We have seen the pressure on the grain and cereal market generally over the past week or so.  There also are indirect effects.  We do not have a huge volume of trade with Russia directly but we have a lot of trade with other countries that trade with it.  There are potential spillover and knock-on effects in that sense.  As a small, open economy, we are going to see a contraction in international economic activity, both in the euro area and outside it.  There is no doubt this will have a direct bearing on the domestic economy.  It has been shown time after time in studies that when there is a major international shock, it very much transmits down into the domestic economy.</p> <p>  The other area of impact, of course, is on prices.  Energy prices, as we all know, have been escalating very sharply, having already risen quite significantly over the past six months.  It is a long time since we have seen the kinds of increases in energy prices we are now witnessing.  This will pose a significant challenge both to households and firms.  There is no doubt about that and there is a substantial increase in inflation associated with it.  Unfortunately, as we have seen, lower-income households, from a distributional perspective, tend to be hit disproportionately by that type of serious increase in inflation.</p> <p>  There are knock-on effects on the public finances.  We have seen a number of initiatives taken by the Government, even in the past couple of weeks, all of which carry a cost.  We are somewhat fortunate in that the public finances, as we said in our opening statement, are on a relatively stable path so soon after the pandemic.  That gives the Government some scope to deal with these issues.  As to the scale of it, we just do not know.  It all depends on the scale and length of the hostilities.  We are seeing a massive humanitarian issue, with millions of people leaving Ukraine.  The Government has welcomed in a lot of people, which is right and proper to do.  Inevitably, there will be expenditure issues around this that will have to be dealt with.  There are a number of different channels through which the conflict will impact the domestic economy.</p><p>At this stage it is hard to be definitive about the exact effects.  Certainly, there will be some considerable effects in the short and medium term.</p></speech>

I will start where he left off with Deputy Ryan.  If a comparison was done between Covid-19 over the past two years and what is now happening in Ukraine, which is the bigger worry for us?  Looking at agriculture and food security, Professor McQuinn said we do not trade much with Russia.  However, Russia produces much of the world's fertiliser which is important for us.  Ukraine produces much of the grain we need for feed as well as seeds to sow our own grain.  We have a perfect storm there.  Now we are talking about adapting our farming and our agricultural practices to do more tillage to produce more of the basic ingredients we need in order that we have the foodstuffs for ourselves and for the animals in winter so that we can continue to produce beef and dairy produce.  If Professor McQuinn was the Minister for Finance, what would he think about this?  Is there an issue around climate and farming that has to be revisited or recalibrated in light of what we are facing now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.259" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022030900002#D00400"><p>I will probably avail of my experience working in Teagasc some years ago to address some of those questions, in particular regarding the tillage sector.  On a straight comparison between the two issues, it is hard at this stage to quantify that.  We had two years of the pandemic, although within those two years we had periods of opening up and closing down.</p> <p>  As for the economic effects overall, the economy still managed to grow quite strongly through the pandemic.  That is one of the remarkable features of it.  It is a testimony to how strong the Irish economy was performing before the pandemic that it came through the pandemic in quite a strong position.  Certain sectors were obviously very badly affected but in general the economy came through quite strongly.  As I said, in terms of the fiscal side, the Government and the State spent a great deal of money on the support measures, the pandemic unemployment payment, the wage subsidy schemes, additional expenditure on health and so on, but the key fiscal metrics of debt to GDP, the Government balance, have come back to a more sustainable path in a very quick fashion after the pandemic because of how strongly the economy has been performing.  The pandemic had a huge impact but in general terms the economy managed to keep going through it and, as we said, has come out in a very strong position in the immediate aftermath.</p> <p>  In regard to the Ukrainian situation, it depends on how long the conflict goes on, and how widespread it becomes.  That is the key issue.  At this stage, it is very hard to tell.  However, there have already been significant economic impacts, as we have seen.  The Deputy mentioned grain prices and the impact on agricultural input prices in terms of fertilisers.  There is no doubt that has had a huge impact and will have a big impact right across the globe.  The energy market repercussions from this could be huge.  We have seen the US and the UK authorities minimising or reducing completely their reliance on Russian oil.  We have seen growing pressure for the European authorities to do likewise.  The desire to reduce energy dependence on Russia is perfectly understandable but it comes with an enormous cost transformation.  It would entail a significant amount of transformation right across the economy.</p> <p>  These are very hard to quantify at this point in time but certainly the downside risks associated with this are substantial and are possibly greater than anything we saw during the pandemic.  Equally we do not know whether the whole situation could possibly be resolved quite quickly.  If there was a change of government or whatever in Russia, then the military action could be reversed.  It is difficult to assess how significant the measures will be over the medium term but certainly in the short term, we have seen significant economic implications of the crisis.</p> <p>  In regard to the implications for agriculture directly, as I said, I spent some time modelling the grain sector years ago.  I know from my knowledge there that it is not the easiest thing.  Sometimes people looking on from outside think you can switch production from beef and dry stock to tillage or from dairy to tillage.  It is not that easy.  It requires significant adjustment and so on.  I do not think anybody should underestimate the challenges in terms of doing that and underestimate the impact of increasing costs on agricultural production.  These costs are obviously going to come through myriad channels as a result of this.  There are serious challenges for agriculture as well as the rest of the domestic economy.</p></speech>

I may be wrong but I cannot see how the fiscal rules can be brought back into play or even contemplated until we see how this pans out.  We are two weeks into this war and the repercussions are being felt right across the globe.</p></speech>

In general, it is fair to say that European institutions, whether the Commission or the European Central Bank, have probably learned a great deal from the financial crisis when they did not perhaps react in the way  they should have.  There has been noticeable change in the way they reacted to the pandemic in terms of suspending the fiscal rules and providing supports which they previously had not been as quick to do.  European institutions have learned much and reacted to the pandemic in a good manner in terms of trying to ensure economies got through the crisis and were not thrown off too much and that policy decisions made by the European institutions did not themselves bring about contractions in economic activity.  That will colour and influence decisions going forward in regard to this issue.  People will realise that you cannot just reimpose the fiscal rules given the huge uncertainly prevailing.  It would be very difficult ask to try to get governments to take on board the full implications of the fiscal rules in the present context.</p></speech>

What has been a housing crisis will be compounded by the fact that we will probably have 80,000 or 100,000 - those figures have been bandied about - more people who will need housing as a matter of urgency over the next 12 months.  How do we deal with that and the existing shortfall?  In my book it could be a case of taking out some of the processes that exist at the moment and getting on with building, as opposed to having processes which mean it takes between five to seven years for a project to get off the ground, and bringing in emergency measures to allow us to get to the stage where we are building and putting in infrastructure, such as water and sewerage, in places where it is needed.  That will take money and resources.  Are we in a position to front-load our national development plan starting now, and not just projects that might be delivered over time but putting up buildings to house people so that they can live in a humane way?  What are Professor McQuinn's thoughts on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.263" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022030900002#D00800"><p>We have spent time in the past talking about the imbalance between supply and demand in the Irish economy as far as housing is concerned.  Our estimates in the ESRI suggest we need about 35,000 units per annum to meet the structural demand for housing that exists.</p><p>Yet, we have been building, on average, between 15,000 and 20,000 units per annum during the past six or seven years.  We are not even meeting the yearly requirement.  That leads not only to missing out on meeting the annual requirement but also to an accumulation in the shortfall over time.  As everybody knows, there is a major task in meeting the challenge that already exists in the housing market.  Clearly, if there is an additional increase in the structural demand to house between 50,000 and 100,000 people due to the Ukrainian issue, that will compound the existing difficulties.  Significant increases in revenues have been pledged on foot of the Government&rsquo;s multi-annual commitments under the Housing for All strategy.  One could argue that perhaps more money could be pledged but the fundamental problem will be the capacity to get the workers and materials required to meet that housing demand.  That is where the challenge will be.  It is worth remembering that the energy and other related costs we mentioned earlier are all directly affecting the housing market as they are affecting many other markets.  We have seen very sharp increases in housing costs.  Those directly impact the ability of the industry to provide the supply needed.  It would be worth considering any measures that can fast-track the supply given the challenges that will probably exist as we go forward.  We are facing a very significant challenge in that regard.  I do not know if Dr. O'Toole would like to contribute.</p></speech>

It is rapidly rising in ways we have not seen for many years.  The risks in terms of direct price effects cannot be understated with respect to how much they could affect building costs and materials.  All of these commodities are internationally traded and will increase in line with the stresses we are seeing in the international markets.  That can feed through directly into our ability to meet even our current commitments and current envisaged investments in the housing sector.  We cannot understate the risks associated with how the propagation of the severe price stress we are seeing will feed back into the Irish economy.  It is certainly a major risk which is very difficult to deal with in the short term.  Housing issues take a long time to deal with.  As we have seen with the supply challenges, it has taken many years to ramp up supply.  This crisis layers an additional complexity to the ability to manage the delivery in the housing market.</p></speech>

I wish to ask about budgetary scenarios having regard to all that is happening as we face into the next budget.  I know that is like being asked to look into a crystal ball.  I refer to the pressures on existing contracts with suppliers and business people that have been entered into.  For instance, a person who has a bus company contacted me today.  Two years ago, that person entered into a five-year deal with Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide bus services at a rate that was based on the price they were paying for diesel at the time.  Now there is the issue of what they will have to pay for it now.  With the constant pressure on businesses that have entered into those types of contracts, are those businesses sustainable?  Will they disappear, as it were, from the market or is that a major risk?  Should we be budgeting to support those businesses with fixed-price contracts for three to five years, whether they be capital or service projects whose costs have greatly increased?</p></speech>

The danger related to what we call the second round effects, whereby we would have an initial spike in inflation and that would prompt people to look for higher wages or revisit contracts, along the lines of what the Deputy mentioned, and the initial spike in inflation would then prolong in the system for a period of time.  We would have been arguing against that and saying that is not something we want to see.  Unfortunately, it is highly unlikely the inflationary issue is going to go away in the short term.  Everything we see in terms of the energy markets, cereal prices, grains and commodity markets is pointing to much higher prices certainly for the foreseeable future.  The inflationary period we are now in is being prolonged because of what is happening in Ukraine.  As to how long and severe it will be, it is a question of how long the crisis lasts and the conflict continues.  Certainly, we are on the cusp of seeing very significant price hikes and, unfortunately, I do not see any great hope of those price increases abating any time soon.</p></speech>

It has come sharp and sudden.  I appreciate it has just happened but have the witnesses had an opportunity to do a body of work on the impact of the Ukraine crisis on the Irish economy?  What intervention measures should the Government be taking?  We had a reduction in excise duty today.  What do the witnesses envisage in terms of the cost of living for people?  For instance, Ukraine is one of the biggest producers of wheat.  I understand we import 30% of our wheat requirements from Ukraine and Russia.  What intervention measures are required?  Are the witnesses doing a body of work on the impact of the crisis?  Where do they envisage there will be a shortage of supply?  How can we counteract that?  Will they address those questions specifically on the Ukraine crisis?</p></speech>

We are obviously considering the impact of this crisis in the short to medium term.  The duration of the period we typically consider in the commentary is the rest of 2022 and into 2023.  We will be considering the impact of the Ukrainian crisis on the Irish economy for that period.  In terms of other work, I have no doubt we will be spending much time on this issue into the future.  I could compare this crisis to the pandemic.  In fairness to my colleagues in the institute, they have displayed a remarkable degree of versatility.  We were able to shift our work focus very quickly when the pandemic hit to consider the impacts of the pandemic on a myriad of areas in terms of macroeconomics, behaviour, health and the like.  I have no doubt a significant amount of work will be done on the impact of this crisis in the coming period.  Certain Departments with which we interact quite a lot will come to us with requests for analysis and more deep-seated and longer&ndash;term analysis and medium-term appraisals.  I have no doubt that will be the case but we are certainly considering its impact in the short and medium term.</p></speech>

The impact of this crisis is already manifesting itself in the price of oil and the potential shortage of supplies.  We are speaking to grain merchants and so forth.  I am looking at the impact of the crisis as a layman but the witnesses are the experts in this area.</p><p>Where do they see the Ukrainian crisis manifesting in the Irish economy?  What form will it take and how grave will it be?  Will the impact of the Ukrainian crisis far outplay the impact of the Covid crisis?  I want to drill down into the details.</p></speech>

As we suggested in our opening statement, a situation like this initially brings a large degree of uncertainty, and uncertainty is bad for business decisions on investments and consumption decisions by households.  It has an adverse impact on global trade in a myriad of fashions.  All the major drivers of growth that we can envisage are impacted across western economies.  We are a small open economy.  Typically, there is a 1:1 relationship between Irish economic activity and global economic activity.  If global economic activity falls by 1 percentage point, Irish economic activity tends to fall by 1 percentage point.</p> <p>  That is the overall uncertainty effect, but then there are cost-of-living issues.  Energy costs have increased sharply.  Much will depend on the scale and duration of the conflict; that will determine the point.  In the short term, though, there will be significant increases in energy costs, commodity prices, grain prices and the prices for related agricultural products and inputs.  We are looking at a substantial increase in the cost of living across the board.  What its duration will be depends on the scale of the conflict.</p> <p>  This poses a challenge for the public finances, given that the measures the Government has introduced to deal with the inflationary issues come with a price tag.  It may well be the case that more such interventions will be required in the months and, possibly, years ahead.  Those will also have significant price tags.  From the overall impact on economic activity to the impact on the cost of living and the public finances, there is a substantial effect.</p> <p>  Regarding the comparison between this situation and the pandemic, it is too early to say.  We will have to wait to see how long it lasts.  As I told Deputy Canney in response to pretty much the same question, the pandemic had an impact on the Irish economy, but the resilience of our economy enabled it to come through in quite a strong fashion.  While there are sectors that are still suffering from its effects, the economy performed in a resilient fashion overall and the public finances were able to be returned to a sustainable path quickly.  That puts us in a good position coming into this crisis, but the scale and duration of the crisis will depend on the scale and duration of the hostilities.</p></speech>

Are there intervention measures that the ESRI as an advisory body would recommend the Government should be taking now?</p></speech>

In our opening statement, we referred to how overheating pressures had been building in the Irish economy before the pandemic and were building again after exiting the pandemic in a robust fashion.  In the absence of all these crises, the danger is that we would have overheating in the economy.  Therefore, any measure that we introduce, such as measures to support family incomes, should be as targeted as possible.  Those are the kinds of measure that one can envisage at this stage.  Given that it is difficult for the Government to introduce interventions that can deal with some of the global-related issues, this is about supporting family incomes and ensuring that the least privileged in society are insulated from the cost-of-living hikes that we will face.</p> <p>  It is early at this stage to prescribe supports for businesses in terms of the duration of the effects and so on, but something like what we saw during the pandemic may be required.  Does Dr. O'Toole wish to discuss supports for businesses?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.278" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor O'Toole" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022030900002#F00500"><p>I will add something in terms of how the impact of the Ukrainian crisis feeds through to the Irish economy.  As Dr. McQuinn said, one of the main channels is the uncertainty channel.  It is likely to deter business investment, in that businesses will postpone investment decisions from now until they see the situation becoming a little clearer, and households may engage in higher precautionary savings.  However, these are channels that might take a little longer to work through the system.</p> <p>  Two direct effects that we know will happen are that it will feed into higher food prices and higher energy prices.  We will see these direct effects in the economy quickly.  Targeted measures should directly help with the cost of living for households that spend a disproportionate amount of their budgets on the items in question, namely, lower income households.  The International Monetary Fund, IMF, has warned in its statement on the Ukrainian crisis that lower income households globally are going to feel the effects of this crisis first because they are the ones that spend more of their budgets on food and energy.</p> <p>  When discussing the types of instrument that we could use and calibrate to try to direct the impacts the most, it would be those measures that are most targeted at lower income households that spend more of their budgets on energy and food costs.  That is the type of directionality that should be applied in calibrating the instruments.</p></speech>

In recent days, we were speaking internally about our commentary and were trying to dichotomise what was happening.  There are two countervailing forces.  In the absence of the Ukrainian crisis, the Irish economy was recovering quickly.  The epidemiological situation was improving rapidly, the domestic economy was kicking back in and the unemployment rate was falling rapidly.  We were starting to see signs of overheating &ndash; falling unemployment, higher wages and higher price pressures.  The international dimension was also a contributor to the inflationary pressures.  It was likely that, if these pressures continued and households kept consuming in a rapid fashion, there could be a build-up of vulnerabilities through the overheating channel.</p> <p>  This crisis has created a shock &ndash; a roadblock to growth &ndash; that we did not anticipate.  These uncertainty channels are likely to kick in and slow some of that growth quickly.  Households will put off some of their consumption decisions.</p></speech>

Typically, inflation would be associated with an overheating economy, but could there be that contradictory situation because of the Ukrainian crisis?</p></speech>

One way in which inflation in the domestic economy can materialise is if there is too much expenditure at that time.  That puts pressure on resources.  The current crisis is a different type of shock.  Prices are rising in the international markets and these are passing to us domestically.  That will lower households' expenditure because their budgets will not go as far and they will not be able to make as many consumption decisions.  Real incomes will be squeezed.  Since inflation is increasing at a faster rate than wage growth, households will have a shock to their real incomes.  That will lead to lower expenditure and then-----</p></speech>

It has to have some impact on keeping inflation down whereas if we were to give it in the form of a subsidy at the existing price, that would clearly drive inflation in a much faster way.

To answer the Deputy's question on whether we achieve overheating, since the domestic economy is growing very strongly, when the unemployment rate starts to go below 5% is typically when we see inflationary pressures building in the domestic economy.  We are still a little way off that.  The unemployment rate is approximately 7% but given that inflationary pressures are building anyway in the domestic economy, it means whatever supports we give should be as targeted as possible so they are getting to the people who need them the most and, if possible, are not spreading out towards the more general economy where they may contribute to inflationary pressures.  In essence, whatever intervention is introduced should be as targeted as possible and reach in particular the people whose incomes and livelihoods are most threatened and challenged by the inflationary period.</p> <p>  Stagflation, which is in effect high inflation and low input, is something that could occur at an international level, certainly, and possibly even in the euro area.  We are seeing a pick-up in inflation and euro area output levels typically have not been very robust anyway so there is a greater risk of that occurring, although not so much in the domestic economy because our output levels are quite strong.  I do not see stagflation being an issue, therefore, certainly in the short term in the Irish context, but at an international level it is something that could manifest itself.</p></speech>

We appreciate their time very much.  I will touch on two specific issues because we are trying to figure out all that is happening at present and trying to look around corners when we see what is happening with inflation and the implications of the war.  Every one of us is acutely aware of the sanctions the world is putting on Russia but since the representatives have expertise, have they got any insight they could give us on this?  What is their view of the implications of the possible sanctions that Russia will put on us?  I am talking about the disconnection of energy, fuel supplies and the general trade we have.  We have talked about our inward trade; I am talking about the way we might rely on Russia.  We have a very strong number of Russian connections in Ireland in the business world.</p> <p>  I have heard people say all types of things.  At present, I feel very bad to be even talking in this way about the economy, economics, money and trade at a time when innocent women, children and men are being murdered and run out of their homes and places of living, but I am only doing my job.  I have to ask questions when we have experts such as the ESRI representatives before us.  Do not think I am being cold-hearted in asking questions about finances and ignoring the most important thing of all, which is the tragedy that is befalling these lovely people.  It was so nice today to be able to meet and support the Ukrainian ambassador after she was kindly invited to the D&aacute;il.  There was a massive outpouring of support for her and her people.  I will preface everything I am asking by saying that the most important thing of all are those beautiful children, the lovely people who have lost their lives so far, the displacement and the horror.  No one can forget that but, as a public representative, I also have to be hard about it and ask the representatives about food security of supply to Ireland and fuel security of supply.  We already hear of rationing of fuel.  I know of agricultural contractors and, indeed, farmers, being told they will get half of what they are looking for.</p> <p>  I am asking about those two specific issues, the other being Ukraine, which obviously has to make decisions with regard to trade and everything because it has to try to protect itself.  Again, what are the implications of that for our country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.288" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022030900002#G00400"><p>On the implications of the measures Russia could take in countering us or responding to the sanctions that have been imposed on it, energy is the obvious issue.  Russia has already been making noises about reducing the energy supply.  It is even cutting off completely the gas that is supplied, particularly to Europe.  We know that Europe in general has a high dependency on Russian gas.  Germany, in particular, has a very high dependency since approximately 40% of its gas comes from Russia.  That is a very high dependency and there is a significant threat from the Russians to cut off energy.  However, it is worth bearing in mind that gas and oil are probably the only two commodities that Russia is now trading with the rest of the world and are certainly the two main ones.  They are worth a huge sum or value of cash to the Russian economy every day.  Europe, in general, is paying somewhere in the region of almost &euro;1 billion a day to the Russians in payments for gas and oil.  In fact, our energy consumption of gas and oil has increased over the past week or so.  We have been paying more for gas and oil to Russia than previously.  That is one of the elements.</p> <p>  Whether the Russians would carry through on a threat to limit supplies of gas and oil to Europe is a vexed question.  However, there is growing discussion about the possibility of Europe pulling the plug on supplies of gas and oil.  Again, to date, it has been very reluctant to do so but we have seen the actions of the US authorities in banning imports of Russian oil, while the UK has said it will cease all imports of Russian oil by the end of the year.  At a European level, one suspects that the clamour for this action will possibly grow in the weeks and months ahead, especially if the humanitarian situation in Ukraine deteriorates because it is ultimately the one last and most severe economic sanction the West can undertake.</p> <p>  Whichever way it comes, whether Europe decides to stop or change its imports of gas or the Russians decide to pull the plug, it is fair to say there will probably be a significant transformation in European energy use, certainly over the next year or two, in terms of what ensues from this crisis.  That will bring major challenges - there is no other way to say it - and possibly quite substantial increases in energy costs in the short term as we try to adapt.  As I said, quite a lot of work has already been done by various European agencies in looking at the challenges that would bring in respect of how quickly we could bring in liquid gas as a potential substitute, or even again looking at the possibility of nuclear power etc.  These questions are all being teased out and discussed at this time.</p> <p>  Our trade with Russia is quite limited although, and Dr. O'Toole is in a good position to comment as he has been looking at this, in certain key sectors of the economy the quantity of goods we import from Russia is quite high.  Dr. O'Toole will possibly be able to talk about that.  On sector specifics, we have heard a lot of talk about aircraft leasing and Irish companies trying to get hold of aircraft they leased in the Russian market.  Other headline companies have quite significant plants and possibly exposures in the Russian economy.  Some of those have already been mentioned in the public domain; I do not think I am mentioning anything that others have not.  The likes of Kerry Group and CRH have a substantial presence in the Russian market.  It is probably too early to tease out exactly what the implications are in respect of those issues.  While our direct exposure is quite limited, there is no doubt that the fact Russia supplies so much energy and agricultural produce to western markets means this will certainly have a general impact on producer prices, cereal prices and grain and food prices here.</p><p>As I stated, the impact from the energy component alone will be substantial in terms of the pressures it will bring on household incomes.  Dr. O'Toole may wish to come in on the fact that certain sectors do quite a lot of importing from the Russian market.</p></speech>

We do not have a major direct trade in merchandise exports to Russia but we have an import dependency in the context of two items mentioned earlier, namely, fertilisers and the energy sector.  Russia is not necessarily the largest trading partner but it is a large one.  Naturally, if there were to be any rationing or halt in the trade flows by Russia on these items, that would cause disruption to the Irish ability to use those imports in the production process and that could be disruptive to our economic activity.</p></speech>

Given that Deputies Canney, Healy-Rae and O'Donnell have contributed, it is no surprise there has been a great deal of discussion of the particular vulnerability of the agriculture sector and the impacts of energy, but I am also noticing a discussion in respect of whether Russia might default and in terms of the financial markets.  What is Ireland's exposure to that or the knock-on effects, for example, in other markets where Russia might be particularly influential?</p></speech>

Even in recent days there has been a significant amount of commentary on it and speculation that a default is imminent.  From what one can gather, obviously there is the issue of the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, exposure.  However, I do not think it poses a systemic financial stability risk to the Irish financial sector in general terms if some of those bodies were to default.  In terms of a broader default by the Russian state itself, these things can be difficult to assess.  We do not fully know what the knock-on implications may be.  Outside the IFSC issue, I do not think we have any particular exposure in terms of Russian finance generally as far as our financial sector is concerned, but clearly there would be an impact in terms of, for instance, risk premiums generally and the setting of interest rates.  That would have a knock-on effect on interbank interest rates and possibly on interest rates at the household and firm level.  If there is a major international episode such as a default, especially by a sizeable economy such as the Russian one, it would have knock-on effects.  The one channel that would affect straight away would be through the risk premiums channel and that would lead to an increase in interest rates charged throughout the financial system, whether interbank rates or possibly rates that are set in terms of households and firms.  That is the one channel where I would see that occurring.  I do not know whether Dr. O'Toole agrees or has anything to add.</p></speech>

There are countries in Europe whose banking sectors have exposures, such as Austria, Italy and France.  Those countries are more exposed to defaults not only by the Russian state but by banks in Russia with which they have exposures.  There is always the possibility of contagion from financial stability mechanisms propagating through the system.  The banking sector in particular is a lot stronger now than it was at the start of the financial crisis.  The European banks are very well capitalised.  The funding structures for European banks are much more stable than they were back in the global financial sector period.  The vulnerabilities that materialised in the financial crisis are not necessarily the same now.  The risks are lower but, with such a significant shock as the war in Ukraine that has such large consequences for the international financial sector, it is difficult to know at this stage where all the effects are going to wash through.</p></speech>

Obviously, a lot will depend on the response of the European Central Bank and the monetary authorities there.  Indeed, the whole issue of future interest rates will be very interesting because, typically in the case of a very sharp pick-up in inflation such as we are witnessing now and are likely to witness going forward, the standard response of the ECB and other agencies would be to increase interest rates as a way of controlling inflation.  To date, the ECB has been reluctant to do so in the context of the inflation increases we have seen prior to the Ukrainian issue.  That has mainly been because, as I stated in response to an earlier question, many of the European institutions are cognisant of some of the mistakes that were possibly made during the financial crisis when, for instance, there was a tightening by the ECB of monetary policy in 2008 and 2012.  In hindsight, people regard that as a profound mistake.  The danger is that if one starts to tighten monetary policy at the wrong time, it will choke the recovery of economies from the pandemic.  Of course, now economies will also be hit by this significant shock from the Ukrainian situation and that will counterbalance to a certain extent what the ECB decides to do in response to inflation.  It is a very difficult position for the ECB to be in.  It will witness substantial increases in inflation but it will also be mindful of the effect the crisis is having on everyday economic activity and it is going to try to sustain that economic activity through this crisis in the way it did during the pandemic.</p> <p>  In terms of the way the ECB has been dealing with it to date and in the context of the kind of asset purchasing schemes it has in place, the way in which it signalled it was going to deal with the inflationary issue was to wind down those asset purchase schemes initially and maybe accelerate the winding down of those schemes before it would start to increase the policy rate itself.  Of course, it is possible it will not wind down those asset purchase schemes if, for instance, it sees that countries are getting into difficulty in terms of sustaining the fiscal costs that may come about as a result of the crisis.  It is a sticky wicket for the ECB in terms of how it deals with and reacts to the present situation.  Clearly, its response will be crucial in terms of the scale of the impact of a Russian economy default and its impact on interest rates within the euro area.</p></speech>

That kind of sets me up for my next set of questions, which relate to interest rates.  I have another question before we move off the topic of Russia.  I am not an economist so it might be a slightly stupid question, but if there is a state default, will firms such as those in the IFSC necessarily default?  Will they have to cease trading or do they not necessarily have to do so?</p></speech>

It would just be a case of whether it had funding tied in with the state and consequently could not redeem it.</p></speech>

I want to ask about interest rates.  Dr. McQuinn's opening statement referred to the significant cost of the pandemic and the Government's stated plans for expenditure levels.  Dr. McQuinn mentioned a paper by Furman and Summers, which I went away and read.  Obviously, it is an American paper.  I am not an economist, but from what I can gather it seems to be suggesting that structural changes have happened in economies which are unlikely to revert to the way they were.  The way we have been using interest rates in recent decades is not the way we will use them in the future.  Is that a correct reading of that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.303" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022030900002#J00300"><p>One of its key points is to question why interest rates are so low at present.  What are the determinants of that?  How is that likely to evolve or change in the future?  Larry Summers has done considerable work on why we have had such low interest rates over a longer period of time.  One of the reasons highlighted in western economies is the demographic shift that is being observed in societies.  It is also tied into the relatively low rates of economic growth in western economies in Europe and the United States in recent years.  Consequently, there has not been the pressure on interest rates there was previously.</p> <p>  A number of factors are contributing to the low interest rate environment.  Obviously, policies of central banks have been instrumental, particularly in the euro area in the past ten years, in keeping interest rates low.  The determinants of why the natural long-run interest rate is so low are likely to remain the case in the long run.  Obviously, the major shock of the whole Ukrainian issue, especially the energy price shock, could disrupt that in the short to medium term.  The longer term outlook would certainly point in that direction.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the ESRI or the Furman and Summers paper itself gave the example of borrowing for a mortgage and accruing equity in a home.  The suggestion is we need a new conversation about investing to accrue assets and value.</p></speech>

One of the points they make, which is very much related to that, is the kind of target we should be setting.  This ties into the discussion about the fiscal rules and fiscal policy and whether we should be targeting a specific debt-GDP ratio.  For instance, should we aim for a debt-GDP ratio of 30%, 35% or 40%?  Once we hit that rate, we could then adjust our budgetary position in response to that.  For instance, in May if we are able to hit a specific debt-GDP ratio, we could still possibly engage in some degree of borrowing.  I wrote a paper last summer that looked at that particular issue in some detail, assessing what we could do in an Irish context.  Could we specifically target a certain debt-GDP ratio and then, given the likely growth rate in the economy and the likely outlook for sovereign debt costs, could we possibly borrow and still meet that target?  The evidence suggests we could.</p> <p>  These are very interesting and important fiscal policy decisions we need to think about.  If we did not have the awful Ukraine situation, we would be saying quite conclusively that the fiscal metrics are improving quite strongly in the Irish economy.  Even given the significant cost outlay associated with the pandemic, the debt-GDP ratio and debt-GNI* ratio will be lower at the end of this year than they were in 2019.  There has been a downward trajectory as far as those debt-GDP ratios have been concerned ever since the financial crisis.</p> <p>  One of the issues we were flagging was whether we will just continually run down the debt-GDP ratio over the coming years.  Will we just try to get it as low as we can, similar to where it was prior to the financial crisis, or do we set a target of, for example, 35% or 40% and then, once we are clearly hitting that target, we will be able to generate surplus funds we can use for investment purposes in areas such as housing and climate change.</p> <p>  That is an important debate.  There is considerable debate even internationally as to where, for instance, the fiscal rules could go as a potential option.  It is an important point as far as the future conduct of fiscal policy is concerned.</p></speech>

It outlines it really well for me.  I understand the level of disruption the Ukraine situation brings to the debate.  Leaving aside the level of disruption and uncertainty war brings, if we see a corresponding change in interest rates, does Dr. McQuinn believe that would negate that thesis or will it simply be a temporary effect and over time interest rates will continue to be low?</p></speech>

It will ultimately depend on the scale.  Unfortunately, I need to answer the question in the same way.  It goes back to the scale and persistence of the difficulties.  If we are into a persistent period of much higher energy prices, that will ultimately feed into higher inflation and will ultimately feed through to higher interest rates as far as central banks are concerned.  They will need to start increasing policy rates at some stage to get a handle or put a lid on the inflationary issue.  If the crisis is relatively short-lived somehow - obviously we all hope it is - and we see some return to fairly normal energy prices, maybe by the latter half of this year, then it is quite feasible we will see a return to the kind of longer term path where interest rates are concerned.  However, in the short term we need to be prepared for the possibility of policy rate increases given the sheer inflationary impact that is likely to occur from energy prices.</p> <p>  The argument Furman and Summers put forward is to simply adjust budgetary stance.  The same framework can still be used.  It just requires factoring in higher interest rate charges and possibly a lower GDP growth rate because of the effect of the crisis, and that will ultimately change the target to be set.  The framework they are suggesting to be applied is just as valid into the future irrespective of the Ukrainian situation.  It would obviously require considerably different values for future interest rate costs and possibly for the future growth path of the economy.  That will ultimately impact the target GDP ratio to be set, or the surplus or deficit targets in fiscal policy from year to year.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. McQuinn.  Page 4 of the submission reads, "Preliminary estimates from the ... (ECB) indicate that the conflict could reduce economic output in the Euro area by up to 0.4 per cent this year."  I am interested in the next sentence which reads, "Previous modelling work done using ... the largescale macro-econometric model of the Irish economy ... indicate[s] a 1 for 1 relationship.  I had not been aware of that.  We have all learned from the past two weeks - some of us knew it already - that we are not as reliant on Russian oil and gas as other EU countries.  Notwithstanding that inflation here is impacted by the war as much as it is elsewhere, we have less vulnerability to the particular energy outputs of Russia.</p><p>Will that one-to-one relationship of growth or non-growth between Europe and Ireland be exactly the same over the 12 months given that unlike Germany, we do not get 40% of our gas from Russia?</p></speech>

In terms of the effect on the Irish economy and this general one-to-one relationship, what that reflects is how open an economy we are and how dependent we are in terms of economic growth.  The traded sector of our economy is hugely important, particularly the multinational element of that.  We saw that during the pandemic.  The multinational element of our traded sector actually performed very strongly, which is why overall economic growth actually increased in 2020 when economic growth in every other country was declining.  We are hugely dependent on the traded sector of the economy.  Overall, what you would expect and what the preliminary ECB analysis is suggesting is that the crisis will have a contractionary impact on the euro area economy.  Obviously, the US and UK economies will more than likely be impacted.  These are the major economies as far as we are concerned with regard to the kind of trade we do, so even though we do not have the same direct exposure to Russia as those economies, the fact they are being hit and adversely impacted by the crisis will ultimately affect us.</p> <p>  It is worth saying that the ECB figure is very preliminary in analysis in terms of what the ECB has actually stated.  The other work that was arguably a bit more developed in the sense that it came out after that suggested more in the region of a one percentage point decline in economic activity due to the Russian crisis, so I would focus more on that figure being the overall global and euro area effect at this stage rather than the preliminary ECB analysis.  More analysis will come from the ECB in that regard.  This is why it would have an effect on the Irish economy because we are so reliant on our traded sector and that is so reliant on the UK, US and euro area economies.</p></speech>

We saw a significant failure to spend in terms of our capital allocations over the past couple of years.  Covid was the cause of some of that but we have talked a lot about capacity within various sectors.  I presume some of the effects of the Ukraine-Russia crisis will impact that capacity issue as well and supply.  Does Dr. McQuinn believe we have the capacity to spend our capital allocations in 2022 and 2023?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.312" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022030900002#K00400"><p>It will be a challenge, especially in light of the Ukrainian situation.  Another important related point is that the capital amount we are allocating will not go as far as it would have simply because cost pressures will eat into that.  The tangible output we would have got in terms of the number of housing units or other tangible outputs you would get from spending that capital allocation will now probably be less than what we originally intended or forecast simply because of these cost pressures, which will eat into the allocation amount.</p> <p>  We spoke about the construction sector earlier.  Some capacity constraints will emerge there.  They are already there but in terms of scaling up production, for example, housing output, there will challenges in meeting those kind of targets.  In terms of some of the other infrastructural projects, it is probably the case that the cost pressures we will see emanating from the crisis will eat into that capital allocation to a greater degree than we would have previously thought, so the amount of goods and services, particularly tangible goods, we get from the capital allocation will be less than we envisaged at the time we allocated that expenditure.  I do not know if Dr. O'Toole wants to add anything.</p></speech>

It is very hard to quantify exactly how large the cost pressures are going to be in particular sectors because this is a very fluid and fast-evolving situation, but it is undoubtedly the case that we will get less for the expenditure than we expected.  These challenges will only increase.  If the international price is a signal to how the commodity markets are working, it will create serious pressures, especially in the housing market.  Any large capital infrastructure that requires these international commodities will be a major challenge this year.</p></speech>

Every year, when we formulate our forecasts for corporation tax revenues, we deliberately take quite a very conservative path, and at the end of the year, we are surprised by how large the increase has been relative to what we had expected.  That is certainly one area where there is an ongoing issue in terms of the sustainability of that revenue stream.  Along with others, we have suggested we need to estimate as far as we can, because it is a difficult thing to do, how much of that increase has been what we call windfall in nature - how much of it is sustainable and how much of it is not.  We should try to base our current expenditure plans on the basis of the elements of corporation tax we believe are sustainable.  We should not seek to spend all of it on current expenditure but leave some of it for capital expenditure or divert it elsewhere.  The extent to which the crisis has an impact on corporations generally and multinationals is hard to say but it is more a concern generally about the sustainability of that taxation revenue stream.</p> <p>  Other elements of the tax base have registered quite strong growth as well.  They include income tax returns and VAT.  A lot of them are registering strong returns at the moment because they are bouncing back from low levels during the pandemic, especially VAT sources and, to a certain extent, excise.  In general, we still believe the economy is going to grow this year and next year despite the crisis.  With that, we would still expect fairly strong taxation revenue to grow but, again, there is the ongoing issue about how sustainable is the kind of increase in corporation tax.</p></speech>

If I repeat something somebody else has said, please let me know.  We saw on Sunday that Putin's regime indicated its sovereign bond repayments could be conditional on the financial sanctions imposed on it by the west.  In 1998, it defaulted on $40 billion in domestic debt after the Asian debt crisis and falling oil prices shook confidence in its short-term rouble debt.  Will the witnesses outline the impact of such a default?</p></speech>

A number of factors are associated with it.  First, our financial system has no real direct exposure to the Russian financial system apart from some of the entities in the IFSC.  We do not have exposure in terms of our mainstream banks and banks regulated here.  The direct exposure of the Irish financial sector to such an event is relatively limited.  However, obviously you cannot control things and it is very difficult to assess what happens to entities that are exposed to the Russian financial system to which we may be related or connected.  As Dr. O'Toole pointed out earlier, a number of Austrian, French and Italian banks have significant exposure to the Russian financial sector.</p><p> In terms of the overall impact of a sovereign default, one would probably see pressure in respect of the risk premia, upward pressure on interest rates across the system and interbank rates and possibly resulting in upward pressure on rates at the household and firm level.  However, a clear agent in that will be the response of the monetary authority and particularly the ECB.  If the ECB decides to try to insulate households and firms in the euro area from those upward pressures, it can do that.  Much will depend on its response.  Without wishing in any way to underestimate the impact, it is fair to say there is a relatively limited exposure of the Irish financial economic system to such a shock, but inevitably there would be some implications.</p><p> The other point to make, and Dr. O'Toole made it earlier, is that the Irish financial sector is much more resilient now than it was 15 years ago.  When the financial crisis hit in 2007 we were particularly exposed because of the exposures in our financial sector.  We are in a much stronger, more stable position.  Most financial institutions across Europe are as well, following the impacts of the financial crisis.</p></speech>

This committee has just issued its inflation report, which recognises that the underlying causes of the inflation are external and can be attributed to things such as supply chains taking time to reopen and so forth.  I am conscious that an increase in interest rates is unlikely to impact on those things, but would make the cost of borrowing more expensive.  What are Dr. McQuinn's thoughts on that?  I should note that the reason I am reading from my telephone is that we had an IT issue and I could not print anything as I have been in meetings since.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022030900002#L00300"><p>Our outlook on the inflation situation has changed with the events of the last two weeks.  Like most commentators, our view on inflation was that it was temporary in nature.  The inflationary pressures we witness, particularly the energy market issues we saw and other elements, were down to the energy market and supply chain issues.  There were obviously base effects as well which were working through the system in the latter part of last year and into this year.  We felt those pressures would abate as we moved through 2022 and that, by the end of this period, the inflation rate would be back at the target ECB rate of approximately 2% across most euro area countries.  In that context, we felt that the ECB probably would have been unlikely, certainly in the short term, to increase policy rates.  It may do other things such as scale back some of the debt programmes or the support programmes it has, the asset purchasing schemes and so forth, but it was unlikely to increase policy rates.</p> <p>  The events of the last two weeks have potentially changed that considerably.  Inflationary pressures are now likely to emerge particularly to do with issues concerning energy but also to do with food, and we have seen the huge pressure in areas such as cereals, grains, wheat and other commodities that originate both in Ukraine and Russia.  The upward pressures that are likely to come on price levels from the events of the last two weeks probably are going to be quite significant and, depending on how long the events last, could be quite persistent.  In that context the ECB will probably have to look at rates being raised possibly sooner than it would have anticipated.  Again, however, it will depend on the overall impact of the crisis on the performance of euro area economies.  The ECB will be mindful of the fact that if it starts to increase policy rates, there may begin to be some concerns about sovereign debt sustainability in certain euro area countries, so it might be reluctant to do so.  It is a very difficult position for the ECB.  On the face of it, substantial increases in inflation, probably like what we are going to witness, would generally be met with higher interest rates and an increase in policy rates, but the implications of the crisis for the growth rates of individual euro area countries and consequently the sustainability of their debt will be an issue as well.</p></speech>

I have been in many debates in which people told me that interest rates were going to rise and I kept returning to what Christine Lagarde has been saying.  Obviously we are living in quite interesting times.</p></speech>

The ECB increased policy rates in 2008 and 2012, and there is a general acknowledgement that this was a mistake and that it cut off the potential recovery of some of the economies in the euro area during the financial crisis.  There is a lot of institutional memory there, as it were, in terms of the impact that those rather hasty increases in policy rates had, so I believe that is still influencing decision-making in the ECB at this juncture.  However, clearly, if inflation really takes off and is very persistent, it is going to have to act.</p></speech>

It has been announced that the fiscal rules will not be returning in 2023, if they return in their current incarnation at all.  We have seen the issues with energy security and the requirement for that bulk of funding from the Green New Deal coming from a national level.  This is evidence that we need to hasten our transition away from fossil fuels.  Will Dr. McQuinn comment on that and will he comment on the issue of the fiscal rules more generally?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.324" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022030900002#L00700"><p>We have said, perhaps not in this committee but in other Oireachtas committees, that in the reform of the fiscal rules it would be a good idea to exempt some climate change expenditure levels because it is important that we ring-fence expenditure on climate change across the euro area.  We have seen in recent times here that there is significant pressure on some of the climate change policies because of what is happening in the Ukrainian crisis, so it important that we ring-fence the expenditure levels on those issues in order to effect climate change over the longer term.  One way of doing that would be to exempt certain climate change expenditure levels in the fiscal rules.  I also believe it could even be extended further to commonly accepted areas such as expenditure on housing which, as we said earlier, is not just an Irish issue but an issue across the euro area in terms of the need for more social and affordable housing and more involvement by governments in providing that.  There are a couple of areas where there could be exceptions built into any reform of the fiscal rules.</p> <p>  Regarding the fiscal rules in general, we mentioned the research by Jason Furman and Larry Summers.  Other more recent research by Olivier Blanchard has provided quite a lot of interesting insights into where the fiscal rules should go.  There is a need for greater clarity, for them to be more transparent and for them to be more comprehensive as far as lay people are concerned.  Often they have got very much attached to very technical definitions that are not only hard to estimate but hard to explain to the lay person.  There are many areas where the rules could be reformed, but certainly I believe, in principle, excluding certain areas of government expenditure, particularly relating to climate change and also relating to certain elements of housing, would be a good idea.</p></speech>

Once again I welcome the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, and his officials to today's meeting.  I will start with the usual note on privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contributions, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  Please note that in order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19 the service encourages all Members, visitors and witnesses to continue wearing face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others.  We ask them to please be respectful of other people's physical space.  They are also asked to adhere to any public health advice.</p> <p>  I remind members that, should a vote be called, they must physically come to the committee room in order to vote.  We will now resume consideration of the Bill on amendment No. 140.  As the discussion on the amendment has already taken place, we will go straight to putting the question in a moment.  I remind everybody, including me, that as we move through amendments I will hear from the group of proposers of the amendment and then input from any members of the committee who wish to comment before getting a response from the Minister.  We can then move to putting the question on the amendment.  Amendment No. 140 was discussed with many other amendments.</p></speech>

In such a case, this new insertion in the Bill would seek that the authority would seize all records relating to the relevant person's adoption or an illegal birth registration and open an investigation.

The amendments are intended as a safeguard to ensure that Tusla provides records and not just information from the records.  It is a key concern for people that they may not be given the actual record but information extracted from it.  We are concerned that categories of information are open to a range of different interpretations.  Given people's experiences in the past and how this has been handled in the past, there is a fear that personal data will be held back.</p><p> Amendment No. 151 seeks to change the language so that data controllers are not given a get-out clause under the legislation.  Amendment No. 152 is very similar to amendments Nos. 148 and 150.  Amendments Nos. 153 and 154 concern the provision in the Bill to provide a statement setting out the information contained in records, as opposed to a full schedule of records as required under GDPR.  If a person is not provided with a full schedule of records, he or she will not be able to ascertain what is being held back.  This, in turn, may inhibit the person's ability to know about records that have been withheld.</p></speech>

The first issue is around the discussion on the release of records as opposed to information.  I seek to reassure Deputies now, as I have on a number of similar amendments previously, that we are not just releasing information; we are releasing copies of the records.  This is provided for in relation to birth information, care information and medical information.  It will not just be a summary of what is on the records available but copies of those records.  I do not believe the sections of these amendments seeking to insert the word "records" is necessary, as that issue is already provided for.  Copies of records will be provided and that is already provided for throughout the legislation.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 154 proposes the provision of a schedule.  Again, I argue that this is covered by section 11(2)(b), which sets out a statement outlining the records and categories of information to be released and which will be issued.  As I understand it, this is the same as the intention of amendment No. 154.  I believe, therefore, that this point is already covered in the legislation.  On that basis, I do not believe these amendments are necessary and I cannot accept them.</p></speech>

The amendments are very similar to the group we discussed previously in the context of people's personal data and people having the fundamental right under EU law to access those data, not merely the information contained in a record.  The amendments seek to strengthen the Bill to ensure every effort is made to provide adoptees with their records and not just the information contained within the records, which are two entirely different things.</p><p>Apart from the fact that this restriction is in breach of GDPR, there is also a real danger of vital medical information being withheld by not providing a full schedule of records, and instead only providing information that is in the records, to the affected persons.  We also consider it inevitable that complaints will be made to the Data Protection Commission.</p><p>There is concern that the Bill seeks to set out the information contained in records as opposed to a full schedule of records, as required under GDPR.  If a person is not provided with a full schedule of records, he or she will not be able to ascertain what has been held back and this will inhibit the person's ability to know about records that have been withheld.</p><p>Amendment No. 164 seeks to broaden the scope of the data controller and requires that the data controller make every effort to locate, and provide the applicant with, all information relating to him or her.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for copies of records to be supplied to anybody who applies under this legislation.  The proposed provision is not necessary because the goal, one that we share, that people get full copies of their records and not just information is already provided for in the Bill.</p> <p>  Amendment No 164 seeks to put an obligation on a body to seek out records that it does not have.  If Tusla does not have information about a relevant person when the person applies, this proposed provision would place a statutory obligation on Tusla to look for that information elsewhere.  Tusla's focus needs to be on getting the information it has and providing that to adopted people.  Thousands of people will seek that information.  To provide a statutory obligation on Tusla to look for information it does not have and which it does not know even exists is incredibly uncertain.  To make this a statutory obligation, when there is no certainty that the obligation could ever be fulfilled, is not the best use of Tusla's resources.  For this reason, I cannot accept this group of amendments.</p></speech>

There will be a form on which they tick the box on which sort of information they seek.  I believe the vast majority of adopted people will seek all information but some may, for whatever reason, decide not to seek certain information.  This amendment seeks to force their medical information on them without them having requested it.  Giving people agency as to what information they seek is important.

As I read it, it is in keeping with the spirit of the recommendation in our pre-legislative scrutiny report.  The spirit of those recommendations in general was to ensure adopted persons would be provided with the maximum possible information.  Recommendation 14 states:</p> <blockquote> 	All information is part of an adopted person's history and heritage and must be included in the records provided to them, including: information relevant to treatment, including medical records and evidence of possible abuse[.] </blockquote> <p>The proposer may correct me but I read the amendment as saying that persons who apply should have made available to them all medical records, regardless of whether they have explicitly requested a particular medical record.  That is of value because persons seeking medical records may not know, for example, that they had a vaccine test administered to them as children.  Unfortunately, that is often the case and I have met individuals for whom that has been an issue.  They may not know that and they may not know to request that record.  This amendment seeks to ensure they would get access to particular aspects of medical records they may not have known to apply for.</p><p>There may be a better way to draft the amendment to ensure that is its effect.  It should not be read as denying agency but as ensuring that a person gets the fullest of information available without needing to apply for specific types of information.  I am thinking specifically of vaccine trials.</p></speech>

The Bill currently uses the words "relevant to the health" of an affected person.   In cases where you have a diagnosis of something, you understand what you are looking for, but many people will just want their or their family's medical history and will not know specifically what they are looking for.  The fact that it is restricted to what is "relevant to the health" is our difficulty.</p></speech>

It does not provide for forcing records on anybody or insist they see them.  It sounded like the Minister took it like that.  Does he agree that all records should be made available at that time?  Is there a better way we could word the amendment in order that he would be agreeable to it?</p></speech>

Vaccines are covered either under the medical information category or the early life category.  The amendment states "When a relevant person applies under sections 11 and 12 for information".  Section 11 deals with the "Relevant body to provide early life, care information or incorrect birth registration information".  Section 12 again concerns early life or care information.  The amendment seeks to ensure that when adopted persons look for early life and care information, they also get medical information, whether they applied for it or not.  There is already a right to apply for information in the legislation.  That will provide all medical information about the person that is on file.  This seeks to tie the release of medical information to other categories of information when the person has not sought it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.437" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#D00600"><p>That is the point of it.  I do not think people distinguish medical information from care information in the instance of, for example, an illegal vaccine trial being carried out on him or her while in care.  That is what adopted people are calling for.  They would see it as part of their early life or care information if they were subject to something like an illegal vaccine trial while in an institution.  Making their medical information available when they seek information is the purpose of the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.438" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#D00700"><p>The debate is touching on the important issue of the degree of overlap between different categories of information.  For people who were adopted or held in care, we tried to capture in the report that early life and care information encompasses so much about a person's medical history, from vaccine trials to, for example, abuse, genetic background and circumstances of birth.  It may be difficult in practice to distinguish between those categories of information.  That is the issue here.</p> <p>  We sought in the report to ensure that people would have access to and be provided with all information about themselves.  That is part of respecting and giving effect to a person's right to identity.  It would cover not just names of their birth parents, but also all the other early life and care information.  The Minister is also trying to capture it in that definition but the amendment seeks to ensure that all that information is covered and the person is not inadvertently blocked from receiving particular information because he or she thinks it is in one category when, as the Minister said, it could be covered under early life and care information rather than medical information.</p></speech>

It is clear that it covers all elements of such information.  When we undertake the information campaign about what material people can apply for under this legislation and particularly when we provide the documentation for people to make an application, we can make it clear what is set out under the categories.  We will make it clear what medical information is.  Where adopted people wish to get their medical information they will be able to see it.  We will make it simple so that people can tick the boxes for medical information, birth certificate, birth information and care information.</p> <p>  There may be circumstances in which people do not wish to get all their information.  This amendment ties medical information to release of other categories of information so that people do not have a choice.  We should give adopted people the choice of what sort of information they apply for.  In the vast majority of situations, adopted people will apply for all the categories of information but it is their decision and we should not tie the release of one sort of information to another, if it is not what they seek.</p></speech>

The information campaign and the guidelines may well clarify the issues but in the section 2 definitions of "early life information" and "medical information" there is a clear overlap.  It will be important, as we said in pre-legislative scrutiny, for adopted persons seeking to access records on early life information and medical information that the guidelines are accessible and that everyone seeking to apply for information would be clear on what was meant by early life information as distinct from medical information.</p> <p>  Early life information clearly covers medical information.  The definition in section 2 includes "information on any medical treatments, procedures or vaccinations".  As the Minister said, that would cover vaccine trials and information relating to his or her medical history.  There is an overlap and medical information is included in early life information.  It will be important that the information campaign and the guidelines make clear what is covered in each category and what people are applying for.  There should be a box which somebody could simply tick for all of the information.</p></speech>

My understanding from the initial work the team has done is that there is an all information box that can be achieved there.  The Deputy is correct that there is overlap in the definitions.  Throughout all our discussions here I have said that we have designed the definitions expansively.  We are keeping them wide so we can take in as much information as possible in order that adopted people are entitled to as much information as possible.  We designed them to be wide on purpose, and I believe that is positive.</p></speech>

Information that is relevant to a person's health is subject to change over time.  The affected person should not have to wait until he or she is seriously ill before seeking out relevant family medical history.  Amendment No. 198 is similar.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 183 and 184 propose to delete the wording &quot;to which the application relates only&rdquo; from the information that should be provided to affected people.  We believe this represents a restriction on the information provided.  For example, if someone has cancer and as a result applies for a family medical history, according to the Bill only medical information relating to cancer will be given.  What if information relating to heart disease or another medical condition is available on the file?  This is particularly relevant for hereditary conditions that an adopted person may have, and would not know to ask for.</p><p>Amendment No. 186 proposes to delete the requirement for the information to be provided to a medical practitioner.  The Department's data protection impact assessment states that this measure is necessary in order to mitigate the risks of a genetic relative being identified.  Any identifying information, however, will have already been removed, so the requirement to release the information to a medical practitioner is completely unnecessary and an unnecessary breach of the affected person's privacy.</p><p>Amendment No. 188 seeks to give children under the age of 16 the right to their medical information through an application made by their adoptive parents.</p></speech>

It speaks to one of the key issues raised by adopted people, namely, that they are denied information about their medical history that could be relevant to their health and that this occurs because they do not know who their parents are and they do not know their family medical history.  It is very important to remember what we are providing for here.  We are providing for a person to have a legal right to somebody else's medical information, which is the medical information of a third party.  In the discussions on this, we all understand that the equivalence is drawn by saying we would know if our mothers had heart disease, a hereditary cancer or something like that.  In most cases, that would be the case but none of us here has a legal right to our mother's or father's medical information.  If a parent chose to withhold something from us for whatever reason, bizarre as that may seem, he or she has a right to do so.</p> <p>  We are providing for an adopted person to have a legal right to the medical information of somebody else.  That limits the privacy rights of the other person.  If we are to allow that interference with another person's privacy rights, some protections must be provided.  The protections are that the information being given to the adopted person about his or her parent is relevant to the adopted person's health.  Let us be very clear, "relevant" is not limited to a question about one illness or disease.  "Relevant" means it is relevant to the person's health.  Any genetic or hereditary condition that is on file about the parent falls within the definition of relevant and would be conveyed to the adopted person.</p> <p>  The second protection, which we will also cover later, is that this information is not conveyed directly to the adopted person but it would be conveyed to a medical practitioner in order that there will be an intermediary in the provision of such information.  This is not the case when we are talking about the adopted person's own medical records, for which full release is provided, as we discussed earlier.</p> <p>  This provision is a dramatic but necessary interference with the privacy rights of the parents in these circumstances.  When the medical information of the parents is shared with somebody else without consent or permission being given, there must be protections around that.  We have engaged significantly with the Office of the Attorney General and the Data Protection Commission, and we have also spoken to mothers.  The mothers who spoke to the committee raised their concerns about their medical information being released.</p> <p>  The protections provided are that the information conveyed must be relevant to the adopted person's health, with the word "relevant" being interpreted broadly, and that the process will involve the information being given to the adopted person's medical practitioner.  I believe these two safeguards are necessary and will allow for the limitation of the privacy rights of the parent.  This is what we have been advised legally from a data protection position.  It also reflects the concerns about this particular point raised by the mothers who appeared before the committee.</p> <p>  I am not able to accept these amendments.  To do so would put at risk the entire goal we are trying to achieve, namely, to enable adopted persons to get health information that is relevant to them.</p></speech>

One of the key things in this regard, however, is what people might interpret as information &quot;relevant to health&quot;.  As Deputy Ward said, when I read this provision I see it as potentially restrictive.  The Minister, though, has said that he sees this as referring to the health of the person concerned and that he or she should be able to access all of his or her information.  Since the subject access request forms have been available, I have found that my constituents seeking information have achieved a good level of success with them.  I have encountered one or two cases, however, and I have contacted Ms McGarrigle a few times in this regard, where people have received documents where everything has been redacted.  I have come across people who had been looking for records for 40 years and got them and it was fantastic and great that they were able to get that information.  I have also met people, however, who were left much more frustrated when they got ten or 12 pages of information, but where only three or four lines were intelligible because so much was redacted.  In those cases, people tend to ponder what information exists about them because they wonder why so many pages have such little information.</p><p>I gave that example to show what can happen when something is potentially left open to interpretation and how one group of officials can respond to a request by deciding to agree to give all the information, while others can refuse and decide they do not believe the person making the request is entitled to the information being sought.  That is why we are so focused on the language of &quot;relevant to the health&quot; of a relevant or qualifying person and this is important.  It reads to me and others as if information may only be relevant if people know what they are looking for.  I refer to a situation where a person might potentially have a diagnosis of cancer or could be going for a battery of tests, but is not yet 100% sure of the prognosis.  It is for that reason that we are so focused on this aspect of the legislation.</p><p>The Minister might say something different about this phrasing, but I think it is still open to interpretation.  I do not want to go over everything we have said again, but this is why, similar to what Deputy Bacik said earlier, we believe the provision of information should not be restricted to it being &quot;relevant to the health&quot; of a relevant or qualifying person.  It is, unfortunately, open to interpretation and it would be possible to have very willing and accommodating officials, but, equally, other officials who might think very differently.  That is why we believe this is the opportunity to ensure that the legislation is strengthened in that regard.  If the Minister is of the same belief, I do not see why he could not accept some of the amendments in this grouping.</p></speech>

I see that as what this set of amendments aims to do.</p> <p>  Turning to the Deputy's point concerning consistency in this context, she is right that it is vital and that is why there is the ability to publish guidelines under this legislation and for those guidelines to be revised if elements of inconsistency are seen to be creeping into the application of the legislation.  This aspect is fundamentally important.  A later set of amendments seeks to limit the power to issue guidelines and I will be opposing those as well.  Guidelines are the manner in which we can see the achievement of the required consistency.</p> <p>  This set of amendments is concerned with deleting the second level of protection in respect of interference with the privacy rights of a parent.  The first level of protection is the provision that the information requested is relevant information about the adopted person's health and the second level protection is that the information is conveyed to the medical practitioner.  We have been advised that these are the necessary measures to balance the significant interference in the privacy rights of the parent.  It is worth repeating that we are giving the adopted person a legal right to access the medical information of another person, without that other person's consent.  It is a big step.  It must be taken, but it is a big step and some level of protection must be put in place.  This aspect of the legislation is one of those protections and therefore I cannot accept amendments seeking to delete it.</p></speech>

It is part of the difficulty when amendments are grouped and we are limited to just discussing those in the group.  This group, though, is very much linked to the previous group, namely, amendments Nos. 182 to 188, inclusive.</p> <p>  Regarding the proposed guidelines, because this topic has come up a good bit in recent meetings, I request that we be able to have a look at those guidelines before Report Stage, if that is possible.  It would mean that we could know exactly what is in them and, as the Minister said, perhaps some of our concerns might be addressed in them.  It would be useful and helpful to us if we could be provided with a copy of those proposed guidelines before Report Stage.</p></speech>

The team has been focused on addressing the significant body of work in front of the committee now.  We can look perhaps at getting some draft heads of the guidelines for the committee, or something like that.  We will do our best for the committee in that regard, but a significant body of work is ongoing in this context and we were going to use the three-month period of the information campaign to finalise the guidelines.  We will, however, seek to get a draft copy of the guidelines to the committee to give some indication of the level of detail we are seeking to implement in them and, hopefully, that will provide some element of reassurance.</p></speech>

We are all conscious that a significant workload is involved in doing that, but, at the same time, the issues we have been debating in many of these amendments could well be addressed through the guidelines.  Therefore, it would be of great assistance to us and, more importantly, to those who are concerned to see this legislation enacted for their own use and application.  It would be of great benefit to have even some idea of what the guidelines will include.</p></speech>

As I said, however, we will endeavour to get drafts of the guidelines to the committee.  It must be recognised, though, that those will only be drafts of the guidelines and that they will be subject to change, but we can listen to the views of the committee in that regard as well.  To reiterate, what we will be providing will be the heads of the proposed guidelines rather than the detailed information.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for an information meeting with adopted people aged between 16 and 18 years who have applied for their information.  Our position is that this meeting must only be provided if requested by the adopted person in question.  It must be provided by a service of the adopted person's choosing.  It should not be conducted by a social worker and the person holding the meeting should not attempt to influence the adopted person in any way.  If the adopted person requests emotional or psychological support, it should be provided by a service of his or her choosing, as we have set out for section 18.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.515" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#J00800"><p>We made a decision when bringing forward this legislation that we did not want to define just for those people aged 18 and above and we wanted to recognise that younger people who were adopted also have an interest in their birth and early life information.  We wanted to make provision for that.  Issues are different when we are not dealing with adults and we engaged quite significantly.  In particular, we consulted with the Ombudsman for Children to ensure the appropriate provisions were put into the Bill and the section we are discussing here has been developed in consultation with the children's ombudsman.  The Ombudsman for Children has confirmed that the supportive meeting we are proposing in this Bill that allows for the release of information for those who are aged 16 and 17 is a necessary protection for younger people.</p> <p>  Under section 18 of the Bill, a person aged 16 or 17 seeking identity information will have that information released through a supportive meeting with the help of a suitably qualified person.  In addition, the applicant - the adopted person seeking the information - may be accompanied by a person of his or her choosing.  The meeting can take place in person or virtually as preferred.  This mechanism is designed to ensure there is an additional layer of support available to younger applicants and those who are not adults at the point of receiving and assimilating the information.  Given the clear opinion of the Ombudsman for Children on the provision, I will not accept an amendment that seeks to remove such a meeting.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 204 suggests that nobody in the meeting should try to influence the relevant person in any way with respect to his or her view on the adoption.  This language is very imprecise and it is unclear what constitutes influence.  It is defined in such a way that virtually any interaction between the younger person and the suitably qualified person could be construed as influence.  Again, matters relating to the conduct of these meetings can be dealt with through guidance and guidelines rather than through statutory provision.</p> <p>  A second element of amendment No. 204 requires that a person facilitating a supportive meeting should provide details of emotional or psychological supports upon request.  Again, that provision of support to relevant persons is already provided for under section 57 of the Bill.</p><p>We do not feel it necessary to repeat it.</p></speech>

This group of amendments removes the phrase &quot;to which the application relates only&quot; from the information that should be provided to relatives of deceased adopted people as this represents a restriction on the information provided.  For example, if a relative of a deceased adopted person has cancer and as a result had applied for a family medical history, according to the Bill only medical information relating to cancer will be given.  What if information in relating to heart disease or another medical condition is available on the file?  I believe I have discussed this already with the Minister and I am repeating myself.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 232 to 234, inclusive, concern the provision that only information that is relevant to the health of the relevant person will be released.  Amendment No. 233 removes the requirement for the information to be provided to the medical practitioner.  The Department's data protection impact assessment states that this measure is necessary in order to mitigate the risks of a genetic relative being identified.  However, as any identifying information will already have been removed, the requirement to release the information to a medical practitioner is completely unnecessary.</p><p>Amendment No. 235 ensures the location of all medical information that is available on file.</p><p>Amendment No. 236 ensures that a person with expertise in reading documents is involved in the process.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 240 and 241 widen the definition of a record by including that which relates to any relevant person and in section 2 the Bill defines a relevant person as someone who may apply to Tusla for information.  These two amendments further strengthen the Bill's ability to ensure that records, data and information are not withheld by any means.</p></speech>

Again, this section was designed in consultation with both the Office of the Attorney General and the Data Protection Commissioner.  That is important in the context of making provision for what we want to achieve here, which is the release of information.  We get the release of this information but it is conditional on the medical history being relevant to the applicant's own medical history.  We have discussed earlier on the definition of relevance and how relevance can be expanded upon in guidelines, but it is relevant to hereditary conditions and not relevant to one specific illness or disease.</p> <p>  Second, this information will be conveyed through the relevant person's GP and that is again a necessary protection put in to recognise the sensitivity of providing a person with somebody else's medical information.  I am not in a position to accept this set of amendments.</p></speech>

Without getting caught up in semantics, we know without doubt who the relevant person is.  It is the applicant who is looking for this information.  I repeat the point that we still do not know what is deemed relevant to the health of that person.  I hope the guidelines and all of the other matters that are laid out will make that a great deal clearer.  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

This originates in the understandable distrust adopted people and survivors have for State bodies.  They are seeking the assurance of as broad a definition as possible to prevent the lack of access they have been presented with for decades.  These amendments seek to insert such broader definitions.  </p><p>Amendment No. 247 seeks to remove the entirely inappropriate and ambiguous term &quot;to the extent that it is practicable to do so&quot;.  We must call that phrase out as a get-out clause.  It is a worrying element of the Bill, which does not provide unfettered access, as everybody keeps claiming it does.  It is a barrier, plain and simple.  At a previous meeting, the Minister assured us that all of this Bill was carefully fine-tuned in accordance with engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General, which was integral to the Bill.  The phrase &quot;to the extent that it is practicable to do so&quot; is far from finely tuned and it is important to point that out.  I hope I am wrong but there is no doubt in my mind that such a phrase in the legislation will be used as an obstacle for people using their personal information.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 248 and 249 seek to remove another restrictive aspect of the Bill.  The amendments remove the option for the relevant body to provide what is essentially a summary or list of information and insist on the provision of the full range of records held about the applicant.  If this Bill is about enabling full and complete access, this is another section that needs changing.</p><p>Similarly, amendments Nos. 250 and 251 remove the relational statement &quot;a record of such class as the Minister may prescribe&quot; and replace it to provide for absolute statements that allow full access to records and personal data.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.638" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#M02000"><p>This group of amendments relates to section 27 under Part 4.  That section provides for the release of the birth information of a child who died in an institution to a qualifying relative.  This speaks again to an issue that came up during the pre-legislative scrutiny process about information relating to children who died in institutions.  That was not provided for under the original draft that was recommended in the pre-legislative scrutiny and we are providing for that now.</p> <p>  Section 27 relates to birth information about children who died.  The amendment seeks to expand the definition of "birth information" to include the other categories but it is important to remember that those other categories are all covered by the next set of sections.  Sections 27 to 30, inclusive, provide for the release of birth information, early life information and care information, the successive types of information about children who died in institutions.  The type of information the amendment is seeking to insert into the section is addressed in subsequent sections and, therefore, we do not feel it needs to be repeated by including particular definitions in this section.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 248 and 249 relate to issues we have addressed previously.  We are looking for a statement to be released along with the documents explaining the documents as they are released.  The alternative that has been proposed in a number of places is the idea of a schedule.  We believe that the statement, which is not just a list, like a schedule, but actually gives some context to the documents being proposed, is a better way forward.  That is why on each occasion the issue comes up, we believe the provision of a statement alongside the release of documents is better than the provision of a schedule.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised concern about the use of the term "to the extent that it is practicable to do so".  That is a term of art in legislation.  It is intended to convey an obligation to provide copies of all records unless there is some significant obstacle to the provision of those particular records.  An example would be where an original record is lost.  We know there are situations where information will not be with Tusla or the AAI and that is going to be a difficulty when it comes to certain adopted people for whom there will be no information to provide them with because of historical circumstances.  </p> <p>  I will give the Deputy another example of the use of the term "to the extent that it is practicable to do so".  During the pandemic, electronic records were easily provided to people but hard copy records were not as accessible because people were not attending to collect them.  The SARs we have been issuing from our Department have meant the release of the electronic document which, for the commission's archive, is the vast majority of the information.  However, in answer to each SAR, the Department has stated it will also undertake a search of any physical documents that are in the commission archive.  It is in such a situation that "to the extent that it is practicable to do so" is used.  The core goal and intent behind this legislation is for the full release of information.</p></speech>

Why not just strengthen the point in this section if he is already on board, along with the rest of us, on this point?  We can add it to this section, given the unique circumstances we are in when considering this legislation.  For four decades, people have been refused access to their information by these State bodies and, therefore, there is an understandable level of distrust.  That is what we are dealing with and that is why all these amendments have been tabled.  People understandably do not believe they are going to be given this information because they have been wrongly denied it for so long.  Instead of always trying to discredit the amendments we have tabled because people have come to us in good faith and asked us to table them, can the Minister not strengthen the legislation to assure them that they will be provided with the information we are seeking to ensure is available through this amendment?</p><p>If it is already in another section why not strengthen it in this section too?</p></speech>

Where a right to information is provided in the next section I do not see a need to provide the same right in two separate sections.

It cannot be deleted and does not require expansion.  It also serves as a key data protection safeguard for the release of this special category data of a third party by ensuring specificity and limitation on the records that come into scope.

Amendment No. 268 concerns the justifiable opposition to the Child and Family Agency having access to and processing personal data.  Tusla is the default tracing service provider under the Bill, which is unacceptable given the agency is dealing with affected people.  People should be given a choice of service provider, at the very least.</p><p>Amendment No. 269 removes the capacity of the Minister to intervene in the tracing process.  This needs to be an absolute right that individuals can avail of themselves and not require ministerial interference.</p><p>Amendment No. 274 has a comparable purpose in removing the reference to section 33 and the role of the Minister in seeking information from individuals.</p><p>Amendment No. 270 adds a caveat to section 34(2) that requires the agency or the authority to first and foremost conduct reasonable research before seeking access to information from the person.  Similar to amendment No. 268, this is about protecting adopted people and their relatives from any unnecessary request to divulge further information to these State bodies which have treated, and continue to treat, them disgracefully.  There should be an overwhelming obligation on the authority and agency to carry out the tracing functions under this Bill without interfering in the lives of people affected.</p><p>Amendment No. 288 is significant in adding a much broader range of bodies to which the Minister can issue guidelines for the purposes of tracing.  Currently, this only applies to the agency or the authority whereas our amendment will incorporate the range of State and religious actors outlined in section 34(6), such as Departments, the HSE, the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland.  It is both prudent and desirable that the Minister be permitted to issue such guidelines to those bodies, all of which have had substantial involvement in illegal adoptions.</p></speech>

That will be in Report Stage amendments I will bring forward.  I am just notifying the committee of that at this point.</p></speech>

It is, in part, to respond to some of the recommendations of the special rapporteur's report on illegal birth registration and to give additional powers to respond to that.</p> <p>  In respect of the set of amendments that have been proposed, the provisions of the Bill allow for a tracing service and provide a statutory underpinning for a tracing service, a statutory underpinning that has been missing up to this point.  It has meant that tracing is far more difficult for anybody, be it Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, to undertake.  First, it is important to say that by giving tracing a statutory underpinning we will significantly improve the ability of these bodies to engage with other State bodies.  Right now, GDPR is immediately used as a barrier to the exchange of information.  The statutory obligation to share information with Tusla and the AAI will facilitate the provision of this information.  It is also important to recognise that these are the bodies that have expertise and skill in tracing.  We are very clear that we want people to be able to get the benefit of a tracing service immediately.  It is important to say that these are the agencies with that level of expertise at present.</p> <p>  In terms of the specific amendments, we believe what is proposed in amendment No. 269 is already sufficiently provided for under this section.  In response to amendment No. 288, our view is that it is unnecessary as the guidelines are only relevant to the authority and agency in providing tracing services and they do not need to be expanded to include bodies from which the authority and agency can request information.  Those bodies do not have functions under this Part, only an obligation to comply with a request for information made in the context of a trace.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 274 is contrary to the policy intention of the legislation.  Section 33 is an important provision to cover a potential situation where people must be traced and contacted with important information.  To remove that reference could be detrimental should that situation arise.</p> <p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 268 and 270, I cannot see the necessity for those amendments.  They would actually hinder the ability to provide a timely and efficient service.  Amendment No. 268 seeks to remove the ability to refer to the contact preference register in the provision of a tracing service by either the agency or the authority and it does not provide for an alternative process.  The decision to include this provision in the legislation was carefully considered.  The ability to check a contact preference on the contact preference register is a very important part of how the tracing service will operate.  First, in a scenario where a trace has been initiated and the preference for contact is found to be on the register, then it is possible to immediately and efficiently proceed to the facilitation of whatever level of contact has been proffered by both parties, including up to a reunion or a sharing of information.  It would avoid the need to go through a protracted tracing process if they can immediately refer to what is set out by parties on the contact preference register.  Second, in a situation where a trace has been initiated and the preference for no contact is found on the register, this information is conveyed to the person who requested the trace and the person can decide whether or not to proceed.  In both scenarios, by providing that the data on the register can be processed as part of the trace, the process is made more efficient.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 270 seeks to place restrictions on the manner in which the tracing service operates.  During the drafting process, my officials and I engaged with the organisations currently providing tracing services.</p><p>We requested their assistance in identifying the bodies from which information requests would be crucial to the provision of an effective and timely tracing service.  As far as we are aware, the current non-statutory tracing service encounters very significant difficulties, delays and obstructions in the provision of its service due to the fact it cannot request key information from other bodies such as those listed in this legislation.</p><p> The purpose of section 34 is to ensure the tracing service provided under this legislation can operate in the most efficient manner possible and, therefore, accepting this amendment would be contrary to that goal and it would undermine that particular intention.</p></speech>

The aim is not to slow the process for people getting information, and this is something we have discussed at great length in the committee.  When witnesses came before the committee we heard that people were not just traumatised by interactions with Tusla but really retraumatised as well.  There were stories of people sitting in front of social workers with their information in front of them, including birth name and the name of a mother and father.  This is information that people have wanted to know for their entire life but even though the staff could have several pieces of information, they would not tell these people any of it.</p> <p>  We spoke about this a lot because none of us wanted to delay the process of people accessing their information.  I request that the Minister and his Department give this consideration before the next Stage.  Something must change in the way Tusla interacts with people who have been affected.  Perhaps it could be a different department.  Could we give this some consideration before the next Stage because it is really important?  We must figure out a way that does not slow the process but we really cannot ignore it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.709" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030900002#P00300"><p>As the Minister stated, we support the statutory underpinning of a tracing service and the provision of that statutory underpinning.  The need for that was made clear.  As Deputy Cairns said, the experience of Tusla of many of the witnesses who came before the committee was very negative.  I look again at our recommendations Nos. 56 and 57 in the pre-legislative scrutiny report, where we indicated the dissatisfaction in experiences with Tusla and the AAI, and the need to ensure improvements in resourcing, culture and legal structure.  There was also a recommendation that a new agency would carry out functions assigned and that interim arrangements would be made.  These amendments are proposed in that spirit and in recognition of what we heard at committee meetings.  The amendments deserve consideration.</p> <p>  The Minister has made a very significant indication that he will table amendments on Report Stage on the delivery of specialised placing services in the context of illegal birth registrations.  We probably all want a little more clarity on what those amendments would look like.  Is it envisaged, for example, that there would be any provision for a criminal investigation or is it much more about the tracing of the birth?  From the brave testimonies of people who have come forward and been the subject of illegal adoption, we are all conscious that the tracing in the context of these adoptions would be a much more difficult process because there were falsified records in some cases.  Attempts were made to cover up in others.</p> <p>  Will the Minister outline exactly what will the specialised tracing look like at this stage?  If anybody is affected by this, what should they expect in the context of Tusla's specialised tracing?</p></speech>

I have also heard from and met people who were adopted and subject to illegal birth registration.  I have heard their very real and deep frustration with processes and how they were treated as individuals.  I am very aware of that.  I have said in these hearings on a number of occasions that we must change the culture in these organisations.  We will do this in a number of ways.</p> <p>  First, we must amend the law because the law does not facilitate the proper release of information.  That is why we are bringing forward this legislation and we believe it crucial in beginning that change.  We are bringing forward guidelines to ensure and copper-fasten that culture of release of information and the presumption of release.  That culture will be reinforced through the process of the implementation group led by my Department, ensuring alignment between our departmental review of the open release of information and that this is replicated across Tusla and the AAI.</p> <p>  This is also supported by resources.  We have discussed in the context of the budget an extra &euro;3 million for Tusla specifically to support the implementation of the information and tracing Bill this year and an extra &euro;1 million for the AAI, again to do that work.  Both of those bodies are hiring relevant staff and securing new expertise within their ranks to implement what is happening here.</p> <p>  there is also the provision in the legislation for a review of its operation.  It is entirely possible that in future a decision could be taken to entirely remove the provision of tracing from certain bodies.  The point I made in particular when we discussed this on Second Stage related to the suggestion of a creation of a new agency.  I know the recommendation was made in good faith by the committee but to attempt that now would delay the availability of the provisions in this legislation.</p> <p>  In changing the law and culture and by providing the resources, we can change the experience that adopted people have in terms of their engagement with Tusla.  I know the committee has had Mr. Bernard Gloster before it but I do not know if members discussed this particular point with him.  I regularly discuss this matter with Mr. Gloster both in the context of our quarterly meetings and, for various reasons, when I am on the phone to him regularly.  This is a core matter.  It may be useful for the committee to hear from him as chief executive on the work he is doing within the organisation to bring about this culture change.  I know many adopted people are not reassured and will not be reassured until they see change.  Perhaps it is the same for the committee.  It might be useful, rather than hearing it from me, to hear it directly from the chief executive.</p> <p>  I made a point regarding the tabling of an amendment on Report Stage and Deputy Bacik is correct.  Illegal birth registration is extremely hard to prove.  The reason is it is an illegal act and the person or persons perpetrating that act would have done their best to cover their tracks.  I do not know why but the people who engaged in this illegal act in St. Patrick's Guild did not cover their tracks but drew attention to the acts on the cover of the files by indicating adoption for birth.  That allowed the investigation to take place.</p> <p>  We will table an amendment that will expand section 33, allowing a Minister to request the review of files in certain circumstances.  This is primarily dealing with cases where an individual has no idea he or she is subject to an illegal birth registration.  As the Deputy knows, the legislation provides a route for people with a suspicion to go through but where Tusla, in particular, identifies a file about which it has very significant concerns, the amendment will allow a Minister direct the agency to undertake further tracing.</p></speech>

The inclusion of church representatives in section 34(6) is particularly egregious considering that the Bill fails to name religious orders for other entities as data controllers.  Moreover, it does not seem to have occurred to the Minister or the Department that some of the church representatives whom Tusla and the Adoption Authority Of Ireland are authorised to approach may have been involved in adoptions, both legal and illegal.  Section 36(6)(g) and (h) need to be deleted and these data controllers must instead be obliged to furnish the AAI with all adoption records they hold in order that they can be made available to persons affected.</p><p>While my party appreciates that there may be some instances where a person is difficult to find, in the vast majority of cases a trained genealogist will be able to locate someone through discreet measures using public records and other information in the public domain.  While social workers have a fundamental role in society, they do not have the skills or training required to undertake tracing research and to ensure the confidentiality of affected persons is protected where interactions such as those described in section 34 are genuinely required.  A person who receives a request for information must be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement.</p></speech>

The amendment proposes to remove the ability of these agencies to engage with a diocese or parish of the Roman Catholic Church or the Church of Ireland.  The proposal is to remove those organisations from the process.  They were added to the bodies that could be consulted in the context of a trace because of the existence of marriage and baptismal certificates.  These documents, particularly baptismal certificates, are valuable sources of information, including names that can be used to facilitate a trace.  Baptismal certificates were not included in the original draft of the Bill but they are included now.  They can be a very good source of information.  Guardians or godparents can also be identified on a baptismal certificate.  This is also valuable information.</p> <p>  The process of consulting church records is invaluable in the context of the provision of a tracing service.  To remove the ability to engage with churches for the purposes of requesting such important information would limit the ability of the tracing services.  We do not see any benefit in that and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister is acknowledging how much relevant and important information they have but they have not been included as data controllers.  Has consideration been given to the fact that the tracing services could be engaging with people in the religious orders who were potentially involved with adoptions, illegal or legal?</p></speech>

This means they can be designated as secondary information sources.  What we are talking about here is the ability to engage with a parish church in Blanchardstown or Kilkenny to see if we can look at its register to find out if there is information available on a particular individual.  Restricting the type of valuable information the tracing service could secure from that would negatively impact on its ability to undertake tracing.</p></speech>

The subsection currently does not clearly oblige the authority to seek to make the information available.  Amendment No. 286 adds a requirement for the authority to provide the adopted person with all records immediately when received from a body in other jurisdictions.  We feel this provision is necessary given the level of distrust that currently exists, understandably, with adopted people and relatives.</p></speech>

The consequence of this information is that an adopted person would be provided with all information, even if they only apply for certain categories of information.  We are all of the belief the majority of adopted people will apply for all categories of information.  The application form will make provision for one box to be ticked to get all information, but in a situation where an adopted person seeks certain types of information but not other types of information, that is their choice and this amendment would have the consequence that they would receive all information, even if there were categories they were not seeking.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 290 states: &quot;In page 37, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following: &ldquo;(a) safeguard and maintain existing registrations on the National Adoption Contact Preference Register,&rdquo;.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 289 is to provide clarity on the function of the contact preference register, which is an important aspect of the Bill in an area of personal and technical complexity.  It is important that the purpose is clearly articulated for the benefit of those who avail of it and who would be impacted by it.  Amendment No. 290 ensures that existing registrations on the national adoption contact preference register are preserved.  No ambiguity should be allowed concerning the role of the new register in relation to former registers.  We believe this amendment clarifies the relationship and protects current records.</p></speech>

The objective of it would appear to be to elaborate on the purpose of the contact preference register.  However, the people for whom the register provides a service is already clearly outlined in section 38(3) and, as such, we feel this amendment has no material effect.</p> <p>  I also cannot accept amendment No. 290.  The objective of the amendment is to maintain the existing national contact preference register.  Again, we consider the amendment is unnecessary, as the transfer of the existing information that is on the existing register to the new contact preference register is already provided for in section 42.  Section 42 enables the existence of a single contact preference register once the existing data have been transferred and six months have elapsed after the date on which the section comes into operation.  Rather than creating no ambiguity, as was suggested, it would copper-fasten ambiguity, as we would have two contact preference registers in existence at the same time, so that would cause confusion, but it would also be a clear breach of the GDPR, in particular Article 25 on data protection by design and by default.  Article 25 is clear that unnecessary data should not be retained.  That is why we oppose the amendment.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 293, 294 and 301 seek to allow a person who was the friend of a parent or the friend of a deceased relevant person to make an entry on the register, although the amendment would prohibit them from making an entry stating a no-contact preference.  If I understand and accept the spirit of this amendment, it speaks to the importance of found family and the bonds people build outside of traditional family structures and it seeks to make it possible for information to pass on from the closest of friends.  I cannot accept the text that has been put before us here, but I will ask my officials to consult with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consider whether an amendment can be made.  I cannot guarantee it, but I understand what is being attempted here, so we will look and see if something can be done.</p></speech>

Given the very restrictive interpretation of GDPR rights by Departments and State bodies, it is necessary to clearly state that these sections do not interfere with GDPR.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 312 ensures that all relevant records will be transferred to the national memorial and record centre when it is established.  It is important to include this obligation to ensure that all bodies impacted will be aware of their obligations when the national memorial and record centre is set up.  Currently there is no provision in the Bill for this.  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 313 removes the potential restrictions under section 443 that limit the capacity of bodies holding information to make it available.  It is a very prescriptive approach that could lead to limitations of individuals accessing data.</p></speech>

The amendments spoken to by the Deputy relate specifically to adding text regarding not interfering with the GDPR rights of relevant persons or parents.  I reassure members that it is not the intention of the Bill to, and, more importantly, the Bill does not in any way, interfere with a person's right to apply for their information through a subject access request.  The Bill does contain a limited limitation of GDPR rights.  That is inherent in what we are trying to do here because the right of another party to not accept the processing of their information, which is provided for under GDPR at the moment, will not be available to people seeking to prevent the release of their information to an adopted person.  It is that limitation that is provided for.  If these amendments are accepted to say GDPR applies as normal at all times, it will undermine the very limited exception to GDPR that we have provided here, which ensures no one can prevent an adopted or boarded out person getting access to their information.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 327 relates to Part 9, which provides for an information campaign.  It relates to the right to access information and the right to rectification for mothers and fathers.  It is a response to my consultation with parents but particularly with mothers.  I know that some of that group also engaged with the committee.  The amendment will ensure that a mother or father's right to access information about themselves held by an institution and, importantly, the right to rectification of inaccurate or incomplete information under GDPR is highlighted to them as part of the information campaign that will be run for three months on enactment of this legislation.  When I spoke to individuals they were not aware of some of the existing rights available to them under GDPR.  There was a particular concern if, say, derogatory comments or untrue information about the context of their pregnancy were placed on the file.  This mandates within the information campaign that these rights of access but also rectification will be conveyed.</p></speech>

I want to make sure all efforts are made to ensure access is facilitated.  It is important the Adoption Authority of Ireland has the ability to prioritise which secondary information sources should provide statements in order that those at risk or with key information are given its immediate attention.</p></speech>

Part 7, which relates to the safeguarding of records, has been carefully developed to provide clarity to the Adoption Authority of Ireland and to the holders of records.  The authority must have the ability to consider what records are, in fact, relevant.  To do otherwise could result in a glut of records arriving at the door of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, many of which may not actually relate to matters covered under this Bill.  It is a more practical approach whereby the authority has control over the types of records being transferred and the timing of that transfer.</p></speech>

In deleting this section, we are removing the restriction on people whose births were illegally registered before 31 December 1980.  The general scheme of the Bill states an affected person is someone whose birth was illegally registered before 31 December 1970.  How was this date arrived that?  It seems arbitrary and flawed.  Although the State is clearly aware these practices were not restricted to one agency or a single timeframe, instead of ensuring each and every affected person can access his or her information in the Bill, it merely changed the original cut-off from 1970 to 1980 instead of removing the time limit altogether.  We feel strongly there should be no time limits on this.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for the new register that will reflect and give legal protection to an individual's lived identity.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 323 seeks to delete "an entry in the register of births relating to his or her birth was made on or before the 31st day of December 1980" from the definition of "affected person".  This definition was created in careful consultation, having engaged with the groups, and understands the time period within which the St. Patrick's Guild illegal birth registrations took place.  The cut-off was set at 1980 to ensure all known illegal birth registrations would be captured and would benefit from the provisions of this Bill.  At the same time, the cut-off point in respect of legal advice was that the definition should not be open-ended such that it would encompass children and young people under the age of 24 years.</p></speech>

They may also have a different age by a matter of days, weeks or, indeed, months than that recorded on their incorrect birth registration.  As we know, as members of society, we are all often asked to complete a declaration when applying for services or engaging in contracts with both the State and private organisations.  This kind of declaration will also often ask the applicant to ensure the facts provided in the form are true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge.  Through consultation and engagement with those impacted by illegal birth registration, I understand that for some people this declaration now poses a challenge and causes discomfort given they know about their birth of origin.</p><p>Amendment No. 325 seeks to address this directly and is in line with the recommendations from the interdepartmental group on the St. Patrick's Guild incorrect birth registrations.  The amendment will provide assurance that contracts, legal documents and any acts undertaken in good faith will not be invalidated or that the persons affected will not experience any adverse consequences simply because they were the subject of an incorrect birth registration.  This assurance will apply both retrospectively and prospectively.  It does apply retrospectively, however, which is important; that is, prior to the passing of legislation and before the affected person discovered his or her birth was incorrectly registered.</p><p> I also intend to bring amendments on Report Stage to deal with the issue of succession in respect of persons affected by illegal birth registration.  This issue was raised by the interdepartmental group I established last year to address issues arising for people affected by illegal birth registration.  Since then, I have been liaising with the Minister for Justice on amendments to the Succession Act 1965, which falls within the competence of the Department of Justice.  These amendments will ensure that people affected by illegal birth registrations would, for the purposes of succession and inheritance, be deemed to be the children of their social parents.  It is proposed that the amendments will be carried in the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, again, so affected persons can benefit from them as quickly as possible.  That amendment will be brought forward on Report Stage.</p></speech>

People feel it is staggering, after everything we know, that the lesser category of assistance and support is suitable.</p><p>Similarly, amendments Nos. 333 to 335, inclusive, are about ensuring that relevant people are provided with assistance rather than the lesser category of support.  Adopted people and their relatives need help and the removal of barriers.  That has been the paramount function of this Bill.  Amendment No. 333 removes the paternalistic &quot;as it considers appropriate&quot; sentence.  Adopted people should decide what is appropriate and necessary and not State bodies.  Amendment No. 335 provides specifically for trained archivists to be involved in the process.  They can provide the expertise that people need in accessing records and information.  Amendment No. 336 removes a restriction on when counselling services can be offered.  Amendment No. 337 ensures that.</p><p>We are coming to the end of this process.  The whole purpose of this legislation is to provide unfettered access - the officials keep using that terminology - but after going through 300 amendments and not one of them being accepted, are we completely confident that people will get unfettered access to their information?  We have discussed over and over again, at great length, why people do not feel that will happen.  One reason is distrust of State agencies and bodies, and people's experience for decades of being treated in that way.  A second reason is that they had very many concerns about the specific language in this Bill and none of the amendments dealing with that have been accepted.  As we come to a close, reassurance that people will have that unfettered access is appropriate.</p></speech>

This legislation has developed from heads of Bill.  Changes were made between the heads of Bill and the introduction of this draft legislation.  Since the publication of the draft legislation, I have brought forward a set of important amendments, which have been agreed by this committee.  In the context of the significant number of amendments that we discussed, I have agreed to go back to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the wording and implementation of a number of them where I believe they strengthen the Bill and chime with the view we all have of bringing about better legislation.  Where I did not agree with the provisions of the amendments, I put forward clear arguments for that, primarily on the basis that the issues concerned were already addressed in the Bill.</p> <p>  There are one or two important areas where there is a clear disagreement.  We had the opportunity to discuss that and we will have the same opportunity on Report Stage, but I have carefully considered every amendment here.  I have given them fair consideration and answered the concerns that have been brought forward as to why those amendments were not implemented.  As I said, my officials and I will go back to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on a number of the points raised and we will continue to strengthen this legislation.  I have also indicated that I will bring forward new amendments on a number of points, again, with a view to strengthening this legislation and making sure that all information is available to adopted people and to those who are the subject of illegal birth registrations.</p></speech>

It relates to the review period.  As I understand it, the legislation currently provides that it will be reviewed after four years.  My party believes that is far too long and a one-year period would be much more beneficial.  If there are difficulties or issues with the legislation, a review after one year will provide an opportunity to make changes.  I do not see how anyone would disagree with that.  It was one of the issues the committee discussed, particularly in relation to the idea of a new agency.  We understood that would not happen overnight and we did not want to delay the process.  We believed, however, that having a review after a year could at least identify if the legislation was working.</p><p>I feel strongly that this amendment should be accepted.  It is not unrealistic to seek to have the period changed from four years to one year.  Four years is a long time if something is not working, particularly when we are dealing with people who have such distrust.  We have spoke about that and everybody acknowledges it.  If the legislation was reviewed after a year, at least people could see whether it was working.  Four years is a long time to wait before rectifying a problem.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, I agree with Deputy Funchion that four years is a long time.  We will discuss this and bring an amendment on Report Stage to reduce the period from four years.  We need to consider what we believe to be an appropriate time but we will reduce the period from four years.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Angus Robertson and his team, Mr. Frank Strang, Mr. Ewan Crawford and Ms Katy McNeil, to today's meeting.  The flight to Edinburgh is only an hour, so we are neighbours.  In the few seconds we spent speaking prior to the meeting, we managed to cover everything from the beauty of Edinburgh to rugby and football, all things cultural and, of course, our close relationship.  We are engaging today on the topic of post-Brexit relations.</p> <p>  We will begin with a note on privilege and some house-keeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech which might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who intends to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I will members partaking by MS teams that prior to making their contribution to the meeting to confirm they are in the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  In order to limit the risk of spreading of Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, to be respectful to each other's physical space and to adhere to any other public health advice.</p> <p>  I thank all present for their indulgence and I now call on Mr. Angus Robertson to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

My colleagues, who are part of the Scottish Government delegation, and our colleagues, who are based in Dublin, are delighted to be here.  This is my first visit to Ireland in my official capacity as Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, External Affairs and Culture.  While I am disappointed not be to be able to time my trip to watch the rugby, I am nonetheless delighted to be here and I look forward to many visits in the future.</p> <p>  Ireland is Scotland's closest European Union neighbour and we value the Scottish-Ireland relationship very highly.</p><p>Earlier this morning, I met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, to discuss the progress we have made together on the framework for our future co-operation and collaboration, namely, the Scotland-Ireland joint bilateral review.  Of course, we were meeting at a time when devastating war has broken out in Europe because of the outrageous actions of Russia's President Putin.  Scotland, like Ireland, is doing everything it can to support people in Ukraine at this dreadful time and these events are a reminder of the importance of the close collaboration between countries, which share common values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.</p><p> It is clear from the meeting we held earlier and the variety of work taking place across the full spectrum of the Scotland-Ireland relationship, that said relationship is in extremely good health.  Of course, it is great to have that formalised structure, but it is the vibrant people-to-people connections, familial ties and interwoven history that binds us so close together as people.</p><p> Turning now to Brexit, I will not need to remind anybody in this room, but it is worth stating just for the record that Scotland did not vote for Brexit.  We do not want it.  It is our intention to rejoin the EU as quickly as we are able to.  We very much see ourselves as a proudly European nation and that our future is within the EU as an independent country.  We were inside the EU for 47 years, share the EU&rsquo;s values and believe we have much to contribute.</p><p> It is clear that the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement marks a significant step backwards from our trading position within the EU, and that view is shared by the Scottish people.  We know through polling that 75% of people in Scotland have a negative opinion about whether the UK has benefited from Brexit and only 2% of people in Scotland believe that Boris Johnson delivered a good Brexit deal.  In this respect, regardless of constitutional circumstances, the Scottish Government will always be a supporter of efforts aimed at greater co-operation between the UK and the EU, and that close co-operation is in all our interests.</p><p> Scottish independence is, of course, a matter for the people of Scotland.  Following the election in May of last year there is now a substantial majority in the Scottish Parliament in favour of an independence referendum.  The Scottish Government is working to ensure that a legitimate and constitutional referendum can be held within this parliamentary term, and, if the Covid crisis is over, within the first half of the term.  However, again, regardless of the constitutional settlement, the Scottish Government will always be a voice for the warmest possible relationship and partnership between the peoples of Scotland, the rest of the UK and Ireland.  It was very good to be able to discuss with the Minister for Foreign Affairs the links and areas where we are focusing our efforts, such as the on economy, health, culture and a number of other concrete areas that will matter to all of members' constituents, no matter which part of Ireland they represent.</p><p> On that note, I will finish my remarks.  I look forward to our discussion and answering any questions that members have.  I look forward to the ongoing positive relations that we have between Scotland and Ireland.</p></speech>

It is wonderful to have the Cabinet Secretary in person.  It is wonderful to have anyone here in person, but particularly Mr. Robertson after the past couple of years.  Those of us who were in the previous Oireachtas had a very good relationship with his predecessors across a multitude of roles, both Mr. Mike Russell and Ms Fiona Hyslop, who, I know, play a different but continuing role in Scottish politics.</p> <p>  I want to go straight into four key questions leading on from Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s remarks.  The first two are specifically kind of Brexit-related issues.  From engagements we had with his predecessors, it was obvious that there was a clear disconnect between the Westminster Government and the devolved administrations.  Much of this was happening at the time when the Northern Ireland Executive had collapsed and Stormont was not in position, but there was also an inability on the part of the Scottish and Welsh Governments to influence the decisions is one area but, more importantly, to influence the implementation of decisions and deal with the practicalities.  Could Mr. Robertson give, if possible, a brief synopsis of where that relationship stands in terms of London working with Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast?</p> <p>  The second aspect, which is also in respect of Brexit, relates to the practical implications of the protocol for Scottish ports and what sort of effect it has had.  We can go into the macro issues of trading impacts and relationships, but I am interested in terms of actual responsibilities, such as the levels of traffic and things like that.  We have obviously seen a drastic increase in direct shipping from this island to the Continent.  Traffic across the land bridge, through Holyhead, Fishguard and Pembroke, has fallen dramatically.</p> <p>  Moving away from Brexit for once but tied absolutely to it, I am very intrigued about Scottish Government policy and where it may differ from overall UK Government policy.  Pressing and timely, and Mr. Robertson referred to this, is the reception of refugees fleeing Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s war in Ukraine.  What is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s position on how it will receive refugees fleeing conflict?  How it will work with partners across the UK and with the EU, particularly Ireland?  Questions were raised off the record by British ministers in relation to the impact of the common travel area in this regard.  Those questions were misplaced.  Scotland, like Ireland, has a very strong reputation as being a welcoming country.  Huge efforts were made after the Brexit referendum by the Scottish Government, I believe by Ben Macpherson, Jenny Gilruth and other ministers, to specifically state to EU citizens that they are welcome.  However, I am particularly concerned with the Ukrainian refugees fleeing the conflict.  In the main, these are women and children.  How does the Scottish Government view its role in this regard?  Is it different from that of the London Government?</p> <p>  My final question also relates to the crisis in Ukraine.  There has been much discussion of the possibility of fast-tracking Ukrainian accession to the EU.  We had a lengthy discussion in private session, and the matter is not that straightforward.  I wish to kind of play the hypothetical card.  I think Mr. Robertson is game for it, but he can say if he is not.  He mentioned that Scotland&rsquo;s future constitutional discussion is a matter for the Scottish people.  We in Ireland wholly recognise that it is not our discussion to get involved in.  However, to what extent has Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s Department looked at the Copenhagen criteria?  Is it a matter of fact that it is his political desire as opposed to his ministerial desire to achieve Scottish independence?  Accession to the EU would play a big part in that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.990" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Angus Robertson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022030900002#F00400"><p>I could probably talk for the rest of the session, which I will not do, in answering Deputy Richmond&rsquo;s timely questions, as he covered quite a lot of ground there.  I hope I do them justice.  The Deputy can feel free to come back if I do not touch on some of the points.</p> <p>  First, on the intergovernmental relations side of things, notwithstanding the fact that we have a profoundly differently view on the future relations that we foresee in Great Britain, we are very keen to work, wherever we can, with the UK Government, but also with colleagues in Northern Ireland and Wales, on practical co-operation.  To give an insight into that, I have been a member of the Scottish Government since last May.  We do much of our traffic online, and I have been involved in numerous calls with UK Government ministers and with Northern Irish and Welsh colleagues to discuss the four-nations approach to any number of things.  Where those have worked well has been the exception rather than the rule.  I have one particularly good example, which I use repeatedly because I am a glass-half-full kind of person, to highlight where it has worked very well with the then Cabinet Minister Chloe Smith from the UK Government to try to get what are called the framework agreements, which are the post-Brexit arrangements for how we are trying to manage our post-Brexit realities in a better way.  In some respects it helps because, as somebody who has spent a long time - 16 years - as a member of the UK Parliament, I know many of my UK Government interlocutors.  As one can imagine, when one has a good working relationship with people, one can get things in a better a place if one is minded to do so.</p><p>Let me start with that as the good news.  That was an example where we could meet and we were both committed to ensuring we could try to get things in a better place.<br/><br/>However, as a general rule, meetings that take place are perfunctory box-ticking operations initiated by UK Government Departments to say they have &quot;consulted&quot; Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland rather than working with us on developing policy and listening to suggestions.  Invitations often come at next to no notice.  I was messaged one Friday to say the UK Attorney General wanted to meet with the Scottish and Welsh Governments and colleagues from Northern Ireland and we literally had no idea what it was about.  Our officials had no idea what it was about.  We arrived to be told what the UK Government intended to do in relation to dealing with legacy EU legislation.  These are things that matter and they matter to us greatly because, jumping forward to one of Deputy Richmond's next questions, where there is a difference of policy we in Scotland are doing our best to remain aligned with the EU and EU legislation.  Notwithstanding the fact we are outside the EU, we are ensuring legislation in Scotland remains as closely aligned as possible for very obvious reasons so when we rejoin - and this jumps forward again to another of the Deputy's questions - EU colleagues will know that not only do we have the 47 years behind us of fulfilling the <i>acquis communitaire</i>and the standards of membership of the EU but even during Brexit we were doing our level best to remain aligned.<br/><br/>In answer to the Deputy's question, intergovernmental relations on a technical and working level are, frankly, not good.  I have officials who join me here who will no doubt be able to say on a technical level the civil service-to-civil service relations can be very good and very positive and we certainly want to operate in that way.  However, sometimes when things get to a political level, there is not a willingness to operate in a respectful way.  This has led to a change in the working architecture between the UK Government and devolved administrations.  This is publicly available information if members are interested in seeing how all this is supposed to work.  In theory, you would have to hope the machinery will work better than it has up to now but frankly, if the political willingness is not there to have a respectful approach to colleagues in Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast then it is not going to improve things.  Something that will no doubt be of interest to all members of the committee is often you find yourself in meetings where you find the same point of view is being represented by SNP ministers, Welsh Labour Party ministers and ministers from Northern Ireland, who often appear in twos at meetings.  I can be in meetings with colleagues from Sinn F&eacute;in and the Democratic Unionist Party and we are all in agreement.  That shows how unfortunately often intergovernmental relations in the UK are suboptimal.  It is a shame but we are committed to trying to make that work better.<br/><br/>Moving to the Deputy's second point, he asked about the practical implications of the protocol for ports.  Obviously, there has been a change in the nature of Irish direct freight traffic in particular wanting to get straight into the European market from one part of the Single Market to another and not have to transit the UK that is not part of the Single Market, with all the challenges that brings.  That is not our situation because we are now outside the EU.  We have not had that kind of change in trade patterns, although I can easily see that happening after we rejoin the EU because the advantages of that are pretty clear.  The advantages of that are, incidentally, also understood on the Continent.  We recently had a visit by the premier of Flanders, who made the point publicly in Scotland that he thought Antwerp would be a tremendously good port for Scottish freight traffic to use more after we rejoin the EU.  I am sure it will not be the only opportunity we have and we must look and understand how all that would work.  On the negative aspect of things, we are facing the prospect of having border arrangements at Cairnryan for port traffic between Northern Ireland and Scotland.  That is of course related to the protocol and what is emanating from the Brexit process.  Notwithstanding the challenges we know are associated with all that at the present time, we are working to try to make things work as best they can because in some respects this is actually devolved.  Agriculture, for example, is a devolved issue.  Again, we will try our best to make things work as well as they can.<br/><br/>The third question was on Scottish Government's policy divergence from the rest of the UK on the specific issue of refugees.  We take the same policy approach as the Irish Government and the rest of the EU, namely, that the worst refugee crisis in Europe since the end of the Second World War behoves us all to act in different ways.  The fact that the Irish Government and its EU colleagues have waived any visa requirements that may have previously existed is, to our mind, exactly the right response to take.  The UK's administrative approach, whereby it is effectively using immigration hurdles to deal with refugees in their hour of need, is wrong-headed in our view.  We can look at the number of people who have been taken in.  From memory, at the start of this week Ireland had already taken in 1,923 refugees, and I know it is now more than that, while the UK had taken in 50.  It had issued visas to 50 people.  I find it shaming and appalling.  I have been very vocal on the issue because we need to do more.  I speak as the son of a refugee.  Think about this for a second - the United Kingdom was taking in refugees from Germany after the war in 1946 and 1947.  It was a big-hearted response.  The UK was absolutely right then and is wrong now.  It would be good for people to remember the history of a better Britain in dealing with refugees.  We have much to learn from Ireland because we will see greater refugee numbers through the suboptimal schemes the UK Government has introduced.  We are very keen to learn about the experience here.  I was interested to hear that among the early arrivals, the overwhelming majority are people who are being taken into the private accommodation of relatives and friends, so it is a quite a different refugee picture from that we have experienced in recent years in Scotland with people coming from Afghanistan or Syria, for example.  We have much to learn.  Incidentally, Ukrainian refugees are arriving in Scotland from Northern Ireland, which is a good thing because we have a part to play in helping our fellow Europeans in need.  We take much the same attitude in terms of our values towards refugees as you do and we want to do as much as we can.  We will try to persuade the UK Government to reform their approach to the arrival of Ukrainians.<br/><br/>On the specific question of the fast-tracking of Ukrainian EU membership, I completely understand the benefit of sending a signal that there is a European future for Ukraine and incidentally also for Moldova and Georgia, which have similarly asked that consideration be given to their accession.  Having spent ten years on the European committee of the UK Parliament, it is an area I know a bit about and in a previous life as a journalist I covered the accession processes of the mid-1990s.  We all know that joining the EU brings with it all kinds of requirements.</p><p>We must do anything we can to help the Ukrainians after they emerge from this horrific war and after, hopefully, they win by resisting the Russian invasion.  They will need a lot of help in terms of economic preparation, rule of law and the institutional standards that are required by EU member states.  I totally understand and applaud the signal that is being sent to the people in Ukraine that they have a European perspective.  I agree with that.  I wish us to be as helpful as we can in helping people in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia do everything they need to in order to ready themselves for EU membership in a post-war environment.  There is potential for unforeseen consequences no one would wish to see, such as negative impacts on the economy and so on.  I agree with the point about the perspective.  We should help Ukraine join the EU in the speediest possible timeframe.</p></speech>

I presume Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; had intended to ask the same questions.  Will we move on to the next speaker?</p></speech>

The answers were comprehensive, which is why the Deputy did not need to come back in and ask about any point that was missed.</p> <p>  Some of the madness we are dealing with as regards the British Government's position around Ukrainian refugees is the result of the ridiculous positions that were taken around Brexit and the whole issue of refugees.  That probably makes it difficult for them as they consider where to go.  Has Mr. Robertson had any major interaction with the British Government about the notion that has come out of the Home Office about security and that Ireland is a security risk because of the common travel area?  The British have suggested they do not know who is coming in and out although I see that as an excuse.</p> <p>  The word Mr. Robertson used most often in connection with the British Government was "suboptimal".  I imagine Mr. Robertson will tell the committee that consultation is tick-box consultation at best.  There has been some anecdotal evidence but perhaps Mr. Robertson would like to give some details about the negative impacts that Scotland is already suffering as a result of Brexit, which was a subject he touched on.  Mr. Robertson was not clear earlier.  Perhaps he would like to reiterate his position on Scotland's long-term positioning.  It is a question for Scottish representatives and not Irish representatives but Scotland has a particular project in place.  Does it have a strategy and a timeline?  If Mr. Robertson would go into whatever detail he can in that regard, I would appreciate it.  As much as it is an issue for the Scottish, I would not shed any tears for any damage done to the union.  That is unlikely to come as a shock to anyone.  Perhaps Mr. Robertson would also share some minor details of the framework discussions he had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.997" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Angus Robertson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022030900002#H00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for all the questions.  I should say first that I have a long-standing interest in this area.  I served for a number of years on the intelligence and security committee, which involves Members of both Houses of the British Parliament and which oversees the UK intelligence services.  I have a very close interest in the area and a reasonably deep understanding of the work that these agencies do in the UK and internationally to keep us safe.  It is largely women and children who are coming from Ukraine and I do not think they pose any security threat whatsoever.  That is my first observation.  My second relates to bad people who want to do harm in the UK.  We have experience of such people coming from Russia, as was the case in Salisbury and in the attempted and, sadly, successful poisoning of others.  That shows that the Russians do not need a refugee crisis to get into the UK.  I make those two points.  Speaking frankly, I view the arguments of the British Government as excuses to manage and limit the arrival of refugees.  Do I think it is a sensible thing that our security and police services do everything that is proportionate and sensible to make sure that we are aware of who is arriving?  I absolutely do.  However, if that is required, it should be done once people have arrived.  We should attain standard information about who is arriving in the country but we need to do it the other way around.  To answer the Deputy's question in short form, I do not see that there are major security implications or different security implications from those that previously existed.  Incidentally, if that were a particular issue for the United Kingdom, it must surely also be a particular challenge for European Union countries.  The exceptionalism we often hear about from Ministers in London is beyond me.  I have every faith that Ireland's policing service and the policing and border services in other European Union states will be doing what they need to do to ensure that states know who is arriving into their countries.  That is right and proper but in the UK's case, it is being used as an excuse to use an administrative system to limit the arrival of refugees.  That is my answer to the Deputy's first question.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about our longer term positioning.  It is not very long term.  We were elected last year with a majority in the Scottish Parliament.  We believe the people should be able to decide our constitutional future.  The Scottish Government has been elected with that mandate and it is our intention to deliver on it and ensure that the people can decide on our constitutional future in a democratic referendum.  The UK still views itself as a voluntary union and because of that, we have an inherent right to decide the arrangements we wish to see.  We want to see improved relations on our islands and we believe that becoming a sovereign state, working together with friends and neighbours in the rest of the current United Kingdom, who will be our closest political and economic partners, and our friends in Ireland and Northern Ireland, is important in that regard.  It is important to understand Scottish independence in that context.  We believe we will have a better future by becoming an independent state.  It behoves us to think about what we can do to ensure we have the appropriate architecture on these islands to allow us work together better.  Of course, we have the British-Irish Council, which brings together the Governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland while also including colleagues from Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.  That is a good start and there is much more we can do to develop that as an architecture to bring us together.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the timeline.  We were elected last year.  We said that we wished to have a referendum after we emerged from the pandemic and, thankfully, we are all now emerging from the pandemic.  We are in the process of making the necessary preparations within the Government to be able to hold a referendum, which would take place towards the end of 2023.</p></speech>

I have a difficulty in that I think the comparative mechanism for a referendum in the North is insufficiently clear.  That is a separate issue but perhaps Mr. Robertson could explain how the mechanism works in Scotland.  The Scots have done a significant amount of planning.  There has been a failure across this island to do that sort of planning.  Perhaps Mr. Robertson could detail the planning that has been done in Scotland.  I apologise for not dealing with those matters earlier.</p></speech>

It has provided a precedent of a United Kingdom Government that respects democratic election results in Scotland and works with the Government of Scotland to hold a recognised constitutionally-approved process and that is exactly what we intend to do this time around.  We have been elected as a government, we have a mandate to hold a referendum and we intend to hold a referendum as we did previously.  If there are to be any changes, that would be from the UK Government that would disrespect a democratic election result and that would recast the United Kingdom as the kind of state that it would then be - one that would deny democratic election results and overturn a precedent that was set by a previous and incidentally Conservative Government.  We are proceeding on the basis that we have a precedent and a mandate.  On the basis of those two facts, it should not be an insurmountable problem to recognise and operate as a democracy.</p><p> It is not my area of expertise to understand the various mechanisms of these islands and there is not a direct read-across.  There are very different provisions that have been agreed in relation to the Good Friday Agreement, etc.  Our position is different in that we have had a vote.  Subsequently, we have had Brexit.  We did not vote for that.  There is public demand now, given that context, that we should be able to revisit the issue because there has been a profound change of circumstances for us relative to 2014.</p></speech>

We have a big bank holiday weekend coming up here which coincides with the rugby match.  I hope Scotland will not ruin the bank holiday atmosphere by winning the game.</p> <p>  What is Mr. Robertson's view of the protocol?  As he looks from Scotland over to Belfast, does he see the advantages of the protocol as it is currently constructed from a trade point of view of a country that may be in competition with Northern Ireland for trade and investment?  Is it his view that Northern Ireland has a considerable advantage over Scotland arising from the protocol as currently constituted?</p> <p>  Mr. Robertson spoke to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; about a timeline of 2023 for a potential referendum on independence.  I smiled at his description of the union as a voluntary one.  That would be an unusual phrase to us here.  That aside, if the referendum goes the way Mr. Robertson wishes, what is his timeline for Scotland's application for accession to the European Union?  At what stage would an independent Scotland become a membership candidate for the EU?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1003" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Angus Robertson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022030900002#J00300"><p>Clearly, we look to Northern Ireland and its remaining in the European Single Market as having a competitive advantage to Great Britain.  When it was not certain after the initial Brexit referendum result what form of Brexit the UK Government was pursuing, we were making the case for that ourselves.  We had voted to remain and if it was possible for one part of the United Kingdom to remain within the Single Market, why would it not be possible for another part of the United Kingdom to remain within the Single Market?  Unfortunately, that train left and we are left where we are.  We very much look to the advantages that Northern Ireland has being in the Single Market and us not being in the Single Market.<br/><br/>On timelines, I am sorry to disappoint the Deputy who asked the question on this.  If I can make a process point about the stage at which we are at, we have begun the work of preparing, in every manner of means, for both the referendum and also the case that will be made as part of that referendum process.  This is to ensure the public is properly informed about the choice they will be able to make, part of which will relate to the European Union and accession to the European Union.  We are in a different circumstance from 2014 where we were talking about becoming an independent member state of the European Union while being in the European Union.  We now find ourselves outside, which is a significantly different position to be in.<br/><br/>Having said that, we would be in the unique position of having been in Europe for 47 years.  We would be a known quantity.  We have, for 47 years, maintained the <i>acquis communautaire</i>in Scotland and, as I have already told the committee, we are working to remain aligned with European legislation.  There are differences from 2014 but as part of the process in the run-up to the referendum date in 2013, we will be publishing a range of documents as part of the prospectus that will inform people's choice.  That will include much of the information the Deputy is asking me to give him a sneak preview of.  I would be in big trouble with colleagues in the Scottish Parliament committee that I regularly appear before if I were to divulge such interesting information.</p></speech>

It really matters that our friends and fellow Europeans and neighbours, both in the European Union but also in the rest of the United Kingdom, understand exactly the route map that we wish to pursue.  We want people to know that we are pursuing a constitutionally-recognised, legitimate process.  That is important for friends across the European Union to understand and that is exactly what we intend to do.  Details will follow.  I look forward to briefing the committee on those, if and when time allows.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Robertson.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to interact with him.</p> <p>  I want to make one point on Ukraine before I ask two other questions.  My question on Ukraine may not be for Mr. Robertson because it is obviously a British Home Office matter.  There is concern here that a number of refugees - people fleeing from terror in Ukraine who want to come to the United Kingdom because they have family members in the United Kingdom - cannot get access right now.  Some are coming to Ireland.  I had contact in my office in Wexford this week with a mother and daughter who decided to come to Ireland and apply to access the UK from here.  I am wondering if there is any help Mr. Robertson can give to ensure that if there are people with direct family connections in the United Kingdom who, for practical reasons, are fleeing terror, want to escape and find it more convenient to come to Ireland, they would have their visas processed quickly here.</p> <p>  On the trade distortions post Brexit, I chair the economics committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and we are doing a report on the trade changes post Brexit on these islands.  We are taking evidence on the island of Ireland and we intend to go to the UK side to take evidence there as well before preparing our report.  I represent the constituency of Wexford where the port of Rosslare has seen an increase of more than 300% in direct continental traffic since Brexit.  More and more freight operators are not using the land bridge but travelling directly to the Continent.  That practice will increase with a new service regularly being added to an already burgeoning set of services.</p> <p>  This question may fall under the category of questions Mr. Robertson cannot answer.  We are trying to get a handle on the operation of the protocol in Northern Ireland and its implications for trade there.  Would that be the model the Scottish Government would seek to achieve, that is, continued membership of both markets post independence?</p><p>My third question relates to energy co-operation, which has probably accelerated in the last week, never mind in the last couple of months.  There is an enormous focus on decarbonisation, which has accelerated.  Frans Timmermans's declaration yesterday has underscored that for the European Union.  Offshore wind will be a huge resource for these islands with regard to decarbonisation.  Has the Scottish Government any practical engagement with the Irish Government to co-operate on the development and servicing of offshore wind?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1010" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Angus Robertson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022030900002#K00200"><p>There is lots of ground that I could cover.  Those are excellent questions and I will try to do them all justice.  On co-operation between the Scottish Government and the UK Government on new schemes for Ukrainian refugees, we are in active contact to try to ensure we have the best possible system in place under the parameters of this suboptimal approach taken by the UK Home Office.  Visa processing in Ireland will form part of the picture.  As I mentioned to the committee already, we are seeing people arrive in Scotland from Northern Ireland.  I do not have information in front of me about whether these people had flown directly to Belfast, but I suspect they had flown to Dublin.  We need to understand all of that much better.  We need to do anything we can to make the suboptimal system work better and to help people in their hour of need.  If there is co-operation that we can pursue with Irish colleagues and through the UK diplomatic network, with the visa application process, that is definitely something to look at to make sure things are working as well as they possibly can.</p> <p>  On the Northern Ireland protocol, we are all invested in trying to find workable solutions to the challenge.  We did not wish and I do not think members wished to see the UK leave the European Union.  It is problematic for the UK to have entered into international agreements which it then seeks to change unilaterally.  We have been a strong voice in a UK context in trying to impress on UK Government colleagues how important it is that the UK upholds international law and agreements that have been reached in good faith.  We will try to be a voice of reason in that.  There is not a direct read-across from Northern Ireland's situation to Scotland, for reasons that we do not have long enough to go into at this session.  They should be obvious to everybody.  I leave the committee with the assurance that we will do everything we can to make sure we have solutions to the problems that have emerged in Northern Ireland and are continuing to emerge, with a ripple effect on good governance.  We want to be as helpful as we can.</p> <p>  Regarding energy co-operation, Scotland is fortunate in that it has won the natural resource lottery twice.  Not many countries can say that.  We were the single biggest oil producer in the European Union, not that Scotland saw the great tax benefits that her majesty's treasury has enjoyed for decades.  Notwithstanding that and the fact that we need to pivot away from our dependence on hydrocarbons, we have the good fortune that we have amazing renewable energy potential, which is our second lottery win.  I think we have 25% of Europe's wind energy capacity.  That does not get into other sources of renewable energy, which we also have, including water, waves or tides.  Ireland is not short of those either.  The Deputy is right to underline the potential for co-operation between Scotland and Ireland.  I know colleagues in government who are responsible for these areas are interested in making sure we pursue all of those things.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that Covid has been a big challenge for everybody, in my bilateral meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, earlier today, we reflected on the successful delivery across the range of areas that we want to work together on.  Technology, economy and energy form part of that.  There is undoubtedly more that we can do.  Let us have the ambition to do that.  I would welcome us doing more together in the future.</p></speech>

In the fullness of time, history will judge the fall-out from and assess Brexit.  While we did not wish for Brexit, would it be widely accepted that an unintended consequence of Brexit is to strengthen the case for Scottish independence, as I believe it does for reunification of this island?  Maybe we should not waste an opportunity to move forward that agenda for somebody who advocates Scottish independence.</p><p>The best of both worlds includes access to the Single Market and the internal market.  I believe that is a way forward, through the teething process.  Would it be true to say that Scotland would be envious of the best of both worlds and the protocol and that it would like something similar?  Is the only reason Northern Ireland secured that not that it was a recognition of a vote in what unionists might regard as a region of a country, but rather that it was underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement, which Scotland cannot rely on?  Are the witnesses still actively seeking it as an interim protocol arrangement?  I am interested in preparations for EU membership for post-independence Scotland.  Are the witnesses doing anything to comply voluntarily with EU regulations so that they are ahead of the field on flora, fauna and habitats directives?  That would be smart.</p><p>I would like to see them win the referendum this time, as I would like to see it won in Ireland.  Despite passionately wanting to see that, I am realistic about it.  Have the witnesses more than token representation in London this time?  I am not saying that Scotland should receive dominion status.  This applies equally for our brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland.  Should we not have a beefed-up infrastructure from east to west, with a gathering of our friends in all these countries?  That might win over, and allay the fears of, people of a unionist bent in Scotland or Northern Ireland.</p><p>Being a realist, I know the procedure required for a referendum on this island.  Can the Prime Minister not stymie the witnesses in proceeding with that referendum?  If they go ahead without the Prime Minister's<i>imprimatur</i>, will it be regarded as an invalid referendum?  He does not seem to wish to have it any time soon, although reference has been made today to 2023.  I wish the witnesses well in that regard.  How do they overcome the current Prime Minister's lack of enthusiasm, to put it mildly, about holding a referendum for Scotland?  It is fantastic that the witnesses are here and we look forward to closer relations with our Celtic cousins.</p></speech>

I will try to cover some of the ground of the Senator's questions.  A point was made about complying with European regulations and that is the alignment point I made earlier.  We are remaining aligned and using a number of different ways to do it so that when it comes to a point where we have conversations at the appropriate stage with the Commission about our membership, we will be able to show that we have effectively remained aligned with the European Union, its regulations and so on.</p> <p>  There is the question of where Scotland now finds itself as an unintended consequence of Brexit.  We certainly did not wish to leave the European Union along with the rest of the United Kingdom but it is being forced on us.  We do what we must to ensure we can be in the best possible position.  There was a question about our representation in the rest of the UK.  We are very fortunate to have an excellent Scottish Government representational office in London with very esteemed leadership.  Some of the members may know Mr. John Webster, who was the head of Scotland House in Dublin, and he has now moved on to head our representative office in London.  He has been replaced here by my colleague, Ms Katy McNeil, whom members will see more of attending various meetings in this place and in public life in Dublin and Ireland more generally.  We try to have the best possible relations, both in London and Dublin.</p> <p>  There was a question on thinking about administrative architecture that brings together all of us in what I still call the home nations.  I say that as a rugby fan but why would I not say it with everything else?  I feel very at home here, as I do elsewhere on these islands.  It behoves us to think about how we can give people assurance and reassurance that regardless of our views on constitutional arrangements, there is a place for all of us and all our traditions in an improved constitutional situation in Scotland and elsewhere on these islands.</p> <p>  I have already mentioned the British-Irish Council, the secretariat of which is based in Edinburgh.  We look with great interest at what our colleagues in Scandinavia do to bring those nations together to work co-operatively but we will have to find our own way.  I am very much in favour of that and it is over to committee to get its ideas.  I am very interested in hearing about all that.</p> <p>  The Senator also commented on the British Prime Minister wishing to stymie things.  Scottish political history is full of UK political leaders saying "no, no, no, no, no, yes".  We do not have enough time to go into all of this but at some point the penny will drop for decision makers in Westminster that if one is going to block democracy and a democratic decision to be able to decide on our constitutional future, it would not be a decision without consequence.  It would profoundly change the nature of the United Kingdom and the view internationally of the United Kingdom as a democratic state, or how it might not be acting as a democratic state.</p> <p>  I am keen to ensure our experience in the run-up to the 2014 referendum is the one we seek to emulate.  It was workable, deliverable and respected.  If it was good enough then, it is good enough now.  It is exactly what we intend to do.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on last year's elections, which I watched with interest night and day.  I am happy to see the Green Party in a partnership in that government.  It is great to see.</p> <p>  My questions have been covered.  I have much writing here and I know the issues have been covered the whole way through.  I go back to what Senator Martin asked.  Mr. Robertson mentioned the 2014 mechanisms and will these be used by the Scottish Government or the Scottish Parliament to move forward on a referendum?  Does the parliament put these in place and the referendum would happen or does Westminster need to be told?  Is it just notified?  Could Westminster say the referendum cannot happen?  What are the mechanisms in this respect and could a referendum just be done?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, it is a pro-independence party.  We have an excellent working relationship and we now have two Green Party ministerial colleagues.  This is working very well in terms of the general work of the government by bringing their insights and priorities into government so they can be delivered.  We are delighted that is working so well.</p> <p>  It is also very advantageous for the preparations we are making for the referendum.  Their perspectives are not all the same.  We have different policies on a number of different issues, which underlines an important point.  Independence is not just there for one party or one vision of an independent state.  Becoming an independent state means it can change to become the image of different political parties and priorities, which is a thoroughly good thing.  It is what is done here.  Our partnership working with the Green Party is new for us and for it.  It is working very well.  It is good to be able to put that on record.</p> <p>  The mechanisms from 2014 are the mechanisms to be used.  We have a precedent and it is exactly what we intend to follow.  I have gone through it already so I will not go through it again.  We have a precedent and it worked then.  This does not need to be complicated.  It is very important for us that we have an agreed, recognised and constitutional process.  It is important for us in the UK and it is important for the European Union and EU member states.  The level of interest across the European Union for where Scotland finds itself in our ambitions to rejoin the European Union is extremely high.  Across the political spectrum we are seeing incredible empathy for the situation in which we find ourselves, having been taken out of the European Union against our will.</p> <p>  I look forward to us working as good neighbours and friends and as member states of the European Union, helping and supporting one another, especially in times of need, like those seen currently in Ukraine.  Perhaps we can act as a beacon to our friends in England in showing why working together in Europe is thoroughly good.  Who knows?  Perhaps in time we will be able to inspire them to rethink their relationship with the European Union.</p> <p>  I will finish on one fact, which it may be helpful for friends in Westminster to remember.  If Ireland and Scotland's economies are counted together, we are England's biggest trading partner.  We look forward to working with our friends from the rest of these islands.  It is in our interest and their interest.  We will find the appropriate constitutional way of doing this for the 21st century rather than the 20th century.</p></speech>

It is a specific piece of planning and the SNP had done a considerable amount of it in the considerable run-up to the previous referendum.  What is happening at a state level in order that when a referendum is called, the answers are there, verified and double-checked?  One is into a political play which is not always fair and it is worth having that detail.

I suspect this is some of the ground I covered when the Deputy was out of the room which relates to the prospectus we are preparing in order that people are informed in the run-up to their democratic choice.  We had a White Paper in the run-up to 2014 that covered all of that ground.  Our prospectus will be published in the run-up to the 2023 referendum and will cover all of the ground Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; had imagined it would.

I am always delighted to have the input of friends through these processes.  Scotland House in Brussels engages with the European institutions across the legislative piece in Brussels.  If issues pop up that European institutions are thinking about and there are areas on which we have views, we have permanent dialogue with those institutions and the member states.  However, there is no getting away from the fact we are no longer a member state.  We are in the same position as EFTA countries that are rule takers and are not part of the process.  That horse has bolted.  What can we do?  What we can do is at the margins.</p> <p>  Nevertheless, in terms of the values and the content and direction of European decision making, we see ourselves very much in the European mainstream and aligned with the decision making which the Irish Government and MEPs are part of the process of shaping.  That is another reason we seek to retain alignment.  We most certainly do not share the ideological fixation one sees in the Westminster government of wanting to be different and to diverge from anything and everything that is decided by the European Union.  I will leave that to Jacob Rees-Mogg and Brexiteer UK ministers.</p> <p>  We are doing our best to have a collegial relationship with European Union member states and institutions.  We continue to do so and we are doing everything we can to remain aligned.  However, there is no getting round the fact that the best way to be able to influence decision making at a European level is to be in the European Union, have Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament and be part of the Council discussions that shape all of these processes.  That is exactly what we intend to do.</p></speech>

We have a long-standing community in Scotland.  How do we ensure our towns, cities and regions feel a direct connection with Ukraine?  We have the fortune in the city that I represent, our capital Edinburgh, to be twinned with Kyiv.  What is it that we can do more through our formal twinning processes?</p> <p>  I do not know if this is the Irish experience, but in Scotland, twinning is not what it was when it was set up after the Second World War with French and German twin towns, in particular.  Part of the conversations I was having with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities was about thinking about partnership arrangements.  That would mean that local towns in Scotland, and perhaps in Ireland, might think of having a direct connection with another town, city or region.  When that town, city or region emerges from the horror through which they are going at present and, God willing, victorious to boot, we can play a direct role with communities, towns and cities and have a tangible connection with them.</p> <p>  Maybe that can be thought about here as well.  In the helplessness we all feel, we want to give and be as supportive as we can, but we have to be aware that this will be a long-running challenge.  Having a more structured relationship with Ukraine and all of its parts, especially those that have been ravaged by war, would be worthy of all of our consideration.</p></speech>

We will have upwards of 100,000 Ukrainians in our country over the period of time ahead.  Many people have opened their doors already and are willing to take them in.  The majority of the people who will come here want to go home again.  Most refugees want to go home.  Many individuals struggle with this at an individual level in terms of what they can do to help.</p> <p>  Not to bring football into it but the World Cup is as symbolic a competition as one could get in the sporting world.  Three more countries from Europe will compete to qualify for the remaining places, including Mr. Robertson's country.  The Scottish FA has been very generous in facilitating and trying to postpone the match.  I will not ask Mr. Robertson for his opinion because I do not want him to get into bother with his Scottish authority.</p> <p>  I am not talking on behalf of anybody other than myself.  My opinion is that FIFA should look at symbolically facilitating Ukraine in order that it does not have to go through the process of a semi-final and a final and even at postponing the match until June.  As Mr. Robertson said, this will be long term.  Half of the FC Dynamo Kyiv footballers are fighting today in the trenches.</p><p>Footballers are fighting in the trenches.  People have died since this meeting started.  There could be a symbolic gesture like that, without being a detriment to Scotland, Wales or any other country that is trying to qualify.  Maybe FIFA should in some way facilitate Ukraine to play in Qatar without having to go through a semi-final and a final.  It has paid a lot and more than earned its place at this stage.  I know a former First Minister, Henry McLeish, spoke on this issue.  He was referred to by <i>The Scotsman </i>on Monday.  That is a personal opinion.<br/><br/>Gu&iacute;m gach rath ar na finn&eacute;ithe amach anseo.  T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh Angus Robertson aon am.  T&aacute; an doras oscailte.

She is very welcome to our committee.  We are dealing with Revised Estimates for public services.  The D&aacute;il ordered that the Revised Estimates for public services in respect of the following Votes be referred to this committee for consideration, namely, Vote 35 on Army pensions and Vote 36 on defence.  The select committee will consider the Estimates for Votes 35 and 36.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Defence, Deputy Simon Coveney, and his officials: Mr. David Geraghty, principal officer, Mr. Michael O'Boyle, principal officer, and Mr. Robert Mooney, assistant secretary.  I particularly welcome the Minister to this engagement having regard to his quite taxing and busy schedule.  I am very pleased, as are members, that he is joining us in person.</p> <p>  The proposed format of the meeting is that the committee will deal with Votes 35 and 36 under programmes A and B.  At the outset of our consideration, I invite the Minister to give an overview of the Votes, outlining any pressures likely to impact on his Department's performance or expenditure relating to the Votes for the remainder of 2022.  We will take the Votes in reverse order with Vote 36 followed by Vote 35.  The floor will then be opened for questions from members of the committee on each programme for both Votes.  I ask that members put their questions on the specific programme in order that we can progress in an orderly and efficient manner.</p></speech>

I remind members and our guests to turn off mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they interfere with the sound system.  I think the Minister has probably just turned on his phone after a very substantial flight mode.

If there are other related, broader questions on these Estimates, I am also happy to try to deal with them because it will be an opportunity to deal with a range of matters across the defence sector.</p><p>I welcome this opportunity to engage with the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to consider the 2022 Revised Estimates for Vote 35 - Army Pensions, and Vote 36 - Defence.  I have a short opening statement that sets out the overall position and updates members on some recent developments within the defence sector.</p><p> As members will be aware, the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces was recently published and I express my thanks to the chair and all members of the commission for their time and effort spent producing this report.  Following its publication last month, I had some very positive and constructive discussions on a wide range of matters relating to the report.  The report is forthright in its assessment of the current status of the Defence Forces and highlights key issues that must be tackled, including cultural change.  The report proposes significant changes for the Defence Forces and defence provision in Ireland that we as a society must carefully consider and respond to.  This report, and recent events, have fostered real interest and debate about defence matters and I look forward to further exploration and discussion on these issues in the period ahead.</p><p> The defence sector is comprised of two Votes: Vote 35 - Army Pensions, which members will see from the briefing is straightforward this year, and Vote 36, which is the broader Defence Vote.  The high-level goal of both Votes is to "provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government".  Accordingly, defence sector outputs are delivered under a single programme in each Vote.  The combined Estimates for Defence and Army Pensions for 2022 provide for gross expenditure of over &euro;1.1 billion, an increase of over &euro;35 million, or 3%, over 2021.  The 2022 provision comprises of some &euro;836 million for Vote 36, an increase of &euro;27 million on 2021, and some &euro;271 million for Vote 35 - Army Pensions, an increase of some &euro;8 million.</p><p> The Army Pensions Vote has a single programme entitled, "Provision for Defence Forces&rsquo; Pensions Benefits".  It makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to, or in respect of, former members of the Defence Forces and certain dependants.  The 2022 Estimate provides a gross sum of &euro;271 million for the Army Pensions Vote, of which some &euro;261 million covers expenditure on superannuation benefits.  Pension benefits granted are, for the most part, statutory entitlements once certain criteria are met.</p><p> During 2021, some 300 members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, retired on pension.  There are currently some 12,890 pensioners paid from the Army Pensions Vote and their numbers continue to rise, year on year.  Against that backdrop, I am pleased to inform the committee that the increased allocation provided in 2022 will cover both the cost of existing and new pensions, as well as the passing on of benefits from pay increases received by serving personnel.</p><p> Turning to Vote 36 - Defence, this is delivered under a single programme entitled "Defence Policy and Support, Military Capabilities and Operational Outputs".  The Revised Defence Estimate of some &euro;836 million for 2022 includes an allocation of over &euro;545 million for the pay and allowances of members of the Permanent Defence Force, civil servants and civilian employees.  It also provides for commitments arising from the Building Momentum 2021-2022 public service pay agreement.  The non-pay allocation comprises both current and capital elements, and the Revised Defence Estimate provides a non-pay current expenditure allocation of over &euro;150 million for 2022.  This allocation provides mainly for expenditure on ongoing and essential Defence Forces standing and operational costs, such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.</p><p> The principal demand drivers of defence capital funding are the ongoing renewal, upgrade and acquisition of military equipment, along with the development of military infrastructure and information and communication technologies.  The White Paper on Defence, updated in 2019, highlighted the importance of capability development and the necessity for continued renewal, upgrade and acquisition of military equipment and infrastructure.  To this end, the national development plan has allocated multi-annual funding of &euro;566 million to defence out to 2025, with an allocation of &euro;141 million provided for 2022.  Many of the defence equipment projects are complex, multi-annual and have long lead-in times, so the funding certainty now provided by the national development plan is welcome as it will enable the Department and the Defence Forces to plan, prioritise and deliver on scheduled projects over the coming years.</p><p> The acquisition of military equipment is pursued through the defence equipment development plan, a plan based on White Paper objectives, which provides a consolidated, structured basis for ongoing investment in military equipment to maintain and develop necessary capabilities.  Among the major defence equipment upgrade and replacement programmes set to be prioritised over the coming years are: the land forces capability development and force protection programmes, including an upgrade of the military transport fleet and next-generation radio communications and signal equipment; the ongoing Naval Service vessel renewal and replacement programme, which includes the mid-life refit of the P50 class of naval vessel and the progression of the multi-role vessel project, which is very important; and the ongoing Air Corps aircraft renewal and replacement programme, which includes the purchase of the CASA C295 maritime patrol aircraft, which is due next year.  In addition to these major projects, an ongoing schedule of capital investment across a broad range of force protection, transport, communications and information technology, weapons and ammunition systems continues in 2022.  This level of investment in defence equipment platforms will further boost ongoing efforts at modernising and upgrading defence equipment platforms through land, sea and air domains.</p><p> The capital allocation for defence infrastructural projects for 2022 is &euro;35 million, the highest allocation since the economic crash in 2008.  This will allow significant investment under the Defence Forces built infrastructure programme, including: the provision of a new cadet school at the Defence Forces Training College at the Curragh, County Kildare; the provision of a new military medical facility for the Defence Forces at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel; and the upgrade to accommodation facilities in various military locations throughout the country, such as Collins Barracks, Cork, McKee Barracks, Dublin, and the Naval Base, Haulbowline.  This level of infrastructure investment, which has a strong regional or local dividend in terms of local enterprise and employment, seeks to ensure that all Defence Forces installations are fit for purpose, taking account of operational, security and health and safety considerations.  However, it will take time and a programme of continuous investment to bring all Defence Forces facilities up to the modern standards that we desire.</p><p> The White Paper on Defence has identified that demands on future capability will need to take account of climate change objectives.  In that regard, defence remains fully committed to incorporating green procurement practices into all defence organisation equipment and infrastructural procurements in line with overarching climate action plan objectives.</p><p> I would like to briefly reference some of the many outputs to be delivered by the Defence Forces from the Defence Vote throughout this year.  The 2022 allocation will allow Defence Forces personnel to meet Government commitments on our overseas peace support missions and proudly represent Ireland abroad in diverse, often challenging, locations throughout the world.  As of 1 March, there were 569 PDF personnel serving in nine overseas missions throughout the world.  This level of overseas deployment reflects Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing contribution to international peace and security and I thank our Defence Forces for their professionalism and commitment to their overseas roles.  At home, the funding provision allows the Defence Forces to continue to provide essential support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as requested, across various roles such as explosive ordnance disposal call-outs, Garda air support missions and Naval Service diving operations.  It also enables the Defence Forces, as part of their aid to the civil authority role, to provide support to local authorities and the Health Service Executive in their emergency response efforts.</p><p> At this point, I believe it is opportune to highlight the collective defence response to the Covid-19 pandemic over the last two years, which involved Permanent Defence Force personnel, members of the Reserve, Civil Defence volunteers and civil servants and civilian employees within my Department.  I thank all of them for their resilience and support throughout what was a very difficult period for everybody.</p><p> The Defence Vote provides funding of over &euro;5 million for Civil Defence in 2022.  This funding supports Civil Defence units throughout the country by way of central training and the supply of vehicles, boats, uniforms and personal protective equipment for volunteers.</p><p>The Government also values the service of the Reserve Defence Force and on behalf of the Government, I commend the voluntary effort made by members of the Reserve Defence Force and thank them for their ongoing dedication and enthusiasm, particularly those who assisted in the national Covid-19 response.  We have a lot of work to do to build the Reserve to what it should be.  It is one of the key actions from the commission report on which I hope we can make some early progress.  I believe that we can do that.  There is an appetite for people to join the Reserve if we create the right conditions and context for those efforts.  I look forward to bringing forward recommendations to the Government on that.</p><p> In addition to the Commission on the Defence Forces, I also want to advise members of the strategic review and development process currently under way within the Department.  This process, which is nearing completion, includes a comprehensive independent organisation capability review of my Department.  It will provide an assessment of the Department&rsquo;s capabilities and capacity to deliver on objectives and will present an opportunity for my Department to take positive actions to address any gaps that may emerge from this review process.  When we launched the Commission on the Defence Forces, there was a view that we were effectively applying a rigorous scrutiny to the Defence Forces but were not applying similar scrutiny to the Department.  That is simply not true.  Any organisation worth its salt must be open to outside assessments and benchmarks and so on.  I will be willing to learn lessons from that.  I certainly believe the Defence Forces are up for that, and the Department is too.</p><p> To conclude, I am very proud of the Defence Forces and all that they achieve, both nationally and internationally. However, as outlined in the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, there are many challenges facing the Defence Forces and the Department, both now and in the future, with significant levels of further engagement, collaboration, adjustment and legislative change envisaged over the coming years.  I accept that the level of ambition and change outlined in the report is potentially far-reaching and, if implemented, could necessitate significant increases in defence funding.  There is no secret there.  There are other pressing changes, however, which are also required and which are not resource-intensive.  I remain committed to leading the required change, as I believe it has the capacity to transform our Defence Forces, and the choice of a career in the Defence Forces for the many people who serve there, over the coming years.</p><p> Committee members have been provided with briefing material on both the Defence and Army Pensions Estimates and I look forward to positive engagement, as well as any questions or comments that members may have.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his opening statement.  The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces is a comprehensive report and key elements of the report need to be implemented.  It will certainly go a long way to addressing many of the challenges and difficulties within the Defence Forces around pay and retention, which certainly needs to be done with immediate effect.  One of the primary and key asks in that report, and of the representative bodies, is the right to affiliate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  Given the upcoming pay talks, I believe that this needs to be acted upon immediately.  I preface my contribution with this request.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to it.  The representative bodies have continually asked for it, and I too have sought it.  It is a key recommendation within the report, as is the issue around the working time directive, which is a major issue that also needs to be addressed.  I do not see anything in the Estimates here in this regard, even as an initial attempt to start trying to record the hours that the members of the Defence Forces are actually doing, without fully implementing the directive in full.</p> <p>  I will deal with Vote 35 first.  There is not a lot that I have to say on Vote 35 other than on the post-1994 contracts.  I welcome that some movement has been made around the huge difficulty this creates for members of the Defence Forces and the future they see for themselves within the Defence Forces.  I am aware there are still issues that need to be resolved, for example with regard to sergeants.  I note there will also be a knock-on effect for pensions. Will the Minister give an overview as to where that situation is and what agreement has been reached on that long-standing issue with the post-1994 contracts?  That is my first question.</p></speech>

I will ask other members to come in on that, briefly, at this stage.  Then we can go on to the more general queries.  I invite Deputy Berry to speak on Vote 35 - Army Pensions.</p></speech>

On page 3 of the Minister's opening statement, we see that 12,890 people are in receipt of Army pensions.  That is a massive number.  My observation is that there are 50% more people on military pensions than are actually serving in the Defence Forces.  It just shows how small our Defence Forces complement has become.</p><p>The other statement the Minister made was, "and their numbers continue to rise year on year".  That is an accurate statement.  It shows the importance of retention and stopping that haemorrhage of people.  When people hit 50 or 60 years of age, they have to retire but there are many people retiring before that age.  The actuarial problem here is that not only are you paying the military pension of the people who retire but you are paying the military salary for their replacements as well.  I want to place the emphasis on it being important that we try to retain people in the organisation.</p><p> My final observations is that there is &euro;271 million for pensions.  A quarter of the entire defence budget is going towards military pensions.  The only thing I want to emphasise there is that retention is essential.  If we can keep these highly-skilled, highly-motivated, highly-professional people in the organisation, it will save money in the long run.</p></speech>

I am not sure where we sit in terms of the pensions.  Are they defined benefit, defined contribution or both?  Is there a spectrum depending the ages of exit from the service?  Perhaps we are paying both.  If it is either, how is it funded?  Is it funded through current spending or is there a pool under investment by actuarial management with a view to each year's spend coming out?</p></speech>

All I am saying is we are working on implementation plans and consideration of all the recommendations in the commission report.  There is a recommendation that the Permanent Defence Force representative associations should be facilitated if they wish to pursue associate membership of ICTU.  It is important to understand what associate membership, as opposed to affiliation, is.  We are speaking to members of the commission who made their recommendation.  We are also speaking to the representative organisations on how we will proceed on that and, obviously, to the Department as well.  We will be bringing recommendations forward.</p> <p>  There is an element of time pressure on this because the new round of public sector pay talks will be probably getting under way in May.  I am conscious that that is a time pressure we need to take note of on this issue, particularly given the interests of PDFORRA but also the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, in regard to the relationship they will or will not have with ICTU in the context of those discussions.  As I have always said, I have an open mind on this.</p> <p>  By the way, we have also started an initial discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as is agreed to in the programme for Government, on a separate pay body for defence and how the two issues of potential associate membership of ICTU and having a separate pay consideration body could be married together.  It is not straightforward because they are two very different approaches to how you assess and manage pay, and potentially consideration around allowances as well, in the Defence Forces.  There is work already very much under way on both of those issues.</p> <p>  In terms of the working time directive, that is more straightforward.  We have committed to implementation of the working time directive.  That requires legislation but it also requires a recognition that the work of the Defence Forces at times can be different from other work fields and, therefore, within the confines of the working time directive there also needs to be recognition of military service as well in certain circumstances.  It is important to say that the working time directive is already a guideline in many ways in terms of the ask of many in the Defence Forces but there is more work to conclude there and to finalise legislation on.  By the way, that legislation needs to come from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as opposed to the Department of Defence, as far as I know.</p> <p>  On the post-1994 contracts issue, in December last agreement was secured with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an increase in service limits for privates and corporals recruited to the Permanent Defence Force since 1 January 1994.  This will allow such personnel to remain in service up to 50 years of age subject to meeting certain criteria, including medical and fitness standards.  Agreement was also secured which will allow for sergeants recruited since 1 January 1994 to continue to serve beyond 50 years of age.  Details on the proposal for sergeants will be finalised following further discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There will also be a discussion with PDFORRA, the representative association for enlisted personnel.  These revised arrangements follow a review of barriers of extended participation in the Permanent Defence Force as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission in the report of recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force.  Other recommendations in the review relating to commissioned officers, senior non-commissioned officers and personnel in certain technical appointments will be considered in the forum of an interdepartmental working group which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has established to consider mandatory retirement ages for public service groups which have fast-accrual pension arrangements, as many in the Defence Forces do.</p> <p>  On Deputy Berry's comments, it is important to say that we have significantly more people who are ex-Defence Forces than currently in the Defence Forces.  That is not unusual in many countries because people tend - sometimes they are required - to retire earlier than those in many other careers or else they choose to retire.  Not everybody chooses to spend all of their working life in the Defence Forces.  The Deputy is a good example of that but many other people are too.</p> <p>  I take the point Deputy Berry made in terms of trying to keep people in the Defence Forces for longer, holding on to that skill set and that experience, particularly in the context of what we must try to do now in terms of responding to the challenges the commission has put forward for us.  Not only do we have to get an extra 1,000 people into the Defence Forces to get us to the establishment of 9,500 that we should be at, but we must find a way, if we follow the recommendations and if I get Government agreement on that, to get an extra 2,000 people into the Defence Forces plus a significant increase in the number of people in the Reserve as well.  Recruitment, training and intake need to be a substantial factor in building up the numbers in the next few years as well as retention because, of course, turnover is not good if you are having a significant net increase each year given the level of experience that will be available to the Defence Forces, often in challenging environments.</p><p>I am conscious of the net increases we will have to deliver each year.  While we have not yet settled on an exact figure and how we will deliver it, if we are to get to the second level of ambition in the commission's report, that will mean we will have to deliver an additional 2,000 people in the Defence Forces, which effectively means an additional 3,000, given we are 1,000 behind where we should be.  Doing that in the space of five or six years or whatever period is agreed will require very significant net increases in the number of Defence Forces personnel each year, and that will put considerable pressure on the system.  Structural change, external HR management expertise and so on have been recommended to help us deliver those kinds of numbers, as well as a potentially increased civilianisation of some of the roles within the Defence Forces.  There are many challenges there, but the general point the Deputy made about the importance of retention is central to how successful we will be in delivering on the recommendations and the numbers that have been set out for us.</p><p> In response to Deputy Lawless on Defence Forces pensions, it is not always the case that pensions in a certain sector are taken in an entirely separate Vote, although it is the case here because the number is so significant.  The issues are relatively straightforward and it is about ensuring we have enough money each year, which I am glad we have had in recent years.  There was a practice for a number of years whereby there needed to be a Revised Estimate each year to meet the Army pensions bill, but that has not been the case in recent years.  The team has really got it right in terms of Estimates and recommendations to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and I expect we will be well covered this year with the additional &euro;8 million.</p></speech>

We make the case each year to the central pool of financial resources available to the State for an Army pensions current expenditure Vote, and in recent years, we have been successful.  I take the point that this approach is taken regularly within the private sector, but that is not how public sector pensions work given the guarantees arising from defined benefit pension schemes.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanton asked about abatement of retirement pensions where someone rejoins the public sector.  From 1 November 2012, where public servants retire on a pension and take up a new job anywhere within the public service, their retirement pension may be reduced or suspended for as long as they remain in that job.  This is called pension abatement.  For practical purposes, this means a person's combined earnings from the current public service job as well as from his or her existing public service pension cannot exceed the current equivalent of his or her pensionable pay from the first job.  This measure was introduced with effect from 1 November 2012 under the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 and applies without exception to all public service pension schemes, including the new single scheme.  A pensioner already in public service employment immediately before that date is not affected by the change while he or she remains in that post or position.  The measure does not apply to employment with the commercial semi-State bodies.</p> <p>  Before the 2012 change, the abatement principle operated as a standard feature of the public service pension schemes generally, but only within individual sectors where a public service pensioner resumed working in his or her former job, such as the Defence Forces, Garda, Civil Service and so on.  The 2012 Act extended the principle to all sectors without exception, thereby restoring the arrangements that had been in place until 1965.  Any change of status since 1 November 2012 constitutes a new job.  Those not subject to pension abatement in respect of their current job, such as because they were appointed before that date, will be subject to abatement if, after that date, they secure a new post through promotion.</p></speech>

I understand it was to be reviewed with a view to returning to what it had been prior to that but, again, I am not sure whether that is the case.  There was some discussion of the issue recently, so I thought I should raise it.</p></speech>

If an enlisted soldier, say, of private or corporal rank, retires after 31 years' service, he or she will get a 31-year pension, perhaps in his or her late 50s or at 60-years-old.  When he or she hits 66, he or she will get the old age pension, but the 31-year pension will be pushed back down to a 21-year pension.  It seems this issue is unique to the Defence Forces, although I am open to correction if that is not the case.  If a garda, a prison officer or a firefighter has 31 years' service, he or she will keep the 31-year pension and it will be included with the old age pension.  There appears to be an anomaly in the Defence Forces whereby service of 31 years is pushed back to 21 years when the old age pension is drawn down, but that does not happen in the rest of the public service.  If the Minister does not have an answer to hand, will he inquire into it?</p></speech>

This might be a technical answer to a technical question, but I will give it in any event.  In the case of pre-April 2004 enlisted personnel, their basic 21-year Defence Forces pension is payable for life.  An additional increment is payable on top of that basic pension for service of between 22 and 31 years, as the Deputy pointed out.  Under the pension scheme rules, however, this increment ceases payment when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age for the social welfare contributory State pension, namely, between the ages of 66 and 68, depending on when the insured person was born.  This is in accordance with the long-established principle of integrating occupational pensions with the social insurance benefits of employees who are in the full PRSI class, including non-commissioned officers, NCOs, and privates, who are fully insured for the range of social insurance benefits, such as the State pension, which are regarded as part of the person's overall pension package.  The integration principle applies throughout the public and private sectors, as well as in other countries.</p><p>I will have to check as to whether it applies to the Garda, for example, but I could send my note to the Deputy.  It contains a lot of backup information that I do not need to share with the committee.  My understanding is that it does apply across other public sector areas as well.</p></speech>

In terms of associate membership of ICTU, the Minister himself acknowledged that time is ticking away, as the public sector pay talks start in May.  As a result, a decision will have to be taken very quickly to ensure that the representative bodies can do their work in advance of partaking in those discussions.  I impress again on the Minister the importance and urgency of making a swift and correct decision to allow the associate membership to proceed.  Unless we get this right, everything else we discuss, such as sustainability in terms of retention and the development and growth of the Defence Forces will result in us being back here year in, year out.  I impress on the Minister the urgency of dealing with the issue.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned legislation is needed on the working time directive.  He said that is the responsibility of another Department.  Could we get a sense of how that is progressing?  Is there a sense of urgency in regard to it?  Has the work commenced to draft the heads of a new Bill?  The Minister might give an indication on progress.</p> <p>  Subhead A4 relates to allowances.  There has been much talk about allowances and issues that need to be addressed to deal with the shortfall in income needed, as members of the Defence Forces would perceive it.  I wish to touch on two areas, the first of which is the specialist instructor allowance, which is a critical one for specialists who are essential to the Defence Forces.  They keep the operation on the road in terms of rolling out specialist training courses and in terms of participation in overseas missions etc.  Will the Minister tell us where that is at?  It is my understanding that a proposal had been arrived at within the Department, which was sent to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and, unfortunately, it has not resurfaced in terms of a decision on funding the proposal on the allowance.  Could the Minister give us some indication of the exact status of the situation?</p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise is the sea service commitment scheme, which has been in operation for more than a year.  Has an analysis been carried out on how it has been received, how successful the Department believes it is and the level of uptake?  Could the Minister provide numbers on how many members of the navy have been included in the scheme?</p></speech>

If Deputy Brady could complete his questions on A1 to A7, I will see if there are any questions from other Members and then I will come back to him for questions on A8 to A13.

Some 40% of the members of the navy are excluded.  The Minister might respond as to what analysis has been carried out and give specific details.  There is also a concern that there was a delay in paying the &euro;10,000 allowance.  In October or November last, a small number had not received the payment.  It is not clear whether everyone who is eligible has received the full entitlement.</p> <p>  The Minister touched on the major failure to get the best from the fantastic people in the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, who have made their services available to the State.  In 2019, some 1,673 people were in the Reserve Defence Force.  In 2020, there were 1,588 and in 2021, the figure was down to 1,489.  Some of the issues have been articulated by the representative body for the RDF and they have been identified by the commission.  The Minister touched on it himself that those recommendations must be implemented immediately.  One of the major issues was the length of time it takes to bring in a new recruit when a person applies to join the RDF.  In some cases, it has taken more than two years.  People's lives move on, and their interests shift.  That is a major failure.  Could the Minister elaborate on what it entails when he says immediate action needs to be taken?</p> <p>  A very important decision was taken last year on legislation to allow members of the RDF to participate more fully in Defence Force operations and potentially to be deployed overseas, but there is a whole piece of work concerning workers' rights that is needed as part of that.  Employer organisations need to become stakeholders in the process.  There is a need for stringent workers' rights to ensure that members of the retained service who may choose to go on overseas deployment are not punished by their employer and do not lose out as a result of that.  As that is something that is needed, the Minister might give us an update on whether the issue has been examined and when the legislation is scheduled to appear.  That is it for now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2022030900002#F01200"><p>I will be quite brief.  I note that the PDF strength is also dropping from 8,659 in 2019 to 8,468 in 2021, which would be a concern.  The 2022 Estimate is lower than the 2021 outturn for allowances.  Could the Minister comment on why that is the case?  Is it because of the reduced numbers in the PDF?  Could he provide a breakdown on the PDF strength as well between the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service?</p> <p>  We know that pay and allowances are an issue in the Defence Forces.  Hopefully, that can be addressed in order to bolster retention.  Because of their fantastic training and skill set a lot of people are being headhunted by the private sector.</p> <p>  On the RDF side of it, could the Minister give a breakdown between the Army Reserve and Naval Reserve pay, which is given as one figure, &euro;1,918,000.  Could he comment on the allowances?  What are they for?  Has any thought been given to bringing back the gratuity that was there in the past for the Army Reserve, as it was?</p><p>If somebody put in so many hours per year, he or she got a gratuity at the end of the year, which encouraged people to show up for training and so on.  Again, the numbers there are dropping dramatically.</p></speech>

There was a gratuity involved certainly with the Army Reserve at one stage.  I do not know if it is still there or not or whether it is covered under allowances; I am not sure.  As I said, the numbers are dropping.  At one stage, there were approximately 15,000 people in the FCA, as it was called way back.  Now, that number is down to 1,400 people and dropping.  If something is not done to arrest this, that organisation will disappear.</p></speech>

In terms of a headcount of 9,500 in the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, I tabled a parliamentary question in the Chamber about this recently, although I do not think it was reached in the end, in terms of how the Estimates see the 9,500 playing forward.  Is it 10,000 or 10,500?  Where does the figure of 9,500 land when the Estimates are factored in in terms of our total headcount in the PDF?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1587" speakername="Cathal Berry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2022030900002#G00600"><p>I will make a couple of points.  On page 5, it states that 19% of the Defence Forces served overseas in 2020, which is a staggering number.  I want to emphasise that.  When one fifth of an organisation is spending six months overseas, it has massive implications for family separation and all the social issues that go with that.  It emphasises why we need to have more substitutes on the bench, basically, and a larger organisation to maintain our overseas commitments.</p> <p>  Also on page 5 is a list of memorandums of understanding and service level agreements with various organisations in the country.  I understand there is a memorandum of understanding between the Irish Defence Forces and the UK armed forces.  Would it be possible to get a copy of that?  I believe it is only a small document.  I genuinely have not actually seen it myself.  Perhaps it could be circulated to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence if possible.</p> <p>  On page 8, and I agree with Deputy Stanton, it is concerning that the number of PDF troops in the Air Corp, navy and Army are dropping.  I will juxtapose that with the increasing numbers of civil servants.  Again, we have nothing against civil servants.  Everybody understands that a Government Department needs civil servants.  Many employees in the Department of Defence are actually my constituents.  It is a red flag, however, when the numbers of front-line workers in any organisation are reducing and the numbers of managers are increasing.  We have seen that in the Health Service Executive as well.  It emphasises the importance of retention and proper recruitment in getting as many front-line troops in as possible.  I will also emphasise the Reserve Defence Force, as Deputy Stanton did.  We really need to get those numbers up as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Will the Minister clarify his specific plans to increase overall female participation?  How are current recruitment practices designed to attract more women?  It is my understanding that a report was due to be completed by December 2021 regarding combating pregnancy-related and other discrimination.  Has that been completed?  Is there an update with regard to that?</p></speech>

In response to the question on the possibility of associate membership with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to be honest with Deputy Brady, I am very limited in terms of what I can do and say to PDFORRA while there is still a legal case against me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2022030900002#G01000"><p>In fairness, PDFORRA has outlined what it is willing to do in relation to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1114" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2022030900002#G01100"><p>The Deputy might let me answer the question.  It has not withdrawn its case as of yet anyway.  I have spoken to it directly about that.  I have a very good relationship with PDFORRA.  If we are going to progress this issue, however, I am not going to do it under threat of legal action.  I think that is well understood.  There needs to be some good faith here.  I can understand the reason the legal action came about and I respect that.  However, we are now in the space of having a very short period before the public sector pay rounds start.  If we are going to make progress on this, it would be helpful if there was not a legal action still pending.</p> <p>  In terms of allowances, Deputy Brady raised the issue of a specialist instructor allowance.  That is a specific issue the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, raises all the time with me.  I can understand the argument it makes.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's view on this is very clear.  There was a negotiated buy-out, essentially, of that specialist instructor allowance under a previous pay round discussion and negotiation.  RACO does not accept that; we are happy to work with it to try to progress this issue.  I met with RACO last week and we spoke about this issue.  I want to be helpful if I can.  We also need to be realistic, however, in terms of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's view on this issue.  It is something on which we can hopefully find a way forward as part of a new round of discussions or negotiations around public sector pay, or in advance of that if it is possible to do so.  I will continue to speak to RACO with regard to this, however.</p> <p>  Given the pressure on training and need for instructors in terms of the level of recruitment we will need to facilitate and encourage in the years ahead, I can certainly see why there would be a strong argument around ensuring that we can incentivise specialist instructors to move into that space.</p> <p>  In terms of the sea service commitment scheme, as far as I know, 103 people are in that scheme now.  We are looking at how we can broaden that.  It took a year to negotiate this scheme and get it agreed.  It was not easy because a public sector pay round was under discussion.  What we could not do in the Naval Service, essentially, was increase pay in a straightforward pay increase fashion.  That would have had a knock-on impact in terms of pay negotiations in other sectors and so on.</p> <p>  That is why this is quite targeted for people who have been in the Naval Service for three years and who are willing to commit to go to sea for a number of years.  They get quite a significant financial recognition of that commitment in the sea service commitment scheme.  Let me give members the updated figures.  The new service commitment scheme was introduced in January 2021 for officers and enlisted personnel in the Naval Service who satisfied the following conditions: they must have a minimum of three years' service at ensign-able seaman grade and give an undertaking to serve for an aggregate of 24 months at sea, and a minimum number of 240 patrol days, over a maximum 48-month reference period.  There is a total payment of &euro;10,000 for this commitment and that is to be paid in stages.  Stage payments of &euro;2,500 are made following each six-month period of seagoing rotation on confirmation that the individual delivers the required minimum 60 patrol days per six-month period.</p> <p>  To date, the military authorities have advised that 103 applicants for the seagoing service commitment scheme have been approved.  Payments for the first tranche of this scheme have been processed for a total of 70 personnel to date.  The scheme remains open for further applicants as they commence their seagoing rotation.  Would we like a broader scheme than that?  Yes, I think so.</p> <p>  We have particular recruitment and retention issues in the Naval Service.  That is not just a pay issue, by the way.  It is a lifestyle issue as well, which is why one of the recommendations in the commission report is that we would look at double crewing for ships so that people would not have to spend as long at sea, which many find difficult in terms of family life and so on, particularly when there are alternatives in the workforce, the private sector and other opportunities in the public sector.  We must, therefore, make it more attractive to be in the Naval Service and go to sea.  We have to reward that financially but we also have to make sure the lifestyle issues and retention issues around HR management and so on for people in the Defence Forces are prioritised.  It is a combination of all those things.</p><p>That is why there are clear recommendations on this in the commission's report.  Its recommendation is that we provide immediate access to the seagoing service commitment scheme to direct entry personnel into the Naval Service, replace the existing seagoing allowances with less complex seagoing duty measures and make a few other changes that would apply to everybody.  Those are issues we have to consider and talk to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about, as it ultimately has to sign off on any change to or broadening of criteria.</p><p> A number of Deputies raised concerns about the Reserve Defence Force.  I have spoken to reservists who up until a few months ago were very downbeat about the future.  I have heard people say that this service is being allowed to die on its feet.  I can promise that it will not be allowed to do that.  We are committed to the future of the Reserve, to broadening the role of reservists and to bringing in professional expertise around recruitment and what is needed to excite people about opportunities in the Reserve.  That is a clear recommendation of the commission's report.  In fact, there is a whole chapter on it.  We need to set about addressing this issue.  The report also recommends a reserve for the Air Corps.  We would then have reserves in the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps so there would be a presence in Haulbowline, Baldonnel and the Curragh.</p><p> I do not want to sugarcoat the problems.  The numbers are way too low and have been falling in recent years.  They are not falling dramatically but they are steadily falling from a low base and that is not good.  It is not good for morale, retention or recruitment.  It is possible to dramatically increase the numbers coming into the Reserve with the right approach.  Deputy Berry said we should be more proactive and should give preferential treatment to people who choose to leave the Defence Forces and allow them the option of staying connected to the Defence Forces by being part of the Reserve.  That is already happening in some cases but we could be more proactive on that.  It is one of a series of things we need to do to invest in the Reserve.  My conversations with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, in the last number of months have been very positive and constructive.  We need to work in partnership with it on this issue.</p><p> Deputy Stanton asked about the allowances and the fact that the Estimate is lower than the outturn from last year.  The Estimate is for &euro;48 million.  In 2020 there was an outturn of just under &euro;46.5 million and there was an outturn last year of nearly &euro;52 million.  The reason the allowances for last year are so much higher is that there were a lot of extra Covid duties and extra allowances linked to overtime and so on.  Last year was an extraordinary year for the Defence Forces due to the extra duties and so on.  That is the explanation for that.  If the Estimate is proven wrong this year or we have a new crisis that requires significant extra Defence Forces input, we will revise that figure, but hopefully we have had enough of that.  We will have to wait and see.</p><p> Deputy Lawless has gone but he raised the issue of pay.  Each year, our Estimate is calculated on the basis of the establishment number and not on the number of people in the Defence Forces.  We are the only Department, of which I am aware, that has a deal with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this.  Every year we get enough pay for a full complement of the Defence Forces and if that pay is not spent, which it will not be if we are 1,000 people short, we can then transfer that unspent money into other expenditure across the Defence Forces.  Normally that goes into capital expenditure but not always.  There may be other issues as well.  That has been the practice for the last number of years.  I have made it very clear to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that when the number gets back up to the establishment of 9,500, we will need a corresponding increase in the overall budget.  At the moment we are benefiting from that unspent pay money in other areas and it is in many ways supplementing expenditure in those areas that would not be available if we got back up to 9,500.  However, it will take us some time to get there.  I have flagged that with regard to future budgets.</p><p> Deputy Berry had a number of questions and comments.  He noted that 19% of Defence Forces members have served overseas.  As the Deputy will know, serving overseas is a central part of being a member of the Irish Defence Forces.  People are trained and equipped for that and plan for it.  It is a huge part of what we do, unlike in many other countries where the priority is often core defence of a state, either along a border or dealing with threats, perceived threats and so on.  Our structures are built around peacekeeping service overseas and peace interventions.  In the future, some of those interventions will become more complex.  We are going to look at doing more chapter VII missions, which will require more complex training, more advanced equipment and better armour.  That has a price tag but that is where we need to be.</p><p> I take the point that one in five members of the Defence Forces being overseas for six months of the year, or a decent portion of the year, puts pressures on the system.  There is a lot of talk about the Naval Service.  There was also a lot of talk about problems in the Air Corps because pilots were being lost to the private sector and we had to introduce schemes to get them back.  However, there is not enough talk about the pressure on the Army, particularly linked to service overseas.  It is short of numbers too.  We need to make sure our service overseas is tailored to the resources we have available to us.  For example, we have some decisions to make in the months ahead because French forces are pulling out of Mali.  France has a huge contingent there.  Whether that changes the risk profile of that training mission and the UN mission is a matter we are assessing carefully at the moment.  We got a renewed mandate for a continuation of that training mission for another 12 months from Cabinet just in the last few days.  We will continue to assess that through the summer as France moves out of a country that has, unfortunately, become more volatile and less democratic.  We will take all that into account.</p><p> The memorandum of understanding on defence with the UK was signed a number of years ago with the UK's Secretary of State for Defence.  It was predominantly about procurement and training.  Nothing about defence policy was part of that.  It was more a practical memorandum of understanding for sharing knowledge, procurement systems and so on.  I do not know whether I can share it but I will take a look at it.</p><p>Some of the memos are confidential and some are not.  If it is not confidential, I will have no issue with sharing it.</p><p> Regarding staff numbers in the Department versus the Defence Forces, it is important to say that, because we have had pressures in the Defence Forces in terms of recruitment, retention and being under strength, it does not mean that there should be a corresponding loss of numbers in the Department of Defence.  One is not contingent on the other.  We need a Department that is well resourced and is doing the job that is asked of it, and that is what the Department of Defence is doing.  We have a significant issue to deal with in terms of recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces and we need a well-resourced Department to help us do that.  I do not believe that those comparisons are comparing like with like and that, if the Defence Forces are under pressure, it is all of a sudden not balanced if the Department is not under pressure as well.  I know the Deputy is not suggesting that, but there has not been a significant increase in staffing numbers in the Department.  We could well make a strong case for increased numbers in our Department, given the work that will be involved in bringing about transformational change and growth in the defence sector on the back of the commission's report.  I take the Deputy's point, but the two organisations have different roles to play.</p><p> A number of personnel in the Department work in specialist areas of the Defence Forces.  Even without the commission's report, we should not underestimate the civil-military partnership that is necessary to deliver the change that is needed in the Defence Forces, be that cultural change and modernisation or our work on gender issues linked to that culture.  We have a very busy Department and it is not going to get less busy any time soon.</p><p> This brings me on to the matter of the number of women in the Defence Forces.  When we put the White Paper together in 2015, we set a target of, if I remember correctly, approximately 12%.  Currently, we are at 7%, or essentially half of where we need to be.  I will provide the actual numbers on female strength.  In 2016, the figure was 2.6%, although the inducted figure was 7.8%.  In 2017, the figure was 6.5%.  In 2018, it was 6.7%.  In 2019, it was 6.9%.  In 2020, it was 7%.  There has been a gradual, but slow, increase year after year.  Of those we are inducting into the Defence Forces, between 7% and 8% are women.  According to the challenge that has been put to us by the commission, that figure needs to be more than 30%, so one third of people entering the Defence Forces should be women.  There are few, if any, countries in the world that are achieving those numbers, but we have to set ourselves a target.  It will take us time to get into the double figures and move on from there, but the Defence Forces will be made a more attractive career option for women through a combination of better HR management; expertise from outside the Defence Forces contributing to HR management and transformation in the Defence Forces, which was a recommended structural change as part of a new defence headquarters with a chief of defence, or CHOD, and a non-military HR head of transformation reporting into that office at a senior level; and multiple recommendations on bringing about cultural change, introducing much more family-friendly practices within the Defence Forces and ensuring that there is more transparency and clarity around promotion opportunities and a complete zero-tolerance approach towards discrimination and bullying, whether it is based on gender or other factors.  Making it a more attractive career option for women is badly needed because the contribution they can make to the Defence Forces more broadly will be considerable if we can change those numbers.  This applies across the service, including the Reserve.</p><p> The report does not pull its punches in terms of the gender issues in the Defence Forces.  It is my intention, and that of my Secretary General, the Chief of Staff and our teams, to deliver significant change in this regard.  The role that the Women of Honour and others have played in exposing the unacceptable nature of the treatment and experience of some women in the Defence Forces will bring about significant change.  I am determined that that will be the case.</p></speech>

I will provide the numbers.  A key ongoing challenge for the Reserve Defence Force is to recruit and retain personnel.  As of the end of last year, its effective strength was 1,489.  The Army Reserve's strength was 1,373 and the Naval Service Reserve's strength was 116.  The strength of the First Line Reserve was 271.  There are 199 effective female personnel serving in the Reserve &ndash; 178 in the Army Reserve and 21 in the Naval Service Reserve.</p> <p>  We have spoken about this issue previously.  If we are successfully going to include reservists in overseas missions, it will impose on their careers and work at home.  I have given a commitment to consult employer groups.  I do not believe that the way to do this is to go straight to legislation.  We want co-operation.  Otherwise, we will have employers looking for ways of avoiding the problems and inconvenience of losing workers for months at a time.  I would like to approach this by trying to get the buy-in of employers.  If we have to back that up with legislation, we will look at doing so.</p></speech>

I welcome the allocation of &euro;45 million but everybody here knows that most of the facilities across the country were built by the British and they are crumbling.  There is a lot of talk of increasing the Defence Vote in October but some people are pushing back on that because they think the money will be spent on warmongering equipment.  The reality is it will be spent on people and premises.  That is the key point I want to get across.  We need a multimillion investment in premises and that is where the vast majority of the increase will go.  I welcome this increase but plenty more is required.</p></speech>

In regard to subhead A14, on uniforms, clothing, equipment and catering, PDFORRA recently said that the current rations are not sustainable given the rise in food costs.  Will he comment on that?  Subhead A15, communications and IT, provides for the purchase and maintenance of Defence Forces computers, signalling and office equipment.  Given the changing nature of the role of the Defence Forces in national cybersecurity, does the Minister believe that allocation is sufficient?  We have seen the impact of the attack on the HSE.  Regarding subhead A18, the increase in litigation would indicate there is a rising challenge in terms of court cases.  It is surprising not to see a corresponding increase in medical and healthcare support provision under this subhead.  Will he also comment on that?

This highlighted many of the deficiencies that have been widely articulated over a considerable period, including in respect of our primary radar capability and our ability to monitor subsea activities.  Given the proximity of highly sensitive data cables between Europe and America, we have been badly exposed.  Much of what has been identified as lacking, including our primary radar capability, was highlighted in the White Paper in 2015.  Unfortunately, there is nothing in this Estimate in terms of building up that capacity.  There are major security concerns stemming from the grotesque invasion of Ukraine by Russia and our ability to defend our neutrality in terms of our responsibilities to police our air and waters and the other areas I mentioned.  The Minister will say the Commission on the Defence Forces has identified what needs to be done but the White Paper also identified measures that needed to be taken, such as those relating to primary radar capability.  There is no provision here for any of that.  Will he comment broadly in this regard?</p> <p>  On subhead A15, Defence Forces built infrastructure, construction and maintenance, this committee has embarked on a number of barracks visits, including to Haulbowline, most recently, and the Curragh.  While it is welcome to see some capital investment in infrastructure in both locations, it was very evident from our visits that a greater level of investment is required into the future.  I am acutely aware of the five-year capital plan but there is no provision in this regard in the plan.  The derelict houses that would previously have been used as married quarters are very visible to anyone driving through the Curragh.  When I was there, I asked what the intention is for those houses that are lying vacant.  We talk about the need to increase the number of women in the Defence Forces, with a high target of 30% rightly set by the commission.  What is the plan by the Department and the Minister for the houses in the Curragh?  In the midst of a housing crisis, it is crazy for them to be left vacant.  Leaving that aside, there is all this talk of making the Defence Forces more family-friendly.  Does the Minister not see a role for those houses in that regard?  Female members of the Defence Forces have to travel to the Curragh for specific training and be away from young children.  Does he not see a role for those houses to be brought back into use to facilitate women in those circumstances?  I do not see any plan for their use.  Something could be developed along those lines to make the organisation more family-friendly.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, touched on the issue of rations, which was highlighted earlier in the year by PDFORRA.  I understand the current ration is &euro;4.20 a day to feed members of the Defence Forces.  In 2010, it was &euro;4.80, at which point it was cut to &euro;4.20.  Twelve years later, notwithstanding the rate of inflation and everything else, that rate has stayed static and is out of line with other sectors of the public service.  Is this issue being looked at and what is being done to address it?  Does the Minister consider such a rate to be sustainable and right?  For overseas deployment, the ration is something in the region of &euro;6.  Members of the Defence Forces have to go overseas to be better fed.  There is a serious issue in this regard and it is one that has been highlighted.  I want to hear whether it is being looked at with a view to increasing the ration.  If I am reading the document correctly, the Estimate proposes a 4% decrease in the allocation for this.</p></speech>

The primary role of the Defence Forces with regard to cybersecurity relates to the Defence Forces and the security of its networks and systems.  The Defence Forces and the Department of Defence work with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on an ongoing basis on the delivery of measures to improve the cybersecurity of the State.  The Defence Forces provide support to the National Cyber Security Centre and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in line with the programme for Government commitment to implement the national cybersecurity strategy.  I assure members that my Department and the Defence Forces implement a programme of continuous review in respect of ICT security to keep up to date with current threat levels.  We also have a member of the Defence Forces in the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre in Tallinn in Estonia, which is probably the leading organisation in the EU on it.</p> <p>  The commission report references cybersecurity a great deal.  The report contains a large number of recommendations relating to cybersecurity, and the Government will now consider the future development of the Defence Forces in light of that report.  Members of the Defence Forces and officials from the Department of Defence are actively involved in the implementation of the national cybersecurity strategy.  This includes work to develop and update detailed risk assessment of the current vulnerability of all critical national infrastructure.  The response to cyber threats is a whole-of-government challenge, with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications taking the lead role.  From an operational perspective, it would be inappropriate to comment on the cyber capability of the Defence Forces other than to say there is ongoing development of cyber capabilities in the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  Members are right to raise the issue because we know there is a significant cyber risk to Ireland.  We had a very significant cyberattack on our health systems and the HSE in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic that put many patients at risk and cost the Government a considerable amount of money to fix.  Neutrality does not mean we are safe.  There are both state and non-state actors that want to interfere with our systems.</p> <p>  In terms of built infrastructure, it is one of the big increases in expenditure in these Estimates.  There is a significant increase in the built infrastructure.  I will give the committee a sense of the significant projects that were completed during 2021, and we will build beyond that.  There was construction of two new gymnasia at Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick and Stephens Barracks in Kilkenny at a combined cost of &euro;6.2 million.  Provision of a new electric target range at The Curragh was &euro;2.1 million.  There was a no danger area, NDA, range at Gormanston, a personnel support service resource centre in Collins Barracks in Cork, which I opened, and replacement of standby generators at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  There is a series of built infrastructure upgrades.  Deputy Berry is right.  We operate out of barracks that were put in place in a different era.  Many of the buildings are historical and substantial, but they have to be upgraded and modernised from an energy point of view and from a quality of life and quality of work perspective.</p> <p>  There is far too much dereliction in The Curragh.  People talk about that, but we have to prioritise the capital spend we have available.  Everyone who is calling for more expenditure might tell me what projects they want me to drop and not proceed with.  We cannot deal with the dereliction overnight.  We can do it in a phased way as we increase our budgets, which we are doing with our capital budget.  We are spending the highest capital budget this year since before the crash in 2008.  I hope to be able to continue to increase that expenditure.  There is significant work to be done in The Curragh, Haulbowline and in other barracks.  Much of that is on a multi-annual investment programme, which I am happy to share with colleagues.</p> <p>  Regarding the radar issue, the White Paper recommends we look at that, resources permitting.  It has been a question of prioritisation.  It is easy to do everything if one has a limitless budget, which we do not have.  We have an increasing budget every year and I hope that will continue.  We will make recommendations regarding radar facilities in the context of experience, the commission report and the White Paper, but it is resource contingent.  That is why we need to spend more money on defence.  When Members stand up in the D&aacute;il or Seanad and say we should not be investing in weaponry and defence systems because somehow that is a militarisation of Ireland, it is not.  It is about ensuring our Defence Forces are operating in the right training environments and have the right equipment and training systems to be able to perform their role on land, at sea and in the air.  In my view, that requires significantly more investment on both the capital and current sides.  It is up to me to try to get that response from the Government, it is hoped before the summer break, in terms of the response to the commission report.  We have a very strong evidence base now to back that up.</p> <p>  Also, the Deputy spoke about lessons learned in the context of a potential Russian naval exercise.  It was not in Irish waters, actually, but in international waters that Ireland has responsibility for monitoring and observing.  We need to be honest with ourselves.  We could quadruple our defence budget and not have the defence capacity to repel a Russian naval fleet wanting to come into our waters.  Let us get into the real world here.  At present, what we are being asked to do by a commission report is to improve capacity in multiple areas.  It recommends we should consider moving beyond that but accepts this will take a lot more time in the context of issues such as fighter jets and so forth, which some people seem to think is pie in the sky.  The truth is that Ireland's capacity in conventional defence is quite limited.  We need to have a much better understanding in terms of information and observation in both the air and sea and we need to invest accordingly.  I hope we will.</p> <p>  What the commission is asking us to do when comparing Ireland with other peer group countries of similar size, wealth and defence perspectives is to move from spending a third of what they spend on average per year to spending a half of what they spend relative to GDP.  We have to put that into context, particularly in the context of what we are seeing now in Ukraine.  Very fundamental questions must be asked with regard to security, stability, our place in the European Union and what contribution we can make towards protecting our way of life, which we have been a part of building in the European Union, given the threats we are seeing to the east at present.  That will be a discussion that will also be part of the consideration of the commission's report.</p></speech>

Average annual expenditure in this area in the three years of 2019 to 2021 has been &euro;3.2 million.</p><p>The current daily ration rate is &euro;4.20.  This rate is reviewed periodically to counter inflation impacts.  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, has put framework contract arrangements in place for major food procurement for the Defence Forces and other public service bodies to try to guarantee value for money.  The military authorities have advised the daily ration rate will be reviewed, having regard to the retendering of the OGP food contracts, a process that is under way.  PDFORRA has raised the matter and its views will be taken into account in that regard.  Of course soldiers need to be well fed, given the role they need to play.  The review will take that into account.</p><p> On the issue of houses at the Curragh, we did make a policy decision several years ago to move away from residential quarters, if one likes, or married quarters on or in barracks.  There are no plans to change that policy.  The commission did not propose change in that respect.  I am told the houses to which the Deputy is referring are not habitable.  They are run down and quite derelict and would need to be significantly upgraded if we were to allow people to live there.  That is not the plan at the moment.</p></speech>

These have been comprehensive replies.  I am conscious that we have gone as far as subhead A18.  I propose to proceed now from subhead A19, to include the balance of issues under Vote 36.  We have had policy issues and direct questions that have been dealt with.  I call Deputy Stanton, to be followed by Deputies Berry and Brady, to address any outstanding issues relating to the remainder of Vote 36.</p></speech>

I am searching for the recruitment budget, which is important.  I see funding for advertising is mentioned under miscellaneous expenditure, with a figure of &euro;450,000.  Does that cover recruitment or is recruitment provided for elsewhere?  I refer to the figure of &euro;450,000 under A22, relating to miscellaneous expenditure and advertising.  That is all I can find that might relate to recruitment.  As recruitment and retention is such a significant issue, I ask the Minister to let us know what is being expended in that regard and how it is being expended.</p> <p>  On the issue of recruitment, I refer to the cost of the aptitude tests recruits have to undertake.  I also understand quite a number of people fall at that hurdle, which gives me pause for thought as to whether they are appropriate in the first place.</p> <p>  Subhead A25 relates to the Irish Red Cross and the funding it receives.  I assume that if the Red Cross is expanding its role now as it is being called on to do far more in the context of the Ukraine crisis and so forth, it will be getting funding from other Departments to give it the wherewithal to do that work.  Could it rely on the undoubted experience and abilities of the Defence Forces with regard to logistics and so on?  A significant number of people are coming into Ireland in a very short period.  The Chairman and I know from our previous jobs the challenges of dealing with people coming in who may have trauma, language skill issues, accommodation needs, health issues and so on.  I put it to the Minister that the Defence Forces have a significant amount to offer there in terms of logistics.</p> <p>  Those are my questions for the Minister.  I have to leave the meeting soon because I am half an hour late for another meeting.</p></speech>

I was surprised by that.  I could be completely wrong, but normally when money goes to Europe it comes from the Department of the Taoiseach.  I seek clarification on that money having come from the defence budget.  I agree that an additional &euro;9.5 million for the European peace facility was announced by the Taoiseach approximately ten days ago.  Will that additional &euro;9.5 million come from a separate budget or is it coming from the Defence Forces Vote?</p></speech>

Rather than just providing money, can we directly provide non-lethal equipment to the Ukrainians, who are in desperate need at the moment?  Has any final decision been made on - I will not say lethal equipment - protective and defensive anti-armour weapons?</p> <p>  I am hearing that money was handed back to the central Exchequer last year.  I am looking for confirmation on that.  I am hearing the figure may be approximately &euro;29 million.</p></speech>

I am concerned because 12 months were spent - I will not say that time was wasted because it was not - waiting for the report of the commission.  If the budget for the 2023 financial year will not be announced until October, could we not get that &euro;23 million back and start implementing the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces as soon as possible?</p></speech>

I am conscious of that because it is a fantastic organisation that does exceptional work across the State.  It looks to me like the funding proposed for this year involves a cut of in the region of half a million euro.  I might be wrong in that regard.  The 2021 Estimate was &euro;5.64 million; this year it is &euro;5.14 million.  I ask the Minister to explain that in the first instance.  I ask the Minister to provide a general overview of the Civil Defence - Towards 2030 implementation plan.  Where are we in the context of that plan?  What is being achieved?  What else needs to be achieved?</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Stanton regarding the Irish Red Cross and its needs in these exceptional times.  I welcome the funding that has been provided.  I question whether more can be given.  I believe more should be given.</p> <p>  My last question relates to section B and the appropriations-in-aid.  I refer to land and premises and the section that deals with sales.  I am conscious that, for example, in my constituency of Wicklow, and in Bray in particular, land held by the Department at Rockbrae House, which was formerly used by the 21st Infantry Battalion of the Reserve Defence Force, has been identified as surplus to requirements and a process is in place to transfer it to Wicklow County Council for the construction of housing, which is to be welcomed.  There seems to be an increase in provision of money from the sale of land and premises held by the Department.  I ask the Minister to provide detail in that regard.  What are the exact numbers?  What is being considered?  What land or premises is in the process of being transferred?  What is the nature of it.  There has been a significant amount of controversy, and rightfully so, in respect of Cathal Brugha Barracks.</p><p>I know a process has been put in place with regard to the barracks.  I just hope that is not figured somewhere in that section.  Will someone categorically-----</p></speech>

We are going through a process that is appropriate and necessary but, certainly, my responsibility is to the Defence Forces.  More than 1,000 people serve in Cathal Brugha Barracks.  It is a considerably significant military installation in the heart of Dublin city.  We are assessing that, but there are no preconceived outcomes or anything like that.  As far as I am concerned, it is a very important part of our military infrastructure.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked about the figure with regard to land and premises sales.  The figure is &euro;200,000.  It is relatively small in the bigger scheme of things.  There are no big sales there.  That is for sure.</p> <p>  Things are happening in terms of defence infrastructure, such as St. Bricin's medical facility in Dublin 7.  The Deputy knows where that is.  It is in a very strategic location in Dublin.  The Land Development Agency is very interested in acquiring that.  We will build a new medical facility in Baldonnel which is funded and will move ahead this year.  I have made it very clear that we can only close one facility if we build a new modern facility.  However, the St. Bricin's site can make a valuable contribution from a housing perspective.  It is in a strategic location.</p> <p>  The Department has also had proactive engagement with the LDA following its interest in Collins Barracks in Mullingar for the development of housing.  These facilities are not being used any longer by the Defence Forces.  We look to strategically work with another arm of the State to ensure we can make a contribution from a housing perspective.  I reassure the Deputy of that.</p> <p>  Since 2019, the Department of Defence has been provided with &euro;3.6 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  In 2019, Civil Defence was allocated &euro;500,000 which was used to procure 16 4x4 passenger vehicles.  In 2020, Civil Defence was allocated funding of &euro;1 million to upgrade its fleet.  In 2020, it was allocated another &euro;1 million.  The Army veterans associations were also allocated total funding of &euro;300,000.  Sail Training Ireland was allocated &euro;50,000.</p> <p>  This year, Civil Defence has been allocated &euro;500,000 to upgrade its fleet again.  The Army veterans associations have been allocated another &euro;200,00 in funding.  That is the Dormant Accounts Fund element which is, essentially, capital injections on top of the money that we also allocate to Civil Defence.</p> <p>  I will move on to Deputy Berry's questions.  First, I was quite involved in the design of the European peace facility because I wanted Ireland to be part of it.  I did not want to be outside of that.  Ireland, Austria and Malta have a particular perspective here that we want to contribute to a European peace facility in which the EU can effectively pool its resources to make an intervention in a part of the world and that can respond to conflict or instability in a way that promotes peace and so on.</p> <p>  However, there are two funds within the peace facility.  One can fund lethal weapons and the other can fund other elements of the project that are not lethal weapons but can be helmets, gloves, fuel, medical kits, defensive vests and such.  The same project can be funded by two funds: one for lethal weapons and the other for non-lethal weapons.</p> <p>  When we designed the European peace facility, we never envisaged that it would be deployed in the heart of Europe in response to an illegal war on Ukraine by Russia.  That has now been used as the tool to fund and support the Ukrainian military in an effort to defend itself.  It is a &euro;500 million fund.  Some &euro;450 million of that is focused on lethal weapons and &euro;50 million of it is focused on other equally important and necessary but non-lethal weaponry.</p> <p>  We contribute our full amount as a percentage of the &euro;500 million.  Some 1.9% is the allocation key, which is between &euro;9 million and &euro;10 million.  This is the same as every other country but we focus our financial contribution on non-lethal weaponry, or the &euro;50 million element of the fund.  In percentage terms, we make the same contribution as any other country.</p> <p>  We are also looking at what contribution we can make in terms of actual stores of equipment.  I have heard Deputy Berry call on me to look at providing Javelin anti-tank weaponry and so on.  We have decided not to provide lethal weaponry but, even if we did, we do not have excess stockpiles of Javelins.  I have looked at the infantry of equipment and asked for a report on that.</p> <p>  While it is true we have some, we also have a training use and obligations in terms of equipment linked to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and so on.  There is not a large stockpile of excess equipment that we could share, even if we wanted to.  We have also looked at defensive equipment such as helmets, vests and so on.  There are some limited excess stocks.</p> <p>  One of the areas we have extra stocks is in food parcels that would be very useful for soldiers in the field.  We are looking at stocks we can share.  However, most of our contribution will be financial to efficiently purchase equipment and stocks and get them in to Ukraine, as quickly as we can, in order that young men and women who sign up and join can get defensive equipment to protect themselves in the context of the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>  We are making a full contribution but it is important that people understand we have looked at all the options in terms of what is available and what is not.  We are acting on the basis of providing as much product, as quickly as we can, using the efficient channels that are open to us to get product into people who need it in Ukraine.</p> <p>  In terms of the &euro;23 million underspend, as it happens, a number of Departments had underspends last year.  Some of that is linked to Covid.  From our perspective, much of the building work that was due to move ahead last year was significantly behind schedule.  We simply were not able to go on site for a significant portion of the year because of Covid restrictions.  That stalled things.</p> <p>  We also tried to spend the majority of that money on procurement of equipment on which we expected to be able to sign off in December but will not be able to sign off until this month.</p><p>That was unfortunate because I certainly would have liked to have spent all of the money available to us last year.  We cannot carry that money over because that is not the way the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform works.  The conversation on how we should respond to the commission in respect of increased resourcing will need to take place in the context of the recommendations I will bring to the Government in June.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, will be central to those resourcing conversations because we cannot facilitate the level of ambition on structural and cultural change and increased resourcing contained in the commission report without an all-of-government commitment from the three party leaders and, of course, from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  All of that money has to deliver an outcome and must represent value for money because the availability of money is finite.  We are competing with many other Departments which are also making claims from the national Exchequer.  We have a very strong evidence base now from the commission report to make progress in this area.</p></speech>

This Bill was published back in 2018.  It is an ambition of my party's and mine that the excessive charges that are being applied by moneylenders to, in some regards, very vulnerable people are dealt with.  We should not be allowing the type of rates that are applying.  While we have had support at different levels, including on Second Stage, there is a clear kind of cat-and-mouse game, which I think is disappointing for the body politic, because sometimes this committee works well.  We have a piece of legislation that was published four years ago, it comes to Committee Stage and, just like that, we have the Government then publishing its own piece of legislation and taking it to Second Stage before this week is out.  That is disappointing because we hear sometimes that we all work together and all of this, but it does not always work like that, at least when it comes to a Bill that we have produced.  It is not the first time.  We have seen the same with the lobbying Bill and we have seen it with other pieces of legislation.  That being said, I am very grateful to all of the people and, particularly, our witnesses, who contributed during pre-legislative scrutiny to this piece of legislation, which has improved and shaped the amendments that we put forward.  I note that some of the issues that were discussed in relation to my Bill in pre-legislative scrutiny have found their way into the Government&rsquo;s Bill.  As we go through the amendments, we will come to those in time.</p></speech>

Section 93 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 is amended, in subsection (10), by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (g): <blockquote> 	&ldquo;(g) in the Bank&rsquo;s opinion, the cost of credit is usurious, excessively high or any of the terms or conditions attaching thereto are unfair, or&rdquo;. </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 1 is a definitional amendment.  It amends the definition by which the Central Bank may refuse to grant a moneylender's licence under subsection 10(g) of section 93 from the existing text, which is: &quot;the cost of credit to be charged is excessive or any of the terms or conditions attaching thereto are unfair&quot; to the new text that this amendment proposes: &quot;the cost of credit is usurious, excessively high or any of the terms or conditions attaching thereto are unfair&quot;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022030900002#B00100"><p>Amendment No. 1 proposes to amend section 93 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, which deals with the granting of moneylending licences by the Central Bank.  It replaces &quot;the cost of credit to be charged being excessive&quot; with &quot;the cost of credit being usurious or excessively high&quot;, terms which are then defined under amendment No. 3.</p><p>I oppose amendment No. 1 first on the basis that, taken on its own, it does not add any value to the Act of 1995.  I have a note that combines this amendment with amendment No. 3 and if the Vice Chairman is happy to do it, I can deal with amendments Nos. 1 and 3 together because they are connected.  When taken with amendment No. 3, I must oppose amendment No. 1 on the basis that it does not represent the most effective way to cap the interest charged on moneylending loans.  I do not say this to be obstructive but because officials in the Department of Finance considered this approach of tying the cap to the licensing framework, and this method was included in the general scheme of that Bill last July.  Essentially, the Government's approach last July was similar.  However, in the meantime, and with the benefit of the involvement of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the drafting, the Government Bill published recently refined its approach. </p><p>Section 93(10) provides for the grounds for refusal to grant a licence only and it would therefore have no effect once a licence has been granted.  The rates proposed to be charged in the licensing process must accord with the caps under the Government Bill, but it also goes much further.  The Government Bill now makes the cap a standalone requirement in respect of each loan offered, as opposed to the original licence application, and it makes it an offence for a moneylender to provide a loan above that rate.  This is more straightforward and meaningful for individual customers as it is a requirement in respect of each loan and not a general matter considered with regard to the licensing process. </p><p>From the consumer's perspective - many of these people are vulnerable people who have had to borrow in a difficult position - in dealing with the loan and asking people with an issue to go back to how a licence was granted to the institution in question is very complex and it would be a very difficult process.  We are linking the interest rate to each individual loan, saying that under the licence it would be an offence to charge above the rate in respect of that loan.</p><p>The setting of the numerical values of the rates in subsections (1) and (2) is also at odds with the power of the Minister to adjust the rates by regulation under subsection (7).  We also consider this significant as asking the Minister to adjust rates by regulation would not conform with original numerical values set in primary legislation.  There could be a difficulty if regulations were not in exact conformity with primary legislation.  Again, I say this as the Government's drafting process has benefited from engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and there is a risk that the method proposed by the Deputy would constitute an amendment of primary legislation by way of secondary legislation, which would be <i>ultra vires</i>the authority of the Minister under secondary legislation.  We have had the benefit over recent months of refining and examining what we think is the most legally sound basis to deal with the matter.</p><p>With regard to the level of the rates themselves, while lower interest rates are of course the preference for consumers, there is a need for balance in setting the ceilings to ensure consumers do not face the difficulty of having to go without credit where providers leave the market either suddenly or en masse.  We have had some withdrawals from the market.  The moneylending industry remains an important source of credit for a significant number of people.  The rates proposed for the first three years and the period thereafter set a rigid approach, which presupposes the level of reduction that the market can take in three years' time without any analysis and which would require primary legislation to amend in any event.</p><p>The Government Bill, in contrast, sets ceilings above which the cap can be set and provides for the Minister to have regard to a number of principles and policies set down in the primary legislation when making regulations to set the specific caps.  This provides more flexibility to amend the caps in response to relevant policy factors while ensuring that the rate can never be set at such a level as to make it an artificial cap.  The Government Bill also incorporates the consultation with the Central Bank which the Deputy and the committee favours.</p><p>The legislation passed Second Stage in December 2018 and in May 2021 there was a consultation process.  In June 2021, Deputy Doherty made a submission to the committee outlining that he would move away from the annual percentage rate cap to an index cap on the total cost of credit over a timeframe of three years.  In November the Oireachtas committee published a report of detailed scrutiny of the Bill.  Deputy Doherty has proposed amendments to the Bill to cap interest rates, including a similar calculation method but at a lower level than what the Government is proposing.  His method of implementing the cap does not make it an offence to offer credit above the rate and it links to the licensing process rather than the individual loans.  It is one of the key issues and it is something we want in the separate legislation that has been published and will be discussed in the D&aacute;il separately later today.  We will deal with the interest charged on loans during the lifetime of a licence rather than referring back to the licence.  People should be able to understand the interest rate they are being charged on a loan but asking people to go back and check the licence as issued by the Central Bank several years earlier, and them trying to work it out on that basis, would be very difficult for many people.</p><p>I commend the Deputy on raising this matter and there is consensus in dealing with this but because of the passage of time we have had the advantage of input from the Parliamentary Counsel, scrutiny provided by the Oireachtas and the involvement of the Central Bank and Attorney General.  It is about improving what is a very important issue and everybody agrees with the principle of what the Deputy is proposing.  We hold the view that enhanced legislation published by the Government is more comprehensive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022030900002#B00200"><p>The Minister of State has spoken to amendment No. 3 so I will make the following point.  If the Government was willing to work with me as the sponsor of this legislation over the past four years, there would have been a different approach.  A contracts Bill was passed unanimously by the Houses of the Oireachtas and I was a sponsor of that, and there was also legislation relating to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, which saw real engagement.  Through all the process, and even when the Government put forward its proposals, we offered amendments to try to sharpen the legislation.  Often, these are rejected but on a number of occasions amendments have been accepted or the Minister has agreed to sharpen the legislation as a result on Report Stage.  That approach was not taken by the Government with this legislation and the Government is more interested in having its moneylender Bill.</p> <p>  That said, I do not give a damn whose stamp is on the legislation at the end of the day.  The Minister of State speaks of dealing with drafting issues and the benefit of the Attorney General or other advices, which we do not have.  As an Opposition party, we nonetheless expect the process evident in two other pieces of legislation that have been enacted would be seen here.  Unfortunately, that did not happen over four years with this legislation.</p> <p>  That said, outside the drafting issues there is a core issue in the Government's Bill, which is that it does not do enough.  It barely scratches the surface on the question of moneylending.  The Minister of State mentioned that people would not have credit and all the rest.  The largest moneylender in this country left the State, as it had hundreds of thousands of customers and many of them were intergenerational.  What did the Government do to create awareness in those consumers about where they could get credit?  Point me to one initiative or press release.  Point me to anything the Government did.</p></speech>

One loss is significant because it was a substantial company but there are still 100 different registered products out there and available to people outside of those offered by the company that has left.  It is important to point that out.  We want to ensure the majority of the companies lending here to continue, although some might leave after we introduce a cap that is not there now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1204" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022030900002#C00100"><p>That sums up the Government's approach, which was not to do anything because there was another hundred licensed moneylenders in the market.  Many of them are unique and catalogue operators and not lenders that provide loans to cover the communion or birthday party costs.  I am glad the officials are starting to brief the Minister of State on this big issue.  The Government did not do anything on this.  It should have introduced an initiative to encourage the customers of that largest moneylender in the State to go to the credit union where they could get lower cost loans at a fraction of the cost charged by the moneylenders.  That has not happened.  The Government took a hands-off approach in that regard.</p> <p>  As amendment No. 3 is being discussed with amendment No. 1, amendment No. 3 proposes to delete section 103 of the principal Act, which sets out collection charges, which would be abolished under amendment No. 2, if they were to be administered.  That is what the original section provided.  The proposed new section 103 would provide for a cap on the rate of interest moneylenders are permitted to charge.  The interest rate cap would be based on simple interest with an initial cap which would then be reduced further after a period of three years.  It would also separate cash loans from loans provided on a running account.  The new interest rate cap as it applies to cash loans would be as follows: a simple interest rate of no more than 0.75% per week up to a maximum of 36% per annum for a period of three years, which is the initial cap in the proposed amendment.  It is proposed there would a simple interest rate of no more than 0.35% per week, which is a reduced rate, up to a maximum of 18% per annum after a period of three years.  That would be the secondary reduced cap.</p> <p>  The impact of this cap for borrowers with reference to a &euro;1,000 cash loan over a 12-month term by a credit union compared with the largest moneylender in the State, which the Government should have done something about when Provident pulled out of the market, would be that the total repayments on the loan would be &euro;1,060.  The borrower would be charged &euro;60 in interest.  A moneylender would charge the borrower &euro;1,560, which is &euro;560 in interest.  The ratio of interest charged by the moneylender compared with the credit union is nine times more.  The initial cap proposed in the amendment would be mean the &euro;560 in interest that would be charged would be reduced to &euro;360.  The ratio of interest charged compared with the credit union would be six times more, which is still an very expensive type of credit.  The secondary cap we propose would reduce the initial moneylender's interest from &euro;560 to &euro;180, bringing the ratio between what a credit union would charge compared with a moneylender after three years down to 1:3.</p> <p>  Crucially for the moneylender, the total interest payable does not include the impact of collection charges, which we deal with in amendment No. 2.  Those collection charges push up the cost of credit much further.  Therefore, this cap would slash the total cost of credit a moneylender can charge by more than one third and the further cap that would be in place after three years would slash it by more than two thirds.  That would radically reduce the cost of credit moneylenders can charge, thereby protecting consumers, many of whom are vulnerable to vicious cycles of debt, and reduce the interest they are charged.</p> <p>  Further provisions of amendment No. 3 require the Central Bank to produce a report at least every three years assessing the cost of credit in the moneylender market and to make recommendations to the Minister for Finance, where they are warranted, to protect the interests of consumers.  There is a requirement for the Central Bank to produce a report within three years.  This is about sending a very clear signal that we are reducing the cost of credit moneylenders can charge, including abolishing collection charges and, after a three-year period, that cost will reduce further.  That is what is necessary to protect people.  It is not what the Minister of State has just told the committee, namely, that if your moneylender has gone, you should go to one of the other 100 moneylenders.  That is not what we need.</p> <p>  Most of the reports that comprise studies that have been done in this sector show people who go to moneylenders can access credit from credit unions.  A large number of them also access credit from credit unions.  The issue is the convenience, the door-to-door sales, the fact the operator knows Sheila has John and Mary at home and John is about to make his first holy communion, or that people are asked on their doorstep if they are going on holidays.  The issue is the in-your-face sales because of the convenience and short-term nature of the loans, as a result of which people get trapped into a cycle of high interest rate debt.  I strongly commend amendment No. 1 to the committee.</p></speech>

One of the key elements of what we propose builds on the original legislation, the Private Members&rsquo; bill drafted some time ago.  It goes without saying that the longer the period a person has a loan from one of these moneylenders, the more interest he or she will pay over time.  One of the proposals we suggest is the loan would be restricted to 12 months.  That would reduce the amount of interest people would pay over a period of time rather than having loans with a significant high interest rate running for a period of two or three years.</p><p>Second, we believe the issue of the credit unions in this regard is vital.  I think we are all <i>ad idem</i>on that with respect to credit unions providing more unsecured loans, which they are very good at doing.  It is the biggest sector in the economy providing unsecured loans.  I will be meeting the credit union movement tomorrow to encourage it to lend more in that area given it has such a big footprint with approximately 400 branches around the country.</p><p>Up to now, many moneylenders have charged for the door-to-door collection of money.  Every time a moneylender sends somebody out to collect money, that incurs an expensive charge.  The moneylender can charge &euro;40, &euro;50 or &euro;60 for a visit.  We are banning that practice.  All the operator's costs will have to come in under the interest rate.</p><p>The views behind the Private Members' Bill are well motivated and are all in the right place, but there are significant extra items that could and should be taken into account regarding this issue and that is why the Government published its legislation.  The Government approved the heads of the Bill last year.  It is not something that has just emerged now.  Pre-legislative scrutiny of the Government's proposed legislation was carried out by this committee last October.  Having completed that process last autumn, we listed it as priority legislation on 21 January of this year.  The final text of the Bill was agreed with the Attorney General in mid-February.  It was approved by Government quite recently and has now been published.  The Second Stage debate on the Bill is scheduled for later today.</p><p>Overall, the theme behind what the Deputy and the Government are saying is similar but the Government probably has had the advantage of the extra time and extra pre-legislative scrutiny, the excellent paper produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service on the Government's proposal, and the benefit of the Attorney General, the Central Bank and the various organisations that made submissions to the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  We believe our legislation, as proposed, is the best way to move forward.</p><p>When this committee considered the detailed scrutiny of the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018, the Bill before us, some time ago, it was clear in its report when it stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Based on its consideration of the Bill, the Committee is of the opinion that there is a need to cap the interest rates which are currently being experienced by often financially vulnerable users of moneylenders.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The provisions contained in the Bill are a possible approach to affording borrowers necessary protection in this regard. </blockquote> <p>The committee went to state: &quot;The Committee therefore recommends that the Bill, if proceeded with, be amended to include a provision that caps such fees and additional charges&quot;, which is happening.  This committee was highly supportive of the Bill and of a cap but it did not come down on what that cap should be.  I have just read from the committee's report on the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  There is general agreement across the House on the introduction of a cap and the issue is the precise level of that cap  The annual percentage rate, APR, of interest was mentioned.  While that is not appropriate in this legislation, we are proposing a maximum period of 12 months for loans.</p></speech>

It is not appropriate when we are dealing with loans of a duration of fewer than 12 months, which are covered in the Bill we will be discussing later.</p><p>Some loans might only be for three months or six months, and one cannot do the equation of an annual interest rate on a loan that is not an annual loan.  Generally, and the Deputy has the same approach, that is why we are sticking with the simple rate based on the original amount, depending on whether the loan is for two months, six months or three years.  We want to limit the loans to 12 months.  That is why APR will never apply.  The Deputy agrees with what I am saying.  It will not be part of the legislation even though it is part of common currency when people talk about these matters.  On that basis, we are not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1553" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022030900002#D00200"><p>I commend Deputy Doherty on bringing forward this legislation.  It is important that the select committee appraises and considers legislation that comes from the Opposition.  I remember when I was in the Opposition not long ago I managed to get many legislative measures to the justice committee but, unfortunately, I could not always get them through that committee because we did not get a money message.  In fairness to the Government, at some stage it must have provided a money message.</p> <p>  Everybody here is agreed that the most important thing is that we get the legislation right and that rates of interest for moneylenders are applied properly and fairly.  It needs to be properly regulated and controlled.  Amendment No. 1 is proposing to amend section 93(10)(g).  Subsection (10) deals with the grounds on which the Central Bank may refuse a moneylender's licence.  It can refuse it on one or more of the grounds set out in the subsequent paragraphs.  At present, section 93(10)(g) states that in the bank's opinion the cost of credit to be charged is excessive or any of the terms and conditions attaching thereto are unfair.  Deputy Doherty's proposed amendment is that we would leave in the word "excessive" but that we would change and enlarge it by inserting that "the cost of credit is usurious, excessively high or any of the terms or conditions attaching thereto are unfair".  When I looked at this first, I wondered how a court would interpret "usurious" or "excessively high".  In fairness, Deputy Doherty has included that in section 103, but that requires us then to consider amendment No. 3.</p> <p>  My view, and I say this with respect to Deputy Doherty, is that the definition set out for "usurious" and "excessively high" is quite difficult to assess and evaluate.  In the first instance, section 103(1), paragraphs (a) and (b) set out what should be the rate of interest for the first three-year period and in subsection (2) the intention is to refer to a second three-year period but it states "no later than three years after the coming into operation of this section" that the terms shall be defined.  I interpret "no later than three years" is that it must be within the three years, so there is some overlap between subsections (1) and (2).</p> <p>  I also believe we are better off with a situation where the Central Bank can, by regulation, specify exactly the rate of interest that can be applied by moneylenders, and it should be small.  We cannot have situations where exorbitant or usurious, to use Deputy Doherty's word, rates of interest are being applied.  However, once one stitches it into legislation, it is then very difficult to change.  One must go through the process of the Houses changing the legislation whereas if the power is given by regulation to the Minister or the Central Bank in this instance, that can be changed just through statutory instrument.  My view is that we should be careful in terms of the manner by which legislation is enacted.  This will be considered at some stage by a court and lawyers will be arguing about the meaning of usurious and whether it comes within subsections (1) and (2).  I know from my experience introducing Private Members' legislation, and I am sure Deputy Doherty will accept this, that there is an advantage in having the back-up of the Department of Finance, its endless number of advisers, the Office of the Attorney General and all the apparatchiks of the State working on it.  Ultimately, political credit will be decided elsewhere, but the most important thing we have to do is to get it right and make sure the legislation is correct.  For that reason, I go along with what the Minister of State said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022030900002#D00300"><p>I thank Deputy Jim O'Callaghan for his contribution which focused on the definition of the amendment which contains the term "usurious".  He rightly pointed out that subsection (2) deals with that issue and defines it as the rates, the simple interest rate or the nominal interest rate.  He made the point then that there is the second step which has different rates and has the term "no later than three years", which would mean that the transitional arrangement would cease to exist after three years.  However, the issue of "no later than three years" raises the question of whether it could go before that.  Deputy O'Callaghan made the point about having to come back to the House to deal with this.  That is why subsection (7) is in the amendment.  It allows for the Minister to make regulations to adjust restrictions to the cost of credit to the consumer under a moneylending agreement, including those specified in subsections (1) and (2), which are the two subsections the Deputy referred to.  We have tried to deal with that there.  That allows the Minister, if he or she so wished, to change subsections (1) and (2) in terms of the rates or in terms of the period that they take effect.</p> <p>  The wider issue here is to get the legislation right, and there are ways of doing that.  As I said, I have been here and done that.  I recognise the Government has legislation now that is going to the House for Second Stage debate.  I am not a fool.  For three years when I was pursuing this legislation, that was not happening.  There was a vehicle here which we put to the Government.  The Government could amend this and do whatever is required, not tie us up with two separate sets of pre-legislative scrutiny and two sets of Committee Stage.  This is going to pass.  There is no way to stop this passing Committee Stage today.  That is the problem we are involved in.  I presume the Minister of State is going to vote it all down, but there is no final vote on Committee Stage of the Bill.  We differ significantly on the rates, but both legislative measures have similar proposals in terms of the amendments.  The Minister of State talked about collection charges, which we will come to momentarily.  The issue of collection charges, as the Minister of State recognises, emanated from the consultation that happened in respect of this legislative measure.</p> <p>  There is a big fundamental difference between this Bill and what the Government has before the House, and I am sure the Minister of State is well-briefed on the legislation he is taking before the House.  I will give an example of what my legislation would do for a borrower who borrows &euro;1,000 over a 12-year period.  The interest rate would go from &euro;560 down to &euro;360 in the first three years and down to &euro;180.  What will the Minister of State's legislation do for the same level of borrowing?</p></speech>

It amends section 102(1), which currently provides:</p> <blockquote> 	A moneylender shall not make or attempt to make an agreement with a borrower who has borrowed or intends to borrow credit from that moneylender for any sum (other than a collection charge), account of costs, charges or expenses incidental to or relating to the negotiations for, or the granting of, the loan. </blockquote> <p>Basically, the amendment takes the words &quot;other than a collection charge&quot; out of the original text.  The amendment to abolish a collection charge in moneylending agreements is made in response to concerns and recommendations of stakeholders prior to and during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill in November 2020.  For example, in their submission and opening statement during pre-legislative scrutiny, Dr. Olive McCarthy and Dr. Noreen Byrne recommended that any interest rate restriction be coupled with a limit on other fees and charge to avoid circumvention through other or higher fees and charges.  In her opening statement, Dr. McCarthy noted that although the highest rate currently being charged by moneylenders is 187% APR, collection charges can increase the cost of credit to 287% APR.  Similarly, in its opening statement during pre-legislative scrutiny the Social Finance Foundation, which has done a significant amount of work in this area, recommended that imposing a cap on interest rates charged by moneylenders be coupled with the prohibition of fees and charges.  The amendment acts on these recommendations made in November 2020 by prohibiting collection charges under a moneylending agreement.</p><p>As a footnote, I recognise the legislation brought forward by the Minister also incorporated the recommendation that arose during the scrutiny of this legislation in that Bill as published.</p></speech>

I am in agreement with the Deputy that collection charges should be prohibited.  However, from a practical and procedural point of view, I object to the changes being framed as they are here and favour the more comprehensive Government Bill which also addresses the issue and is scheduled for Second Stage this evening.  I think we are all agreed the exception in respect of collection charges should come out but the Government believes that should be done under the more comprehensive legislation that is currently on its way through the Oireachtas in parallel with this Bill.  The Deputy acknowledged we have agreed on that and it is in the Government legislation.  The Government believes it should be included in the more comprehensive legislation even though we are in complete agreement with the principle behind the amendment.  It is a question of getting it into the more comprehensive legislation that will make its way through the Oireachtas.  For that reason, I have to oppose the amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister of State continues to make the point that his Bill is more comprehensive, although I level the charge that he does not even know what his own Bill does.  In fairness to the Minister of State, when I asked him what the effect of his Bill would be on a loan of &euro;1,000, he gave the wrong figure.</p></speech>

This Bill would reduce the cost of credit for borrowers by a far more significant amount.  That is the form, however.  The Minister of State just voted down a section with which he completely agrees.  It is disappointing.  Let us be clear that the Government's Bill will reduce the cost of a loan of &euro;1,000 by &euro;80 over the period of one year, still leaving interest of &euro;480.  This amendment would reduce the figure by &euro;200 in the first three years and &euro;380 thereafter.  That is what the amendment does.  This is the real effect we need in the context of interest rate caps.  The Government has been forced into dealing with this issue.  I have been putting it on the agenda for the past four years.  I published the Bill four years ago.</p><p>The Government has refused to act on this despite the fact that so many vulnerable customers are being fleeced.  We have forced the Government, through public opinion, to produce its own legislation which is before the House.  However, the legislation does as the Government does, the bare minimum.</p><p> Even the Minister could not give recommendations to the public about shopping around.  He would not even give recommendations to the public who were in the grip of moneylenders when they withdrew from the State.  There was no advice, agenda or strategy to make sure that hundreds of thousands of people who were availing of high-cost credit, which should have warnings and all the rest attached to it, could avail of credit at a far cheaper rate, despite the fact that some of the initiatives being rolled out by the credit union are supported by the Department.</p><p> The Minister of State was of the belief that the Bill actually kept the rates at the same level that they were.  It is very disappointing that the Government is doing so little.</p></speech>

Quite simply, the persistent overcrowding crisis in our hospitals, like our record hospital waiting lists, are the direct results of an equally persistent failure, by successive Governments, to invest in bed capacity, infrastructure and medical workforce to meet the needs of a growing and ageing population, a fact which the IMO has reiterated consistently to our politicians.  When the Taoiseach was Minister for Health more than 20 years ago the bed capacity need was identified at 5,000 more inpatient beds than we currently have.  Since that time there has been little positive growth in capacity yet our population has grown by more than a million and we are now at a point of frightening waiting lists, inability to deliver timely care and too few doctors in the system.</p><p> Ireland has a growing and ageing population.  During the past ten years the population of those over the age of 65 has grown by 35% and is set to grow by a further 35% in the next decade.  While the majority of older people are living longer and healthier lives, an ageing population combined with increased rates of chronic disease and complexity of illness all place additional demands on the system.  OECD data show that in 2019 Ireland had 2.9 beds per 1,000 population compared with an OECD average of 4.4, and we were ranked among those countries that had highest occupancy rates at 90%, a figure well above internationally recognised safe occupancy rates of 85% for inpatient care.  The HSE is also suffering from a major medical workforce crisis.  One fifth of consultant posts are vacant or filled on a temporary locum basis while we require up to 2,000 additional consultants in the next five years to meet the needs of our growing population.  We continue to rely on non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, in both training and non-training posts to fill service requirements, and for whom illegal and unsafe working hours are the norm.  Last month we saw an unprecedented number of patients boarding on hospital trolleys in our emergency departments, EDs, and wards while our waiting lists for outpatient appointments, diagnostics and elective care are quickly approaching the 1 million mark.  The emergency medicine programme set out a target that 95% of patients should be either admitted or discharged within six hours of arriving at an ED.  However, the target is currently achieved for only about 60% of all patients and for 30% of those requiring admission to a bed.  </p><p> The consequences of overcrowding at these levels are dangerous for both patients and those trying to deliver care in an under-resourced environment.  Numerous Irish and international studies show that ED overcrowding is associated with increased mortality - within 30 days - and poorer outcomes for patients, whether admitted to or discharged from an overcrowded ED.  Studies have also shown that ED overcrowding is associated with delays to receiving pain relief, medication errors as well as greater hospital lengths of stay and the consequent risk of hospital acquired infection.  Delays in diagnostics, outpatient appointments and elective care can lead to poorer outcomes with patients presenting at a much more advanced stage of illness.  Overcrowding also impacts on staff with doctors across the health service experiencing high levels of stress and burnout.  </p><p> Covid-19 exposed the fragility of our health services but it did not cause it.  The absence of any surge capacity within our health system meant that non-urgent care was cancelled while staff absences, combined with requirements for infection control, reduced capacity even further.  It is important to note the policy of cancelling elective care was in place before Covid-19, as the HSE&rsquo;s full capacity protocol has been in operation in many hospitals on a 24-7 basis.  After the initial wave of Covid-19, the IMO met the Oireachtas Covid-19 committee on a number of occasions and proposed to Government a range of measures to address the deficits in our health services but despite two years of the pandemic little action has yet been taken.  Urgent and simultaneous investment is needed in a range measures to ensure a robust and resilient heath system into the future.  These measures are as follows.  We need urgent investment in acute bed capacity and infrastructure, including immediate investment in temporary modular builds.  We need to develop, finance and implement a multi-annual capital investment programme in acute bed capacity to include a minimum of 5,000 additional public acute beds.  We need investment in stand-alone public hospitals for elective care and to increase critical care capacity to 550 critical care beds.  The minimum requirements of 2,600 beds in the Health Service Capacity Review 2018 were never and will never be enough and were based on a significant expansion of capacity in general practice, community care and long-term care for the elderly, all of which has yet to happen.  We must appropriately resource diagnostic, radiology and laboratory departments to allow timely access to investigations for both hospital doctors and GPs in the community.  We need to invest in secure systems of electronic health records across health systems and community health centres.  Systems must be able to communicate and allow embedding of national summary patient records as per the 2019 GP agreement. </p><p> Immediate action must be taken to recruit and retain doctors to work in the health service, including targeted measures to address our unprecedented number of consultant vacancies.  These include the immediate reversal of the two-tier pay system for consultants and the negotiation of a new fit-for-purpose contract to attract consultants to a career in the HSE.  Successive reports and studies have demonstrated that the two-tier consultant pay issue is a major barrier to recruitment.  We need to increase the number of specialist training posts to meet future medical workforce requirements.  A 38% increase in training posts is required to meet future medical workforce requirements but there is no plan to implement this.  We need ongoing investment in the health and social care needs of older people.  That means further resourcing of rehabilitative beds, long-term community care beds and home care supports, including intensive home care packages to ensure older people do not remain in hospital longer than necessary.  We must continue to invest in the development of general practice including supports for new and established GPs to employ additional GPs, practice nurses and other support staff.  We need investment in a programme of GP care for nursing home patients that reflects the complexity of care required.  Through ongoing investment in structured chronic disease programmes, general practice can help to reduce future pressure on hospital systems.  However, general practice is not without its own capacity constraints with estimates suggesting that between 1,260 and 1,660 GPs will be required by 2028.  </p><p> Unfortunately, there is no quick fix to hospital overcrowding; without concerted investment across our health system, we will likely be discussing hospital overcrowding crisis for many years to come.  This is no longer a crisis; hospital overcrowding, long waiting lists and long ED times have become the norm and they are dangerous not only for patients but for staff.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and members for accepting our request to appear before them and organising this meeting this morning.  We set out in our written submission the issues that, unfortunately, remain a feature of the acute hospital overcrowding, which is not only occurring in emergency departments but throughout the hospitals.  We now have wards that are overcrowded, which is not a new feature and that continues to be the case.  As the committee heard, the issues facing nurses, doctors and other workers in acute hospitals are now such that they were described at a meeting we held with our members last evening as akin to whistleblowing.  They are asking this Oireachtas committee to make significant changes that are necessary in order to ensure we do not face this problem year in, year out.  As the previous speaker said, Covid-19 did not cause this problem but it most certainly has made it worse.  We now have one single workforce dealing with two different types of care delivery and, obviously, with the donning and doffing of personal protective equipment, PPE, gear, it makes the arranging of care much more laborious and the delivery of care takes longer.</p><p>Obviously, our infrastructure does not lend itself to single rooms, which means that we are constantly moving patients from location to location to ensure they can be isolated.  In any event, we have an overcrowded system and a tolerance of overcrowding that needs to be tackled.  In our submission, we have set out actions we believe the Government needs to take immediately to ensure the process of changing this broken system is begun.  We say this with a view to the welfare of patients who are attending.  Our president, Ms Karen McGowan, who is in the room with the committee today, is a working advanced nurse practitioner in one of the large acute hospitals and can give the committee first-hand evidence of patients not being treated and of conditions in our acute hospitals becoming inhumane, including having to advise patients of their treatments and give them very bad news in very public locations.  They are not afforded the dignity of privacy or of having a bed in which to have a decent night's sleep.  Instead, they are left in very busy environments.  They do not always stay there just for 12 hours or 24 hours.  In many instances, they are going for treatment and then returning to the trolley.  The trolley is their permanent base in the acute hospital.  As the previous speaker set out, there is ample evidence that tells us that this, in itself, can cause a person's health to deteriorate.  That is not a situation that any of the people who provide the care have control over but it is certainly not an environment in which they can continue to work.  </p><p> It is also detrimental to retention, which is now a real problem.  We are still battling the legacy of the recruitment moratorium for nurses and dealing with a system, particularly in the HSE, that is extremely bureaucratic when it comes to recruitment.  On top of that, our system is causing those who work in it to suffer burnout much earlier than they should or to make the decision to leave because they simply cannot deal with a broken system any longer.  One of the areas that has been looked at over recent years, since 2016, as a result of two nurses' strikes is a measurement tool to determine how many nurses are needed in these departments.  That is now Government policy in surgical and medical wards.  It is termed the framework on nurse staffing.  It was meant to be fully implemented by the end of 2021 with funding available in each October's budget.  Unfortunately, that has not happened to the level it should have.  This framework now only applies in 12 hospitals throughout the country.  When we have a model that measures and determines the skills mix and number and mix of nurses and healthcare assistants needed, that should be funded because the evidence is absolutely clear that, when the framework is in place, patient outcomes are better, the cost to the State is reduced because the dependency on agency staff is reduced and retention is improved, which is extremely important right now.  That is one of our big asks.</p><p> We have appeared before this committee on numerous occasions to discuss Sl&aacute;intecare and the very good work that was done across all parties to determine what changes are needed in the public health system.  We strongly believe that fiddling around at the edges and tinkering with changes will not work.  We need the fundamental change that was set out in Sl&aacute;intecare.  We need the Oireachtas to take ownership of that and we need to see evidence of real reconfiguration and integration of services at every level.  The days of one manager saying that his or her budget is affected and that the money, therefore, cannot be spent between acute and primary care must end.  We must have real integration.  This would allow the patient's journey to be paramount and would make moving someone from a hospital to a community setting much easier.  Those services must be funded and put in place.  That is not happening at a helpful level and pace.  It is too slow and the Oireachtas must insist that this change be overseen by the highest and most senior office in the country, that of the Taoiseach, as was envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report when it was originally produced.</p><p> The bottom line for nurses who are working in acute hospitals, both on overcrowded wards and in emergency departments, is that they fundamentally believe that patients are affected negatively when admitted if they are left waiting on trolleys for prolonged periods.  We have surveyed our members in five of the most overcrowded hospitals over recent months and, to a person, they are now saying that there are negative effects for patients, including missed care, and that they unfortunately do not believe these areas are safe places to provide care.  This is known.  This is not news.  They are now saying that, when they raise this from the front line, somebody must start to listen and take the necessary decisions to bring about change.  </p><p> That change is already designed in Sl&aacute;intecare.  A version of Sl&aacute;intecare or Sl&aacute;intecare with a different focus is not what they want.  They want the report implemented as it was set out.  The fundamental changes that are required, particularly with regard to improving the services that are available outside of the acute hospital, must be made and they must be made this year.  We must see more diagnostics and step-down beds in the community.  We must see more chronic disease management led, in the main, by clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners, as it is now.  That requires investment.  We must see the real change that is the integration of care so that we do not have separate budgets for community services and acute hospital services.  That mitigates against integration at every level.  When HSE management appears before the committee later, members need to ask where the evidence of change is because it is not visible to the people who are dependent on our public hospitals.  What they see is longer waiting times for outpatient treatments and others treatments and some not receiving treatment in the emergency departments because they get so frustrated that they leave.</p><p> In summary, no more than we did with our presentation in 2018 on this subject, we are saying that the evidence of overcrowding remaining a great problem is very obvious.  We have set out the percentage differences in trolley count figures across hospital wards and emergency departments between 2020 and 2021 on page 4 of our submission.  Members can see that the increase was significant.  That is a continuous problem.  There is also the significant issue of hospital wards now catering for additional patients with reduced numbers of staff because wards are, in the main, staffed for the bed numbers that are allocated and funded but they are dealing with additional beds constantly, as are the emergency departments, where there are patients for whom there are no nurses allocated because the areas should not be used and are, therefore, not staffed.  In our submission, we have set out what this means for the staff working in those areas.  We have seen higher incidences of violence and aggression and, unfortunately, the majority of those incidents are recorded against nurses working on the front line.  </p><p> We have also set out in our submission that there is a role for the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, and Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  We were disappointed with their response when we asked them to investigate these units.  We believe that these statutory agencies have responsibilities and we ask this committee to examine the responses from the HSA and HIQA to date.  If strengthening of the legislation that underpins their responsibilities is required, this committee must make recommendations to that effect.</p><p>Having an agency that is responsible for the statutory safety of staff at work must mean the same thing in hospitals as on building sites, and it does not.  Currently, you can work in an emergency department or hospital ward, be subject to a career-ending assault, and there is no change to your workplace.  That is not acceptable.</p><p> We are happy to take any questions but we ask the committee to see our request as a cry for help.  As one of our members said at the meeting last night, when the front line is screaming for assistance, somebody must listen.  That is the request to the committee.

Our delegation today consists of me and my colleague at our national health office, Chris Cully.<br/><br/>F&oacute;rsa represents more than 30,000 health workers in our hospitals, community health system and residential and social care settings, as well as at the corporate centre of health service planning and delivery.  We represent workers in direct public service employment, such as the HSE and the section 38 voluntary hospitals, as well as section 39 agencies and in the private sector.  Our members include health and social care professionals and clerical, administrative, management and technical staff.  We consider it one of the many strengths of this union that our members are central to the delivery of the full array of health and welfare services in Ireland.<br/><br/>Public discourse around our health services is frequently driven by headlines alerting us all to the hazards of growing waiting lists and the numbers of patients on trolleys.  The discourse is, consequently, always stuck in crisis mode, and this contributes to a wider sense of understandable anxiety about access to healthcare when people need it.  While lists and trolley numbers are useful statistical information because they illustrate the symptoms of an underlying problem, it is F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s view that it is the underlying problem that urgently needs to be addressed.  The only way to tackle the ongoing and persistent overcrowding crisis in our hospitals and the underlying problems that drive it is to ensure Sl&aacute;intecare and, in particular, the 96 new community healthcare networks that will allow the health service to provide appropriate care through health and social care professionals working in the community are implemented fully and without delay.<br/><br/>One of the eight fundamental principles of the Sl&aacute;intecare report of 2017 is that patients should access care at the most appropriate, cost-effective service level, with a strong emphasis on prevention and public health.  In the recently launched Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy &amp;amp; Action Plan 2021-2023, seven projects are listed to achieve the aims of Reform Programme 1: Improving Safe, Timely Access To Care, and Promoting Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing.  Project 1 is to implement the Health Service Capacity Review 2018, including healthy living, enhanced community care and hospital productivity.  That review sets out the staffing and physical infrastructure required to meet the Sl&aacute;intecare waiting time targets and outlines the necessity for the shift of care out of acute hospitals into the community and closer to a person&rsquo;s home, where safely possible.  The only way to avoid hospital admissions and reduce pressure on acute hospitals is through initiatives that will see care delivered within the community.<br/><br/>Project 7 of the Sl&aacute;intecare strategy states:</p> <blockquote> 	The removal of private practice from public hospitals is a core principle of Sl&aacute;intecare, ensuring that public healthcare facilities are used for public patients only, and that public patients can access public hospitals based on clinical need.  The Sl&aacute;intecare Consultant Contract, which will only permit the carrying out of public care in public hospitals from the date of implementation, is central to the delivery of the goal of universal, single-tier healthcare in Ireland. </blockquote> <p>The transition to public-only contracts for hospital consultants and State-employed general practitioners is necessary.  F&oacute;rsa trade union is unequivocally on the record as being a strong supporter of the community health intervention and servicing model proposed by the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  F&oacute;rsa and our members played a pivotal role in the process that established community health networks, and we are actively engaged in the introduction of the enhanced community care networks.<br/><br/>Another ongoing cause of pressure on the hospital system is the cultural default position of GP referrals to the acute hospital system.  Direct GP referral to community radiology is an example of one of the stated measures to be implemented as part of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.  This would alleviate hospital waiting lists.<br/><br/>A final consideration F&oacute;rsa wishes to highlight is that a properly resourced home support service is a necessary component of a functioning health service.  A reduction in delayed discharges can only happen when the appropriate supports exist in the community.  A new report, The Irish State Post Pandemic, was commissioned by F&oacute;rsa, produced by the TASC think tank and published last month.  Among other key recommendations, this report called for the provision of greater integration of Government agencies such as home care and health services.<br/><br/>From F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s perspective, we believe the answer to the ongoing and persistent overcrowding crisis in our hospitals is clear.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report and subsequent implementation plans provide both a durable solution and the roadmap to same.  Sl&aacute;intecare has cross-party support, citizens&rsquo; support and workers&rsquo; support.  We ask the committee to consider what are the real inhibitors to its implementation.  Why, five years since the publication of the initial report, are there still the same unrelenting pressures on hospitals and on our members working in those hospitals?<br/><br/>I thank the committee for the invitation and the opportunity to address it today.  We will endeavour to answer any questions members may have</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1275" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr.  John McCamley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030900002#D00300"><p>I thank members for the opportunity to highlight some issues on this important matter on behalf of the SIPTU health division.  We represent around 40,000 workers across private and public health organisations, including many grades involved in the delivery of emergency and acute hospital services.  These grades include nurses and midwives, healthcare assistants, paramedics, porters and diagnostics staff.</p> <p>  Over the past two years, healthcare workers have gallantly worked through the unprecedented events that have tested the foundations of our health services and those working in it.  They now face a return to the pre-pandemic overcrowding crisis that is developing in our hospitals nationally.  In many hospitals the numbers presenting in emergency departments have drastically increased, having a knock-on effect on the rest of the hospital and community services.  While issues with overcrowding have always had a detrimental effect on healthcare workers, the years of the pandemic have led to increased feelings of burnout, fatigue and low morale.  They now face yet another crisis, and we are receiving increased reports of healthcare workers considering their roles.  Coupled with this, the normal delays around recruitment could cause the situation to deteriorate further.</p> <p>  SIPTU represents a number of grades, and how the crisis is developing can be seen uniquely through their experiences.  These can be placed in four main areas: pre-hospital emergency services, that is, ambulance services; emergency departments; inpatient wards; and community services.</p> <p>  Staff members working for the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade provide pre-hospital emergency services to the public and are crucial to the delivery of care and emergency services in our communities.  For example, the HSE National Ambulance Service provides emergency services, intermediate care transport, mobile intensive care ambulances, neonatal intensive care and aeromedical services.  We are seeing an increase in call volumes to these services.  In our submission, we provided a number of figures.  For example, in a comparison of January 2019 to January this year, calls have increased by more than 5,000.  It is a fair assumption that any increase in call volume would have an impact on the availability of ambulances, but this combined with the delays at emergency departments, EDs, has caused additional pressures on services and ambulance crews.</p> <p>  During the pandemic, turnaround times increased due to the introduction of non-Covid and Covid pathways in EDs, with ambulance turnaround times ranging from one to five hours.  This has resulted in ambulances being dispatched from further away to deal with the non-availability of ambulances nearer.  The national average turnaround time at EDs stands at around 54 minutes, though there are examples of much higher times laid out in our submission.  For example, in Letterkenny University Hospital on three occasions in January this year, ambulances could not leave for between seven and 14 hours.  In University Hospital Waterford, it was between four and five hours on eight occasions.  A number of other incidents are outlined in our submission.</p><p>It must be stated categorically that the delays are not the result of the tireless effort of the staff in any of these emergency departments but an overall systems failure in dealing with a number of areas that I will touch on later in this submission.</p><p> It is frequently stated that the unique nature of the emergency department is that it does not close.  It is open 24-7 and patients can arrive at any time with any type of condition.  Members of the public know they will be seen by dedicated and skilled professionals, albeit with increased waiting times.  As a result of this, the ED has become a choke point for wider issues within the health service.  While it is crucial that those issues particular to EDs are resolved as a matter of urgency, there is a need to look at alternative pathways to care.</p><p> SIPTU representatives have noted an increase in the number of complaints around staffing in emergency departments, in particular but not exclusively from nursing and healthcare assistant members, in the past few months.  There is no doubt that staff are under increased pressure and the HSE and health employers need to do more to fill deficits in EDs.  Additionally, radiographers are seeing an increase in cases, with cases in one Dublin hospital up 30% compared with 2019.  There has been an increase in difficulties filling deficits for radiographers in some locations.  We believe this is down to offering short-term contracts instead of permanent contracts.</p><p> While reliance on agency staff is always a feature in the health service, if recruitment and retention are not given priority, there will be additional reliance on agency staff along with increased costs to the Exchequer.  Other locations have had difficulties with regard to staffing in catering and household.  Overcrowding and the need for increased transfer of patients have also affected the availability of portering grades which are essential in the transport of patients within a hospital.</p><p> Healthcare workers in EDs have seen an increase in the number of patients waiting for a bed, with numbers recently exceeding those in 2019.  It is highly likely that being left on trolleys for a long period can have a significant knock-on effect on patients' health.  The HSE and health employers, including the Department of Health, need to do more to develop additional bed capacity in acute hospitals to relieve the emergency departments.</p><p> To increase turnaround in beds in an acute hospital, the provision of proper public community services is needed, either in a residential setting or with home care packages.  Through the years, we have seen a cycle of temporary increases in home care packages only for the funding to be reduced in tandem with the hours allocated to a patient, resulting in them needing to go back to the ED.  SIPTU members regard the delay waiting for home care packages to be one of the biggest factors for delayed discharges, although the allocation of a bed in the community is also a major factor.  Housing alterations to cater for patients can feed into those delays as well.</p><p> Pathways also have to be developed within the community to deal with patient needs, which will reduce reliance on emergency departments, such as the expansion of primary care centres and minor injury units.  Additional utilisation of pre-hospital care by ambulance staff can also reduce the need for a referral to the emergency department, for example, the expansion of community paramedics.</p><p> We have outlined a number of areas in which work needs to take place.  These include the implementation of the ambulance service review on roles and responsibilities which will result in the further professionalisation of the ambulance service; funding to be made available for additional ambulance staff and vehicles; the expansion of community paramedics and other pre-hospital care initiatives; fast-tracking the filling of deficits within emergency departments for nursing, healthcare assistants and support grades; incentivising roles for ED staff, with a view to stemming the drain of staff from the service; and express roll-out of phase 2 of the task force on safe staffing in all EDs to assist and maintain adequate staffing of nurses and healthcare assistants.</p><p> Other areas include the expansion of enhanced care teams into EDs to free up healthcare assistants currently carrying out enhanced care; implementation of the radiographer review recommendations to deal with adequate safe staffing for radiography departments and advanced practice; full roll-out of the Sl&aacute;intecare strategy across the health service; continued investment in the roll-out of home care packages in line with Sl&aacute;intecare and HSE service delivery plans, with focus on delivery of hours via direct HSE employees; a clear commitment from Government to direct provision of home care services, including a more focused emphasis on HSE recruitment of home care support assistants; and an increase the number of publicly-owned community beds to reduce reliance on private nursing homes.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to make our submission.</p></speech>

The issues they have raised have been discussed in the committee since the beginning of the year.  We all acknowledge the tremendous work done by the health services over the past two years.  Challenges came day after day and the medical personnel stood up to the challenges.  We need that recorded because otherwise the challenges ahead cannot be faced.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their opening statements.  All of the issues they raised have been addressed by the committee since the beginning of this year because it is recognised that we can no longer have a haphazard approach to health services.  We have an increased population and increased demand at every level and we need to do something about it.</p> <p>  My colleagues will speak for themselves but all members agree that it is not sufficient to go back to the people again and again to say we are very sorry but we cannot help them because the system does not work and we are in competition with everybody else in the world for personnel, staff or whatever the case may be.  That does not wash any more.  We have to do something about it.</p> <p>  What do we do?  We enlist healthcare as the leading issue.  We request that particular reference be made to the fact that Sl&aacute;intecare has to proceed as was indicated.  We noted that people resigned from the Sl&aacute;intecare co-ordination committee and were assured that everything in the garden was rosy.  We presume that is the case but we do not know.  However, we know for certain that we do not have a separate budget.  We cannot do the things the witnesses want to do.  We do not have a budget to do so.</p> <p>  We are not the Health Service Executive.  The HSE can do that and has to do so.  The HSE now tells us that more money than ever before is available.  It tells us again and again that money is not an issue.  It is all there.  Everything we ever wanted is there.  It is now a matter of deciding that we address the issues.  Hospital waiting lists are one issue of many.  I get frustrated when we repeatedly say to the public we are very sorry that the situation is the same as it was last year or has got worse.  What do we do?</p> <p>  Other countries are having problems with competition for staff.  The reason for that in the nursing area is that nursing is heavy, hard work.  It has been especially tough going over the past two years.  In order to ensure we retain staff, we have to pay them.  If that is the cause of the problem, money is available.  What is the cause of the problem in the future?</p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare must proceed.  Any interim measure must be within the template of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We have said that again and again at this committee.  We accept that progress must be within the template of Sl&aacute;intecare in order that actions are not taken that cut across Sl&aacute;intecare and render it useless.  We mean to create a service that is acceptable, robust, available and accessible.</p> <p>  I will depart from my usual approach of addressing specific witnesses and instead speak to all of them.  Do they know of anybody out there who is deliberately frustrating the onward progress the Minister and the HSE say is possible?  Is it the HSE?  Who is it?  We cannot continue to make excuses.  It is not acceptable to us as public representatives or to the general public.  There is a notion nowadays that everything takes four or five years.  That is utter rubbish.  The Chairman and all of us around this table know that.</p><p>That is not true.  It is possible to take measures that take effect in the next couple of months, so that is what we need.  It is as simple as that.  If it does not happen, we will be back to where we were.  We have a plan for the future and great ideas but we are going to do nothing.  That is what it means.  Urgent progress is required.  In any queue, the waiting list is whatever length it is - I am not going to go into the one million people waiting at the moment - and you have to start doing something about it.  That queue has to be shortened, so you have to start at the two ends of it - the outer end and the immediate problem - and they must converge quickly.  Whatever steps are needed to do that must be put in place now.  That will be in line with the template set down in Sl&aacute;intecare and that must happen.  It is no good us saying we do not have Sl&aacute;intecare ready yet so we will wait two or three years until it is up and running and do it then.  That is not acceptable either so we must start at the beginning and end of the queue and converge.  If that does not happen, we are facing a disaster because there are many challenges ahead.</p><p> I have been involved in the health service in one shape or form for a long time, as have all other members here, and we were told for years we did not need any more hospital beds.  We were told repeatedly there was no need for hospital beds, there were already too many beds, we should get rid of them and it would be much more efficient to do without them.  Well, now they know and everybody knows we need hospital beds.</p><p> We need to provide a service to the people when they want it.  It is no good telling somebody to come back in four or five years, depending on the illness or immediate concern.  We need to reassure the public.  It is one of those things that needs to done as a matter of urgency.  We need to reassure the public we are conscious of the position and have every intention of doing something about it in the current year, not next year or five years' time.  We cannot tell members of the public to come back in five years' time and we will look after them then.  That is outrageous; it is crazy.  I have never seen it work in any other organisation and I have been looking at organisations for a long time.  I will not specify what needs to be done.  The witnesses all know what needs to be done.  The money is in place.  The HSE knows the money must be released strategically to provide the services that are needed.</p><p> There are people who say we cannot do that.  This does not arise.  There are no situations where something cannot be done.  I remember how I was told by institutions five or ten years ago that something would take five or ten years.  Where have we got to?  I was looking at a case recently where a nurse who qualified outside this jurisdiction wanted to become involved in this country as a matter of urgency.  Dealing with this kind of thing has been handed over to a private organisation.  It was done six months ago and that was the last time they ever heard of it.  We cannot go on like that.  It is inefficient, ineffective and is not working.  All the comments about the system being broken are correct.  It is broken and is not working.  However, it was able to work for the past two years in possibly a miraculous fashion.  The health service in this country delivered in a way that was not expected of it.  It was not expected of it because the health service has been dumbed down.  Everybody criticises the health service.  People working in the health service know it and do not expect anything else.  We as politicians know that if someone is always being criticised and nothing is expected of him or her, you will get nothing from that person and nothing will happen.</p><p> The time has come to deal in a meaningful way with the issues that are emerging, and by that I do not mean in six months' time; I mean now.  We need to get the response soon from the HSE and all the organisations we dealt with in January.  We do not have a budget, we cannot enforce it, but we can highlight it, which is what we have done, and this committee was ahead of everybody else.  Everybody was anxious going into the new year.  With some subsidence in the virus, and while it has not gone away and is still around, we need to act now.  That is all I want to say.  I did not direct anything at individuals.  I am merely saying that all those involved need to act now.</p></speech>

Most of the witnesses have been before this committee a few times over recent years and we have spoken about the levels of burnout, stress and anxiety the members of their organisations face.  I acknowledge that.  The people on the front line and across healthcare with whom I speak are sick and tired of politicians giving them a clap on the back and telling them how great they are.  They want us to solve the problems, put the capacity into our healthcare system and deal with the long-term issues, because far too often we focus on quick-fix and short-term solutions.</p> <p>  One line in the IMO's opening statement sums up what was in most of the opening statements, "Unfortunately, there is no quick fix to hospital overcrowding".  That is the first thing we must accept.  There are no quick-fix solutions.  If we continue to chase quick-fix solutions, we will not solve the problem.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses tell me about the human consequences of hospital overcrowding?  I take the point made by the witnesses from F&oacute;rsa that sometimes there is too much concentration on overcrowding and waiting lists and there are underlying problems that create that, but waiting lists and overcrowding are real and have an impact on people.  Does Ms McGowan work in the healthcare sector?</p></speech>

I am an advanced nurse practitioner and work in a very busy emergency department.</p></speech>

Some hospitals are worse than others and maybe there are issues in individual hospitals that must be dealt with as well as structural and capacity problems.  The response told me that in the month of January, almost 1,100 patients over the age of 75 were on a hospital trolley for more than 24 hours.  Some of them were on trolleys for more than 48 hours.  Given that Ms McGowan works in an emergency department in a busy hospital, will she outline the impact of overcrowding on patients - older and younger people and children?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1283" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen McGowan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030900002#F00500"><p>That is a good question.  The environment in which we are working in emergency departments is very much out of our control.  As previous speakers have highlighted, our doors are open 24-7.  The indignity of what patients endure in these emergency departments is horrendous.  We witness the trauma these patients experience.  Our trauma pales in comparison with what these patients endure, and every day it is getting worse.  This is simply not being managed and it is getting worse.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about quick fixes.  Our emergency departments keep throwing us life lessons year after year and we are not learning from them.  Quick fixes will not fix this.  We have a solution in Sl&aacute;intecare and it is not just about acute care.  From community to acute care, it is the solution we want and it needs to be implemented.  The environment in which we are working is horrendous and patients are enduring so much trauma.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1284" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030900002#F00600"><p>When I read all the opening statements, I found common themes in all of them in respect of solutions.  For me, it is really worthwhile when we have witnesses and organisations come before an Oireachtas committee and not only outline the problem but also give us their insight into the solutions.  As Deputy Durkan said, we know we need more beds so we need more inpatient bed capacity.  If we do not have enough beds, patients who have to be admitted to hospital cannot be admitted quickly enough because the recovery or inpatient beds are not available.</p><p>As a consequence, many of them end up on trolleys.  We do not have enough community beds, as we know, which means that there are knock-on consequences in terms of step-down beds, care in the home and all of those issues.  Those are the points made by F&oacute;rsa, which we all accept.  We do not have enough GP capacity.  The witnesses referenced that.</p><p> If people cannot get access to a GP in or out of hours, they have no choice but to go to an emergency department.  It strikes me that huge numbers of people are going to emergency departments who should instead be treated in the community, but they are not being treated in the community because the capacity is not there which puts more of a burden on our emergency departments.</p><p> The key to fixing a lot of the problems is workforce planning and a workforce strategy.  We need to train, recruit and retain more professionals.  We cannot fix the problems in our healthcare system if we do not send out a very powerful message to people who are training that we want them to come and work in the public system, that we have listened to the issues they raised regarding retention, recruitment and the reasons people are not coming, and that we have fixed these problems.  If we do not fix them, we will not hire staff in the numbers that we want and we will not be able to deliver on the healthcare the people need.</p><p> Can the witnesses address workforce planning and recruitment?  Consultants are represented by the IMO.  I ask Dr. Molloy to outline the difficulties they face and any other points he wants to make.  I will put a quick point to SIPTU following his response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1286" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mick Molloy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030900002#G00200"><p>As a consultant in emergency medicine in a busy emergency department, I can tell the Deputy exactly what the impact of waiting and trolley times is.  It is death.  That is what the impact is.  A seminal paper was published earlier this year by the ex-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in the UK.  Two years of admissions in the UK were studied, along with 430,000 deaths in the UK system.  Researchers were able to show that for every 82 people who were delayed in getting to a bed on a ward for longer than six hours from the time of presentation to an emergency department, one extra person died because of the delay.  It is fairly simple.  The study was carried out very scientifically over a huge population.  It showed that people who got a bed on a ward more quickly were less exposed to &ndash; I do not use this phrase lightly &ndash; the torture of being in an emergency department.  It is a 24-hour operation.  The lights are on.  When people are sick they want the lights turned off and a place with peace and quiet.  There are many staff moving around and there is a lot of noise.  The Geneva Convention recognises that not allowing a person to sleep and exposing him or her to loud noise is a form of torture, and that is what is happening to these people in emergency departments.  People tolerate that for short durations.  We know that people who have been exposed for 24 or 48 hours are not getting sleep for that period which dramatically affects their ability to survive an illness.</p> <p>  With respect to workforce planning, quite a lot of work went into this in recent years in the national doctors training programme which identified the numbers required in each specialty over the next ten years in order to staff the service.  That is great, if people have confidence in working in the service.  People are choosing to work elsewhere because they cannot see the level of investment in the service to guarantee them the ability to do their job.  Surgeons are appointed to hospitals without any operating time.  That makes no sense.  Why appoint a surgeon if he or she cannot operate?  People are appointed to community health organisations where there is no base from which to run clinics.  Again, that makes no sense.</p> <p>  A lot is required in the service.  I draw the attention of the committee to a report from the Department of Health from 20 years ago on acute bed capacity.  At that time, it recognised the need for 5,000 extra beds.  At that time, there were 11,862 inpatient acute beds.  We now have less than that.  We had a population of 3.5 million then, but the population now is over 5 million and is growing on a week-to-week basis.  Sitting and talking about strategies and plans are great, but they are only good intentions unless we actually generate the hard work needed to implement them.</p></speech>

We are tight on time and I want to give her as much time as possible to respond.  One of the issues that arises with staff I meet is the lack of safe staffing levels.  We know we have a safe staffing framework and a skills mix framework.  I have raised this issue with the Minister several times recently.  He has told me that the money is there, and it is not an issue and is being implemented.  Is it being implemented?  Is the money there?  Are there wards or healthcare facilities in the State without safe staffing levels today?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1288" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030900002#G00400"><p>Yes, 12 hospitals out of all of the acute hospitals have been funded to implement the safe staffing strategy on surgical medical wards.  The remainder do not have it.  In 2019, &euro;5 million was allocated but was not spent.  We know that to get the framework implemented over three years will take a minimum of &euro;10 million per year.  Last year's budget did not allocate &euro;10 million.  The budget for 2019, 2020 and 2021 should have allocated &euro;10 million.  To date, &euro;15 million has been allocated.  We know the savings that come from implementing the framework, as I set out earlier, are significant.  It is now Government policy.</p> <p>  In our view, the framework which measures how many nurses and healthcare assistants are required and what mix is needed on surgical and medical wards needs to be underpinned by legislation.  Otherwise, it will just be a policy that sits on a shelf and somebody will decide not to allocate the money that is required every October.  Fundamentally, we know that it works and that where it has been implemented it saves on agency costs and improves retention and patient outcomes.  Fewer people are readmitted to hospital when we have the correct nursing staff levels because they get their care on time.</p> <p>  Phase 2 of the framework on emergency departments is now being examined by University College Cork, led by Professor Jonathan Drennan.  This will be the first time anywhere in the world that staffing levels for emergency departments will be examined in this way.  That needs to be funded and implemented quickly across the 29 hospitals.</p> <p>  Nurses went on strike in order to ensure we had a measurement tool and funding to implement safe staffing.  That was one of the fundamental issues they raised and felt strongly enough about that they took industrial action.  The settlement of that action related to a Labour Court recommendation which sets out that over three years the funding must be made available to implement the safe staffing strategy, but that has not happened over the three years in question, namely 2019, 2020 and 2021.  Today, 12 hospitals have implemented the framework on surgical and medical wards.  It is not good enough.</p></speech>

I thank them for their presentations, and thank them and all of their members for all of the work they do to keep the health service afloat, not only over the past two years where their contributions were outstanding but on an ongoing basis before and since.</p> <p>  It is remarkable that so many people have referred to the fact that there is a solution.  We talk about these problems a lot, and have talked about them for donkey's years, but there is a solution which many have identified, namely Sl&aacute;intecare.  The issue is the slow implementation of that and the lack of buy-in from some people involved who are central to the health service.  I do not think the committee needs to be convinced of that.  Many of us were involved in drawing up that strategy.</p> <p>  What kind of engagement are the unions having, as key organisations within the health service, with the Government and, in particular, the Minister regarding the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare?  Have there been meetings about that in recent times?  I would be interested in hearing in their response what engagement, if any, they have had.  That is the critical thing.</p> <p>  The slogan of Sl&aacute;intecare is "Right Care Right Place Right Time", and that sums up in six words very well what we need to do in the health service.  We have spoken about providing care at the earliest possible stage and at the lowest level of complexity.  We know that within the health service the vast bulk of activity relates to chronic illness.  About 70% to 80% of chronic illness can be perfectly managed, and is best managed, within the community.</p> <p>  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha spoke about the commitment we are supposed to have to chronic illness management.</p><p>We have been talking about that for 20 years and it is the key to unlocking many of the logjams within the health service.  There was mention of the need for clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners but why are we not doing this?  It seems to be blindingly obvious that this is where the emphasis should be within the health service.  Why is the Government not rolling out the chronic illness programme and why do we not have those key senior nurse posts in place to the extent required?</p></speech>

We should remember that in 2013 there was a moratorium on recruitment.  Ms McGowan, who is in the committee room today, is an advanced nurse practitioner and to get to that level takes an investment of nearly seven years.  Recruitment must be featured around investing in advancement for those who are in post currently but we have never done that.  We have never had a recruitment policy that goes beyond one year.  Currently, if a director of nursing has notification that somebody is going on maternity leave, retiring or resigning, it can take up to six months to replace that post.  That does not mean there is a workforce plan that is investing in building for the future.</p> <p>  The Minister has recently announced an increase in advanced nurse practitioner posts for the community for the management of chronic disease.  There is some good work starting in the Department of Health in respect of virtual wards and bringing that care out of hospital into people's homes.</p></speech>

We have been talking about this for 20 years and very slow progress has been made.  It is just so frustrating.  The whole area of social care is being completely downgraded and this is where it is now.  If we want to deal with upstream issues, we must invest properly in social care also.  Unfortunately, it gets very little attention at a senior level within the Government.</p> <p>  We have spoken about workforce planning and Dr. Molloy has made the point it is not just about numbers.  We need to find out the issues that prevent good recruitment and retention of staff.  There has been much research done in the area and we are getting a presentation in the next few weeks on consultants.  The Irish College of General Practitioners had representatives before us talking about the need to have a working group set up to identify those blockages.  We know from research done that the number one reason people do not stay is because they want a proper work-life balance, which is not available to many people within the Irish health service.</p> <p>  They also want a clear commitment from the Government that it is serious about reform, which is not available either.  Money is clearly an issue and it is undoubtedly the case that the two-tier pay scale for consultants was very damaging to morale.  To a large extent we are moving beyond that now.  Witnesses may shake their heads but the Sl&aacute;intecare contract is now being offered.  It offers a very good salary of between &euro;140,000 and &euro;252,000 for regular working hours to provide that kind of work-life balance that so many doctors are seeking.  What exactly is the problem with the contract from the perspective of the IMO?</p></speech>

Talks were under way under an independent chair.  That chair was appointed to the High Court and we have been calling for a new chair to be appointed so talks can recommence to deal with these matters.  It is difficult to understand, when we are waiting for talks to start again, why the Government is already reneging on previous agreements such as the restoration of cuts from before.  If the Government is refusing to honour current contracts, it does not breed much trust for people to enter into a new contractual arrangement.</p> <p>  The Deputy noted I was shaking my head.  Moving forward to Sl&aacute;intecare does not solve the problem for the people who had their salaries cut in 2012.  They will now have had ten years of a reduced salary and pension benefits and they will not be replaced by a sudden uplift in the salary when they sign a new contract.  It has nothing to do with private practice.  It means that group of people have been penalised through no fault of their own and just by the nature of the date they were appointed.  I am one of them.  By the nature of the date of my appointment, I should have left the country and stayed abroad because I would have been more valued in the system.  I stayed in Ireland and worked on a temporary contract arrangement of six months here, four months there and two months over there.  I was working around the system, which meant I had no permanent contract.  By the time I got a permanent contract, I was subject to this 30% cut in salary.  There is no plan to have that deficit addressed in my pension fund or agreement with what is on the table now.  It has not even been discussed with the Minister at this point.</p></speech>

At a strategic level, we have no engagement on Sl&aacute;intecare.  At an operational level, F&oacute;rsa is engaged with the roll-out of the enhanced community network and we have good engagement on that one particular piece.  I will give a very quick example of workforce planning, which we have all mentioned.  It took me three years, a motion to our conference from our members and raising it at numerous meetings at our national joint council to get one meeting on workforce planning for dietitians where there is a crisis, partly linked to Brexit, partly linked to training and partly linked to no investment.  Simply through the treatment of diabetes, this group of health and social care professionals can keep people at home.  Things like that do not happen quickly enough.</p> <p>  As part of F&oacute;rsa's submission to the European semester for 2022 and the national reform programme, we believe there is a strong case for the social partners at a high level to be given a role in the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We think that could be very useful in driving it forward.</p></speech>

I am standing in for our health spokesperson, Deputy Gino Kenny, today.  I thank all the healthcare workers and those present today for the fantastic work they have done under extremely difficult circumstances.  This includes ambulance drivers, porters, nurses, doctors and midwives.  Across the whole gamut, they have had a very difficult time.  Unfortunately, things are not improving for them, based on what they have told us.  I am certainly aware of the horror stories of people spending hours on trolleys or months and sometimes years on waiting lists.  It is beyond shocking.  I recently met somebody who told me they would not get community mental health care for two years.  I could not believe it.  We are facing a mental health crisis and people cannot get seen for two years.  It is a staggering level of dysfunction.</p> <p>  My first question is for Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha and Ms McGowan, as a working nurse in an emergency department.  I was shocked to hear today that we only have safe staffing levels in 12 of 29 hospitals.  Three years after we identified that we needed to address that as a matter of priority, only 12 of 29 hospitals have safe staffing levels.  That is very shocking.  What does not having safe staffing levels mean for the patients?  What does it mean for the staff?  I am aware of people working in emergency departments facing physical aggression and sometimes assault.  Is one aspect of not having safe staffing levels that the staff are actually putting themselves in very serious physical harm's way from possible assault or attacks?  </p> <p>  During the Covid pandemic we highlighted the failure to pay student nurses who are on work placement.  I thought it was unbelievable.  Leaving aside the Covid pandemic, given that we desperately need more nurses it is incredible that we are making it difficult for nurses to do their training and get through their education with knock-on consequences for our ability to recruit and retain nurses and midwives.  Those studying to become nurses in the UK get &pound;10,000 a year as a bursary.  That was actually a cut by the Tories; it used to be &pound;15,000.  It is multiples of what student nurses here get.  I ask Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha and Ms McGowan to respond to those points.  I also have some questions for the other groups if I have time.</p></speech>

The assault figures are fairly shocking.  They were released under freedom of information and we set them out in our submission.  Some 7,600 assaults on HSE staff were reported last year.  That is only in the statutory hospitals and does not include psychiatric hospitals.  It does not include the community or voluntary hospitals, meaning that it is much higher than that.  Most worryingly, half of those assaults were against nurses.  Obviously, the staffing levels contribute to an increase in the public's frustration, particularly when they are waiting.  The level of assaults on staff in paediatric hospitals is higher which is of concern.  There is also a higher incidence of psychiatric patients attending emergency departments and waiting to be assessed by psychiatry staff, sometimes for prolonged periods of time.  A number of examples can be given of those inappropriate wait times.</p> <p>  Added into the mix is that the first port of call for the garda&iacute; bringing patients with altered behaviours, drug abuse issues etc. is into the emergency department and the staff of the emergency department then have to deal with that.  It is obviously an inappropriate area.  We have previously requested that psychiatric admissions should be made first to the acute psychiatric units.  As the Deputy has pointed out, there is another problem in that our psychiatric services are not fit for purpose.</p> <p>  We have a lack of services, particularly community services.  That is a big problem and can lead to people with drug and alcohol abuse issues unfortunately ending up in the emergency department, which is unacceptable.</p> <p>  We hope this committee will look at the health and safety legislation which needs to be revised and strengthened to protect staff working in these departments.  As I said in our opening statement, there are very clear guidelines for people working on building sites and if those guidelines are not met, the site closes.  The reported figures are of over 7,000 people being assaulted.  One of our members had an assault last year which ended her career; that is simply not acceptable.  The hospital in question remained open.  She was on duty for four hours after the assault because there was nobody to take over from her.  Her colleagues went back into the very same situation with no change the next day.</p> <p>  The legislation relating to protection for nurses, doctors and healthcare workers in hospitals, particularly emergency departments, must be reviewed and strengthened.  It is not acceptable to have inspection from a health and safety authority which does not recommend very serious improvements in the protection for staff working in these environments.  If we have no alternative to people coming in, then the protection for workers must be strengthened and must be very clear and obvious to staff.</p><p>It is a feature of our health service that is extraordinarily unwelcome and should not be happening.  One should not be assaulted as part of one's work or role.  It simply should not happen.  As I have said, the official numbers reported only tell half of the story because the assaults that were recorded did not include the voluntary or community hospitals.</p><p> I completely agree in respect of student nurses as the battles we had to get the McHugh report published involved protesting at the D&aacute;il to request it be done.  It is now published and we are still meeting with the HSE on aspects of it.  Everything is a battle when it comes to improving the conditions for nurses, from the student right up the line.  We have an expert review of nursing and midwifery in general which has just been issued to the Minister and, again, we are waiting for it to be published as this has not been done.  There is a crisis in retention, in the workforce and in the conditions under which they are working.  It should not be the case that nurses need to go on strike to highlight these issues.  Most of the time they are highlighting the negative effects on patients of not investing properly in nursing and in midwifery.  We fully agree with the point made by the Deputy.</p></speech>

That is care that is being undone or care that may be missed.  There are increased incidents of pressure area care which will increase their length of stay.  If things are being missed, especially with the elderly, there is an increased chance of delirium happening.  That in itself also increases bed days and mortality rate.  It is very significant.</p> <p>  On the issue of assaults at work, I have witnessed two in the past month.  That is crazy.  We are totally dumbfounded that we are in a health system in which this is happening.  I can quote two such incidents.  Everybody has a different day.  It is horrendous.  The health and safety legislation must be changed and strengthened to support us to be safe in our areas of work.</p></speech>

I ask our guests to comment on a phenomenon which strikes me.  When I hear about the constant overcrowding in our emergency departments, I am simultaneously listening to the radio in the car and hearing advertisements to come to the Beacon or the Blackrock Clinic, etc., to receive emergency care there.  The clear implication is that if one is in the public system, one is going to a war zone in one of our public hospitals where one will be on a trolley for hours and will be dealing with stressed staff, but if one goes to a private hospital for emergency care and can afford to do so, one will not have a problem.  Is that the reality?  To what extent does that reality say something about where we could get the additional capacity to resolve the problem we have in our public health system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1333" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mick Molloy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030900002#K00600"><p>All of those hospitals have a function to fulfil right now because they are decompressing the public emergency departments.  If they did not exist, one can imagine how much worse the problem would be.  Granted, they only operate at a limited time during the day.  With some of them it is ten hours and with others it is 12 hours a day.  If that volume was taken from them and placed back into the public system, it would mean it would be even worse.</p> <p>  To be honest, those hospitals are very much concentrated in the Dublin area.  I do not work in that area but work in a smaller model 3 hospital in the country.  We have a critical need to recognise the importance of future-proofing these model 3 hospitals.  Just because patients in these areas live remotely from Dublin, it does not mean they deserve a lesser form of healthcare.  Unfortunately, the majority of the resources seem to be directed towards the large model 4 hospitals.  If one is in a smaller hospital without all of the services on site, the patients who come to the emergency department are the same types of patients who go to the larger teaching hospitals in Dublin.  When someone with a fracture presents to a hospital without on-site orthopaedic treatment, one has to get involved in phone calls and remote consultations to get him or her referred onwards.  In the case of somebody with a brain haemorrhage, one tries to refer him or her to Beaumont Hospital.  If the patient has a myocardial infarction, one tries to get him or her into a percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, lab.  All of this requires more resources in the smaller hospital and not less.</p> <p>  I would like to mention a particular issue that arises.  The Deputy started talking about community healthcare.  Community healthcare is available 39 hours a week but is not available 129 hours a week, which is the majority of the time.  When someone has an acute need outside of normal hours, he or she rings an ambulance and is brought to a hospital.  There are four hospitals in the country that do not have on-site psychiatric services.  I work in one of them.  When a person calls an ambulance, that is where he or she will be brought.  When I have dealt with that patient and have tried to get him or her into the next part of the care system, which involves referring to a hospital 50 miles away, I might call the ambulance service only to be told it will not take the patient.  It will say that the patient is voluntary, not involuntary, and should transport himself or herself the 50 miles to the next hospital.  There are standardised bypass protocols in the National Ambulance Service to protect and bypass the large Dublin hospitals.  For example, paediatric patients or labouring obstetric patients are not brought to the adult hospitals in Dublin.  We receive those patients in the hospital I work in because we have those services on-site, but we do not have psychiatric services on-site.  There should be a similar bypass protocol for people with acute psychiatric emergencies to go to the places which have those services so that they are not brought to a smaller hospital which does not and cannot provide a service for those patients' needs.</p></speech>

I extend my apologies as I have been following the meeting remotely.  I have read the opening statements and have been listening to the debate so far this morning.  I join others in thanking all personnel in the front-line health service for what they have been doing.  I am the son of a nurse.  My mother is now retired but she has said many times over the past two years that she does not know how nurses, particularly younger nurses entering the profession, are coping with all of this.  That is where I wish to begin my questioning.</p> <p>  Can I ask Ms McGowan whether young men and women who are in the leaving certificate year and considering college choices are put off joining the profession given what they have seen on TV with regard to pay and conditions, Covid-19 and the abuse Ms McGowan has referred to?  At a time when more and more staff need to be recruited, is there a worry that many people will be discouraged from joining the profession? </p></speech>

Based on the applications for nursing this year, there has been an increase in students applying for nursing and midwifery courses.  Having said that, it is a long four years and it is particularly difficult when the circumstances in which they are working are challenging.  We certainly need to retain and to keep training the nurses in the way we are doing but it is a very challenging environment and the next four years will be very challenging and telling.</p></speech>

I understand that they are in a different world but they are also nonetheless involved in the caring profession.  Many people who work in that career have come to us to say that it is very demoralising.</p><p>Many of them cannot get mortgages.  Have the witnesses' front-line colleagues struggled over the past two years as property prices and the cost of living have gone up?  Are nurses struggling at the moment to raise loans with financial institutions to buy homes and to live near hospital environments?</p></speech>

On a personal level they are struggling, particularly in the Dublin area.  Colleagues have struggled to buy houses and have had to look further afield so the commute has increased.  We cannot work from home.  There is that element in recent times with fuel costs and so on.  It is a bit of a worry and a source of stress.</p></speech>

We have a conference coming up in May and are currently accepting motions from our delegates.  The salary for nurses is very modest and the cost of living increases have extraordinarily affected their ability to live in Dublin, particularly, while Cork and Galway are not far behind.  Also the price of rent is just the same as it is for everybody else living in a big city.  In the nurses' view, it has not been taken into account that essential workers must live near where they work.  They would be looking for essential workers to be considered when zoning legislation, particularly, is being considered, for example around the new children's hospital.  We are going to need significant numbers of staff to come and live in Dublin city.  We simply will not have accommodation that is affordable for them.  There is a massive issue right across the cost and availability of accommodation and the very modest salaries.  We either increase the salaries or we provide subsidised accommodation, or both.</p></speech>

There is a high-profile case that I will not get into today of a healthcare professional, a front-line worker, who, owing to tiredness, would have had a road traffic accident coming home from work.  Ms Hetherington wants to come in on that.</p></speech>

We long know that their contractual hours and requirements breach the European working time directive.  Tiredness, fatigue and that risk of having an accident are well known.  A recent survey we carried out showed that seven out of ten of all our doctors are showing signs of burn-out.  It is actually higher among the NCHDs at eight out of ten.</p> <p>  Going back to those risks of understaffing that the Deputy was asking about-----</p></speech>

The way the training programmes are set out at the moment means that NCHDs often have to move every six months around the country.  They often have to be two hours away from their families.  They therefore have additional costs on top of their own normal family costs.</p></speech>

I apologise for cutting across Ms Hetherington.  We have very limited time when we get to speak here.  I want to discuss my local hospital group, the University of Limerick Hospitals Group.  Perhaps Ms Hetherington can come in on that also.  First I want to ask Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha and Ms McGowan if it concerns them that the management of this hospital group have upped sticks from the University Hospital Limerick, UHL, environment and moved 2 km up the road to an office building far removed from the clinical environment.  I have been told by some people in senior management that nurses are delighted they have upped sticks and moved out of the hospital.  I think it is the opposite.</p> <p>  When I was a teacher, our principal was based in the school, not down the road.  In a local Garda station the sergeant and inspector are based on campus.  I find it incredible that this move has happened, given that it is the most pressurised hospital in our system and persistently has the worst waiting times and trolley numbers.  The management has been tasked with running it by the Government, the HSE and the Department of Health.  This is not personal but operationally, at least, they should be based in the hospital not up in an office block far removed from where their nurses, doctors, cleaning staff and attendants are under pressure.  Is it an issue?  Is the INMO concerned about it?  Are the nurses in UHL concerned that managers are not present on the hospital campus?</p></speech>

They have been talking about it and met the Minister for Health directly a number of weeks ago.  They have looked for an independent review of the system currently in place in UHL, not the management system but the current system of patient flow.  That has been refused.  They have looked for the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to come and inspect the hospital.  HIQA wrote to management and got a response.  HIQA has written back to us saying it is satisfied with that response and feels an inspection would add further to the pressures.  We do not accept that.  In our submission today we have attached the letter from HIQA.  We believe fundamentally that there are legacy issues in Limerick, namely that the reconfiguration did not provide sufficient bed numbers in the Dooradoyle campus.  The 100 beds that were added made no difference so there is now another issue.  We need to see how patient flow is being managed.  We believe that requires an independent investigation which should happen immediately.  We do not accept that it cannot or should not happen.  We ask the committee to speak with the Minister for Health and ask him to change his mind about that matter.</p></speech>

Can I go back to that question a small bit in terms of how the hospital is managed?  Is it effective or ineffective to be remote from the hospital site in terms of having oversight?  Does it matter to nurses?  I really want to get to this.  I have another follow-up question in a moment.  Does it matter?  Can a hospital be managed remotely?</p></speech>

There are no two ways about it.  We must have clinical oversight.  Senior clinicians, whether nurses or doctors, cannot do that job remotely.  They have to be on-site.  That is a 24-7 job.  They do not have the option of leaving at 5 o'clock.  They are there constantly, leading their team.  When the hospital is in crisis, the most senior clinicians must be on-site, even if that is after 6 o'clock.</p></speech>

Incredibly, while Sl&aacute;intecare recommended elective-only hospitals for Dublin, Cork and Galway, the mid-west and UHL, with 700,000 people funnelling through it under huge pressure, have no such recommendation.</p></speech>

The three elective hospitals that are now being developed are for day surgeries and day procedures only.  They will not assist in any location.  They will possibly decrease the numbers attending outpatients and day surgery but they will not assist in our battle to provide overcrowding solutions.  The problem we have in our acute hospitals right now is that our day surgeries are full of inpatients.  The elective hospitals as envisaged by Sl&aacute;intecare in our view were never designed to close at 5 o'clock.</p></speech>

I do not believe elective hospitals will have any immediate impact on that.  Over a 20- or 25-year period we might then have fewer people developing emergency problems and needing to be admitted into UHL.  That type of population demographic should require an elective hospital in that area.</p> <p>  The difficulty at the moment is the TrolleyGAR figures.  I do not know if the committee receives them.  There are directives from the HSE to hospitals not to count certain patients.  We do not count somebody who is put into a day care bed, a day surgery bed, or the acute medical admissions unit.  That now means all that activity cannot take place on the day.</p><p>We are just displacing other people and other activities, yet it is not reflected in the figures.  The true TrolleyGAR figures could be twice as high as the numbers we have, and on some days could be well over 1,000 patients.  If we have 11,000 beds and 1,000 trolleys, that means we cannot accommodate 10% of the emergency admissions we have, let alone deal with elective care as it stands.  There is a huge capacity issue that must be addressed by fairly rapid modular builds at this stage.  If we look back to the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, China was able to build a hospital with 1,000 beds in ten days.  Why can we not do something similar?</p></speech>

It has been a very difficult time for everyone involved.</p> <p>  The presentation from the IMO referred to 5,000 additional hospital beds.  This issue came up while I was on my way here.  I refer to the proposed elective hospitals for Cork, Galway and Dublin.  The report presented from Sl&aacute;intecare was to the effect that they would provide day facilities only.  I cannot talk about Galway or Dublin, but we definitely have a bed capacity issue in Cork.  The IMO made a substantial contribution when the Sl&aacute;intecare issue was being dealt with.  How does it fit that into what is being proposed for these three centres?</p></speech>

We are almost talking about two, or even three or four, competing systems.  We are talking about chronic care, acute care, emergency care and the elective hospitals' elective care, which is different again.  The 5,000 extra beds was from a Department of Health report 20 years ago.  We have followed that since then and looked at the trends in admissions.  The international evidence suggests that when a hospital is operating at above 85% capacity it becomes less efficient, there are more mistakes, there are more problems with admissions and there are more things missed because of the difficulty in moving all the people around to accommodate them.  In fact, that 85% figure is predicated on-----</p></speech>

Some of these elective hospitals, of necessity, will need to have overnight facilities.</p></speech>

I was recently speaking to a consultant in the north west.  She has a half day a week.  She came back from the United States where she had two days of operating space when she was working in the hospital there.  She tries to get three operations done in the half day.  However, she has been advised that if a patient is not in theatre by 4 p.m, the procedure cannot take place and, therefore, she is finding that she is cancelling one in every three operations.  How can issues such as that with theatres be resolved?  There are theatres in all the hospitals and comparing their usage with theatre usage in the private sector suggests they are not being used for the same number of hours.  How can that issue be overcome?  I know it is a staffing issue and that it is necessary to work with staff from all sectors, but how can that issue be dealt with?</p></speech>

It is staffing, and it requires agreement from a large group of people.  It is not just doctors, surgeons and anaesthetists; it is the laboratory technicians, the porter staff, the nursing staff, the operating theatre staff and the day case staff.  There have been proposals-----</p></speech>

At present, we have these operating theatre sessions in day case units working five days a week.  There are proposals to operate them seven days a week, but that will obviously have staffing requirements and flexibility in work requirements.  However, as the Deputy has identified with the surgeon he was talking to, there is a willingness on the surgeon's behalf to perform surgeries.  When the surgeon worked in the United States, and I worked there myself, people would have had routine operations on Saturdays and Sundays.  In fact, in the hospital I worked in, the patient would be admitted to a hotel the night before, would be woken up at 4 a.m. to have a computed axial tomography, CAT, scan and then be in the outpatient clinic for 8 a.m. to have the decision made on surgery for that afternoon.  It is a much more condensed episode of care, not multiple episodes as outpatients.  I am not sure we have the resources in our system to go to that because it is a fully-funded, private health insurance system in those situations in the United States, but there is certainly a lot more ability and efficiency to be driven in our system with the appropriate-----</p></speech>

The figures I have are up to October of last year.  It is about having staff and then making sure they are able to work in the facilities and have access to theatres, wards or whatever.  In December 2014, there were 103,028 working in the HSE and, last October, there were 131,000, which is a 27.7% increase.  I know we are looking for more staff.  However, we have additional staff, but the question is whether they are able to function and access theatres, procedure rooms and so forth.  Is enough being done in trying to deal with the staff we have as regards making sure they are able to do all the work they want to do?</p></speech>

The numbers employed in the HSE and the health service overall do not all work in hospitals.  Going back to the Sl&aacute;intecare model, many people have been hired in the past year to address the chronic care in the community programmes.</p></speech>

There is a 27.7% increase in HSE staff since December 2014.  The increase in public health nurses is 4.05%.  It has gone from 1,480 to 1,543, an increase of 60.  The figure for home help has gone down from 3,703 in 2014 to 3,552 in 2021.  If we are focusing on community care, we must have the staff and that does not appear to be happening.</p></speech>

However, looking specifically at the hospitals, there have been increases in hospital staff over the period, but we have been going through that Covid scenario where we have had buddy staff working arrangements for bringing Covid patients from one ward to another, up to radiography, into X-ray suites or into operating theatre suites.  We have hired a lot more cleaning staff to deal with Covid.  It has not been the ideal time to look at how efficiently the hospitals work because it has been a completely different work practice with the personal protective equipment, PPE, and having people monitor people putting PPE on and off, which technically is not a very productive job but is necessary during a public health emergency.</p></speech>

There are many new services in which nurses and other healthcare professionals now work that were not there prior to Covid.  The modest increase is staffing those services.</p> <p>  To answer the question in respect of acute-only hospitals, the TrolleyGAR, which is the HSE's trolley count figure, only reflects patients in EDs.  Our count reflects and counts patients who are admitted on trolleys anywhere in the hospital.  That is why the figure is usually higher.  For example, today we have recorded over 500 patients on trolleys, 80 of whom are throughout the hospital in various units and corridors.  The HSE does not count those whereas we do.</p> <p>  It is important to look at why theatre time is not provided, which was the question originally asked by the Deputy.  That is usually because there is no bed available for the patient who requires a bed post surgery.  Many patients return post procedure to a trolley in ED for emergencies.  Surely that is not what we are advocating.  We have surgeons who work in private and public hospitals so that goes back to the contract.  I am not getting into that discussion but there are issues relating to public-only contracts and we support Sl&aacute;intecare's position on that.</p> <p>  It is important if acute-only hospitals are concentrating on day cases that we state clearly that patients who require admission will have to be put in an ambulance and transferred to a hospital where they have an inpatient bed.  If the day surgery hospital is the model and it closes at 5 o'clock on a Friday evening, there will be patients who will require care over the weekend in some instances.  That again will put further pressure on the acute hospital.  The model should be to provide inpatient beds on a 24-7 basis because that will reduce waiting lists and release the pressure on the acute emergency hospitals and the departments that are currently under such pressure.</p> <p>  In respect of bureaucracy, as we are saying, particularly in the reference to recruitment, it is so difficult to get through the red tape and recruit.  Many hospitals still rely on agency staff because it is so difficult to replace staff and get through the bureaucracy that has become the machine of recruitment in the HSE in particular.  The voluntary hospitals have a little bit more control.  We need to get that cleared because if someone wants to work and is willing to come to work, bureaucratic obstacles should not be placed in his or her way.  I hope I have answered the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I was struck by Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha comment that the HSE does not count certain patients on trolleys whereas the INMO does.  It seems most unethical and immoral that the HSE does not count the figures but the INMO does.  The HSE seems to be grossly neglecting its responsibility to have accurate figures.  We know the INMO counts these patients but we should be shocked to learn that the HSE does not count them.  It is unacceptable.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions on Sl&aacute;intecare.  Do the witnesses have confidence in the current Sl&aacute;intecare personnel given the hiccups that its various teams have had over the past while?  Are they confident that we will achieve the roll-out of Sl&aacute;intecare as envisioned, needed and promised or will we end up with a piecemeal or hodgepodge version of Sl&aacute;intecare that will not serve anyone?  Are they confident we will get Sl&aacute;intecare as envisaged or are we all jumping around hoping for the best?</p></speech>

We have such huge capacity issues across the health system.  While no one can question the value of Sl&aacute;intecare, where is the capacity?  As many as 2,000 additional consultants and 5,000 additional beds are required, yet all we are talking about here are small day-case hospitals in three areas.  There is no plan to recruit additional consultants to the scale required and we cannot even recruit and retain the consultants we have.</p></speech>

The previous chief executive of the HSE said that it should have been front-loaded with a dedicated build early on in play to generate public confidence, early wins and support.  Five years down the line, there does not seem to be a willingness to invest in Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is the same as every other report that has come before.  The Department of Health has produced some fantastic reports but they have not all been implemented.  If they were implemented, we would not be here having a discussion about capacity.  A report compiled by the Department of Health 20 years ago recommended an additional 5,000 beds.  Had those beds been put in place, we would be having a discussion, one about a four-week waiting list rather than the current four-year waiting list in some services.</p></speech>

We certainly do not imagine it will happen any time in the future unless there is fundamental change to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, inclusive of, at the highest level of the Government, responsibility for implementation.  We have gone further than that in our submission and said that this is fundamental.  Ms McGowan works in a hospital and can give a first-hand account of patients not being treated in a manner that would be classified as dignified or safe in most of our emergency departments.  That is not due to any fault of those who work in these departments but simply because of the environment, overcrowding and missed care.  The long waits on trolleys, as stated earlier, are now causing problems for recovery and people are having negative outcomes as a result.</p><p>In addition, we now have cross-infection with Covid and airborne disease.  Imagine 520 people on trolleys today in overcrowded environments with an airborne pathogen in the environment.  It is simply wrong.  It is inhumane.  Unless there is real action taken to implement and fast-track Sl&aacute;intecare, it will not change.  We cannot change it but we will continue to highlight every single day what is inappropriate, what is inhumane and what is simply not tolerable for patients or for staff.</p></speech>

It has to be a Government decision and, as Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha said, we need the involvement of the Taoiseach.  I mentioned earlier, and it is worth repeating, that our view in F&oacute;rsa is we need a high-level role for the social partners.  This is something for the whole country; it is something for every citizen in the country.  Citizens want it and workers want it.  We asked in our submission and I am still asking what is the real inhibitor.  It is not us and it is nobody in this room.  I would still say that, yes, I can see Sl&aacute;intecare being implemented but it will take a whole-of-government approach.  It was a whole-of-government approach that introduced it but it needs to be driven at the highest level.</p></speech>

I have only been in this role for two years and we have had Covid in the middle of all of that.  However, it seems this predates Covid.  It seems we are constantly talking about what could be, but I do not know where the movement is coming from to make that a reality.  Maybe that is because I am being cynical.  We in the Labour Party are enormous supporters of a single-tier healthcare system, so it is very frustrating, and I can only imagine how frustrating it is for the witnesses.  I am sitting here, looking at the whole thing, and it is immensely frustrating.</p> <p>  I want to raise two other issues.  Is it fair to say overcrowding and what the witnesses are describing is having an impact on recruitment?  I think it is having an impact, particularly on nursing, and I do not know that we have fully got to grips with this in terms of the impact it is having.  The witnesses might be able to expand on this.  I talk to a number of student nurses and midwives and my mouth nearly hits the floor whenever one of them says, &ldquo;I am going to stay and try to work in emergency.&rdquo;  I reply &ldquo;What?&rdquo; because it seems crazy to me.  It is unusual for me to know someone who says they are going to stay here.  It is fair to say it is impacting on recruitment but perhaps the witnesses would expand further on that.  Core pay is a core issue but I also think we are not getting to grips with the wider issue.  We talk about overcrowding in terms of it being bad for the patient and so on, but this obviously has a long-term impact on our ability even to roll out Sl&aacute;intecare because we are just not at it, so to speak.</p></speech>

I went to Australia two years ago for a conference and made a point of going to a particular hospital in Perth to meet some medical colleagues.  We have 700 interns a year, which is the first year after coming out of medical school.  In that particular year, 380 of the 700 left Ireland to go to Perth.  They did not see their future working in the Irish health service.  They saw there were better terms and conditions, lifestyle and work-life balance in Australia, and Australia has been a major beneficiary of our medical graduates for the past ten years.  In fact, there are probably more medical graduates from Irish medical schools now working in Australia than there are in Ireland, such has been the volume of exports.  That obviously stopped during Covid, but there are now a large number of people pooled up who are all trying to leave, which is going to lead to a big issue as to where we get the middling 30, 35 and 40-year-old group of doctors who we would see as being the future of our health service in the country, because they are not going to be here.  They will be abroad getting family life and structures set up abroad, and it will make it very difficult to recruit them back.</p> <p>  If these are the people who are now being made to work excessive hours and not getting their rest breaks, and we are saying we want to try to recruit them back to the country, they will not have trust in that as an employer of choice because they have had a different service and a different experience overseas.  We have to compete with that.  We have to look at that and ask how we structure career prospects for these people.  We are currently saying people are appointed to a job for two years but they are going to spend six months in Dublin, six months in Waterford, six months in Wexford and six months in Clonmel.  How do people manage a family life like that?  It is very difficult, yet that is what we are expecting people to do.  On the other hand, if they go to Australia, they work in one city, one hospital, for five or ten years in a row.</p></speech>

However, I will not go into workforce planning.  When talking about trolleys, it was said that the patients are not counted and, therefore, staff are not assigned.  I want to make sure I heard that correctly because that would mean staff numbers do not take account of the fact there are going to be so many people on trolleys in different hospitals.  Is my understanding correct?</p></speech>

Emergency departments, as an environment, in general have between 12 and 20 spaces and they can have between 50 and 60 patients in them at any one time, but they are staffed for the 12 to 20 spaces, not for the 60.  If we have a sudden surge tonight at the department I work in and I go looking for additional nursing staff, I will be told they are not available and there is nowhere to find them at short notice.  It is okay if we want to book agency staff for next week or the week after for planned leave periods but we cannot get them at short notice, which means the staff who are there have to work harder and are under a lot more pressure, not getting their breaks and not even getting toilet breaks at times because of the volume of work in those emergency departments.</p></speech>

Every single time we are discussing this and every time the witnesses and this cohort come in, my mouth is just hanging open.  It just seems crazy and, I would say, immoral, unethical and inhumane on both patients and staff.  It is crazy we are standing over this.  It seems absolutely crazy.</p></speech>

We have probably around the same number who are on the register but working abroad, and they will probably never come back.  It is a huge issue.  We are crying out for doctors and the biggest problem is the working conditions they are in.  They are junior doctors.  They had experiences in training where they were working excessive hours.  They are burnt out and fatigued, and they are just saying they trained and are out of here, that they are not going to put up with what their colleagues and superiors are doing.</p></speech>

We have to refer very regularly to the Workplace Relations Commission for increased staffing when the volume of patients increases.  Every day, as the Irish Medical Organisation has just pointed out, we have sometimes two wards' worth of patients for whom there is no allocation of nurses.  Even worse, we have examples where trolleys are being moved from emergency departments, EDs, into different areas so they do not form part of the count.  To our mind, that is absolutely scandalous.  That is not looking after the patient.  That is making sure the trolley count figure is low and that is simply not acceptable.  We raise that with each hospital manager in each site when it happens because our figures, regardless of where the trolley is, are counted on the basis that that is the true and accurate figure, which must be recorded because the consequences for patients and the consequences of not having proper staffing are that care is not delivered.</p></speech>

We had Covid and then we had hope with the vaccination, and that curbed it, but there is no vaccination that is going to curb this overcrowding.  There is hope with Sl&aacute;intecare and there is a pathway to get out of this.  That is how we need to retain our staff, make it more attractive and improve the conditions we have.</p></speech>

We have had an informative discussion, although one might feel we are going over old ground.  I listened to Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha's engagement with previous speakers, particularly on the issue of UHL.  We all agree there has been significant Government investment in the hospital, including in the emergency unit and the 60-bed modular unit.  As a politician for the region, these are the things people asked for, as well as the 96-bed unit, which, in real terms, will provide only half that number because of the decommissioning of certain wards and so on.  I have thought long and hard about what the problem is in Limerick, which is a problem that does not seem to be as acute in other areas.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha spoke about the flow through emergency departments and the issue of delayed discharges.  In particular, she spoke about the lack of on-duty clinical management at times.  Will she elaborate on that lack of clinical management and how bad it is?  What knock-on effects does it have in terms of the situation in emergency units and what we are seeing in Limerick?</p> <p>  Will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha also comment on the review?  Her opening statement indicates that HIQA has more or less washed its hands of it, saying it does not believe there is any merit in its carrying out a further inquiry.  Based on that, I agree with her that it should be done by somebody independent.  If that is the view HIQA has taken, what is the point in commissioning it to undertake a further inquiry?  I would like her comments on that and perhaps a suggestion as to who should carry out an independent inquiry.</p> <p>  In terms of other facilities, the challenges in Limerick are obvious but there are challenges in other areas as well.  What is the significant problem in Limerick that does not exist in other areas?  Why is Limerick constantly at the top when it comes to numbers on trolleys?  Other areas have problems in this regard but do not seem to hit the same numbers.  Of the 520 patients periodically on trolleys, as Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha referred to, at least 20% of them are in Limerick.  I am trying to figure out what is being done differently in other areas such that the problem is not as acute as it is in Limerick.  I would like to hear her thoughts on those points.</p></speech>

We know that the 24-7 nature of healthcare delivery means that clinical teams must be led by senior clinicians.  We note that admissions, and the ratio of attendance versus admission, are higher in some hospitals than in others.  We looked further into that and asked the HSE for statistics.  We are disappointed that the emergency department task force meeting has not been held, despite our seeking it, because it would give us a lot of this information and, from that, we could determine how matters might be improved.  For example, if the attendance to admission ratio is higher in some hospitals, we have to look at why that is so.  If it happens between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m., which it does in some hospitals, we must look then at the seniority of the admitting doctor.  If consultants are on duty during that period, we find, in many instances, that the admission rate reduces because they have the clinical confidence to say to a patient that he or she can go home and come back to the outpatients department tomorrow or be sent for further referrals, if necessary.  It is about clinical confidence and the seniority of the clinician making the decisions.  When we see increased admission rates between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m., we must ask that question.</p> <p>  Furthermore, we see many patients attending who have not been seen in the community by GPs, largely, the latter tell us, because they do not have that capacity.  We are seeing an increase in children being admitted and attending hospital emergency departments, particularly in the out-of-hours period, whose parents say they have not been able to access GPs.  There is a whole load of issues and the nub of it is there is no one problem that can be fixed at a site like Limerick.  There is history there whereby reconfiguration left it with a lot of problems.  The independent review must take into account the availability of beds in Nenagh and Ennis and how they are being used, as well as what services are being curtailed because of the lack of beds on the site in Dooradoyle and whether services for older people could be supported.  The most recent statistics we have seen show there is a higher number of over-75s attending there.  The independent review should and must take all of that into account and we also need to look at how patient flow happens through a region as opposed to just concentrating on a particular site.  Last week, there were four discharges from one of our major acute hospitals between Friday and Monday.</p></speech>

When we have an agreement in place - which we do, namely, the escalation policy - and any hospital has overcrowding to the level we have seen in all of our hospitals since last November, we then expect there to be very regular ward rounds focused on discharge and, in addition, an examination of instances, which we know are happening, where patients are being admitted because they cannot access diagnostics.  We have examples of patients being admitted on a Friday for a scan on a Tuesday.</p></speech>

Two smaller emergency departments were closed and now the patients are being brought on an extended journey to UHL.  If those patients arrive late into the evening, there is an HSE target time of six hours from the patient arriving to discharge, which could end up being 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.  At that time, there is often great difficulty in trying to get those patients back home.  The default in that scenario and the safest thing to do is to admit those patients at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. rather than discharging them into an area with no public transport and no ambulance that can convey them back home because of the shortage in the ambulance service.  Therefore, we have a structural difficulty.  If the hospital were able to engage ambulance services to work predominantly for the hospital on a 24-hour basis to take the patients home again-----</p></speech>

For example, we had an assault on Monday.  There is no predictable time.  One needs to think of people who are in a horrendous environment for a prolonged period of time.  They may have a mental illness.  It is a form of torture, as previously highlighted by colleagues.  There is only so much people can take and then they break.  That is no excuse either, but everybody has a breaking point.  When that happens, it is unpredictable.  In the emergency environment, it is very dangerous.</p></speech>

I would like to return to the discussion on the retention of graduate nurses and doctors in this country.  No single issue is solely to blame for this problem.  Issues like pay, the cost of living, work pressures and the draw of living abroad have to be considered.  Do we have any figures on the percentage of nurses and doctors who eventually return home?  It might be their plan when many of them go out that they would return home.  Do we know how many actually come back after a period of time abroad?</p></speech>

The Medical Council keeps the register and many people who have re-registered have not been off the register.  The numbers are small.  It tends to happen when people are in their 40s or 50s and looking at a different settling period in life.  We do not have hard figures on that.  By walking into hospitals and looking at the profile of the staff, one can see people in their early to mid-20s and people from their 40s and 50s on.  The group in the middle seems to be quite small.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1441" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030900002#Q02100"><p>Just to answer that from a nurse and midwife perspective, we survey our graduate nurses the January before they graduate every year.  We have done that for the past four years.  Every survey indicates the same thing, which is that they want to stay in Ireland working in the Irish public health service for at least the first year post graduation to consolidate their training.  It is the system that is forcing them out.  Some will decide to travel and some will decide not to travel.  Last year the retention was improved but, again, one has to take into account all of the travel restrictions.</p> <p>  We are also seeing many nurses attempting to return.  Again, there are delays in registering with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI.  There are some delays in getting registered that can be corrected.  That is a simple enough fix.  If that is delaying the return, it needs to be fixed.  Whatever it takes to invest in additional staffing, and whatever the NMBI needs, must be looked at because that is a simple enough issue to fix.  When people want to return, we should be making it as easy as possible for them to return.  We also had a programme whereby if staff returned to work in the Irish public health service, there were incentives.  As a trade union, we have had to pursue those incentives because they are not paid.  The promise is made, and the circular is there, but then one has to follow it and pursue it via the industrial relations channels.  If we are serious about making it attractive to come back, all of the agreements that are in place must be implemented and promoted as an incentive and enticement to come back.</p></speech>

If someone wants to come back and is promised incentives but does not get them, word will go back to people in Australia, Canada or elsewhere that Ireland is promising but not delivering on its promises.  That is not good enough.  We might have to try to follow that up with the Minister as well.</p></speech>

There is another group that is hidden and forgotten in this, and that is the group of Irish students who go to Europe to gain their medical degrees.  While they get all of the technical knowledge in the various courses through the university and get a degree, they have difficulty integrating back into the system here because they have not done the Irish legal system in their medical training and they have not worked in the hospital system to understand what the processes are for managing certain types of patients here.  We developed a programme with University College Dublin, UCD, to try to help to bridge these doctors back into the working system.  We put a proposal to the HSE but we have not been able to get it funded.  There are hundreds of Irish medical students who have already spent a period of time in Europe getting a degree and want to come here, but the UK system has developed a process for them to integrate into the UK.  We are losing them to the UK when we could actually do with them here.</p></speech>

Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha said earlier in relation to a question about Limerick that 100 beds made no difference.  I do not want to misquote her.  Is that because there were not enough beds, there was not enough staffing, there was not enough utilisation or there were other issues at stake?  What did she mean in that case?  Obviously, we are all advocating for beds.  Some 100 beds is not insignificant but she said it made no difference.  Can she expand on that?</p></speech>

That is why we are saying that in most cases increased capacity helps.  When it does not, it poses a question.  That is why we are looking for the independent review to examine why that increased inpatient bed capacity did not improve the overcrowding situation, as one would have imagined it should have done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030900002#R00200"><p>Perfect.</p> <p>  As for the elective care issues, I think Dr. Molloy or someone else stated that we really need 24-7 inpatient beds in conjunction with elective hospitals.  We have this debate in Galway because there are plans for an elective hospital at Merlin Park and for the emergency department at University Hospital Galway, UHG.  Depending on traffic, there is a serious distance between them.  Effectively, we have a day hospital only, with no inpatient beds, yet we have one of the highest levels of overcrowding.  Certainly, we did before Christmas and the neighbouring period, when one in eight patients in Galway, or 12%, was on a trolley, yet we had no acute beds under the winter plan because there was no physical space.  An elective hospital is proposed with the promise of acute beds on the never-never.  I am concerned about this.  I have always been concerned but I am even more concerned about the testimonies here that we really need inpatient beds in conjunction with elective hospitals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1448" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mick Molloy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030900002#R00300"><p>The two things go hand in hand.  There are four streams of healthcare, as we mentioned earlier: chronic, acute, emergency and elective.  The elective patients are the ones who tend to suffer because their care can be postponed.  The other elements tend to be a little more immediate and take place in the emergency department or the outpatient department.  People in cancer treatment and people needing cancer surgeries have to get that care immediately.  It happens straight away.  However, when people are put on a waiting list, they remain on a waiting list for a long time, hence the need to separate the two groups of patients.  Unless there is a significant build in the inpatient facilities, we do not have the capacity to deal with all those elective patients immediately, so those elective hospitals do have a role.  A lot of this can be dealt with as day cases but not all of it.  Some of it will still require the benefit of a large inpatient facility with additional critical care capacity.  Cardiac bypass or cardiac transplant cannot be done as a day case.  All that work will still need to be done.</p> <p>  Critical care capacity needs to be enhanced.  There was a report in 2009 suggesting our critical care capacity should be 550 beds.  After Covid, I think up to 340 beds is our plan at the moment.  We will still be well short of what we need in critical care capacity to deal with the volume of the service required at present, so both those elements are required.  In the Senator's region in Galway, UHG needs significant expansion in its emergency department.  Having been involved in two emergency departments that were new builds, I suggest that very close attention should be paid to the plans that are developed.  In both the facilities in which I was involved the places were cut down in size before they were opened.  We have now seen the need for them to be increased in size.  We should therefore be very careful when the plans are put down that they are not cut back to save some money here and there.  If the plan is for 50 or 60 spaces, it should be 50 or 60 spaces.  That is what is required.  Any of the hospitals in the United States or the UK that function well have significant numbers of spaces for patients to be managed.  We expect many of our people to sit on chairs in corridors, which is inappropriate.  We have many people waiting in waiting rooms while other patients get their treatment, but they get their antibiotics and fluids while sitting in a waiting area commingling with the patients who are waiting to be seen, which is not acceptable.</p></speech>

Mayo has 27, Sligo has 13 and Letterkenny has 46.  That healthcare group has a chronic overcrowding problem, and one hospital cannot help the other.  Clearly, if there are 54 patients on trolleys, that are almost two wards on trolleys in the emergency department, and nothing else will happen in that hospital because it cannot.  They are not day cases; they are inpatients.  They have been admitted because they are sick enough to require hospital care.</p></speech>

Governments often get blamed, of course, in respect of funding, but funding is not available unless plans are put forward and progressed.  There are effectively no plans by Saolta for inpatient beds at UHG.  They were not even provided under the winter plan.  There is no physical space and there are still no plans.</p></speech>

I will let them in in a moment.</p> <p>  I have a couple of comments to make.  I have been one of those people who has been on a trolley.  I have been in an emergency department where there were no free trolleys or chairs.  I have been there with a loved one who was dying in the hospital system.  People have their own experiences as to how good or how bad the system is in that regard.  I had just last week a man in my constituency office who said people have this idea that they will be able to get a cup of tea or something to eat in an emergency department.  Someone can be nine hours in an emergency department and the vending machine will be empty.  The man in my constituency office said the only thing left in the machine when he was there was sugary popcorn.  This is an elderly man who was seriously ill at the time.  There are all these lived experiences.</p> <p>  What we are talking about this morning is the overcrowding crisis in our hospitals.  There has been collective agreement, judging from many of the submissions, that the solution is Sl&aacute;intecare.  As the witnesses will probably be aware, every two months, following the collapse of the oversight group for the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, the committee has tried to bring in the two chief executives, Paul Reid and Robert Watt, to discuss that.  In their latest submission to us they said 87.9% of the Sl&aacute;intecare goals are on track.  The witnesses say clearly in their submissions that this change is not visible.  We in the Opposition hear every day that more money is being put into the health service than ever before, but is that view of Sl&aacute;intecare and its roll-out borne out in the experience of the witnesses' members?  I am conscious that what we have heard today is a clear cry for help about assaults on staff and so on.  There is clearly something we as a committee can do about that.  It would be interesting to follow up on the health and safety legislation, the amendments to it and so on.  If the witnesses have suggestions for amendments they feel need to be made in that area or something positive the committee could do, we will certainly follow that up, including with the chief executive and the head of the Department of Health.  We will have them in here in the next month or so.  What is the witnesses' experience of Sl&aacute;intecare?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1452" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCamley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030900002#R00700"><p>As outlined in our submission, we just find progress incredibly slow.  That is not unusual for the health service in respect of implementing reports and reviews, and a number of speakers have alluded to that.  We certainly have a fear that the slowness in dealing with these issues and the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare is having an effect on our members.  In preparation for our submission, we spoke to our officials and local representatives across the country.  We have reports back from people in the emergency services who are now contemplating just leaving.  These are people who have a number of years' experience and who are valuable to the service now saying they will either just leave it entirely for a different career or go abroad.</p><p>That is right across the grades, including nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants, radiographers and ambulance staff.  It is very frustrating for us, particularly in those areas.  The struggles we undertook to get student nurses and midwives something for carrying out clinical placements and proper travel allowances have been alluded to but there are other grades, including radiation therapists and radiographers, who do not receive anything when doing clinical placements.  These are areas in which there are chronic shortages.  There is going to be an issue with the delivery of radiation therapy because of the lack of radiation therapists who treat cancer patients in the country.  That is an area that is going to come to the fore because of the waiting lists and what has happened over the last two years.  We are seeking a review into that.  A review has been granted but it is progressing incredibly slowly.  Among our members, there is a general feeling that there is slowness in trying to develop anything.  When we do get an independent report, the implementation of that report is often painfully slow.  The main battles relate to the implementation of reports rather than getting reports done.  In some cases, as others have indicated, it is very difficult to even get reports agreed.  As I have said before, there are definitely issues in respect of morale and burnout.  These need to be resolved.  We need action from health employers and the Department of Health in that regard.</p></speech>

I do not want to go over all of the ground because I am conscious of the time but we saw the response of the health unions to the health emergency during the pandemic.  What the committee is hearing from us this morning is that this is the other health emergency.  It does not need to take five years.  I mentioned that we have had operational engagement with the employers in respect of parts of Sl&aacute;intecare but there has been no strategic involvement with all of the unions.  That needs to happen and it needs to be driven and focused.  The union side will not be found wanting.  We were not found wanting when it came to the pandemic.</p> <p>  One of the key issues for F&oacute;rsa, which is a flaw at the moment, is that there is no health and social care professional adviser in the Minister's office in the Department of Health.  There are 26 or 27 health and social care professional grades.  The HSE has a beautiful document called HSCP Deliver 2021-2026.  Much of Sl&aacute;intecare will be delivered through health and social care professionals, HSCPs.  One example of such a professional is the clinical measurement physiologist in a hospital.  I am going to get the terminology wrong and will be murdered by my members.  The work these physiologists do on echocardiograms leads to early discharges.  We have been trying to get a report from 2010 implemented, which would involve looking at workforce planning in respect of these vital grades.</p> <p>  Health and social care professionals are years behind our nursing colleagues with regard to advanced practice.  If advanced practice was introduced for physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, with the right numbers and physiotherapists operating at an advanced practice level, orthopaedic waiting lists could be cut.  The Minister gave a commitment to F&oacute;rsa nearly two years ago that an adviser would be brought in to advise him on health and social care professionals.  How can anyone implement a system-wide reform involving a multidisciplinary approach without someone giving advice?  We call on the Minister to make good on that promise as part of driving Sl&aacute;intecare forward.</p></speech>

Our colleague, the previous speaker, mentioned the need for physiology measurements such as echocardiograms in hospitals.  If Sl&aacute;intecare was taken to its ultimate extreme and there was free and open access to healthcare across the system for every patient in the State, general practice would be overwhelmed.  There would be a group of people, usually men in their 40s and 50s, who do not now get examined suddenly being diagnosed with conditions.  This will immediately result in more referrals to hospital for acute care.  Over 30 or 40 years, that will all balance out but, in the beginning, there will be a surge in demand for services unless we can front-load and get those services and beds in now.  Our biggest concern about Sl&aacute;intecare is that we are not looking at the two sides at the same point.  We are looking at chronic care and almost ignoring the crisis that is now happening because we are focused on that chronic care.  Right now, we have a crisis in emergency and acute care that we need to address, in addition to Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1457" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030900002#S00500"><p>On implementation, the Chairman has said that the information he has is that 82% of the aspirations have been implemented but one only has to look at the overcrowding figures and the evidence from our members to see that there are admissions to acute hospitals for diagnostics.  Diagnostics are not available in the community to any level that would alleviate the problem of the necessity for GPs to tell people to go to hospitals, sometimes at 6 a.m., in order to be in the queue for CAT scans and other diagnostic tests.  It simply is not working.  The making of diagnostics available outside of acute hospitals is too slow.</p> <p>  Likewise, 82% of all care of the older person long-term care services have been privatised.  We saw what happened during the Covid pandemic, we saw what the Oireachtas committee on Covid recommended with regard to revisiting that issue and now we see the HSE's service plan, which was published last week, not making any reference to undoing the privatisation of long-term care.  In fact, from the manner in which it is set out, I believe the service plan will further reduce the availability of long-stay public beds.  Sl&aacute;intecare makes very clear recommendations in respect of the public service providing acute and long-term care.  That is certainly not happening and will not happen if this year's service plan is anything to go by.</p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare also recommends regional health authorities and the integration of hospital and community care.  They should be acting as one but that is not happening.  We have separate budgets, which is certainly an issue on which Sl&aacute;intecare is very clear.  There is no evidence of change in that regard.  Likewise, the recommendation on devolving decision-making away from the centre is not progressing.  We have put those questions in our submission.  When the committee has an opportunity to meet the HSE, we request that it put those specific questions.</p></speech>

I was watching from my office because I have been in and out of the Chamber.  I will confine my questions to University Hospital Limerick, UHL.  Senator Conway has already asked some of the questions I wanted to ask.  There are 562 beds in the hospital.  An extra 60 have recently been provided.  It has been stated over and over again how they have not been of benefit with regard to the number of people on trolleys and waiting lists.  It has been acknowledged this morning that UHL has some of the longest waits on trolleys.</p> <p>  I want to look at the area of neurology nurses, of whom there is a shortage.  An extra three were taken on in UHL recently.  Sometimes, if people can be treated and given pain management, they do not necessarily need to be taken into hospital.  Is that an area that needs further investment?  I know there is still a shortage.  </p> <p>  How many beds do the witnesses believe are needed in the UHL group, which covers six hospitals?  St. John's Hospital only has ten beds for procedures.  There was a proposal at one stage when Deputy Harris was the Minister for Health.  Consideration was given to including 120 replacement beds in the capital programme.  There was room on site for them.  These 120 beds would also accommodate those who were already there, leaving approximately 90 beds in the hospital for procedures.  Do the witnesses have any comments in that regard?</p></speech>

There is a need for a full independent review into that hospital.  That is not to apportion blame.  There is a crisis in many acute hospitals but there is a real problem in Limerick.  There are accountability issues as well.  While we rightly acknowledge the capacity issues in hospitals, and it is our job as politicians to make sure the health service is properly equipped, has the resources and staff and that policies are in place to ensure hospitals are fit for purpose, there is also a need for accountability and it seems to me there is a lack of accountability in some hospitals.  In fact, there is a lack of accountability across the HSE.  There is a need for this committee to call for and support an independent review into what is happening in Limerick because it is not fair on patients or staff.  Every week we hear horror stories of patients waiting far too long.</p> <p>  My final point relates to something in the opening statement from the INMO.  The fact we have become desensitised to what is happening in our hospitals and hospital trolley waits is something in and of itself.  The INMO rightly said we should take a zero tolerance approach to emergency department waits.  Such an approach being adopted by Government, Opposition and across the political system means we have to commit resources and, when they are committed, any failures in management need to be addressed.  It is unacceptable that day after day and week after week the trolley figures are published and are the same if not worse.  It is not being resolved.  I echo and support the calls made for a review into University Hospital Limerick.</p></speech>

That only relates to large hospitals.  We have quite a lot of moderate-sized hospitals in our model 3 hospitals.  They are not supposed to operate at beyond 75%.  Smaller hospitals should not be operating at more than 65% because that means they are able to cope with a sudden extra five or ten people.  At the moment, there are days when the whole system is operating at more than 100%.  That is not safe and is dangerous for everybody involved.  To get that figure down, we need to increase capacity.  We are asking for urgent modular build as soon as possible rather than waiting for a ten-year capital plan.  It has to be immediate.  We have been discussing this since 2000, when the Taoiseach was the Minister for Health, and it has not changed.  There are fewer acute beds now than there were then.</p></speech>

There is a requirement for additional specialist nursing in a lot of chronic disease management but neurology is particularly remarkable.  Unfortunately, the level of diagnosis in that area is increasing.  Certainly, there is a need.</p> <p>  On bed numbers and what we believe is necessary, the Sl&aacute;intecare report sets out that we will need increased inpatient beds but will not need as many if we get the community piece right.  We advocate getting that piece right, doing it quickly and looking at the acute bed increases set out in the capacity report.</p> <p>  In respect of the areas that have been reconfigured, we have had the mid-west reconfiguration, which saw a reduction in beds in Nenagh and Ennis and in the times they are open, especially in their emergency departments.  We need to look at whether that was the right model.  When we did not increase the bed numbers in Dooradoyle, it clearly was not.  We need to look at what is needed, given the increased population and need and the slowness in implementing community change.  We will not prescribe it here.  We are saying we need an independent review to examine that matter.</p></speech>

We did an audit on an advanced practice internal clinic.  It saved 8,740 bed days in its service.  That is massive.  That is what advanced practice can do and how effective it is.  That is why this needs to be supported and pushed by Government.</p></speech>

T&aacute; &euro;1.2 billi&uacute;n sa leithdh&aacute;ileadh ioml&aacute;n do V&oacute;ta 33 in 2022, m&eacute;ad&uacute; de thart ar 8% ar an bhfigi&uacute;r inchompar&aacute;ide do 2021.  &Eacute;asc&oacute;idh an maoini&uacute; m&eacute;adaithe seo sraith bearta substainti&uacute;la chun na hearn&aacute;lacha a bhfuil m&eacute; f&eacute;in mar Aire freagrach astu a thac&uacute; agus a neart&uacute; agus iad ag dul in oiri&uacute;int don, agus ag teacht chucu f&eacute;in &oacute;n, dochar nach bhfacthas riamh a d'eascair as paind&eacute;im Covid-19.  These sectors are both wide-ranging and valuable and were among those most severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Employing many hundreds of thousands throughout the country, these are the sectors that thrive when people congregate to enjoy their leisure time together.  Our cultural institutions and theatres, live performances, tourism destinations, sporting occasions and Gaeltacht communities have all been severely impacted for almost two years.  The public health measures necessitated by Covid enabled us to protect the most vulnerable in our society through our collective action but also had such a negative impact on the way we have lived our lives for the past two years, for example, our ability to watch a match, to attend a live performance, to enjoy a weekend away with friends, to participate in the arts as well as the ability of artists, workers and businesses to provide these uniquely valued experiences.</p><p>As Minister, I am very pleased we are now in a position to enjoy the safe and successful reopening of our society and, with it, our tourism sector, our arts and culture venues and events, and the return of fans to our sports grounds.  The 2022 Revised Estimates for my Department have been informed by ongoing engagement with sectoral representatives.  The additional funding covers a wide range of initiatives and measures to support the resilience and growth of practitioners, businesses, communities and operations in the sectors overseen by my Department, with all efforts very much focused on both social and economic recovery.</p><p>I will outline total 2022 funding for the sectors supported by my Department.  There is &euro;288.5 million in funding for tourism services in 2022, which is an increase of &euro;67.6 million or 31% on the comparable 2021 allocation<b>.  </b>This additional funding includes a &euro;50 million provision for further business continuity support to help drive the sustainable recovery of the sector.  A &euro;35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund will support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland.  In addition, &euro;27 million<b></b>is allocated for a range of industry initiatives, including domestic marketing and festivals, investment in digital skills development, and staff retention, and &euro;36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development &ndash; an increase of almost &euro;4 million over the 2021 allocation &ndash; for the delivery of enhanced visitor experiences in line with the objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2030.</p><p><b></b>Some &euro;371.4 million<b></b>will be allocated to the arts and culture sector, including &euro;25 million to pilot a new basic income guarantee scheme for artists.  This measure was the key ask from the arts and culture recovery task force and will bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector.  The Arts Council maintains the record &euro;130 million<b></b>funding<b></b>allocated in 2021, allowing it to continue to protect the jobs and livelihoods of artists and assist arts organisations through financial difficulties and empowering it to play a strong role in supporting artists and arts organisations to flourish in the years ahead.  Some &euro;50 million is allocated for further supports for the live performance sector following on from the successful operation of a number of schemes in 2021, including the live performance support scheme, LPSS, the music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, and the events sector Covid support scheme, ESCSS, thereby supporting a successful return to full-scale performances.</p><p>The 2022 allocation for Screen Ireland is &euro;36.7 million, an increase of more than &euro;6.6 million on the 2021 allocation.  The audiovisual industry has been one of the success stories of the past two years and this additional funding will ensure the continued success and growth of this internationally renowned industry into the future.  Funding for this programme area includes the following: &euro;4 million to deliver a suite of initiatives proposed by the night-time economy task force; &euro;5 million in additional funding for the national cultural institutions to ensure they continue to provide high-quality services to the public and deliver progress in their ongoing programme of investment; and &euro;5 million to support the 2022 commemorative programme delivering rich and diverse national and local programmes marking the significant centenaries arising in 2022.</p><p> Funding of &euro;295.7 million will be provided for media and broadcasting in 2022, which includes &euro;5.5 million for the establishment of the new media commission and the appointment of an online safety commissioner to begin work on key issues following the enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill in 2022.  This allocation also provides for an increase of &euro;4.2 million, the largest ever funding increase for TG4, bringing its annual funding for 2022 up to &euro;44.9 million.  This additional funding will allow it to deliver its ambitious post-Covid strategy, focusing on news content and putting audiences centre stage.</p><p> In conclusion, I am satisfied the increased allocation for my Department in 2022 of &euro;1.222 billion will allow for the continuation and enhancement of its very diverse but critical work programmes.  As Minister, I intend to do everything possible to continue to support all the sectors for which I have responsibility as we emerge from the shadow of Covid-19, and I look forward to their future growth and successes.  I will now hand over to my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, to speak about the Revised Estimates for 2022 as they relate to sport.</p></speech>

There was a record number of applications for these grants and the Government responded with the most significant level of individual awards ever.  The increased allocation of &euro;34.5 million for the sports capital and equipment programme in 2022 reflects this commitment to investment in sport.</p> <p>  Current funding for Sport Ireland programmes totals &euro;96.21 million in 2022, enabling Sport Ireland to ensure the emergence of a strong and vibrant sport sector post Covid.  Measures support the implementation of the high-performance strategy approved by the Government in June last, equality in grant funding for female and male Gaelic players and core grant funding for sporting bodies.  The allocation also provides for increased funding for sports measures via the Dormant Accounts Fund and increased funding for initiatives to attract major sporting events to Ireland.</p> <p>  The overall 2022 allocation represents a significant investment in sport and builds on the extensive support packages provided to address the Covid-19 challenges to national governing bodies and clubs in 2020 and 2021.  I believe it will ensure the emergence of a strong and vibrant sports sector post Covid, which will provide opportunities for everyone to engage in sport and physical activity in all our communities.</p> <p>  The Minister and I will be happy to take any questions Deputies may have.</p></speech>

The bulk of the funding forms the State's share of the agreed North-South co-funding of Tourism Ireland's destination marketing of the island of Ireland overseas.  Given Tourism Ireland is a North-South body, it also receives funding from the Northern Ireland exchequer for its core overseas marketing.  The primary objective of the tourism marketing fund is to increase tourism revenue by attracting more overseas visitors to Ireland.  Irish tourism is marketed primarily on an island-of-Ireland basis and the majority of the tourism marketing fund goes toward Tourism Ireland's core funding for all-island overseas marketing activity.  A proportion of the non-core tourism marketing fund is allocated for the development of Ireland's specific product and regional marketing by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, to be delivered by Tourism Ireland as its overseas agent.</p></speech>

Tourism Ireland delivers marketing programmes in 21 markets throughout the world and reaches a global audience of more than 600 million each year.  The agency is doing incredible work and I have witnessed that in two missions I have undertaken, to the United States and, recently, to Dubai.  The work it is doing to sell our island as a destination at a time when that is so badly needed is incredible, not least because of the time and commitment that is given to it.  As an example of where the money goes, targeting market activity includes advertising online, on television, at outdoor sites, in cinemas, newspapers and magazines and through e-marketing, overseas publicity and co-operative marketing with carriers, other partners and promotions.  I have heard from the main tour operators to which they are trying to sell Ireland that at a time of absolute devastation in those early days of the pandemic, it was Tourism Ireland that reached out to the tour operators when others did not, and kept that relationship really special and valued.  They linked in with them and that is what is being remembered as tourism reopens.  That is all down to the incredible work Tourism Ireland does.</p></speech>

My point is we should ensure it is done on an equal basis for each region and for the four provinces.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland is delivering four new regional tourism strategies in 2022, setting out a ten-year vision and a five-year action plan for each region.  They will be activated through a series of local destination and experience development plans.  By the end of 2022, 27 of them will be live, while by 2025, every part of the country will have a destination development plan.  That should address some of the Deputy's concerns.  Each plan will be appropriate to a given region's level of tourism maturity.</p><p>The Deputy can look also at the incredible amount of funding provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland last year to develop tourism attractions, for example, in Westport, Donegal, Dublin and Cavan.  It was the largest funding ever announced by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which is constantly working on developing new destinations and attractions for tourism and sharing tourism out.</p></speech>

I live close to the Wild Atlantic Way.  Does the Minister have a breakdown of the programmes or the infrastructure?  I know she spoke previously about the regional strategies.  Is the &euro;36.5 million part of the four regional strategies that will be published very soon?</p></speech>

The Vice Chairman mentioned one of the four regional tourism experiences.  These are the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, the Hidden Heartlands and Dublin.  Tourism Ireland is promoting the island of Ireland in more than 21 markets.  Those four brands resonate with tourists, and they work very well.  In terms of F&aacute;ilte Ireland-supported capital projects, although restrictions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic may have delayed some openings, some examples of projects that were completed in recent years include the Butler Gallery in Kilkenny, the Blasket Islands viewing platform, which will open shortly, and Carlingford Castle.  The work is ongoing.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland allocated the sum of &euro;1.1 million to the Butler Gallery; &euro;1.7 million was allocated to the Blasket Islands viewing platform; Carlingford Castle got &euro;400,000; Nowth in Meath, where I was last week, received &euro;1.4 million; and the C&eacute;ide Fields visitor centre in Ballycastle, County Mayo, received a F&aacute;ilte Ireland investment of &euro;863,000.  Some of the F&aacute;ilte Ireland tourism projects due to be opened during 2022 include the Blasket Islands, the C&eacute;ide Fields, Avondale House, Strokestown Park, Mount Congreve House and Gardens and the Norman Heritage Park.  We are constantly building on the regional spread.  Much-needed investment is taking place.</p></speech>

I also thank each and every one of them for the work they did during the pandemic to support the sector.  What lessons can we learn from the engagement, as a result of the experience of supporting a sector that was particularly badly impacted by the pandemic and following the establishment of new links with elements of Irish cultural activity that perhaps the Department had not supported previously?  I have in mind the work of the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI.  I have heard it repeatedly said that in rushing back to normal, let us decide what parts of normal are worth going back to.  Will there be any change in approach in the Department's work or by the Arts Council in how it engages with and supports those who were supported for the first time during the pandemic?  Are there any plans to develop those linkages in the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1610" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOS2022030900002#C01900"><p>In general terms, the lesson that has been learned by everyone, not just the Department, is the value of the arts.  As an artist, Deputy Cannon will appreciate that.  We have often spoken about the value of arts and how we treasure it, but it really came to light during Covid.  A valuable lesson also is not just about the performers themselves, who of course are incredibly important, but also about the people who make these events happen - those who work backstage on whom the spotlight does not shine.  A light was shone on them, and it is my intention to keep that light firmly there.</p> <p>  We could not have designed the number of schemes we did without engagement.  From the first moment I became Minister, engagement and feedback have been key.  Schemes have been adjusted following engagement with those affected.  Although we are emerging from Covid, I would not see that as something that should ever stop.  It is essential that we continue to engage with the stakeholders through the forum that was set up to assess the recovery and their current needs.  Yesterday, we announced another new scheme, which is about helping people with the recovery.  That needs to continue.  Such engagement is evident also in what we are doing with the basic income.  The artists must shape what we do in the Department.  As far as I am concerned, the artists must be involved and at the table in any policy initiatives.  That is the lesson that has been learned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1483" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOS2022030900002#C02000"><p>I thank the Minister.  The creation of a universal basic income for artists is a truly groundbreaking move on the Minister's part.  Everyone, in his or her time as Minister, seeks to do exactly that, in other words, make a significant change that would impact on the lives of people long after he or she has exited the role.  I think of the work President Michael D. Higgins did when he was Minister, including the 1% for arts provision, the establishment of TG4 and various other wonderful things.  I congratulate the Minister on having the vision and ambition to make this happen.  This will be truly groundbreaking if and when - I always use the word "when" - we make it happen.  It is important that she gets the support of her Cabinet colleagues and the Government in general in making it happen.</p> <p>  I would be grateful for an update on where we are at right now.  Since the Minister first mentioned the proposition, an extraordinary number of artists have been in touch with me to ask if they would qualify and how they can make their voice heard right now in terms of being able to access the universal basic income when it becomes a reality.  Anything the Minister could say this morning to reassure the artists that this will be as encompassing and broadly supportive as possible would be much appreciated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1612" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOS2022030900002#D00100"><p>Engaging with the artists shows how essential that basic income is.  This was the number one recommendation that came from the artists themselves through the arts and culture recovery task force.  I was absolutely delighted to secure agreement within the Government on that.  I secured &euro;25 million in budget 2022 to launch this three-year basic income for arts pilot scheme.</p> <p>  The stakeholder engagement has been absolutely core.  We had the stakeholder forum in December followed by public consultation.  There were well over 1,000 pieces of feedback into that public consultation.  As I said, we received a significant number of submissions.  That reflects the high level of interest, which the Deputy talked about, in this key policy intervention.</p> <p>  The scheme will be open to practising and developing artists and creative arts workers.  It will be non-competitive.  Therefore, once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria, he or she will be included in a randomised selection process.  The eligibility criteria will be published as part of the scheme launch, which I hope to do in the coming weeks.  We are nearly there.  It was essential that the artists had to feed into this and help to shape it.  I expect the launch in the coming weeks.  We are now down to the final details of the number of recipients and the rate of payment.  We are trying to finalise that right now.  Of course, issues around artists with disabilities have been raised so we must give serious consideration to ensuring this is addressed.</p> <p>  It is my intention that the basic income for arts will be an unconditional basic regular income to artists and creative arts workers to allow them to focus on what they need to focus on.  The recipients can do that when they are in receipt of this grant.  It will be groundbreaking.  There will be a control group as well and we will be assessing the scheme.  Research will be done throughout the programme on its impact on creative output and well-being.  It will be a thorough research project for three years.</p></speech>

Of the 40 feature film and television drama projects that received funding from Screen Ireland in 2020, how many were located in counties Dublin and Wicklow versus other regions of the country?  Has regional balance been factored into the output targets for 2021 and 2022 to ensure the whole country benefits?</p></speech>

New figures published recently reveal a record-breaking spend of more than &euro;500 million in the Irish economy across film, television, drama, documentary and animation production in Ireland in 2021.</p> <p>  The Irish screen production industry is building a reputation for high-quality production across the world.  The 2022 allocation for Screen Ireland will amount to &euro;36.743 million comprising &euro;32.15 million in capital funding and &euro;4.593 million in current funding.  For screen allocations, there will be pay of &euro;2.2 million and non-pay of &euro;2.275 million with capital funding at &euro;32.15 million.</p> <p>  That &euro;6.65 million will allow them to keep indigenous production levels at a pace that is consistent with previous years.  That is where that is being targeted.  It will enable the encouragement of more regional productions in the Irish language; continue the training academies, which build on the skill set that is needed; introduce a new funding stream to support documentary series; and a provide a further round of State funding to support Irish companies.  That money will allow them to invest in IT and marketing and recruit key roles and talent such as a diversity and inclusion manager, a project manager, a development executive, an audience engagement executive, an IT executive and a HR executive.  That is where the money will be targeted.</p></speech>

The 2020 out-turn target was 1,146 organisations.  The 2021 output target was 840 organisations and the 2022 output target is 895.  The Department is currently in the process of collating the 2021 out-turns for performance metrics.  All 2021 performance information will be available in the 2021 public service performance report, which is due to be published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the end of this month.

In early December, the Minister announced a most welcome &euro;50 million package of support for the live performance sector.  Does she have a breakdown at this point of how that has been expended?  What is left in the pot?  How does she intend to distribute that to those who are still in a very difficult place?</p> <p>  We always made the point, and the Minister always agreed with us, that this is not an industry where we can just turn the lights back on like we can in a factory on a Monday morning and it goes right back into full production.  It will take quite a length of time to get back to something resembling normal activity and pre-pandemic times.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1622" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOS2022030900002#D01100"><p>Of the &euro;50 million that was allocated for a suite of supports for the live entertainment industry, &euro;5 million was allocated for the live performance support scheme, LPSS, strand 2.  The Deputy might remember that this was to support pantomimes and seasonal musical theatre, which were brought to a halt due to the Covid-19 restrictions in place in December and January.  Of that, grants of &euro;2.6 million have been offered and payments of &euro;1.3 million have been made under the scheme to date.</p> <p>  Up to &euro;20 million has been allocated under strand 3 of the LPSS to support events that were due to be staged in December and January and were curtailed, cancelled or rescheduled due to the restrictions with live performances at 50% capacity and the closing time of 8 p.m.  Grants of &euro;7.7 million have been offered and payments of &euro;1.1 million have been made under the scheme to date.</p> <p>  Applications are being assessed on a rolling basis and grantees are advised of the status of their grants as soon as a decision is made.  The payments are being made and issued on a rolling basis once grantees have supplied the Department with the required documentation.  There is, therefore, ongoing liaison with my officials.</p> <p>  There was &euro;4 million allocated for another round of the music and entertainment business assistance scheme to support small music and entertainment businesses that do not operate out of a rateable premises.  Some 642 applicants have received funding of &euro;2.8 million.  To date, &euro;2.3 million has been awarded and payments of more than &euro;900,000 have been made since the scheme closed on 27 February.</p> <p>  There was &euro;5 million allocated for local authorities under the live performance support scheme to support local artists and performances.  A further &euro;5 million was allocated to continue the capital support scheme, for example to help venues that might need ventilation upgrades or other Covid-19 adaptations.  There was &euro;1 million for the St. Patrick's festival.  Yesterday, the live performance restart grant scheme was announced, which is a new scheme for businesses engaged in staging events in the arts and cultural live performance sector.</p> <p>  We will continually assess what money goes out but that money will go where it needs to go, which is to the artists.  As I said, that is through constant liaison with officials linking in with artists if further information is needed.  It will go where it is meant to go, however, which is to support the artists.</p></speech>

I will make one final comment on it.  My understanding is that the vast majority of people who succeeded in securing LPSS support will automatically migrate to this scheme and will not have to make a new application.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The scheme is really to support venues, promoters and producers and help them with the costs of reopening and hiring artists and crew to stage live performances in the coming months.  It will trickle down.</p></speech>

We need to look forensically at how best to support the artists and technicians the Minister mentioned earlier, namely, those who switch on the lights and are not seen.  It is important that all the work we do through the LPSS and the live performance restart grant scheme, LPRGS, is focused solely on that.</p><p>Artists cannot survive without venues.  The two have a symbiotic relationship.  I would argue that some venues are perhaps more interested in selling alcohol than in staging cultural events and view cultural events as a tool or mechanism to earn money elsewhere.  These events are not the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>of many of these places.  We need to be careful to ensure, as the Minister has been, that the vast majority of the funds her Department disburses reach those who create and genuinely support the creation of art.</p></speech>

I am sure it will be very much welcomed by the industry.

Will they essentially be automatically entitled to the grant without having to provide any further information?</p></speech>

Existing grantees, who are fully compliant with their existing service level agreement and drawing down procedures, would be defined as LPSS pilot, LPSS 2021, LPSS 2, LPSS 3 or ESCSS stream A grantees in full compliance.</p> <p>  The existing grantees are deemed to have already demonstrated their track record and there will be no need to demonstrate that again.  If an applicant is a new entrant, that is, not an existing grantee, the applicant will have to be in a position to demonstrate either a proven track record of at least two years of delivering ticketed events in the arts and culture sector or VAT exclusive turnover generated in the State of at least &euro;100,000 for 2018 and 2019.  The business must also be in the State.  There are details provided on how they would demonstrate their loss.  That would probably answer Deputy Munster's question.</p></speech>

I have often stated that I will go back to the Covid contingency fund, which is where we secured an additional &euro;25 million before Christmas.

As I have stated many times, if one looks at what I am doing with Irish language funding, for example, for TG4, it has exceeded all previous levels and has been very well received.</p> <p>  Our arts and culture were devastated through Covid.  The ability to perform was taken away from artists.  Artists who were on the cusp of breaking through had that snatched from them.  Artists who spent all their lives at this and for whom the arts is their only way of making a living found that their living was taken from them.  It was essential that the Government sent a signal that we treasure our arts.  The way to do that was in all the Covid supports I put in place and in bringing funding for the Arts Council up to &euro;130 million.</p></speech>

Without it, we would not have experienced our success to date and enjoyed the economic contribution that film provides.  Every country in the world has a film tax credit and ours is no different from many others.  The incentive in implementing the uplift programme was to encourage more production outside the major urban centres of Dublin, Wicklow and Cork.  Can we do more to incentivise more regional productions?  There are additional costs of up to 8% for regional productions, but this critical element of shooting regionally is not factored into the programme.  Perhaps the Minister could speak to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, about trying to increase regional production and enhancing the regional film development uplift.</p></speech>

If I am a venue owner in Athlone and I secured funding under the LPSS, the maximum grant under which was, as far as I recall, in the order of &euro;100,000 at the time, will the Minister clarify what I was required to do to make the case for that funding?  Was I to stage one or a number of performances?  Was I to provide definitive proof that those performances took place and who took part in them?  With the implementation of the LPRGS, I fully suspect those who are already part of the branch aid system and who have registered their presence on the Department's system will see this as an opportunity to apply again because the bureaucratic burden on them will be much less, and thankfully so.  What will they be required to do this time?  If the same venue in Athlone succeeded in securing another &euro;100,000, what would it need to have proven to the Minister it had done to support the creation of art and the people involved in that creation?</p></speech>

This scheme is about supporting people and has been designed to give them restart stability to ensure they can plan ahead.  All applicants, existing and new, must be able to demonstrate their VAT exclusive turnovers and a proven track record of at least two years of delivering ticketed events in the arts and culture sector.  If an applicant is a new entrant, he or she must be in a position to demonstrate that.  Existing grantees are deemed to have already demonstrated their track records, so they will not have to do so again.</p> <p>  The LPRGS was just announced yesterday.  All grantees will have to complete the evaluation survey to demonstrate that the grants are reaching where they need to go.  I am happy to forward the committee more information on comparing the schemes and how that comparison might impact on the LPRGS.  What we were doing in the thick of Covid compared with what we are doing now to aid in the recovery process are quite different in design.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for State for being so proactive in securing this level of funding.  I do not need to tell him the impact such funding has on local communities in terms of the provision of sports facilities is phenomenal.  Every cent we invest in local communities on the development of sports facilities is leveraged.  I am sure some analysis has been done on this, but it leverages other funding through fundraising locally and work that is done voluntarily.  It is extraordinary.  Time and again, I have stressed the importance of this investment, so I thank the Minister of State for his support in making such a significant investment this year.  His predecessor, Deputy Griffin, also did a great deal of good work in this regard.</p> <p>  We have always striven to ensure to the application process is as simple and straightforward as possible while acknowledging these are public funds we are dispensing.  Regarding invalidated applications, what mechanisms are in place this year for clubs that did not realise they had made a small documentary error?

It will capture not only invalid applications but a broader range of unsuccessful applications than was the case previously.  We have a &euro;6 million fund ring-fenced for it.  This will allow for a fair second or additional chance for applicants that missed out for technical reasons or whatever.  This process will be open in the next week or so and there will be an opportunity for clubs to appeal.</p></speech>

There could be another club in the Deputy's area that has gone through all the stages and it could then draw it down this year.  We have grant applications going back to 2018 and even earlier where the clubs have not been able to draw down because they have not been able to fulfil the criteria on the provisional grant allocation.  They may not have been able to get the land that should have been acquired, for example.  Obviously, the timeline is dependent on the club's application.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1668" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOS2022030900002#G00500"><p>As it is capital, it is a multiannual programme and that has been the nature of it for many years.  Even so, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to running regular rounds of the sports capital and equipment programme.  We answered parliamentary questions on this issue last week in the House.  The timeline and sequence will involve, first, concluding the appeals process that I referred to in response to Deputy Cannon and the &euro;6 million allocation in that regard.  We will then conduct a review of the sports capital programme from this round, and take learnings and get input from the Oireachtas and the broader public as to how we can strengthen it and ensure every part of our grassroots sports system can apply and be enabled to fulfil their ambition.  We expect that to take about two or three months.</p> <p>  After that, we will look at a timeline for a further round.  There will be a further round, although I cannot give a definitive answer as to when we will open it.  It is still my intention and that of the Minister to match the ambition in our sporting system and to invest in it.  We will be able to give further details to the committee as we move through the year about when there will be a further round.  As it took ten months to assess the applications for both capital equipment, we cannot commit to an annual round where we can assess and pay out in that period.  It is a multiannual programme and has been that way for many years.  Nevertheless, we appreciate the demand that is there, the ambition in communities and the scale people want, which is why we delivered the &euro;150 million investment this year.</p></speech>

I have spoken to many clubs in my county, Wexford.  We would like to have a fair shot at the supports in the same way as the cities.</p> <p>  How much of the allocated funding for sports in 2022 will go towards helping people with a disability to participate in sport?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1672" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOS2022030900002#G00900"><p>In the most recent round, my predecessor, the then Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, brought in a 50:50 split between <i>per capita</i>and the level of demand, which gave a good regional spread.  As can be seen in the Deputy's county, Wexford, and in County Kerry, which I visited in recent days, there is a fair regional spread that reflects not only the population dynamics of the country but also the necessity to invest in rural Ireland and our regions.  The feedback on that has been positive and it has provided a fair balance.</p><p>A number of budget lines support people with disabilities.  We are working with Sport Ireland on a new diversity and inclusion policy, which will strengthen the overall policy on people with disabilities when it comes to sport.  We will focus on Activities for All and channel a good deal of funding supports through that.</p><p>As for the governing bodies and the core funding they receive, I can give a breakdown but it is complicated.  Under subhead D5, there is significant support through Sport Ireland, with goals for the national governing bodies to support people with disabilities.  Furthermore, we increased the Dormant Accounts Fund from &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million this year, which directly supports people with disabilities.  I am anxious that, with the increase we have secured, we should focus on inclusion and on ensuring everybody in our community can have greater opportunities in sport, and support the grassroots clubs that want to deliver sport for people with disabilities.  I am engaged with some of the sporting organisations, such as the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, and the GAA, regarding how we can deliver better sporting opportunities for people with disabilities.</p><p>On the sports capital and equipment programme, we can send further detail to the committee, with a breakdown in respect of some of the governing bodies, such as Special Olympics Ireland and Irish Wheelchair Association Sport.  Moreover, in our new sports action plan, there is a clear focus on people with disabilities.  I am conscious we all engage with people in our local areas who have disabilities.  I often say that if there are three people in the back of a car, there tends not to be the same level of opportunity for the one who may have a disability, whereas the other two siblings will be able to play any of ten sports on a Saturday morning.  In the context of the Football for All events and the significant potential and inclusive nature of events under Activities for All, a clear focus of mine, through additional funding and budget lines we have received this year, will be on people with disabilities and on giving them greater opportunities in sport.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1674" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOS2022030900002#G01100"><p>One of the major events we are discussing at the moment is Euro 2028.  As a Department, we are positively disposed to the idea.  We have to conclude the cost-benefit analysis and the ratio that applies in that regard but there is considerable potential from a North-South, east-west perspective.  Work is ongoing and we will have to make a final decision before 23 March in respect of submitting an expression of interest.</p> <p>  The programme for Government is committed to forming a major events policy.  We will soon carry out a consultation in that regard, trying to engage with the public but also with governing bodies as to what opportunities exist to bring major sporting events to Ireland.  The Ryder Cup is coming in 2027 and there is significant engagement with the Department on that.  From a tourism perspective, too, the Minister is trying to maximise the benefit for Ireland and the region.  The Northwestern versus Nebraska game will be held in August of this year.  That has substantial tourism potential and will bring many visitors from the US, so it is great to see that type of event back up and running.</p><p>Regarding women's golf, the Irish Open will return in the autumn this year, which is extremely positive and something we are keen to support.  It will take place in September 2022 in Dromoland Castle.  Those are some of the specific events we are focused on.  Ireland has great potential to do more and in the coming years we want to attract major events that provide a return for the country.  Return on investment is a key metric.  We need to ensure what we invest leverages a return for the economy and broader society.</p></speech>

It needs a whole-of-government approach and not just be dealt with by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  I know the Minister of State is doing fantastic work in developing that policy so that we have something to refer back to when we seek to host these sporting events in the future.</p></speech>

The national development plan captures, for example, investment in the national sports campus and the potential it offers for hosting major events.  For example, the velodrome could host events across multiple disciplines because it is a multi-use facility.  Beyond the periphery of the velodrome, which obviously enables cycling, there are big opportunities for badminton and a range of indoor sports.</p> <p>  I forgot to mention that the Cricket World Cup 2030 is coming to Ireland and it will obviously present major opportunities.  There are good relationships between the major events unit, local authorities and other pillars of government.  Unfortunately, we did not get Euro 2020 to come here, but good local structures were established which enabled that collaboration.  Obviously, the Department of Justice and the Garda play a key role as do fans and spectators.  The major events policy will formalise that.  There are good working structures and there has been no impediment, barrier or delay when it comes to enabling the hosting of major events.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome representatives from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, Ms Rachel Cahill, head of the chief executive office, and Ms Eimear Fox, TII landscape architect.  I welcome representatives from Technological University Dublin, Dr. Maria Chiara Leva of the environmental health and sustainability institute, and Dr. Sarah Rock of the school of transport engineering, environment and planning.  They are all most welcome.  This is a very important report and we are delighted to be able to facilitate public discourse on it.</p> <p>  I will read a note on privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful the domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via MS Teams that, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If attending in the committee room, all are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  I call Ms Cahill to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for inviting me here today to discuss TII&rsquo;s Travelling in a Woman&rsquo;s Shoes report.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, TII&rsquo;s purpose is to provide sustainable transport infrastructure and services, delivering a better quality of life, supporting economic growth and respecting the environment.  TII&rsquo;s vision is to ensure this infrastructure is safe and resilient, delivering better accessibility and sustainable mobility for all.  The transition to sustainable transport modes will require extensive new infrastructure and efforts to change travel behaviours.  Key to achieving this change is understanding travel behaviours and ways to influence the modal shift from private cars to more sustainable forms of transport.  I believe TII&rsquo;s Travelling in a Woman&rsquo;s Shoes report is an innovative and very important piece of work in this regard, not only in terms of TII&rsquo;s transport infrastructure projects, for example, Luas Finglas and MetroLink, but also for the wider transport sector and for all of society.</p> <p>  I would like to take a minute to provide some context around how this report came to life.  There were three contributory factors which coincided in 2019.  First, I became involved in TII&rsquo;s sustainable mobility work stream in 2018 and, as part of this, I attended the 2019 International Transport Forum summit in Leipzig.  This included a session on gender bias in transport and explained how, historically, transport has not been designed with the needs of women in mind.  The research presented that day had a powerful impact on me.  Second, the Government launched its 2019 climate action plan, which gave a strong mandate to all public sector bodies to step up and act decisively in the area of decarbonisation with a big focus on promoting and influencing the modal shift away from private cars to more sustainable forms of transport.  Third, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform launched its 2019 innovation programme promoting innovation across the public sector.</p> <p>  These three factors culminated in me commissioning this innovative study regarding women&rsquo;s travel needs in Ireland to inform and influence future sustainable transport policy and design.  The study got under way in late 2019 and it resulted in the publication of the Travelling in a Woman&rsquo;s Shoes report in 2020.</p> <p>  Transport is often seen as gender neutral, providing benefit to all equally.  However, a growing body of international research highlights that this is not the case.  Women and men have different mobility realities.  Women tend to have more complex patterns of mobility characterised by trip chaining and caregiving responsibilities.  Understanding and supporting women&rsquo;s travel needs will help Ireland&rsquo;s transition to sustainable modes of transport.</p> <p>  As the first study to investigate the needs and travel behaviours of women in Ireland, our research gave fresh, new insights.  Some 84% of women in families take on the sole or primary responsibility for childcare and 30% of women provide primary care for another adult.  Dropping off and collecting children or family members is women&rsquo;s primary reason for travel, while men&rsquo;s is work.  For women in Ireland, safety is their top travel concern.  Some 55% avoid public transport at night, 36% feel unsafe walking locally at night, and 34% have avoided travelling altogether because of feelings of insecurity.</p><p>A single incident often has a lasting impact on their sense of safety and daily choices.  A total of 95% of women consider the car a necessity outside Dublin.  Some reasons for this relate to transport infrastructure, caregiving responsibilities and personal safety concerns.  Travelling in a Woman&rsquo;s Shoes presents five key design challenges and the research conducted as part of the study, especially the research into the everyday lived experiences of women obtained through one-to-one interviews and travelling with them as they went about their daily business, produced rich insights that developed into potential and possible pathways to address these challenges.</p><p> As for how TII is applying the findings from Travelling in a Woman&rsquo;s Shoes, this is really the start of a journey.  In 2021, we developed and published a gender checklist for TII&rsquo;s public transport projects and are now applying this to projects such as Luas Finglas and MetroLink.  This document, which is available to view on our publications website, asks a number of thought-provoking questions and provides guidance in many areas, including collecting gender-disaggregated data; incorporating social sustainability and gender equality objectives in documentation, from procurement through to design and operation; co-designing projects with women and consulting diverse voices for more inclusive transport; and designing for gender equality, such as step-free travel, toilet facilities, holding rails for children, comfortable seating, lighting, signage, child-friendly spaces and shelter.  We have also recently tendered for additional research regarding women and cycling and are sponsoring a school project that examines independent travel for young people and children.</p><p> When I started this project, one of the key objectives was to bring this topic to the table, to educate and to build awareness.  Since publication, we have connected with many stakeholders, on both a national and international level.  In my view, this committee is the table to have this conversation.  It sends a strong and powerful message to all involved in policy, planning and design, not just in transport but throughout society.</p><p> I thank the committee for inviting me here.  My colleague Ms Fox and I will endeavour to answer any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague Dr. Sarah Rock, a lecturer in urban design and transport planning.</p> <p>  I will present some findings from our research in the area of inclusion and transport, including a recent EU-funded research project, Diamond, which is aimed at uncovering factors affecting women as users of public transport and as employees in the transport sector.  This research project complements many of the findings of the Travelling in a Women&rsquo;s Shoes report.  As part of the Diamond project, we surveyed and interviewed rail and light-rail users, as well as non-users, to find out why they do not use public transport in three cities: Dublin, Barcelona and Warsaw.  We also interviewed employees.  The research project is rooted in the principle of equity of opportunity for all and transport&rsquo;s role in facilitating equality of access to key life chances and daily needs.  Inequity of access traditionally impacts disproportionately on women, particularly in the areas of safety and time poverty, a term used to indicate how individuals with caring responsibilities perceive their time constraints resulting from paid and unpaid work.  Our research focused on three key areas that impact on women&rsquo;s engagement with public transport; namely, capacity to address basic mobility needs, accessibility in terms of physical access but also monetary access, and safety and security.</p> <p>  A key finding of the study is that people who experience any form of discrimination are likely to experience lower satisfaction in all aspects related to fairness of service provision, while for female users, feeling safe at any time of the day is a key variable for user satisfaction alongside connectivity to the destination, value for money and timely information provision.  Put simply, this means that the more welcome a female feels within the transport system and the more satisfied she feels with the service, the more likely it is that she will continue to use public transport.  Equally, the converse is true.  If she does not feel welcome, safe and secure, she will change to another form of transport if she has the means to do so.  We found that safety and security is a particular issue for women in low-income groupings and those belonging to an ethnic minority.  These are also the groups that rely most heavily on public transport.  We found that travelling with dependants often pushes females to select a different mode of transport, mainly the private car.</p> <p>  Women&rsquo;s mobility needs and patterns are diverse and complex, depending on their age, socioeconomic status and caregiving roles, and this heterogeneity is not often looked at with clarity in our national surveys.  Furthermore, most of the women interviewed confirmed that their sense of safety and security is often enhanced by clarity on norms regarding harassment and non-admitted behaviours and their sanctions; the presence of someone who can be considered a go-to person for help and assistance and who has the authority to intervene if needed; and clean, well-lit CCTV-supervised areas around stations and stops that provide a secure sense of place, meaning the urban design of the area should ensure that the environment around stations is not a lonely place but a welcoming place with eyes on the street and the presence of enough other people to increase the perception of safety and security.  This is true for users of public transport but also for workers, given that the risk of violence and sexual harassment for female drivers and passengers remains a significant factor, with the result that women tend to avoid working in certain front-line jobs and at night.  Not only does this mean women lose out on some job opportunities but it also limits the recruitment pool for transport agencies.</p> <p>  To return to the fundamental role of having access to basic mobility services, the collection and further disaggregation of data to include different socio-demographic characteristics for users and non-users is relevant in highlighting subgroups experiencing specific barriers or those in need of different types of facilitators.  In a report of the International Transport Forum, it was highlighted that almost 40% of public transport journeys throughout the world are mobility-of-care journeys.  These include visits to health centres, escorting dependants and journeys for shopping or other errands.  Women constitute 80% of people in charge of mobility of care and most of these women use sustainable modes of transport, such as walking or public transport.  Despite this, public transport networks and levels of service are typically focused on commuting to and from work, but these routes are often not the easiest routes for mobility of care.  Mobility of care usually consists of more frequent, local and shorter trips and is irregular in time and space, given it involves travelling not only from residential areas to the city centre.  Therefore, future transport planning needs to take into account mobility-of-care journeys.  The proposed BusConnects orbital bus routes and the removal of fare penalties for transfers are welcome in this regard, and we recommend the greater prioritisation of delivery of these orbital routes with high levels of bus priority, in addition to the current rolling-out of the spine routes.  It is equally important to include more women in decision-making jobs, planning and transport service delivery, including front-line services and maintenance services.  EU and UK research has shown that transport has the lowest representation of women within the public sector, at between 6% and 7%, and that women account for just 15% of personnel in most decision-making bodies and advisory boards.</p> <p>  Men's and women&rsquo;s transport needs are different.  Understanding these differences will be fundamental to providing more equitable and sustainable mobility services.  Women rely on public transport more than men do but many will reject it, as we have seen more recently in Ireland, if the system does not understand and meet their needs.</p></speech>

In particular, I welcome Dr. Leva, whom I have known for a long time.  I am great buddies with her husband from my college days.  It is great to see her here on screen in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  In reference to public transport, she stated "many will reject it, as we have seen more recently in Ireland, if the system does not understand and meet their needs."  That was a powerful closing remark in her statement.  The past few weeks have been an eye-opener in this country.  There was the awful and harrowing murder of Ashling Murphy, which sparked a national debate about where it is safe for women to go.</p><p>What was an eye-opener for me and many other males who serve in the Houses of the Oireachtas is that while men can take for granted that places are safe, it is not the same for women because they experience the public realm in a very different way.  There are many places in which men might feel safe while women would not.  It was telling and insightful to hear from Dr. Leva's opening statement that public transport is an example of that.  Public transport may not be a safe place for far too many women in our country.  That is awful and the committee needs to focus on it.</p><p> I use the train, as does the Chairman.  We are frequent users of the train to get from our constituencies to the D&aacute;il.  I wish to put a few points to Dr. Leva.  The Irish rail service has conductors and ticket inspectors.  I have seen problems on board trains.  Only five or six weeks ago, I was on train when a guy stood up and told everyone he had a knife.  Nothing could be done about that.  We all had to sit in silence.  The chatter, fun and joy on the train all ended and for the final 40 minutes of our journey, there was total silence in that carriage.  We did not know how serious this guy was and if he was going to carry out his threats.  It was not until the train pulled in at the platform at Limerick station that members of the Garda put him on the ground and arrested him.  Does Dr. Leva believe we should have a dedicated transport police or at least legislative provisions that give more power to the people patrolling our trains?  Does she believe we need a text service so that when someone is silently suffering on a train beside a violent or unruly passenger there is a way to quietly notify authorities of what he or she is experiencing?  Does she believe that when catering resumes on trains, which I believe will happen next week, alcohol should not be served?  We have all been on trains going to all-Ireland finals, and perhaps the Chairman has been to more such games than I have as a Clare man.  It is fun to sit with a few friends, have a few beers and celebrate on the way home.  However, there are also people who get very messy on trains.  Such people are coming down the carriage and sitting across from a family or mother travelling with her kids, which makes the journey miserable for them.  Does Dr. Leva believe we might need travel police and a text service to make train travel safer?  Has she views on alcohol being served on trains?</p></speech>

In Italy, a specific branch of the police force, the Polizia Ferroviaria, is designed to patrol public transport, especially on trains because those journeys are longer.  If something goes wrong, it can go horribly wrong before anyone can jump onto the carriage and solve the issue.  There are ticket controllers.  We have discussed the issue of women working in transport.  We had the privilege to interview some of those women and learned that they perceive themselves as unable to intervene for two reasons.  First, even if those women had the courage, strength and capacity to prevail over an offender, they may be in danger of being sued by that offender.  Those women do not have the power to intervene in such cases.  We must make clear what it is they can do.   They can eject a disruptive passenger, as is the case on aeroplanes, with the assistance of police forces.  They are not to engage in a power battle.  It is unsafe to do so.  It is not recommended and it is not a part of their duty.</p></speech>

I have travelled around Europe and seen people providing security on trains.  They are robustly clothed in stab-proof vests.  They have a real authority and the trains feels safer as a result.  Does Ms Cahill have an opinion on these matters?  Should alcohol be served on trains?  Is the day of the bag of cans being brought onto the Heuston Station platform and drunk on the train to Limerick or Cork over?  It can be fun but it can also be very messy.  It invariably leads to trouble as the journey moves passed its halfway point and the alcohol intake increases.</p></speech>

Goodness me.  To be honest, I do not really have a view on that matter.  Safety is one of the main concerns for women when they are choosing their primary mode of transport.  I heard the Deputy describe the situation he and his fellow passengers faced on the train.  That was an unfortunate incident.  Transport police is an option that could be looked at and considered, along with many other options.  In the Travelling in a Woman's Shoes report, we were looking at a more holistic approach rather than seeking a single solution to address all issues.  We set out some design challenges in the report.  It takes a more holistic view, including the design of systems, place-making, education and training.  The training of staff, whether staff on trains or customer service staff, would include gender sensitivity training and instruction on how to respond to an incident.  A plethora of solutions are outlined in the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1725" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030900002#E00700"><p>I appreciate the reply.  There is a lot in the report and I will finish with a question about design because I know that is important but I want to home in on the safety aspects.  I love the train.  I take it three or four times a week to get from Clare to Dublin.  I love it, but I have also seen some hairy episodes, examples of illegal, criminal and thuggish behaviour.  People who should be able to enjoy their journeys cannot do so because of how some others conduct themselves on the train.  I do not have strong views on the serving of alcohol on trains but events of recent months have probably strengthened my views in that regard.</p><p>I note that Ms Fox is on the design end of things.  I will ask her a broad question about parking in railway stations and, indeed, in the entire public realm.  The policy guidance in Ireland on parking spaces is that they should be approximately 2.5 m wide and 4.75 m long.  Parking spaces in Ireland tend to be tighter and shorter than in most other European countries and north America.  I have six-, five- and three-year-old children so we are moving out of the time when we need mother-and-baby or mother-and-toddler parking spaces.  We will be parking in the general body of car parks.  It is nigh on impossible to get children out of a car parking space without obliterating the side of the next car.  I have often seen parents dropping off their kids before reversing into a space.  God help anyone who parked at the front or rear of Leinster House this morning.  You would want to be a very skinny person or you would want to get out of the car and roll it back into the space, <i>&agrave;</i><b><i></i></b><i>la</i>Mr. Bean.  Does Ms Fox agree that parking spaces are too tight and too short?  Should the guidance change to bring Ireland more in line with other countries?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1726" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eimear Fox" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030900002#E00800"><p>There is guidance for two categories of car parking.  The first is for assisted and disabled car parking spaces, accessible spaces, which are obviously more generous and tend to be undersized.  There is specific guidance for that.  In terms of general car parking spaces, the focus for most transport agencies is to reduce the dependence on cars.  Where car parking is provided and where there are children or elderly occupants, having space beside the car to get out is a real issue.  Our standards for design guidance are aligned with European standards, though not necessarily with American standards, where cars are larger.  Rather than making spaces bigger, we should focus on making cars smaller so they take up less space on the road.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1727" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030900002#E00900"><p>I thank Ms Fox for her reply.  She has been very honest.  I hope she will change her position on that.  TII carries a fair degree of clout.  National policy trickles down from the organisation all the way to local authorities.  The days of the Ford Fiesta or Renault Clio reversing into a space and a family of five getting out of it are, unfortunately, gone.  Because of stipulations from the Garda and road traffic policy regarding seats for children in the rear of cars, many families now have people carriers.  Disabled members of our population have blue badges and designated spaces.</p><p>There are parent and toddler designated spaces.  However, that probably accounts for less than 10% of overall spaces in any car park in Ireland one can think of.  As to the general body of parking spaces, it is impossible for most families to get in and out, get the children into the car and strap them in, and to throw the school bags and the shopping bags in.  TII needs to have a position that is more reflective of where cars are at in 2022.  We do not all have public transport on our front doorstep, therefore, the local car park is so important to us for being able to get to the school, the shop or wherever.  I would love if TII would undertake a new body of work.  I know I have thrown this suggestion as a curveball today but could the TII do a new body of work to see if those parking spaces meet the needs of mums, dads and families?  I think it needs to be reviewed.</p></speech>

The 90-page report, Travelling in a Woman&rsquo;s Shoes, is a very sombre report in terms of anyone interested in decarbonisation or trying to get people into public transport or active travel.  It shows how far, if you will pardon the pun, a journey we have to go on in terms of getting people from where they are to where planners and others, such as climate activists, would like us to be, and probably where many people themselves would like to be.  They would like to be able to use active travel better.  Unfortunately, today is not the best example of a day one might try to do it.  There is an enormous challenge in moving away from the private car for the everyday short journey, but we need to have as few reasons to not choose public transport as is possible and to have as many reasons one would use public transport, including factors such as reliability of service and frequency.  I believe reliability is more important than frequency.  It is very well having frequency of service, but what if that frequency is not reliable?  People will put up with a service if they know it is on the hour, but it has to be on the hour.  It cannot be every second hour because every second bus goes missing.</p> <p>  We probably should have had this meeting yesterday on International Women's Day with so many women here, but one day out is not too bad.  As to this transport committee, and I know every committee is somewhat self-selecting, there are 14 members on this committee and 13 of us are men.  I was chair of a transportation strategic policy committee in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and a water and waste strategic policy committee that tended to have many men councillors on them.  One found that the arts committee, the library committee, the cultural committee, the housing committee had many more women councillors.  I believe there were 21 men and 19 women councillors in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, so we were not short of women.  It was just that, for whatever reason, men ended up doing heavy engineering and transport, and women chose other committees rather than the transport sector.  I totally get it.  What has been said resonates with me; there is an absence.  It is not that everything is different.  Men and women have many ideas in common but if 85% or 90% of the people in room are men, they will not see everything from a woman's perspective, no matter how many reports we read.  I have read the 90-page report.  I speed-read through it, but I picked up on much of its content and it is very sobering.  I congratulate TII.  I always think of the TII as being the National Roads Authority, but obviously the Rail Procurement Agency, the metro and the Luas and so on, come within that.  I congratulate TII on the fact that it is looking at how women travel generally but particularly in public transport.  I also support what it is doing in terms of cycling.  I know there was a recent report about girls travelling to school and the uniform is a barrier.  Wearing skirts is not the easiest way to cycle compared to being able to wear trousers.  All this research is very valuable and I commend the TII on doing it.</p> <p>  If witnesses of both groups became the Minister for Transport tomorrow morning, what would be the first three or four things they would do to try to improve the situation?  Deputy Crowe referred to car parking, which I will not focus too much to because I am trying to stick to travelling in terms of public transport and cycling.  What would the witnesses do if they became the Minister of Transport tomorrow morning?  Obviously, security, lighting and passive surveillance are a part of it, but I am here to listen to the experts rather than give them a long speech.</p></speech>

That is a good perspective and lens to ask us.  For me, even acknowledging that transport design is not gender neutral and that women and men have different mobility realities and understanding why that is the case would be key.  Acknowledging that and building that awareness and championing it at a senior level and having real leadership and commitment around that fact is key.  It might sound a bit woolly and soft, but without that kind of championing and advocacy, we will not get anywhere in terms of designing and delivering sustainable transport modes.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the gender balance on this and other committees.  For us in TII, we are an engineering organisation so we would have more males, perhaps, than females.  It is about looking at education and our young people and children, and what is influencing them.  An interesting nugget that came from our report, one that I was very interested in, was the role of families in Irish transport and how travel perceptions and behaviours are formed from a very young age.  There is a lot of research ongoing.  There is the Technological University Dublin Diamond project and, obviously, we connected early on in both our projects.  I am aware of the work that project is doing as well.  Something uniquely Irish that came through in our research was the frequency with which the role of the family came up in our interviews.  We conducted 21 interviews with women, spending two hours with each woman, and joined them as they went about their daily travels.  Family came up in every single interview.  The research team that worked on my project said that this was quite unique for Ireland.  It is about designing for families and communities not just for individuals.  That brings a system design approach to the whole transport ecosystem, not just looking at individual bits and hoping that it will all work at the end of the day.  That is my tuppence worth.  If I were the Minister for Transport tomorrow, that is what I would bring to the table from the get-go.</p></speech>

I read some of the stories.  Making children more independent so that they are confident to cycle to school would mean mothers - I accept that it can be fathers too - would not have to go to the school and take up an hour or two of their day getting there, picking children up and bringing them home.  We all know the difference in traffic levels between when schools are open and closed.  It is apparent absolutely everywhere, in urban and rural areas.  By all means the first step is to bring it to the table and have the discussion and we have had the report and the recommendations, but if Ms Cahill were given resources in the morning, what would she like to do first?</p></speech>

I would invest in co-creation of design and getting that diverse voice and hearing the needs of the different people in that local community or town or wherever it may be.

It is all of that.  It is that 15-minute or 20-minute city from first mile to last mile.  Safety is the biggest concern, as we mentioned, but it is not just on the transport itself.  It is not just safety on a train or bus, it is also about safety walking to and from the bus.  That first mile to it and the last mile from it.  All that has to be taken into consideration to see what that looks like.  It is all those factors and that is what we mean by that holistic approach.  I will hand over to my colleagues.</p></speech>

I would do small, practical things next.  This comes back to what the Senator said about representation.  One would be to recruit more diversity in the transport sector.  There may not be as many female civil engineers or transport planners coming through the system but we can value interdisciplinary approaches.  As an example of a multidisciplinary approach to design, Ms Fox is a landscape architect.  We will then start to see much greater representation.  It will bring on board the different voices from different backgrounds.  We should be flexible with recruitment, allow part-time work and job-sharing in the public sector and continue online working, all of which would make a significant difference.</p> <p>  Active and sustainable travel funding needs to give greater recognition to the important of sense of place.  Safety comes up as the biggest factor in how women choose to travel, especially if they have the means to choose other ways.  An important factor is whether a place is attractive.  It relates to urban design quality.  Do women feel that other people are around and that if they get off the train at night, there will be shops beside them and people coming and going, or will they get off at a lonely station in a lonely place?  Even if they survive their journey on the train at night, they might get off and be equally unsafe in that final mile.  We need to recognise and value that sense of place.  That can happen through more diverse recruitment.</p> <p>  The first thing I would do at a local level is to change our Sydney co-ordinated adaptive traffic system, SCATS.  I would increase the amount of time for pedestrians to cross the road.  We currently give six seconds, if people are really lucky, for them to get across most roads.  After that, there is an amber flashing man that frightens the life out of every mother and child, and every other person who has to cross the road.</p></speech>

It was startling to go through the report from beginning to end.  Two things struck me at the beginning.  One was the piece by Dora.  She spoke about the car being a happy place and about laughter.  Karen said that she would support measures to have fewer cars on the road.  We must bring those two points together.  How can we make transport gender neutral?  None of us should travel on a train, the DART or a bus and be worried or frightened if it is a dark or badly lit place.  Deputy Alan Farrell previously made a point about his experience on the DART.  How can we make public transport gender neutral?  Does the committee have a role, in tandem with the Government, in ensuring the 17 goals in the report are completed?</p> <p>  This is the first report of its kind and it is important.  We need to work on safety and security, not just on those matters raised by Deputy Cathal Crowe but because of the overarching experience.  The figures are startling.  People might say that the percentage of women who feel insecure or unsafe is not that high, but it is, since 1% is too high, never mind 35% or 45% of people not wishing to use public transport after dark.  That is just not good enough.  If I put myself in the shoes of my sister or nieces, I would not be happy with this report.</p></speech>

In the conclusions of our report, we set out five design challenges.  The Senator asked all the questions at that same time.  The challenges are how sustainable transport modes can compete with cars, how we can understand that the family unit influences sustainable mobility choices, how transport can be safe and feel safe for women, how transport can consider the diverse needs and contexts of all women and how we can accelerate sustainable behavioural change.  For each of those challenges, we have set out lessons learned from our interviews and general policy pathways.  They speak to the four main areas that need to be addressed, which are safety, accessibility, reliability, and comfort and convenience.  The Senator spoke about reliability.  Both men and women need a reliable transport system, but the impact for women is more significant if trains or buses do not come because of the care-giving roles they have and the mobility of care.  Safety, reliability, accessibility and comfort and convenience need to be considered and addressed if we are to compete with the car.</p></speech>

Linked to that is the matter of reliability and being child-friendly.  We have a journey to take to cause this modal shift.  This report is a breath of fresh air.  I hope it is a wake-up call for public transport and local authorities that are not cognisant of the barrier, impediment and lack of safety in the provision of public lighting or planning around our train stations or bus stations.</p></speech>

There is a problem with connectivity to destinations.  The country has a two-speed reality.  One is in availability.  The connectivity in urban counties is not available in rural and suburban counties.  Even within urban counties, we have had more than one interview where we heard that the problem with public transport was one of connectivity.  Our connectivity is designed to lead us to the city centre and then from there to another point of interest.  Mobility around the local area is not so good.  We also studied sustainable modes of transport in rural areas.</p><p>We have examples from the European research in and around Barcelona in the suburbs and not the city centre.  In the suburban areas, it is becoming more and popular for families to have adopted, or to be considering adopting, carpooling with a little van.  You do not need a bus because the demand is much lower.  Little vans can be shared by different people, some of whom are elderly and some of whom are not necessarily able to use a car.  These are solutions we should look into because our service provision in rural and suburban areas is not up to par yet and we should take that into account.  We need to go back to basics.</p><p> Going back to the security problem, what I showed as an example from the Italian police is also true in other countries.  For instance, myself and Dr. Rock were discussing how there are night coaches in Australia, so there is at least part of the train where this is realised.  I must comment on how well the Luas is doing.  I feel safe on the Luas thanks to the security that is deployed.  It is heavily deployed for the purpose of ensuring everyone pays their fare and there are no disruptive passengers or-----</p></speech>

The more activity you can get around transport options, the more eyes on the street and the more connectivity, then the more self-policing these areas can be.  On the Luas, certainly I am working very closely on Luas Finglas.  We are looking to get as much connectivity between different modes such as cycle networks and bus interchanges so we do not have a situation where you are standing on your own for half an hour if the bus is late.  That is maybe outside one project but is looking at those connectivities.  That means we then have a focus for transport and we can design that in the context of the public realm and of security.  That interconnectivity also really ties into the patterns we know about of how women move.  They might have a number of shorter journeys and it allows those inter-transport mode connections to be much more easily done.  Again, where there are connections we need to ensure there are no ramps, steps or barriers to movement between them.  Having that activity is one way we can look to address the security issues.</p></speech>

I agree with Ms Fox.  It is a combination of that sort of passive self-policing, so to speak.  I have not personally researched it but there is definitely a study that is worth looking at on different models.  There are so many places around the world that have different forms of security, be it transport police like with Transport for London or a night guard like on the trains in Sydney.  It is worth exploring what other models are out there and critically, how women feel under these different models.  That would be a welcome project to undertake.  Bear in mind the answer may not simply be a dedicated transport police.  It may be something else but it would certainly be worth doing that study.</p></speech>

I hate using the phrase "corporate buy-in" but how are we on the buy-in from TII, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Luas, the metro or whatever?  I asked a question about how we can ensure we are never back here again having the types of figures in the report presented to us today.  How do we ensure the starting point, which is today or was the publication of the report last year, results in a better experience, checks and balances and outcomes being more positive?  I thank our guests for being here.  I hope, Chairman, we will come back to this on a regular basis-----</p></speech>

Of the bodies involved, the obvious one is the Department of Transport.  She might give us an indication of what the interaction has been, what the follow-up was and what progress has been made.</p></speech>

To answer the final question first, we met the Department of Transport as we were publishing our report in July 2020.  It was hugely supportive, engaged, open and receptive.  As with everything we are hearing today, it was delighted to have this innovative piece of research with the final report along with it.  When our new Secretary General Ken Spratt joined, he asked for a meeting.  We met him and presented the report and findings.  He was hugely supportive.  The one question he asked was what could he do in his role as Secretary General of the Department to be the champion and ensure all the agencies under his aegis hear about this and actually start to embed the findings and the ethos.  That was a really fantastic message to hear.  I guess the proof is in the pudding.  The Department's sustainable mobility policy is due to be published at the end of this month as it is the end of the first quarter of 2022.  I believe Travelling in a Woman&rsquo;s Shoes, or applying a gender lens to transport infrastructure projects, is included in that policy.  I was involved in early drafts of the policy but I cannot say I have seen the latest draft.  I expect to see this gender lens and topic being part of that sustainable mobility policy.  I do not think we could ask for any greater supports from the Department.  It has been with us all the way through.</p> <p>  On TII leadership and the reception of the report, again we could not have asked for anything better.  TII commissioned the report but it is not just a TII report, or I should say it is not just for TII.  It is also not just for transport and as the Senator mentioned a few moments ago it is also for the Departments with responsibility for justice, housing, community and education.  It is across the whole of society.  It is important, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, that we have senior leadership, senior commitment and senior champions - both male and female.  It is not just the females.  We also need male advocacy and male champions.  I have to say in TII we have that across the board.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1778" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030900002#J00200"><p>I have three specific questions for the guests today.  I commend them on the report.  There is nothing in it a woman using public transport would not have experienced.  I recommend that some of the committee members read Caroline Criado-Perez's book <i>Invisible Women</i>because it is not just transport.  It is the whole of society that is affected by the fact we do not have women at the decision-making table, they are not part of he consultation process and we do not collect the gender-aggregated data.  Criado-Perez also refers to the phenomenon of trip chaining, which is in the report, and the importance of designing transport to facilitate women who, unfortunately, carry out most of the caring activities in society.  With the census coming up, is it a missed opportunity that we have not tried to collect those data?  As far as I know, the census asks how people get from work, school or childcare but it misses out all of those other trips that are taken, in particular by caregivers.  We heard Ms Fox talking about the gender checklist.  What, in the opinion of all the guests, are the biggest gaps in the data in making sure the services are fit for purpose?</p><p>I noticed, again probably without surprise, that fewer women compared with men favoured more security guards on transport.  What they preferred instead was good infrastructure, proper public lighting, proper access to and from, and, if making connections, there are no delays, which means the importance of real-time travel information.  It was a very interesting point and I am glad Ms Fox pushed back a bit from what Deputy Cathal Crowe was saying earlier about no alcohol on the train.  It is about making the facility safe, not banning alcohol or not having police on it.</p><p>The third question is about cycling and infrastructure for cycling.  I did an interview with the <i>Business Post </i>talking about my experience as someone who lives slightly further out and cycling to work, trying to do the right thing in terms of reducing carbon emissions.  From where I am in Clondalkin, the most direct and probably safest route from a cycling perspective is the Grand Canal, but that is not safe from a female perspective and you are not going to cycle along the Grand Canal because there are gangs along it, and you are especially not going to do so if you work shifts or work unpredictable hours.  Perhaps the guests would talk about that and the importance of that cycling infrastructure.  The report stated that cycling is considered least safe by women and least child-friendly, and women are more likely to cycle for recreation rather than for commuting.  While we are seeing many greenways being developed around the country, which are great in terms of a service and for tourism, we need to have commuting routes, not just in our cities but outside of our cities.  Perhaps the guests might comment on that as well.</p></speech>

The witnesses might deal with the totality of the questions put by Senator Boylan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1780" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Maria Chiara Leva" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030900002#J00300"><p>There were many aspects to the questions.  One of the first points the Senator made was about going back to basics, so the first needs to be addressed are safety and security, which are key, but prior to these is the connectivity to the point of interest.  The connectivity to the point of interest as pointed out is the mobility of care for many women and the time poverty experience.  Trip chaining is another aspect of time poverty for many women as users and it means they have no influence.  We are often talking about the same people in two different roles.</p> <p>  In regard to the first aspect of connectivity, connectivity in terms of public transport is urban and rural.  The urban is being addressed.  We have seen many good things happening in Ireland, especially in Dublin in that respect in terms of the initiative on which we commented, which is the orbital route being created.  That will address some of the issues.  For the rural areas I am not aware of any submission or any study deployed in that sense.</p> <p>  Going to the other aspect of cycling, as I said in our study cycling, especially bike sharing, was not effectively used in the mobility of care.  That is an issue that depends on the infrastructure but also depends on the need.  This is something that we need to know and face.  The use of cycling for going to work is being addressed in Ireland.  I can see there are changes being made.  Should they change the level of uptake in the levels we currently see?  I know this is something that needs to be studied.  The disaggregation of car use is key.  We have a very efficient and very good Central Statistics Office in this country and produces a report every quarter that is very informative.  The question is potentially the data are there and whether they are being used to identify a particular group of users.  The other aspect is, we need to investigate the non-users as well as the users to identify what the needs and barriers are.  This is what we tried to do in our study of three cities, with good results.  I suggest the same, if I were the Minister for Transport.  One of the things I would do is try to understand better the different profiles.  As I said there are often undercurrents.  We have ethnic minorities which are hit harder by problems related to monetary accessibility of the service and experience of discrimination on the public services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1781" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sarah Rock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030900002#J00400"><p>I will talk about two points on cycling infrastructure and the data piece.  In regard to cycling infrastructure and how it is used or not used by women and the whole idea about safety, it is very much down to how a country designs its infrastructure.  Currently in Ireland, for example, our infrastructure has been largely designed around commuting or fast commuting, so some of it is about competing on the road rather than being safe.  I will clarify what I mean by segregated cycling facilities.  Senator Boylan mentioned segregation on a greenway or along a canal.  That is not the sort of segregation I am particularly talking about.  I am talking about a segregation in an urban context where you still feel safe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1782" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030900002#J00500"><p>I might not have been clear.  What I meant was not segregation as such.  Segregated cycleways are part of commuting, but we are seeing many greenways.  The greenway along the Grand Canal is not a safe commuting route.  I do not mean segregation as in gender or such a thing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1783" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sarah Rock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030900002#J00600"><p>I know the Senator did not mean that.  I just want to explain what I mean by segregation.  Women absolutely want safety in our cycling infrastructure, and that is the key factor.  That means we largely do not want to share the carriageway with fast-moving vehicles.  That is the key factor.</p><p>We need to design infrastructure that is separate but not so separate that people are left in underpasses or overpasses, or down in places where there are not eyes from the street.  That relationship between urban design and cycle planning is key.  </p><p> Cycling in Ireland does not currently make up a great percentage of the mobility of care journeys but it does in other countries.  For example, in Denmark more women than men cycle, more women with children cycle and more woman across all income groups and age groups cycle.  it is a very different circumstance from Ireland because there is a massive difference in the design of infrastructure.</p><p> The Senator also asked about data.  For my sins, I was an enumerator in the most recent census of population.  Because I was so dedicated to the cause, I wanted to know what it was really like to collect census data.  There is a balance that must be struck in the level of detail one can get from a census questionnaire.  To get to the level we need, we would have to do a different type of survey.  That is where our national household travel surveys must come into play.  We are never going to get the level of data we need from a census which looks at many things.  Instead we need to focus on 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 participants and focus then on a detailed household travel survey.  That is what I would recommend.  I have not seen the new census questions yet and look forward to reading them.  I understand there are more questions around travel.  There must be a limit to what we can get from that sort of census of population.</p></speech>

The Senator brought up a couple of relevant points.  I am working at the project level and looking at where we can apply the design principles in a practical way.  In terms of cycle infrastructure, one of the issues we are coming across is that where there are rigid technical standards for infrastructure, we need to be able to adapt them to the particular locations and contexts in which we are working.  For example, if steep topography is involved, that can be a barrier to women and children.  Another barrier is if the cycle paths are too narrow and there is no spot for someone to get off a bike and regroup with his or her child.  Having a more adaptable infrastructure that is not so engineer-led and takes into account the local context is important.  For example, we are looking to do that with Luas Finglas.  We are providing spots for people to rest and where people can go off the cycle track.  If someone is cycling along the Royal Canal and feels a particular area is a bit dodgy, there should be an option to go off the cycle track and take an alternative route.  We do not need to follow the commuter model that caters for people travelling from A to B, especially in a neighbourhood and local context.</p> <p>  There are many levels of data collection from a census level to a city level.  Where we are applying data to the Luas Finglas project, we are finding that the data collection for the project level hardly even covers pedestrians, never mind the gender of pedestrians or how people use spaces.  There is a focus on the vehicular element of data collection.  If I could change anything, it would be to prioritise collecting data on pedestrians and how women use space in the local context and on the streets on which the infrastructure is provided.  That would bring focus to the design team.  There needs to be that level of data collection.  It needs to come from both ends, if you like.</p></speech>

Many points have been made on the co-creation of design, which is absolutely necessary for safety and security.  I get the idea that passive surveillance is a major game changer rather than using other security measures.  There was some conversation earlier about antisocial behaviour, perhaps as a result of people misusing alcohol and drugs.  That probably requires a wider discussion because it impacts on all of us.  That is probably for another day.  A much more complicated answer to those issues is required.</p> <p>  I will ask about wider issues relating to those from a lower socio-economic space, particularly ethnic minorities.  Dr. Leva made the strong point that 40% of public transport journeys relate to care giving.  I was previously told that a major design problem is how we deal with mothers with buggies.  I am not great at multitasking.  I can imagine that I if I was left alone with a buggy and a couple of kids who were running every which way, it would end in disaster.  I would probably end up in a Garda station.  That is a different kettle of fish.  I would like to get into those design issues.</p> <p>  We have spoken about young women and cycling.  Are issues in that regard related to factors other than the design of the infrastructure?  We know, for example, that girls tend to opt out of sport at an earlier age.  We all go through teenage years and get notions.  Embarrassment is an issue.  I imagine there are greater issues for females.  It would be better for me to listen to our guests rather than rabbiting on so I will stop now.</p></speech>

The design of the physical environment around our cycle paths and public transport is important so that people can safely drive a pram with shopping on one side of it and a toddler on the other.  We must have the space to facilitate that kind of movement, which is different from the movement of an individual who is commuting.  That is vital.  It is one of the areas at which we are looking.  Small details are important.  For example, if a bench is installed, there must be space beside it for a pram to be parked while a person is waiting for public transport.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about cycling.  Part of the study showed that if we can encourage young children to cycle from an early age and they get that independence, those patterns can be set.  It is important that we look at short journeys when children go from home to school or from school to the local football pitch.  We must make those short journeys as safe as possible for children because that will establish a pattern.</p> <p>  How boys and girls use cycle paths is interesting.  One of the things we are looking to find out from the survey data we are collecting for Luas Finglas is whether girls move together as a group.  Do we need to have certain areas with wider cycle paths coming up to schools so that people can cycle two or three abreast?  The separation element is also critical for very young children.  All of those physical elements can help encourage those kinds of movements and that is the aim of our design process.</p></speech>

That is an area on which Dr. Leva has done considerable research.  In case we run out of time, I would like to prioritise Dr. Leva's research in that area and I can come back in at the end if there is time.</p></speech>

The report focused on many different aspects, mainly in the workplace, but public transport was mentioned as an area of interest.  This issue has an impact on many aspects of life, such as accessibility.  Monetary accessibility is not the same for everyone.  When we talk about accessibility, we often think of the structural aspect.  In Warsaw, we worked with people working in public transport who went out and audited their own public transport system, with amazing results.  Their engagement led to an increase in awareness.  I would recommend that for everybody.  We all use public transport, or most of us do, but auditing is a different story.  That would impact the perception of the priority area and I would recommend that to the committee.</p> <p>  It is important that we acknowledge that the segregation of data has the capacity to show pockets of very vulnerable subgroups in terms of accessibility problems.  I am not talking about the visibility issues, which still need to be tackled with regard to basic things like prams and wheelchair users.  In the context of an ageing population, the mobility of care is more and more important in caring for the elderly, as well as young children.  Time poverty is being stuck in between.  There are issues around physical accessibility and monetary accessibility.  Members of an ethnic minority might not have the choice of any other modes of transport and it is very important that they get fair access to the one that is available to them.</p> <p>  We have a very good system for senior citizens.  Believe it or not, in our survey, the senior citizens were the most satisfied age group in the population.  However, younger people were less satisfied, like those between the ages of 35 and 45, as were women in an ethnic minority.  There are a variety of reasons for that.  Most of them have experienced discrimination on public transport.  Most have security concerns and value for money concerns.  Some of them have connectivity concerns about the point-to-point travel service they are provided with.  Once we get the data, we have to be ready to discover that equality and equity are not quite there yet. </p></speech>

My question related to the importance of collecting gender-specific data and women being part of the consultation and design process.  The other witnesses spoke about the collection of data.  I had flagged the census but they said there were other surveying methods we could use.  I understand the NTA does a household survey every five years.  In Scotland there is an annual survey.  I take the point that the census is probably not the most appropriate form to collect the data, but are we collecting data regularly enough?  Are we collecting the right data?  Ms Cahill spoke about security and how women care more about the design of the infrastructure, the connectivity, the public realm and lighting rather than favouring more security necessarily.  They want well-designed public infrastructure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1799" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachel Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030900002#L00800"><p>One of the findings from our report is that women are not in favour of increased security or increased transport police.  That took us a bit by surprise.  However, on delving into that, we realised that it comes back to the social norms formed in early childhood, teenage years and young adult years.  Women largely take on the responsibility for their own safety and feeling secure in a given situation and, because of that, increased presence of security staff on trains was not the answer.  That is why women were not as strongly in favour of that as the men who answered that question.  Women largely take on that responsibility themselves, whether by carefully choosing their route home or taking measures such as holding keys in their hand, wearing headphones, only wearing one earphone, pretending to speak to someone on the phone as they walk home, wearing flat shoes or having flat shoes in their bag at all times.  In the ethnographic research, some of the interviewees used language around having to run or having to get away.  This is the language the people themselves were using, which is very powerful to play back when producing a report like Travelling in a Woman's Shoes.  I do not know if that answers the question.  I may have wandered off a little but it is an important finding from the report.  That is why women are looking for a more holistic solution, such as lighting or not having overhanging bushes or trees, looking at the first mile and last mile, gender-sensitive training or roster training for people in the transport sector.  We need all those things added together.  That co-creation piece is also important.  All together, solutions will begin to appear.</p> <p>  On the data, because we do not have gender-segregated data, it is very difficult to get under the bonnet and pinpoint exactly what is needed or what the solutions are.  The starting point is getting the data.  That sounds easy but it is not.  As Ms Fox mentioned when talking about Luas Finglas, getting those data requires changing the form to include gender.  Even doing that was an achievement as it challenged the norms and the ways things have been done over the years.  That is where we are.  We are starting.  Have I answered the question?</p></speech>

It is about not just having a default person, a default commuter, or a default person who drives, be it a man or a woman.  It would seek a more granular detail.  That is really what is required.  The household survey is every five years.  I really cannot speak to that survey itself but I note it is a very impactful and powerful survey.  As to whether or not it should be done more often, I really cannot speak to that.  That survey is used for many reasons, including transport modelling and across large areas of our transport ecosystem.  As a start, it would be helpful to acknowledge that the data needs to be more granular and to introduce more gender disaggregated data, not necessarily to change the whole form itself.  That is my view.  Perhaps others who are here today are closer to that actual survey.</p></speech>

I had also gone into that idea about the co-creation of design, but there have been answers on that.</p> <p>  On the issue of passive surveillance, there was a significant answer around my question of the particular issues affecting those in the lower socioeconomic bracket and those from ethnic minorities.</p> <p>  There was reference to the whole issue of cycling and girls making a determination not to do it.  There was an answer to that question with the idea of building up to short journeys earlier.  A lot more people might be looking to do that given the circumstances we are currently in.</p> <p>  I spoke about design earlier, but it is also about the design of access.  It is not just about the issue of men and women.  It is also to do with people who have a disability.  The point was made earlier about the need for more time to be allowed at pedestrian crossings.  It just happens that this issue was brought to me this week by a constituent who is in a wheelchair.  He can get halfway across a road to a stop but may not be able to make to the next part.  It makes what is already a difficult journey a lot more difficult.  How does the design take into account such difficulties, including for a mother with a pram and a couple of children?  This would seem to be to me to be a nightmare of the situation to navigate.  I believe that I have covered everything here, including three questions I never asked in the first place.</p></speech>

It is possible to build on that.  An extract, for example, says that lack of service is one of the main reasons given for not using bus services more frequently.  For the reference day, the respondents were asked the reasons why they did not use bus services more frequently:</p> <blockquote> 	  	Respondents were asked reasons why they do not use bus services more frequently.  Over one fifth (22.3%) stated that there was no service nearby, while 17.5% cited that there was no service to where they wanted to go.  Over one in seven (15.4%) cited that it was inconvenient...Too expensive was an issue cited most by persons aged 18 to 24 years, by 9.1% of males and 8.6% of females in this age group.  </blockquote> <p>We have the capacity to examine that level of engagement.</p></speech>

I have been listening in to the contributions in the office here.  I want to pick up on one issue, which my colleague also raised, on the piece about the family roles.  It is the second point in the research.  The witnesses pointed towards policy opportunities such as enabling children's independent mobility, designing child friendly public transport and adjoining public space, and the promotion of car-free travel at weekends to establish new habits.  Will the witnesses speak about the research in that area and the evidence that is coming back? It strikes me that this is a very important consideration.  Will witnesses tease out some of those ideas?  What is meant by the design of child friendly public transport?  Is this a physical feature or is it, as Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has said, about facilitating buggies and so on?</p> <p>  With regard to enabling children's independent mobility, are there good examples internationally where this is done?  I do not have to look beyond my own home to appreciate the logistics of managing small children and everything that goes with that.  Parents often use the throwaway remark of being the "kids' taxi" when running them around locally.  There seems to be a lot of travelling with children that pulls towards the use of the private car.  Are there good practices that we could point towards and learn from?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1827" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachel Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030900002#M02100"><p>I will start and then I will ask my colleague Ms Fox to join in the response, particularly around the design and what it looks like in practice.</p> <p>  Independent travel for young people and children is really part of this conversation and this narrative, given the role of family and the importance of it.  Consider cycling for instance, and children cycling to school.</p><p>Much is said about safe cycling, segregated cycling and safety for children, which is all important.  The NTA does fantastic work on safe cycling to schools.  The #andshecycles campaign is for schoolgirls in particular.  It interviews them about challenges and barriers for them when cycling to school.  It is powerful and impactful.  It is two minutes long and I recommend that everyone looks at it.  As we mentioned earlier, the school uniform and allowing girls to wear trousers is part of the conversation.</p><p> Children travelling on public transport is easier in the cities than in more rural areas.  My children are both in secondary school.  We are lucky enough to live near the DART so they travel on it.  Many schoolchildren use buses in the city.  It is much more difficult in rural areas.  Cars are required in many cases.  Cycling could come into play if the children or parents feel safe.</p><p> Before I hand over to Ms Fox, an interesting thing to come out of our research was the promotion of more sustainable forms of transport because of climate change.  Children come home to their families and talk about climate change.  They raise the travel behaviours in their households and how that contributes to climate change or not.  The research showed that the children are key to everything.  They learn in schools, come home, chat with their parents and their parents say that they are right.  That is an important aspect, which goes back to education of kids in schools.  Does Ms Fox want to refer to family-friendly design and what she is doing with regard to the Luas to Finglas and MetroLink?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1829" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eimear Fox" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030900002#N00200"><p>The average three-year-old is about 95 cm tall.  We need to design for ourselves, people in wheelchairs and also to think about how children experience an environment.  That can include traffic crossings where there are exhaust emissions.  We maybe need sheltered areas directly beside junctions where children can wait to cross.  We need to think about segregation so that when children get to the age of independence, parents are happy to let them go ahead because there is either planted segregation or physical segregation that keeps the modes of travel safe.  The thinking of that design type means that we see the public realm in a different way.  One can begin to see how seating can be adapted or how a group of rocks beside a junction can be a way for kids to explore their environment.  It means they are more interested in taking that journey again, since there are elements that animate their journey, which we might not see as adults.  Small design elements like that can make children want to do active travel.  As Ms Cahill said, it is followed by the school.  Much green school data is coming out, which really encourages kids.  We need to make it safe, fun and sheltered for them.  We need to design not just around points A and B but also the journey.  Children's lives would be enhanced by active travel.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that our starting point is where it is.  We have a long way to go and much to do.  I have a question about sociocultural behaviour barriers.  I am aware of #andshecycles and know advocates in that area.  They are great.  At the minute, they are not representative of broader society.  We need people to show leadership.  There is a lack of cultural acceptance for girls cycling.  Can more be done about that?  What immediate things do we need to do, such as showing leadership?</p></speech>

I might answer a slightly different question, if I can.  With regard to bringing sustainable mobility into the mainstream, we are bombarded nightly with television advertisements telling us how beautiful, fantastic and luxurious it is to drive a car.  All our status, communications and marketing are about that.  Besides the fact that much of our infrastructure does not cater for the needs of women, all the messages that we currently receive tell us that this is what we should aspire to do.  There is a communications and marketing issue.  We have to make sure that we design the infrastructure to meet people's needs.  We also need to let people know about the status that goes with it and that it is good to use these methods of transport.  They can cater for people's needs and they can travel in comfort.</p> <p>  I want to address independent mobility for children, which is important for many reasons.  It frees up women from mobility of care duties.  It is important for children's development.  At present, about 60% of primary school children are driven to school.  The Deputy asked if other places do it differently.  We often talk about our Nordic neighbours.  In Finland and Norway, the number of primary school children driven to school is in the 20% range.  The rest independently travel to school.  In Norway, it is part of the culture to tell children at the age of seven that it is time for them to walk to school.  This is only suitable in urban environments.  It would probably be a shock to many of us who have a seven-year-old to tell them to go to school alone.  That is because they have a programme relating to safe routes to school.  The local neighbourhood has child-friendly street design, with traffic cameras, with low levels of through traffic, low speeds, wide footpaths, parks that connect spaces, and child-friendly cycling infrastructure.  That facilitates independent mobility.</p> <p>  In Ireland, we have a new safe routes to school programme under Green-Schools, which is a really good start.  There is much new funding in this area.  We are moving in a positive direction, but independent mobility is important and deserves further discussion.</p></speech>

We need to get it right and we know from the past we have not got transport or planning right.  We have a good opportunity to do it now.</p> <p>  I will go straight to the report.  I have a number of questions and will direct them to various witnesses.  There is a startling figure of 95% of women who consider the car a necessity outside Dublin.  I ask Dr. Leva if that is a European norm or if it is very peculiar to Ireland.  Is it a result of our dispersed settlement patterns and the difficulty of having viable public transport because of those dispersed settlement patterns?</p></speech>

For this it is back to basics.  Ms Cahill can comment on the rationale for the figures in the Travelling in a Woman&rsquo;s Shoes report.  The Deputy said it.  There are two speeds.  The availability of transport in the Dublin area in the urban and some of the suburban areas is there.  When we move to a more rural context and even different town contexts, the realities are staggeringly different.  Even independent mobility becomes something feasible in the context where you have the community for it and becomes a totally different reality in a rural area where your house might be six miles away from the school.  Most of them have buses and vans but that is the reality we are facing.  Do we cater for all the needs of the country?  The CSO survey asks why we travel.  When we say "we", who is this "we"?  How many different communities are we incorporating in this "we"?  Is it "we" in the country, "we" in Dublin, "we" in D&uacute;n Laoghaire?  It is a different set of needs.  It is a different "we".</p></speech>

The 95% outside of Dublin is to do with the availability of public transport in more rural areas.  It is to do with the caregiving responsibilities women mostly take on in families and is also to do with their personal safety and security.  It is those three reasons.  With the lack of public infrastructure in some areas the car is deemed a necessity.</p></speech>

The research on women and cycling was talked about and I am delighted to see more research coming from this.  We have really damaged children's independence in the way we have designed our streets and in that car dependency again.  We have also put this huge stressful requirement on parents to drive their children everywhere because we have made streets dangerous for pedestrians, cyclists and people who wish to walk.  It is about the dominance of cars again.  On the research being done on women and cycling, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, was in with us last week and the representatives talked about their strategy at the moment.  They have a 50-point plan.  Do our guests think the gender lens is being applied to that plan?  Is it applied to, say, a review of a national cycle manual and is it being applied to looking again at the Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets, DMURS, as well because these all feed into each other?  Is the gender lens being applied sufficiently?  Are the learnings from this TII report being taken into those three main strategies?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1847" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachel Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030900002#O01400"><p>I can speak only from TII's perspective and what we are doing.  The gender lens we developed was for TII public transport projects but it is equally relevant to all transport infrastructure, including cycling and active travel.  On the national cycling network plan, TII is developing that so gender and the gender lens is part of that in addition to looking at international best practice and what is happening elsewhere, our research with women and cycling will certainly feed into that national cycling network plan.</p> <p>  On the Government's road safety strategy I really cannot say.  Obviously we are very involved in the development of that strategy in areas where TII can take the lead and we have a number of lead actions in that strategy.  As to whether a gender lens is applied I am afraid I just cannot answer that.</p> <p>  On the Department and the DMURS, there is a huge engagement and collaboration between the Department, the NTA and TII on the co-ordination and the integration of cycling manuals, DMURS or TII's standards.  I guess because this is part of the wider topic of sustainable mobility and the Department's sustainable mobility policy, which is due to be published at the end of this month, I would expect to see more reference to the gender lens in this area also.</p></speech>

I might direct the question to Ms Fox as well in her role as a landscape architect.  Let us consider the local authorities.  It might sound like I am having a go at engineers here.  Engineers are great.  They are great at building things and getting the technical compliance and the functionality of something.  However, I wonder if we have enough urban designers, transport planners, architects and landscape architects at the implementation level such that we design this infrastructure so it suits all.  It would not just be gender-based but based on age demographics as well.  We should ensure it is completely inclusive.  What would Ms Fox's thoughts be on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-09a.1849" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eimear Fox" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030900002#O01600"><p>I 100% agree.  The multidisciplinary approach to all infrastructure projects is critical because as the Deputy says, the engineers have one set of skills and landscape architects have another.  There is a role for drainage engineers in looking at nature-based solutions and sustainable urban drainage systems, SUDS.  I have very much been involved with DMURS.  The principle of DMURS is we look at a street and how that space is reallocated.  At the moment, so many of our streets are so dominated by the carriageway, which is often extra-wide and dominated by car-parking.  At that principal concept stage of looking at a streetscape to reallocate space we need to have gender and children's issues involved right at that initial stage as space is being reallocated.  Space can be multifunctional as well so it does not have to be just a transport element or just a landscape element or a SUDS element.  They can all be joined together.  All of these threads, including community, transport, water management and biodiversity can all be incorporated but there needs to be that vision at the project level which has all these voices.  That is a gap in certainly some of the larger authorities like those Dublin, Cork and Limerick that have that expertise at the local level.  Other authorities do not have that level of expertise and it is critical we have that thinking because it is about having more minds involved, whether they are male or female or engineers or landscape architects.</p><p>Even at the initial stages, the more views we have, the better the project will be.  That multifunctional element of streetscape is critical, which the design manual for urban roads and streets, DMURS, pushes.</p></speech>

With regard to the design of our urban roads and streets, the most important aspect is what is called the user hierarchy.  That puts pedestrians first, and more women walk than men.  Thereafter, there are cyclists, then public sector users, and more women also use public transport than men.  The other users of transport follow after that.  That user hierarchy is critical, but it has not translated down comprehensively to the local authority level because it involves difficult choices.  Even something like giving additional time at the traffic lights, as I mentioned, might sound as though it is not a big deal but it involves reshifting priorities and saying it is okay for those who drive to have to wait a little longer to allow pedestrians to cross the street.  That resistance is where this issue is coming to a head, so it is about standing up to that resistance and ensuring those difficult choices will be made.</p> <p>  The point about multidisciplinarity is critical and we have seen that issue in our recent advertisement campaign regarding active travel posts at a local authority level.  Many of the advertisements have focused on one profession and, in some ways, we are putting ourselves back in that position of forgetting we need to have diversity of voices.  There are very few urban designers in Ireland - I trained abroad - but it also involves landscape architects, community engagement and communications.  When it comes to urban design, that multidisciplinarity is critical to understanding how to design an environment, a street and a public realm that feels safe.  There are many elements to safety and security but one of them relates to how to design a space in order that it will feel welcoming to people, and an understanding of behavioural science comes into that.  One of the most important steps we can take is to ensure that every local authority that advertises for these active travel posts will be open to a multidisciplinary approach to the people it employs.  Local authorities have to get more women in these posts and that can be from other------</p></speech>

It is important we do not sideline things that, potentially, we do not know about.  I mentioned earlier the areas around Barcelona.  In the suburban borderline rural area, there are flexible, on-demand public transport services.  Although, normally, renting a car is not seen as a form of public transport, in that town it can be used to collect smaller pockets of people.  There are other European projects that are working in this area and there is an Interreg fund with a policy brief relating to the possibility of designing flexible and feasible on-demand transport solutions for rural areas, and that is definitely worth considering.</p></speech>

Are they the norm throughout European rail and train systems, railway stations and light-rail systems, or are they starting to reverse that trend because of the benefits of doing so?  More people might be attracted onto public transport if they feel safer, perhaps because it is not just a driver-operated system but there is the presence of somebody in a hi-vis jacket, even if it is just because of the perception of that.  Is a reversal of that trend taking place?</p></speech>

In the interviews we conducted with some of the users, the perception was that there should be a go-to person, which does not mean a security officer but could instead mean a central presence with a sense of place who is connected with with other human beings.   In an autonomous system, there is an absense of human beings.  It still has an impact on how we perceive that system to be, such as safe or unsafe or trustworthy or untrustworthy, from the perspective of a user.  The trend, however, is towards autonomy.</p></speech>

Are the stations unattended also?  The transport mode is unattended and autonomous and the stations are vacant as well.  Is that the trend throughout Europe?</p></speech>

The supervision is still there, but the way in which it is organised can vary.  The staff might not be localised in one particular station or location but they are nonetheless present and, in theory, supervising through CCTV and other forms of access.  They can see people at the station and speak to them remotely.  An air traffic controller can remotely control an airport in Norway, 1,000 km away from the airport, and still have a totally clear view of the runway.  This technology is deployed also in day-to-day forms of transport.  It does not mean that there is no one there.  Rather, the modality of the interaction with someone is mediated through technology.  The sense of presence can also be represented in different forms and we have to explore those forms.</p> <p>  There is also the issue of getting help.  We heard from many people that there should be a facility to send a text message.  This is very effective.  If you can send a text message and someone comes at the next station, that will be a very powerful message.  If you send a text message and nothing happens until the end of the journey, that is also a very powerful message, but in the wrong direction from what we want.</p></speech>

The executive summary of the Travelling in a Woman's Shoes report outlines a couple of stark statistics.  A total of 36% of women feel unsafe walking in their local area at night, compared with 13% of men, a threefold difference.  One in three women has been subject to physical harassment in public and, obviously, we are aware of the terrible tragedy of the Ashling Murphy case not long ago.  Six in ten women, or almost two thirds of them, do not feel safe taking the bus, while 47% will choose a longer route to walk if they perceive it to be safer.  I am a father of young adult daughters and I saw their reaction to the Ashling Murphy murder and tragedy.  There is evidence in the report to show there is serious work to be done in respect of women's safety in the context of every level of transport, be that walking, cycling or public transport.</p> <p>  What is the action plan to implement what our guests have highlighted empirically in their report and in light of the various surveys Senator Boylan highlighted?</p><p>What is the action plan and timeframe for this so we as a committee can assist TII in that regard?  From the findings of the report, what surprised and shocked Ms Cahill as a woman herself?  She might deal with those.  We have the report and those statistics are the ones I have highlighted because they give it to me in very concrete terms and are from various reports.  What of the action plan and where does she see the conduit for said plan?  Has TII put down any timeframes for actions?  What from the survey carried out in the Travelling in a Woman&rsquo;s Shoes report shocked and surprised her the most?</p></speech>

What surprised me most was good and bad in combination.  It was the role of families.  I know I have spoken about that here but I was surprised to see that came out so strongly.  I am thinking of the lived experience of the women we interviewed and how they spoke about their families.  I think especially of women perhaps with special needs and the levels they went to to ensure independent travel for their children as they grew into adulthood.  It was that family role and perceptions being formed from a very young age.</p> <p>  In our report, the joy and freedom public transport gives women came out very strongly as well.  We are talking about the main challenges, barriers and issues women have to incorporate into their daily decision-making, with safety being one of the big concerns, but many women spoke of the joy, freedom and independence public transport gave them and it is important we call that out.  Look at some of the language our interviewees used.  They talked about how the Luas glides over O'Connell Bridge and the peace that brought them as they looked down the river Liffey.  That is fantastic.  Some of the women in Cork talked about socialising with their pals and how they enjoyed being on the top deck of a bus and the view and beauty------</p></speech>
