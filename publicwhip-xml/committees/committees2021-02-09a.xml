Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate if he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and he is also attending remotely.</p> <p>  Today, we are engaging with officials from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to discuss its 2019 financial statement.  To assist us we are joined remotely by the following officials from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board: Mr. David Gunning, chief officer; Mr. Phelim Devine, project director;Mr. Jim Farragher, finance manager; Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director; and from the Department of Health by Mr. Greg Dempsey, deputy secretary general.  I welcome you all to the meeting.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute their computers when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  I also ask that contributors use the button to raise their hand when they wish to contribute and that they remove their masks when speaking to ensure they can be heard properly.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile telephones are on silent mode or switched off.  When they finish speaking they should take down their hand signal.</p> <p>  I also wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  However, a number of today&rsquo;s witnesses are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask members, where possible, to direct their questions to a specific witness.  If a witness has not been referred to, I ask the witness to state his or her name before responding. </p> <p>  Before I ask for the witnesses&rsquo; opening statements, I must make members aware that on Friday I received correspondence from the interim Secretary General of the Department of Health, Mr. Robert Watt, concerning the difficulty in discussing cost and timelines for completion of the hospital until the board and the Department finalise an analysis of these matters, which is currently ongoing.  I responded that the matters raised by the interim Secretary General could be addressed as part of today&rsquo;s opening statement.  The correspondence will come before the committee on Thursday.</p> <p>  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021020900002#B00300"><p>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is a special purpose public body established in 2007.  It is responsible for the planning, design, construction and fit-out of a new children's hospital located at the St. James's Hospital campus in Dublin and of two new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres based at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.</p><p>Following completion, the hospital and the units will be operated by a separate agency, Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, which was formally established on 1 January 2019.   </p><p>It is noteworthy that the new outpatient and urgent care centre located at Connolly Hospital has been commissioned and became operational in mid-2019.</p><p> The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is funded by State grants provided by the Health Service Executive.  In 2019, such funding amounted to just under &euro;200 million.  The board&rsquo;s statement of financial position indicates that, as at the end of 2019, the cumulative value of the assets under construction was &euro;422 million, inclusive of VAT.  This was the position after transfers valued at &euro;34.9 million and &euro;2 million to the HSE and Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, respectively.  These relate to the transfer to the HSE of the newly-constructed building housing the outpatient and urgent care centre, located at the HSE&rsquo;s Connolly Hospital, and the transfer of specialist equipment in the Connolly unit to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland.</p><p> The 2019 financial statements were certified by me on 17 June 2020.  The financial statements were qualified on the basis that, following the directions of the Minister for Health, the hospital development board accounts for pension liabilities only as they become payable.  This does not comply with the requirements of the financial reporting standard, which requires that financial statements recognise the full costs of retirement benefit entitlements earned in the period and the accrued liability at the reporting date.  Other than the pension accounting, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the board&rsquo;s financial position at the year end, and of the transactions during 2019.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Gunning" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021020900002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for their invitation to discuss the 2019 accounts.  I am joined by Mr. Phelim Devine, Mr. Jim Farragher, finance officer, and Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director, all of whom are on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.</p> <p>  The board was appointed to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital on a campus shared with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin 8 and the outpatient and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown and Tallaght University Hospital.  In December 2018, the Government approved an investment decision of &euro;1.433 billion for the project.  As has been stated since the outset of the project, there are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainty for them and nor can there be for the duration of the project.  These include construction inflation, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes and the employment order.  From August 2019, in accordance with the contract, the contractor has recovered the cost of national construction inflation in excess of 4%.  The inflation payment to the main contractor for the period of August to December 2019 was &euro;1.6 million including VAT, paid in July 2020.</p> <p>  The board's 2019 accounts were audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 12 June 2020.  The expenditure as of 31 December 2019 for that year on the design and build of the hospital was &euro;199,622,610.  This spend was against budgeted spend of approximately &euro;262 million.  This underspend in 2019 is primarily due to the fact that the main contractor did not advance the construction of the build against the planned original programme.  This lack of advancement of programme is primarily due to underresourcing of the project by the main contractor, a situation that has been in place since the beginning and which continues.  By way of an example, at the end of December 2019, the year in question, the contractor had progressed 8.5% of the works by value when it should have progressed 22% of the works by value and this delay has continued to grow month on month.</p><p>An analysis of the expenditure to December is set out in the table in the document provided to the committee.  I do not propose to read out the numbers as I presume members have them in front of them.</p><p> Moving on to the programme timeline, the construction contracts for the project were awarded in August 2017 and the construction completion date for the new children's hospital set out under the terms of the contract was August 2022.  When the construction is completed, the hospital will then be handed over to Children's Health Ireland for a period of commissioning ahead of opening.  When we last presented to the Committee of Public Accounts in November 2019 and to the Joint Committee on Health in 2020, we informed both that the project was behind schedule.  Since then, the delay has been exacerbated as a result of the Covid-19 crisis and ongoing issues with resourcing on the site.</p><p> The outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown was completed in May 2019 and successfully handed over to and opened by Children's Health Ireland in July 2019.  The 4,600 sq. m paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Tallaght University Hospital was contractually scheduled to be completed this month.  However, the contractor has advised us that construction will not complete before September.  The  building will then be handed over to Children's Health Ireland in order that it can open the facility after an eight-week period of operational commissioning and equipping.</p><p> The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board tracks progress and performance on a weekly and monthly basis and continues to engage with the contractor in an attempt to make up lost time.  The contractor  is contractually obliged to provide the development board with a compliant programme of works which sets out its approach to delivering the new children's hospital in accordance with the contract.  However, since the agreement of the programme as part of the phase B instruction, the programme updates provided by the contractor have not been compliant with the contract.  As a result, the development board is currently withholding 15% of monthly certified payments until such time as a compliant programme is submitted.  This is one of the levers permitted to the board under the contract to incentivise the contractor to deliver on its contractual obligations.</p><p> While the contractor has been underperforming as regards project execution, it has been extremely assertive as regards claims, as has been indicated at previous meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and the Committee of Public Accounts.  Since the commencement of this project, there has been a significant number of claims of a very substantial value.  There is an agreed dispute management process in place under the contract.  As matters stand, claims are active at all levels of the dispute management process, which involves the employer's representative, the project board, conciliation and adjudication.  One of the cases has reached the High Court.  We have also been involved in a number of adjudications.  The board is defending each claim robustly in order to manage the cost of the project and defend the public purse.  However, the sheer volume and nature of claims on the project is consuming a significant amount of executive and project team time and incurring significant costs.</p><p> Updates on timeline challenges and the associated impact on cost have been shared with all key stakeholders through the established reporting and governance structures, primarily the children's hospital project and programme steering group and the children's hospital project and programme board, which has members from the Department of Health, the HSE and Children's Health Ireland.  In addition to the regular reporting, the development board has undertaken a detailed review of progress on the project.  The objective of this report is to provide as much clarity as possible to all stakeholders on the implications of any delay, both in terms of the ultimate delivery date of the hospital and the forecasted impact on cost.</p><p>The development board's analysis has been submitted to the Department of Health and we continue to work closely with our colleagues in both the Department and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, as the analysis submitted is now subject to a robust, independent review and scrutiny.  We look forward to returning to the committee in due course to discuss the final details of this report upon its completion.</p><p> Notwithstanding the fact that there are delays to the programme, the building is taking shape, as committee members will see from the images distributed in the briefing pack.  Over 90% of all concrete has been placed and we have been advised by the contractor that the concrete frame will be complete by the end of this quarter.  The stone and glazed facade to the south fingers, the south elevation and part of the east elevation is well advanced, with the first finger block at the Rialto bridge now completed.  The main mechanical and electrical plant at basement level is nearing completion, with the primary distribution under construction up through the building.  The fit-out of the south fingers comprising outpatients, cardiology wards, therapies, etc., is progressing well and the fit-out of the hot block, which comprises the emergency department, critical care and theatres, has already commenced.</p><p> The development board is aware of how badly needed the new children's hospital is and of the impact that further delay will have on the children and young people, their families and the staff who are waiting for it to open and indeed on the residents who live close to the site.  Everyone working on the project is focused on making the new children's hospital a reality as soon as possible.  I look forward to answering any questions the committee might have on the project.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Greg Dempsey" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021020900002#E00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and Deputies for inviting the Department to join the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in assisting the committee in its examination of the 2019 annual financial statements.  My name is Greg Dempsey.  I am the deputy secretary responsible for the governance and performance division in the Department of Health.  This includes the newly created strategic capital investment directorate, which has responsibility for major capital investments, including the new children's hospital.</p> <p>  The national paediatric hospital project is the most significant capital investment project ever undertaken in Ireland's healthcare system.  The development of the new children's hospital is a Government priority project and will bring together the services currently provided at three children's hospitals into a modern, custom-designed, world-class, digital hospital to deliver the best care and treatment for Ireland's sickest children.  As well as playing a central role in the provision of excellent paediatric healthcare services, it will be the primary centre for paediatric education, training and research in Ireland.  The project comprises the new children's hospital at St. James's Hospital as well as outpatient and urgent care centres located at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown, and Tallaght University Hospital.  The construction project forms one of three interrelated elements of the new children's hospital programme for the delivery of a new paediatric model of care in Ireland, the others being the ICT infrastructure and the operational integration of the three existing children's hospitals.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, or the development board, is established under a 2007 ministerial order and has statutory responsibility for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital and the two satellite centres.</p> <p>  Under that same order, the development board is charged with keeping all proper and usual accounts and all special accounts as the Minister may from time to time require and, additionally, to submit an annual financial statement to the Comptroller and Auditor General for an audit report to be carried out in accordance with the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  The board's annual financial statements for 2019 were submitted to the Department on 11 August 2020, following the completion of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit.  They were then laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 13 August, pursuant to section 11 of the 1993 Act.</p><p> The board receives its capital funding for the project from the HSE as the sanctioning body for the new children's hospital programme.  As set out in the 2019 financial statements, costs of &euro;199.6 million were incurred by the board in 2019.  I am satisfied by the Comptroller and Auditor General's note as to the completeness and accuracy of the accounts and by my Department's internal review of same.</p><p> I will take this opportunity to thank the board for the work it has conducted since it was last before this committee with the Department, including the completion of the additional governance systems and increased resourcing and expertise recommended by the 2019 PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, report.  This puts the board in a strong position to deliver the project to completion.</p><p> I will also take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the outgoing chair of the board, Mr. Fred Barry, for the work he has done in the past few years leading the board and this project.  I must not forget the sterling work of the other members of the board.  For the Department of Health, finding a replacement for Mr. Barry is an immediate priority and officials have already initiated the process to seek to appoint a new chair through the Public Appointments Service.  This may take time but it is considered important that we cast the net wide to find the right candidate for this challenging role.  In the meantime, and to ensure continuity and leadership, the Minister is likely to seek an interim chair for the board.</p><p> I note the significant progress that has made to date on the St. James's Hospital campus despite the challenges that Covid-19 has imposed on us all.  The board advises that it has already submitted a progress update to the committee illustrating the activity to date and it is welcome to us all that the distinctive design of the building is now beginning to take shape.</p><p> I am aware from the invitation to today's meeting that, in addition to the task of examining the 2019 annual financial statements, committee members have expressed an interest in the timeline and projected costs for the completion of the hospital.  The Department acknowledges the responsibilities and duties of the committee and the interest of members in such matters.</p><p> A thorough analysis of the project was sought by the Minister in the summer of 2020 and the Department and other stakeholders have been working closely with the development board in the intervening period.  The development board and the Department are nearing finalisation of this long and detailed analysis, which includes a determination of potential updates to the timeline and costs of the project.  A submission was recently received by the Department and is now subject to review by departmental officials, together with a robust and thorough independent analysis and scrutiny.  This is an important quality assurance step to be able to provide assurance as to the validity of the modelling used by the development board to the Government and other stakeholders, including this committee.  This detailed analysis is nearing finalisation.  Following its completion and submission to the Minister for Health, who commissioned it, an update on the position will be provided to the relevant stakeholders.</p><p> It is anticipated to have a final determination before the end of February or in early March.  The Department and the development board would be pleased to return to appear before this committee early next month to address the areas of interest to it and will be in a much better informed position at that stage to do so.</p></speech>

At the time one of the members described that as delusional.  Is he still working under the assumption that the construction will be completed in August 2022?</p></speech>

I will use a particular point which is the time that the site closed due to Covid in March of last year.  The accumulated delay at that time was five months.  In other words, the contractor at that stage was five months behind the committed programme timeline.  As of today, the contractor is guiding us that they are ten months behind the committed programme timeline.  That is the position in terms of the timeline.  As Mr. Dempsey has pointed out, we have gone through a lot of detailed analysis of the programme.  We have a recent submission from the contractor in relation to their assessment of the programme from now until the end.  That is currently under review.  All of these are set out in the analysis that has been submitted to the Department.  So, I would expect out of this there will be a reset of the timelines, but I cannot particularly say until there are further discussions with the Department on that.</p></speech>

August 2022 was the original contractual date.  Because of the Government-mandated closedown due to Covid of seven weeks, that contractual period gets extended by approximately 8 weeks.  So, the contractual date now is October 2022, just as a particular data point.</p></speech>

I will focus on Mr. Gunning and he can defer to others as required.  The finish date, by my calculation, is May 2024 from what he has outlined, which will be news to a lot of people but that is how he outlined it.  He also said earlier, in his presentation, that in terms of the execution of the value of the bill there has been 8.5% done as opposed to the 22% that was expected.  He also used the phrase "rising month on month".  Does this mean the level of delay and the lack of targets being met are widening each month?</p></speech>

By the end of November 2020, we should have spent almost &euro;600 million on this project.  We actually spent &euro;338 million.  The delta that was unspent was &euro;258 million.  This delta has been increasing.  When I say that of late things have improved in the resourcing of the site by the contractor, the numbers on-site have been increasing but they are still not at the level the contractor had set out in the contractor's own resource programme and resource plan for the project.  I do not think it is possible for me to say that it is a week a month because it has varied.  At present, it is improving somewhat.</p><p>At the moment the contractor has had more than 1,000 people on site, which is the highest level of resources it has had on the site since the project began.  That is encouraging, but it will not be enough to recover the delay that has accumulated to date.</p></speech>

I want to park that for a second.</p> <p>  Deputy Munster asked a question and I would like it to be answered in the way I think she asked it.  Of the 700 claims or 466 second claims, rather than the net gain or loss to the project I want to know how many of the 466 claims did the State win and how many did it lose?</p></speech>

We made more savings than there have been additions to the project in terms of the claims process to date.</p></speech>

In terms of the dispute resolution, what have been the legal costs expended on the 466 cases that have been concluded?</p></speech>

As an entity, the legal fees in 2018 were &euro;120,000, in 2019 they were &euro;691,000 and in 2020 they were &euro;466,000.  The last figure does not include the costs that we incurred for our High Court case, for a particular reason.</p> <p>  I wish to put down a marker.  As we look forward and these claims and the various dispute mechanisms come into play, there will be a significant increase in what I would call our claims defence expenditure.  In the face of a &euro;300 million challenge by the contractor, we will spend a considerable amount of money on legal fees and specialist advisers to defend those claims.  That is in the plan we have submitted to the Minister.</p></speech>

The sharing of that information from a commercial sensitivity point of view is not permitted under the contract.  We can share the aggregate type information that we are sharing with the committee today.</p></speech>

We may successfully defend them.  However, if the contractor decided not to pursue the claims in the same way it is pursuing them, we would not be incurring the legal fees and costs of claims defence.  Currently, these are essential and necessary costs that we incur.</p></speech>

Before phase B, as it was known, proceeded - I certainly would have had an issue with going with the existing contractor at the time without having a second tender process - I put on the record of the committee that the contractor in question was in litigation on nine other projects with the State.  I know if I were building a house and the developer sued me, one could chalk it down that the developer would not be building my next house.</p> <p>  This is an important point.  Why would we go with somebody who has form and is suing us left, right and centre as it is?  It is said the definition of true insanity is to do the same thing again and again and expect a different outcome.  Is it Irish law, European law or both that forces us to engage somebody with whom we had a bad experience in the past?  Was it just our own stupidity?</p></speech>

I will first touch on transfer of building and equipment costs as they relate to Connolly Hospital.  In particular, what is the length and cost of the lease agreement between the HSE and Children's Health Ireland for the outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital?  Will Children's Health Ireland ever own that building or is it envisaged it will always be leased from the HSE?</p></speech>

I have something more specific for the board of the national paediatric hospital development board.  It still relates to Connolly Hospital but is more concerned with the contract.  There was a notice of dissatisfaction issued by the board on the back of the conciliator's recommendations relating to the main contractor's claims under the contract for Connolly Hospital.  What was the outcome of that?</p></speech>

As Mr. Gunning said, we are waiting for the final account.  One or two snags remain to be closed up by BAM and we will get to these at final accounts stage.  It is probably trending at approximately &euro;29.6 million, slightly over the budget.  That is what we believe it might be, pending, as Mr. Gunning says, the final account and if the contractor seeks to claim or put in a last claim on that final account.</p></speech>

I also sit on the Joint Committee on Health.  I realise what Mr. Gunning is trying to say and that a report is coming.  However, I find the lack of numbers really frustrating to deal with as well as the lack of surety on this project and the related projects.  It is incredibly frustrating when it comes to giving any meaningful oversight.</p> <p>  I want to return to something that was mentioned in the opening statements, which is the resignation of the chair of the board.  I want to understand a little about the process to appoint a new chair of the board.  What is the timeframe for that?  What is the timeframe for the interim chair?</p> <p>  Mr. Gunning touched on a related issue in that he joined in 2019.  I am aware that in the process of large projects and contract implementation institutional knowledge of what has happened and what has been said in rooms is really important.  I would like to understand this in terms of the board.  We lost a specialist in procurement in October 2019.  We lost an academic who was an expert in corporate governance in December 2019 and we have now lost the chair of the board.  How many on the board now were in place when the board was put together?  How many of those had some involvement in the project or some knowledge of the project, for example, in July 2016 when it began on-site?</p></speech>

I was not there at the time.  I cannot answer that straight-up.  The process for the appointment is a matter for the Department or the Minister.  I do not really have any say in terms of the actual board members.</p></speech>

We will do that with the Public Appointments Service.  We have already engaged with that body to let those responsible know that we will be seeking to appoint a new chair and what the skillsets and competencies we require.  The PAS is engaging with us in terms of a process to ensure we cast the net as wide as possible and attract a wide range of applicants.  Then, there will be a process that will culminate in a recommendation or a number of recommendations to the Minister.  That can take six to eight weeks, but we have started that process.  In the meantime, as I said in my opening remarks, it is possible that we will appoint an interim chairperson from the current board, but we will have to talk to the individuals.</p></speech>

I wish to go back on the &euro;300 million in claims because I want clarification on this.  My understanding is that 466 claims have been dealt with and this leaves 235.  What is the value of the 466 that a decision has been made on?</p></speech>

The first step in the process is that the claim goes to the employer's representative, which the Deputy is familiar with.  The employer's representative makes a decision, which either party can accept or reject.  If that is referred to the next stage and not accepted, it goes to the project board.  After that, it goes to conciliation and if it is not accepted in conciliation, it may be rejected or it may end up in the High Court.  The process involves that set of stages so until they come through, I would not definitively say the 466 are now done.  There are not.  There has been an employer's representative determination but some of them continue to the next phase and several hundred of them have been referred to conciliation.  Only a small number have gone through the conciliation process.</p></speech>

It is only as the work goes on that one discovers whether or not it was detailed enough.  Therefore, is an analysis at this stage just trying to pick figures out of the air?  We are talking about &euro;300 millions in claims and we are only at 20% of the project.</p></speech>

In December 2018, the Government approved an investment decision of &euro;1.433 billion.  Those costs appear to have spiralled to the extent that it has been suggested that expenditure may reach anything up to &euro;2 billion.  I accept that the board is certain that a report will be furnished next month but we are quite a bit into the lifetime of this contract.  Can the witnesses give a sense, say, to the nearest hundred thousand euro, of what the overall cost of this project will be?</p></speech>

We learned today that the board has a complex contract in place with a contractor, to facilitate different levels of dispute resolution and conciliation and all that comes with that, yet we heard there have been 700 conciliation claims by the contractor, with a potential outlay of &euro;300 million.  We learned that, leaving aside High Court actions, we spent &euro;691,000 and &euro;466,000 on legal costs in 2019 and 2020, respectively.  We are learning - the witnesses might tell me if I am wrong - that the number of conciliation claims on behalf of the contractor will only increase.  Despite all that, we still cannot get a specific timeframe for when the hospital will be complete.</p> <p>  Mr. Gunning stated on a number of occasions that he came on board in 2019.  Who is responsible for this absolutely scandalous debacle, whereby we have a contract built on quicksand, based on what I can see and what the committee has heard today?</p></speech>

We have four main work streams, as I mentioned.  The design element is practically complete and we now need to ensure the design is delivered.  We are engaged on that.  The build element is contracted out to the main contractor.  On the equipping element, we have already equipped the centre at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown and we are in the process of equipping the centre at Tallaght Hospital.  We are well advanced in the equipping of the national children's hospital, NCH, at St. James's Hospital.  The commissioning work, which is a complex piece of work, is the commissioning of a highly complex digital hospital.  The planning for that is well advanced.  We are well advanced and we just need to get the project progressing.  I mentioned that the last of the concrete will be poured in the not-too-distant future.  If one drives past the hospital, one will see the progress that is being made.  We are making progress although the Deputy is absolutely right; we are not where we need to be.</p></speech>

If Mr. Gunning had contracted a person to oversee the design, building, equipping and all the other planning issues pertaining to building the house and, when 20% of the works had been done, that agent was not in a position to tell him when the job would be completed or what the final cost would be, would he consider that perhaps he had signed a bad contract and that that is where the fundamental problem lies in terms of the delivery of this project?</p></speech>

Although there were issues in the past, it is fair for Mr. Gunning and his team to state that they have strengthened their oversight and control mechanisms.  There is much uncertainty by the very nature of the cost.  We are working through an updated timeline and cost but, in fairness, we should wait until we actually have assessed it and can discuss it confidently.  That is why we are proposing to come back before the committee to do that work.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their time and for answering the questions they can answer.  I understand that the report to which they have referred is due at the end of the month.  It is a pity that it is not available to the committee today because it would help to inform members on many of the questions we have.  Notwithstanding that, I understand the report will provide more information on the 700-odd claims that have been asked about already.</p> <p>  On the issue of outpatients and the urgent care centres at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals, Mr. Gunning stated that they are being fitted out.  I understand that the centre at Connolly Hospital opened in July 2019.  Are there any outstanding claims relating to those centres that are being developed or kitted out or have been opened?  Is it the same contractor?  </p> <p>  On the issue of the HSE grant, how much is the HSE grant to date?  I am not sure whether that is a question for Mr. Dempsey.  One of the other witnesses may have that information.  I note that the grant had been increasing year on year since the start of the project.  I ask the witnesses to inform the committee in that regard.</p> <p>  On the PwC report from April 2019, I note that there are several recommendations in the report.</p><p>I understand members of the board appeared before this committee previously, although not Mr. Gunning.  As I understand it, he started in his role in September 2019.  The cost of that PwC report and the recommendations contained in it are of interest to me with respect to the impact they had on the project.  I have heard today that, unfortunately, costs may still be increasing every month as well as the timeline for the delivery of this muc- needed hospital.  Mr. Gunning might respond to those points.  I advise the Chair I might come in again in the short period I have remaining.</p></speech>

Certainly, the required reading when I came on board was the PwC report.  It very clearly states the GMP does not provide for an enhanced position in respect of price certainty; it does not present a fixed price.  It goes on to state that a number of risk areas remain that have the potential to place further cost pressure on the budget.  It goes on to identify each and every one of those and sets out a proposed mitigation for each one of those costs.  I reassure the committee that we have implemented each one of those mitigation steps to dimension the scale of challenge each one of those particular risks presents to the overall budget.  Those particular numbers are a key part of the submission we made to the Department, which will be shared with the committee in the not too distant future.</p> <p>  In terms of the PwC report, eight particular recommendations applied to the development board and a number applied to the HSE and the Department of Health.  For the eight recommendations, there were in the order of 45 specific action items.  The development board formed a board subcommittee to supervise the implementation of those actions.  Again, I can confirm to the committee everyone of those actions were discharged and the remediation plans were put in place.  I will hand over to Mr. Devine who can deal with the Deputy's specific questions on Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.</p></speech>

We are nearly at final accounts stage so I will not dwell on it.  However, in terms of Tallaght hospital, which is an ongoing project and is due to be completed in September this year, there have been 215 claims in respect of sections 1 and 3.  Decant and cr&egrave;che administration facilities were built for Tallaght University Hospital, which was the first phase, followed by an outpatient and urgent care centre, which is the third phase of that procurement.  Of those, they have all been determined through the contract apart from six.  We are trending slightly above the budget because there have been a number of unforeseen campus infrastructure issues with which we have had to deal, which we have done, and we have improved the infrastructure for the benefit of Tallaght University Hospital and the outpatient and urgent care centre.</p></speech>

In terms of the design that has been issued for the project, the contractor is responsible for a lot of the design.  Bringing the contractor's design and the employer's design together might move something in the building.  A rainwater pipe might move and it requires a different box set so there would be a claim for that, and it is a minor claim.</p> <p>  The bigger category of claims is to do with delay.  Mr. Gunning has set out that the project is currently in delay by ten months so the contractor will seek to try to recover the cost of that delay.  That is where the big money comes in.  Some of these claims - the &euro;300 million - overlap so they are all time claims.  If one added the aggregated time together, the claim is less than &euro;300 million.  If they claim for four or five different things and a time delay, if they seek to win one, which they have not to date, the other ones might fall away.  Does that help the Deputy?</p></speech>

Mr. Devine said earlier that while there were &euro;300 million worth of claims, he contested that that would be the outlay involved.  Does he want to speak a bit more about that?</p></speech>

That has been the outcome to date of our robustly defending each one of these claims, as Mr. Gunning has set out.</p></speech>

He said that strong additional measures had been put in, and I assume that is what he is referring to.  What about the volume of claims since the implementation of that?  I am not taking April 2019 as the date of implementation.  Surely it takes a period of time to implement that.  Can Mr. Gunning provide more information on that?</p></speech>

The number of claims the contractor submits is not a condition of our control environment or the way this project is run by the development board.  That is a decision by the contractor to put in these particular claims and our responsibility is to robustly defend them.  There is no correlation or causation between these particular issues.</p></speech>

I have some questions that follow on from what my colleagues have already asked.  I find it incredible that the witnesses would say they are between two to four weeks from presenting a report to the Government on this issue.  All that can be left to do is to type it up, yet they cannot give us a figure and are saying it would be commercially sensitive.  That makes no sense to me.  Two weeks out from submitting the report, if the witnesses are asked for an estimated figure, to within &euro;100 million, for the final cost or at least some part of the final cost, it should be delivered today.  They could have saved themselves another trip to appear before this committee.</p> <p>  The dogs on the street were aware that this project would not come in at the projected cost.  The original projections were somewhere between &euro;650 million and &euro;800 million.  Who projected that figure?  Where did it come from and who was responsible for delivering it?  I ask the witnesses to respond as quickly as possible as I have a very short time.</p></speech>

With regard to the High Court legal fees, Mr. Gunning previously stated at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health that there would be an additional &euro;15 million to pay on legal costs, specialists, programme and quantum.  Since the number of claims by the contractor has also jumped from 600 to 700, can Mr. Gunning provide an update to this committee on what he expects costs to total by the end of this project?</p></speech>

We therefore expect there to be a greater increase in those legal costs as the project delays further and the substantial completion date is pushed out.  We will announce the date when we are comfortable with that.  Therefore, the legal estimates are all part of, shall we say, our adding up what we anticipate the total cost will be.  We will have and will make that information available following our engagement with the Department, which is currently ongoing.</p></speech>

I am sure, and Mr. Gunning will be well aware, that the mechanism allows this within the contract.  An enormous value of money is at stake here, however.  How are relationships moving forward?  What efforts are being put in place to ensure BAM provides an updated programme?  Has that been provided to date which incorporates both the Covid-19 delays and the rows on extra costs?</p></speech>

That is currently being reviewed.  Since the very early stages of this project, we have not had a compliant programme that sets out what needs to be included for us to monitor BAM's progress or for BAM itself to monitor its progress.  Therefore, we are withholding the 15%.  It is the only mechanism allowed to us under the contract and hence our reasons for implementing it as the incentive for the contractor to provide us with a fully compliant programme.</p></speech>

We are in a process, Deputy McAuliffe, in relation to that.  Even though he has said we have named the date here, I have very deliberately not said that that is the date so I think there have been certain assumptions made.  I just want to say that we will provide guidance in relation to the schedule, and in relation to the budget, once the process that we are engaged in currently, which has been going on for some months, has concluded.  I know that we offered via the letter last week to come back in in four weeks or the end of February-early March to set out these particular issues, Deputy, so I hope to be in a position to do that.</p></speech>

We have had a lot of speculation around this project right from the start.  I will say, if I can be very brief, there will be costs associated with the delay because of the delayed time.  There will be costs associated with dealing with and defending the claims.  There will be costs that have been identified in the PwC report as residual risks and we have put numbers on each of those, including the bigger issue of inflation and some other matters, including provisional sums.  We will be including all of those particular cost categories.  We have gone through everything.  It has been an extremely thorough analysis.  We think we will arrive at a particular point that we can have confidence in.</p></speech>

It is well known that construction companies often tender for a job and make their money on their claims so I appreciate the robust response that the board is taking to claims.  It does have an impact on the legal costs of that process too.  Mr. Gunning has just discussed the following issue.  Can he outline what measures have been taken to ensure that legal costs are kept to a minimum and, equally, the professional fees that we have seen increase from &euro;130,000 in 2019 to &euro;700,000 in 2018 and up to 2019?  Perhaps he can give us a flavour of how he tried to ensure that the necessary work of robustly defending claims has been managed and, equally, how legal costs have been kept to a minimum.</p></speech>

I guess we need to look at it as follows.  With this level of claims we need an appropriate response and the return on the investment has got to be significant, we have got to get value from the investments that we make here.  We are subject, obviously, to all the normal procurement rules.  So all the moneys that we spend have got to be tendered publicly and, therefore, we get the benefit of the value that comes through that.  We are also managing the procurement process very, very closely in terms of case management, in terms of the decision-making that happens on each one of these cases.  So there is a full and complete process.  There are individuals teams allocated to each particular challenge, each particular claim and we are working these like a military operation from start to finish.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Gunning believe that the contractors are operating in good faith?  In terms of the claims that are being put forward, can he talk to us about those that are reasonable that have been dealt with so far?  There is the possibility that almost in a process of attrition there is an attempt to wear down resistance to claims.  Can he talk about his assessment of the claims that have been dealt with so far?</p></speech>

We are dealing with each one of these claims.  Each one is almost like a mini trial.

We have exchanged some proposals, shall we say, with the contractor on how these might be more expeditiously dealt with.  That would be good for us from a value for money perspective, in that we would not incur a lot of the costs while at the same time would not be acceding to, shall we say, claims that do not have merit.  It is as such a balance and we have that balance right.  However, the big money is in a small number of large claims that are very significant.  That is where we have to put our big guns.</p></speech>

Obviously we would, at stages, question whether - a little bit like what a Deputy asked earlier on - this level of claims is usual and what is being done about it.</p><p>We are seeking an update, which will include a projection or a judgment on the actual expenditure that might have to be incurred against those claims.  That is part of it.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Mr. Dempsey stated "The development board and the Department are nearing finalisation of this long and detailed analysis, which includes a determination of potential updates to the timeline and costs of the project."  To what extent is the claims process mapped onto that "long and detailed analysis"?  If I understand the previous witnesses correctly, it seems to me that if one was trying to map who is winning the battle of the claims war, the board is about a nose ahead at present but in the long-term analysis, it could be that the contractor might come out on top from a financial point of view.  In other words, is there a deeper analysis of this taking place around the claims process?</p></speech>

The answer is "Yes", there is a detailed analysis happening on the claims.  We cannot ignore the impact of Covid in this regard on the whole project, on contractors, on sub-contractors and on others.  That is another issue that will have to be understood and experienced.</p></speech>

On 12 August, the board discussed the current design format of the project and its compatibility with future hospital designs to manage future pandemic-type viruses.  The board discussed potential design modifications to take place post completion and noted that industry guidance would have to come in time.  Have we a reason to be concerned about design?  Is the hostile claims culture of the developer an impediment to doing things in real time as opposed to retrofitting afterwards?</p> <p>  Did we have to change any of the specifications, for example with insulation, as a consequence of the Grenfell Tower fire or other UK examples?  If so, was there a cost implication?</p> <p>  On the time overrun, is there a potential for a counterclaim for non-adherence to the contract obligation in respect of the delivery time?  Has this been considered or is it something that the board will consider?</p></speech>

Those penalties apply after a certain time has elapsed from the contractual completion date.  We will seek to apply those through the contract.  That is one aspect.  Counterclaims also arise on other matters and the development board has issued a number of counterclaims to the contractor to recover costs on some other activities of the contractor.  Those activities are clear and the contract is clear on them.</p></speech>

Interestingly, at the time we were designing the children's hospital, it coincided with the Ebola outbreak and the significant concerns that Ebola might be imported into the country.  It is a highly infectious disease.  We were aware that we had to factor in something like Ebola.  Obviously, we did not know about Covid-19 then.  We had to design with the potential and possibility of that kind of infection in mind.  We needed to future-proof the building.  The infection prevention control measures taken in the design of the building were extremely comprehensive.  To reflect what is in it, there is 100% single rooms in the general wards, the emergency department and the intensive care unit.  For example, at that time there was a request that there might be open provision in some of the intensive care units for various logistical reasons but we-----</p></speech>

On the previous occasion the witnesses were before this committee, following some effort, we got a one-page breakdown of costs, including a final cost figure of &euro;1.7 billion as of 2018.

On the cost, there seems to an assumption of a final cost of approximately &euro;2 billion.  There are 700 claims, of which 466 have been processed.  Mr. Gunning mentioned earlier that we are only 20% into the construction process in terms of the value.  As such, we have 80% of the way to go.  At this point, is he confident that the final cost will not exceed &euro;2 billion?</p></speech>

For example, in Chicago a 664-bed hospital was built for &euro;541 million and in Atlanta a 402-bed hospital was built for &euro;499 million.  The cost here appears to be extraordinary, and rising on the basis of what we are hearing today in regard to the 700 extra claims from the contractor.</p><p>As I said, we are only 20% of the way into it.</p><p> I will move on to legal costs.  There are obviously ongoing legal issues between BAM and the board regarding these 700 claims.  Mr. Gunning has outlined some of the legal costs involved.  On the situation relating to the first lockdown, the contractor could have been back on-site in mid-May but did not come back until mid-July.  There is potentially a big claim and there is a dispute between the contractor and the board.  How much is that estimated to come to, and is that added onto the 700 claims already mentioned at a cost of over &euro;300 million?  In other words and to put it very simply, is it &euro;300 million plus whatever it takes to cover the compensation for phase 1 of the lockdown?</p></speech>

The contract is relatively clear on this particular issue.  In the event that there is a Government-mandated closedown, our view, or the view in the contract, is that for every day of that closedown, the contractor can get an extension of time.  It was seven weeks for the Government-mandated shutdown, and that seven weeks can be extended onto the contract completion date to give a new contract completion date which does not attract penalties or anything like that for the contractor.  For the time that the contractor remained closed, in our view, there certainly can be no compensation or no reward for the contractor's behaviour at that particular time.  There was no reason the contractor should not have been back on-site and working at that particular time.  There are a number of Covid claims within the claims we have talked about and they will be dealt with in the course of the process that is set out in the contract for dealing with these claims.</p></speech>

However, I am tied to Covid guidelines and as we have the Department of Health in the room, we have to abide by them.

Today we are joined by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  They are welcome.  I thank them very much for joining us this afternoon.  The Minister, Deputy McGrath, is accompanied by officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, including Ms Caroline O'Loughlin, assistant principal for performance budgeting, Mr. John Kinnane, principal officer, central expenditure policy and reporting division.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is accompanied by officials from the Department of Finance, including, Mr. Niall Cassidy, principal officer in the economics section and Ms Anne-Marie Walsh, principal officer in the tax section.</p> <p>  Today we will discuss the committee's interim report on the framework for parliamentary engagement throughout the budgetary cycle, the potential for enhanced parliamentary engagement, and the capacity of the Executive to support an enhanced framework.  This is the committee's final engagement before it publishes its final report.</p> <p>  Before we begin I wish to explain to the witnesses some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference they may make to other persons in their evidence.  Pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, the evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege.  However, if they are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the places in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, to make his opening statement.  Due to technical problems we cannot hear him.  We will try to establish contact.  If we cannot sort out the sound issue I will call on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to make his opening statement.  I am sorry, but we cannot hear him either.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#B00100"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it today and to make a contribution to its deliberations on parliamentary engagement throughout the budget cycle.  The interim report of the committee sets out a number of key observations, including in respect of pre-budget and performance scrutiny.  I will deal with the issues that are relevant to the expenditure side of these processes.</p> <p>  I am very appreciative of the efforts and the insights that have gone into the preparation of the interim report.  It is encouraging that the progress that has been made in recent years in improving and strengthening the opportunities for parliamentary engagement in our budgetary process not least through the establishment of this committee, of which I am a former member, but also that it would be kept under review and that opportunities for further enhancement should be identified and implemented, where appropriate.</p> <p>  Equally, it is important to acknowledge and to remind ourselves of the progress that has been made and that is under way to support increased parliamentary engagement.  As I have just mentioned, the establishment of this committee is one milestone in this reform agenda, as is the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office.  At the same time, the reforms introduced by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform also support budgetary scrutiny and effective engagement with the budgetary process.  The programme for Government also outlines a number of priorities in the area of reform to the budgetary process, including the development of well-being measures and better budgeting for demographic costs.  These priorities, along with the significant reforms in place, can help to deliver more focused and more informed engagement.  As the committee noted in the interim report, a more effective budgetary framework has the potential to lead to improved outcomes for citizens through better informed policy-making, resource allocation and accountability.  Ultimately, that is an outcome we all want to see delivered.</p> <p>  Reforms in recent years with the publication of additional documents such as the summer economic statement and the mid-year expenditure report support better pre-budget scrutiny.  I acknowledge that the pandemic impacted this process last year, with the mid-year expenditure report not being published in July as usual and being replaced by a pre-budget expenditure update published in advance of the budget in October.</p> <p>  The exceptional circumstances last year, with a requirement to respond to the evolving situation with the virus, meant that the focus was on implementing measures to support people and businesses experiencing extreme difficulties arising from Covid-19 and to ensure that the health service had the resources to respond to the crisis.  The scale of support provided resulted in overall gross voted expenditure for 2020 coming in at &euro;85.3 billion, an increase of almost &euro;15 billion on the amount set out in the pre-Covid Revised Estimates for Public Services 2020, the REV.  I acknowledge the role of the Oireachtas in considering and approving this significant level of additional expenditure required to implement these support measures.</p> <p>  Turning to pre-budget scrutiny, there are a number of processes in place that can support such engagement.</p><p>In setting out the departmental expenditure baseline for the medium term, reflecting pre-existing commitments arising from cost pressures such as demographics and outlining the mid-year expenditure position for Departments, the mid-year expenditure report is focused on supporting enhanced pre-budget scrutiny.  I note that the interim report specifically references the cost of standing still for the budget year, including taking account of demographics.  This is an issue that the mid-year report seeks to inform and, as I noted earlier, better budgeting for demographic costs is included in the programme for Government. </p><p> Alongside the mid-year expenditure report, my Department publishes the spending review papers.  Among the objectives of the spending review process are the assessment of the effectiveness of public spending in delivering on policy objectives and the development of evidence-informed policy making.  With more than 100 published papers from the spending review process since 2017, this represents a significant evidence base to support policy formulation and development and a year-round approach to the budget process. </p><p> I note that the interim report outlines that performance scrutiny should move towards a more structured year-round engagement.  I am supportive of the principle that underlies this recommendation.  Indeed, there are a number of processes and reports in place that can support such engagement.  In this regard, performance budgeting has been a key focus of budgetary reform.  With the change in the budgetary timetable in 2013 and the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, now being published in December each year, this provides an opportunity for earlier engagement by committees with the Estimates during the first quarter of the year.  The REV itself has developed significantly in recent years and now routinely includes details on activities, outputs and context-specific outcome indicators.  </p><p> Over the past three or four years in particular, the performance budgeting initiative has been expanded to include indicators relating to equality objectives.  The equality budgeting initiative was first introduced as part of budget 2018 and aims to provide greater information on how budgetary measures are likely to impact upon the various dimensions of equality.  Expanding from an initial pilot, REV 2021 includes equality indicators for a number of Votes across 12 ministerial Vote groups, with additional Departments providing indicators this year including the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Since its introduction, the performance budgeting initiative has been kept under review with a view to enhancing the quality of the information provided.  As we look to develop performance budgeting further the OECD, under the EU&rsquo;s structural reform support programme, is currently engaged in a project to improve the effectiveness of performance budgeting drawing on international best practice.  In its work, the OECD has met with a wide range of stakeholders including members of the committee. </p><p> A significant volume of information is published in the REV each year, with information at programme level on financial resources, outputs and public service activities and impact indicators.  Taking into account the ongoing work to enhance performance budgeting, this affords the opportunity to leverage the use of existing reports and processes to support the work of the Oireachtas in scrutinising Estimates.  While the REV deals with planned performance for the year ahead, the public service performance report outlines the key outputs that have been delivered each year.  This report was developed to facilitate meaningful and constructive dialogue on what is being delivered with public funds and is available for use by Oireachtas committees. </p><p> As noted earlier, the programme for Government contains a commitment on the development of a well-being framework for our country.  The development of this framework is aligned with the aforementioned reforms.  In developing this framework, I am mindful of the need for Government to consult with key stakeholders as such consultation should ensure buy-in to the framework and ensure its relevance to the work of those charged with designing, implementing and scrutinising public policy. </p><p> There are many reports and processes in existence that we can look to utilise as we work together to improve engagement between Government and the Oireachtas on the budgetary process and on scrutiny of performance.  Such an approach can support effective engagement, timely provision of information and the identification of those metrics of performance, equality and well-being that are most useful to parliamentary accountability.  It would also be important that there is a clear sense of the respective roles and responsibilities of the various committees as this clarity can support Departments in their engagement with the Oireachtas.  I look forward to a good discussion and to working with the committee on ways to enhance this area of work in the future. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairperson and the committee for the opportunity to discuss the current framework for parliamentary engagement in the budgetary process.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the committee's report and look forward to the discussion we will have.</p><p>At the outset we can all agree that there has been much progress in our broader approach to the national fiscal framework over recent years and I want to assure the committee that I and my Department will continue to play a constructive role going forward, both formally and informally.  To put this in context, it would be useful to briefly highlight the main reforms to our budgetary framework.<br/><br/>I have spoken on many occasions about the importance of our institutions.  Independent, analytically-robust and respected institutions perform an invaluable role in any democracy.  In this regard, perhaps the most important reform to the fiscal framework in recent years has been the establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.  The council provides a crucial input to the budgetary process, providing an independent assessment of my Department&rsquo;s economic and budgetary forecasts, the stance of fiscal policy and compliance with the fiscal rules.  In terms of the economic projections that underpin Government policy, a transparent, rigorous process precedes both the budget and the stability programme update forecasting rounds.  Additionally, the scrutiny of Government policy provided by the council is now firmly embedded within our budgetary architecture.  I know that this committee&rsquo;s deliberations with the council have provided a broader context for my engagement with this committee. <br/><br/>Another important reform initiated in recent years is the national economic dialogue.  This is now firmly part of the annual budgetary cycle although, unfortunately, it was interrupted this year.  The dialogue is normally preceded by the publication of the summer economic statement which sets out the main parameters of the budget.  I will say more about this later.  The dialogue provides an opportunity for all stakeholders to participate in an open and inclusive exchange on the competing economic and social priorities facing the Government. <br/><br/>Each summer my Department also oversees the circulation of the tax strategy group<i></i>papers to the relevant sectoral Oireachtas committees.  This group comprises representatives from various Government Departments, political advisers and politicians in government.  The papers that are published on our website are a stock take of existing tax measures and include issues for discussion and costed options for change.  Finally, the establishment of this committee itself is also an important reform to the budgetary infrastructure<b>.</b><br/><br/>Turning now to the committee&rsquo;s interim report, many of the issues raised have been covered by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and I will not repeat what he has already said.  As the committee will be aware, the programme for Government outlined the Government&rsquo;s objective of developing better measures of quality of life and well-being.  Connected to this is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to expand equality budgeting.  In this regard, I am engaging with my colleagues, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, on next steps in this area. <br/><br/>In terms of the further development of well-being measures, this will be guided by an expert group convened through the Department of the Taoiseach.  My officials have been engaging with their counterparts in the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform in order to further develop the technical aspects of this work.  My Department published a paper entitled Wellbeing and the Measurement of Broader Living Standards in Ireland alongside budget 2021.  The paper examined the development of international approaches to well-being and looked at options for national well-being measurement in Ireland.  The purpose of these measures will be to complement existing economic tools and measures and not to replace them.  It is hoped and anticipated that these new measures can serve over time as a useful reference for a range of policy and budgetary reform initiatives which are currently under way, including performance budgeting, equality budgeting, spending reviews and proofing of policy proposals against environmental and other goals.  On green budgeting, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has already incorporated green budgeting practices into its expenditure analysis in recent years<b>.</b><br/><br/>I will conclude on the summer economic statement as it concerns one of the recommendations in the interim report.</p><p>In a nutshell, the summer economic statement is a vehicle in which the available level of resources for the year ahead is communicated to the Oireachtas and to the general public, taking into account the need to ensure sound budgetary practice.</p><p> I am aware of the views of the committee on the fact that it was not possible to produce this document last year.  I wrote to the Chairman outlining the reasons for this.  I believe the SES is an important staging post in advance of the annual budget and I have been in front of the committee on many occasions to discuss it.  I will continue to accommodate the committee in terms of future attendance.  It is my expectation that the SES will be published over the summer.  We will have to engage in government on the format and role of the SES.  I look forward to engaging with the committee at the appropriate time.</p><p> Having said that, it is important as we look at the SES to highlight the voluminous amount of economic and fiscal analysis published by my Department over the course of any year.  For example, we recently launched the annual debt report some weeks ago to highlight the many issues, positive and negative, associated with the accumulation of public debt.</p><p> In conclusion, I believe it is fair to say that the budgetary processes have evolved significantly in recent years.  Notwithstanding the challenging times we are in, the Government shares the committee's view of ensuring we have an open, transparent and engaged budgetary process.  Sound, counter-cyclical budgetary policy is at the heart of a well-performing economy and a fit-for-purpose budgetary framework is a key part of this.  I remain committed to assisting the committee in its work and look forward to engaging with it.</p></speech>

I remind members that we have two Ministers before the committee today and they should bear that in mind when timing questions to get answers.  The first slot is for Sinn F&eacute;in with Deputy Pearse Doherty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#E00300"><p>My question is for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath.  On 8 October, only five days before the budget, I said:</p> <blockquote> 	It appears from what the Minister is saying that he is still going to pull the bunny out of the hat next Tuesday, despite everything he said for the past ten years.  It is not the way to do budgets.  I acknowledge that there are moving parts but he has a sense of the quantum at this stage.  That is usually published in the summer economic statement, which he and the Minister for Finance have decided not to publish this year. </blockquote> <p>At the time the Committee on Budgetary Oversight was trying to ascertain from the Minister the size of the budgetary package.  What we were able to elicit five days before the budget was that it was &euro;12 billion.  Five days later, the Minister produced a budget of nearly &euro;16 billion.  Can the Minister explain to me why this committee should judge what the Minister did at the time as in any way a serious effort to build on oversight and scrutiny or does he believe, as I do, that the engagement was making a mockery of the committee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#E00400"><p>My thanks to the Deputy for the question.  That was certainly not the intention of me, as Minister, in appearing before the committee, which, of course, I am happy to do at any point.  As both the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I acknowledged in our opening statements, this was a year like no other in the context of budget 2021.  We have acknowledged that, due to the circumstances of the year, it was not possible to publish a mid-year expenditure report.  That was and has been in recent years an important part of the overall process for the committee in preparing for the budget that will be unveiled the following October.</p> <p>  Also, we did not have the summer economic statement, as has been acknowledged.  The truth is that in preparing budget 2021 we were dealing with an extraordinary amount of volatility.  Final decisions on the budget were made following careful consideration over a period at a late stage.  As we know, we constructed the budget against certain key assumptions in terms of Brexit, the pandemic and the issue of a vaccination programme.  We decided on the need for a recovery fund of &euro;3.4 billion and a Covid-19 contingency fund of &euro;2 billion.</p><p>All of these issues were very much in play and remained under active consideration until the eve of the budget.  That is the truth because it was a year like no other.  We had many moving parts.  The value of the decisions we made are now bearing fruit, even with the decisions we made today in respect of a new business aid scheme, additional funding for the sustaining enterprises fund and so on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#F00200"><p>That is not the question, and my time is limited.  I will move on.  I am not talking about the summer economic statement.  I acknowledge there were moving parts.  Is this the way the Minister is going to continue in terms of increasing the budget, even with volatility?  The scope of the package of the budget that the Minister relayed to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight five days before the budget was increased by one third.  That is not on.  It is not the relationship we should have with the Executive.  The Minister knew or had a sense of where the parameters would be.  The Minister might not have known the final figure but decided to keep it from us.  It was okay because we learned about it in the Sunday newspapers, as I said to the Minister at the committee.  I said the Committee on Budgetary Oversight will gain more from reading the Sunday newspapers than from questioning the Minister five days before the budget.</p> <p>  I have a question for the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance said the expectation - or words to that effect - was that the summer economic statement would be published.  I hope the Minister will clarify that there will be a summer economic statement and there are no "buts".  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council criticised the Government and the Department for not doing that last year.</p> <p>  I will move on to the stability programme update and the spring statement.  Is it the intention that the statement will be published at the end of April?  Will there be medium-term projections?  In the budget documentation last year the Minister said it would contain medium-term projections to set a pathway towards moving the national finances back to a balanced position once the public health situation allows.  Can the Minister explain how far out we are going to look?  Is it a five-year projection?  Is that forthcoming in April?</p> <p>  Will the Minister respond to the issue of the fiscal rules and the Stability and Growth Pact?  Does the Minister share my view - more and more people across Europe are saying it - that the pact is now outdated?  I believe that, with the levels of indebtedness chasing the 60% targets, it is not appropriate at this point and we need to look at these rules all over again.</p> <p>  Does the Minister, especially in his role as president of the Eurogroup, support the extension of the general escape clause and the work of rewriting the fiscal architecture of the European Union?  The purpose is to replace what I would argue is an obsession with debts and deficits with targets such as full employment and public investment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#F00300"><p>There will be a summer economic statement, although I will have to consult within Government regarding the format of the SES.  Many of the difficulties we had in respect of economic uncertainty will be better than they were a year ago.  I still anticipate they will be present in a way that will be unlike many other years.  Anyway, there will be an SES, but I will have to agree the format with Government.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty asked about the timing of the stability programme update.  We will publish a stability programme update at the end of April.  It will contain a multi-annual projection with regard to budget performance and how we will look to move our national finances into a sustainable position.  The programme for Government has a long-term commitment to return our national finances back to a position of health.  Again, that will be outlined in the stability programme update.  I wish to emphasise that there will be considerable uncertainty around this.  It will be a different SPU format from what we have done before because there are still many variables and changes that could have a major impact on our economic performance.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty asked a question with regard to the fiscal rules and architecture.  I should make clear here that I am not speaking as president of the Eurogroup on this issue.  I am speaking as Minister for Finance of Ireland, because different rules apply.</p><p>I believe there is an opportunity to make the fiscal rules more simple.  When the fiscal rules are reapplied, that should be done when our economies are recovering and we are seeing employment and income growing again.  I believe there is an opportunity to make the fiscal rules less complex.  We need to look at how they can be the cause of and recognise investment within economies that it is capable of generating further growth.</p></speech>

On the recovery and resilience plan, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, will obviously acknowledge that the allocation in that regard is, in some cases, bigger than the allocation to singular Departments.  Does he agree that the proposals relating to accessing this &euro;853 million should come before the D&aacute;il for a resolution for support and should be scrutinised by the committee before they are submitted to the European Commission by 31 April?</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will note that part of this will have to include how we respond to the country-specific recommendations.   One of those is the fact that we have a system that allows for intangible assets that were onshored to be offset 100% against future profits.  How will he srespond to that?  Is it his intention to allow for the decrease in the standard rate of VAT to 21% to lapse at the end of March or is it his intention to extend it, given the environment whereby many businesses will not be able to avail of that due to restrictions?</p></speech>

First, I believe there should be engagement between the relevant Oireachtas committee and myself or the Minister, Deputy McGrath, or both, regarding the submission to the recovery and resilience fund, but I do not believe it should be the subject of a resolution from the D&aacute;il.  It is a matter for the Government to decide on what our application is going to be and we have to engage with the Commission on that.  I believe it is appropriate that we consult with the D&aacute;il and an Oireachtas committee on that matter, but I do not believe it appropriate that the process should be subject to a D&aacute;il resolution.</p> <p>  On the role of country-specific recommendations, the European Commission has made reference to its views relating to tax planning and the Irish planning.  When I am dealing with this matter in the context of the recovery and resilience facility or, indeed, any other engagement that I have with the European Commission, I will make reference to the roadmap on corporate tax reform that I published several weeks ago.  I will use that as the basis for engagement that I have with the Commission.</p> <p>  On the issue of the standard rate of VAT, it is my intention that it will go back up to its original rate at the end of the planned period, but it is also the case that the rate of VAT for the hospitality and services sector is due to continue until the end of this year.  When we made the original decision regarding the standard rate of VAT, there was a particular need to support retailers at a time of great difficulty.  We have now launched the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, which is providing additional support to that part of the economy.</p></speech>

In the aftermath of all the problems we have had, be they economic, health-related, Brexit or the pandemic, what is the most appropriate fiscal role and policy for us to follow in the years to come?</p><p>For instance, should we adopt something similar to the growth development policies and restrictions of the European Union or the eurozone or, alternatively, should we find a course in between, given that it is important that we do not run off on our own on a spending splurge or that we do not forget from where we came and all the difficulties we had extricating ourselves from that situation?  At the same time, are we recognising fully the problem that faces the general public?  After experiencing hard times for so long and being crushed for so long, do we need to give them some kind of encouragement or incentive in recognition of the efforts they have made and in view of the fact that we cannot recover all the expenditure in a year or two years but that, with the passage of time and growth, we will recover some of the ground?  That is a question for both Ministers.  They should divide responsibility and divide burdens.</p></speech>

It is open until 22 February and we would be delighted to hear from the committee as part of that process.  All Departments have been consulted regarding the preparation of that plan which is currently under way.</p> <p>  On the question asked by Deputy Durkan, we are certainly pursuing counter-cyclical policies at this point.  Over the course of 2021, our expenditure ceiling is almost &euro;88 billion.  That encompasses the money that has been allocated to the 45 Votes as well as the &euro;5.4 billion across the recovery fund and, of course, the Covid contingency fund.  We will require that money because the fact is that we are in level 5 restrictions.  We are dealing with a very strong third wave of this virus.  As such, the cost of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the CRSS, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the local authority rates waiver and so on is running at between &euro;1.2 billion and &euro;1.3 billion per month at this stage.  A certain amount of the provision necessary for that was provided for within the Votes allocated but, as the months go by and depending on the length and depth of the restrictions that need to be imposed, the resources we provided for are going to be required.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, given his international experience and overall responsibility in terms of macroeconomic policy, is well placed to comment on the overall budgetary strategy for the coming years.  One thing he and I share is the view that we should be unremarkable in European terms when considered next to our peers.  By that, we mean that we cannot be an outlier on the negative front because the extraordinary support of the European Central Bank, coupled with the strong position from which we went into this crisis, means that the current level of historically low interest rates will not continue indefinitely.  The markets will at some point take a view as to the overall sustainability of each country's public finances.  We are in a good position.  I believe we are managing this well.  We can afford to do what we are doing, but over the next period, and particularly in the stability programme update, we will need to map out a roadmap for the country in terms of the restoration of the public finances onto a sustainable path.</p></speech>

This week we are directly supporting the income of just over a million of our fellow citizens in terms of those who were on jobseeker&rsquo;s payments before this crisis and those who are now on the pandemic unemployment payment and in receipt of the employment wage subsidy scheme.  We have major levels of support in place in our economy.  As our public health conditions improve, we will need to begin the journey towards how we can put in place more appropriate budgetary policies that support our country in its recovery but move away from very high levels of support that are needed when many people are not in a position or not able to work. That is the approach we are taking in Ireland and it is paralleled by the approach being taken across the eurozone and the European Union.  For now the measures we have in place are needed.  They will be needed for a while yet and over time as our economy begins to open up again, I hope we will be able to get hundreds of thousands of people back into a good job putting in good work which, in turn, will not require the level of support we currently have in our economy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#J00300"><p>The Deputy has another two minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#J00400"><p>Two minutes still remaining - that could be a lifetime.  Will either Minister confirm if we are talking in terms of a revised Stability and Growth Pact for Europe and compliance with it or are we thinking about something different?  Given that we have not fully recovered yet from the economic crash and on top of that we have the effects and cost of Brexit and the effects and cost of the pandemic, we could find ourselves on a bad day feeling we had to recover all that ground in one short sharp phase.  To my mind, that could be difficult.  It could create further difficulties and a burden for the economy that would be counter to what the economy needs, which is growth.  Is it not a fact that growth is the essential part of what we have to rely on in the future, which will result in greater employment, investment and confidence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#J00500"><p>I will take that question.  If by referring to a short sharp movement the Deputy means a very rapid withdrawal of the measures we have in place and trying to move from having a deficit to being in balance in a very short period, that is not what we are envisaging.  It will take time for our economy and society to recover.  A withdrawal too quickly of the measures we have in place could be counterproductive.  What I and, I believe, the Minister, Deputy McGrath, are anticipating is that over time we would be able to rebuild our national finances as our public health allows us and as we are successful in getting more of our fellow citizens back to work.</p> <p>  In terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, there will be fiscal rules.  A debate will begin during this year on the future of fiscal rules, but it is worth noting the fiscal rules have the general escape clause that was triggered which allowed for the measures that are in place in 2021.  The fiscal rules are in some way showing their worth in that, when this pandemic hit Ireland and Europe generally, national finances for the vast majority of countries within Europe were in a position of having a very small deficit, being in balance or having a surplus.  That, in turn, combined with the work of the European Central Bank, has been vital in allowing us to do what we are doing at the moment.</p><p>Therefore, fiscal rules play a really important role.  They will be needed.  A debate on this issue will be developing soon, but the rules allow the flexibility currently being used in 2021.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has always been very generous with his time in coming before this committee and has made himself available more than most.  I welcome my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, to his first budgetary oversight scrutiny and extend very best wishes to him, on my behalf and I am sure on behalf of the committee, in the onerous task that confronts him.  I welcome some comments in both their scripts on developments and the evolution of processes that emerged from budgetary oversight in the previous term, including equality budgeting.  I acknowledge the movement that has been made on that.  I am also excited about the well-being initiative, which the Taoiseach announced today, with respect to budgeting, which I also acknowledge.</p> <p>  What views have both Ministers on the one positive aspect of Covid, namely, the pent-up savings that have occurred during the past 12 months and that will probably continue this year, in terms of budgetary processes and public expenditure and what would the European views be on that?  What are the pluses and minuses for the economy in that respect?  My party colleague, the Minister, Deputy McGrath, might reply first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#K00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for his kind comments.  I look forward to working with him and all his colleagues on this committee.  I  reiterate my officials and my Department generally are available on an ongoing basis to help this committee in the work it is doing.  There have been some really good reforms in recent times and we can build on them.  In respect of many of the recommendations in the committee's interim report, we can develop them on a partnership basis and I look forward to doing that.</p> <p>  The Deputy touched on a really important issue, namely, the extraordinary level of savings we have witnessed in recent times.  However, we should be careful and put it in context.  When we talk about these things in the aggregate, it is far removed from the reality very many families have faced since last March.  A point the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, regularly makes, and it is one that strikes home with me, is that of the order of 115,000 people currently on the pandemic unemployment payment have been on it since March 2020.  They will be rapidly approaching 12 months of being in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment continuously.  Many of those people are facing great hardship.  We need to be very conscious of that when we touch on what is an important issue in the round.</p> <p>  For other people, their incomes are largely unaffected and they have far fewer opportunities to spend money in the hospitality sector, on holidays and on all the things that people might normally like to do.  There is pent-up demand.  The amount of savings across the financial system offers us great hope that, once we can get beyond the necessary restrictions we are having to impose, many people will want to return to the things they always liked to do.  There will be much demand for goods and for services, but it comes down to sentiment and confidence.  For me, in any economy that is the critical intangible, and that is why we have always said that moving out of the health pandemic is inextricably linked to our economic recovery.  Until people have the confidence that we are not heading into deeper restrictions in the future, I do not think they will adjust their behaviours.  For us the key issue is to manage the health pandemic as well as we can to make sure we do not have to deal with a fourth wave and reintroduce further restrictions over the course of 2021.  That will then give people confidence, as they see a level of normality returning in line with the vaccination programme.</p><p>Much of that money can undoubtedly represent a stimulus for the Irish economy which is something we would welcome.  It is the job of Government to give people confidence and time to spend that money in the appropriate way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#L00200"><p>I will just make three points.  The Deputy is correct to call out the fairly significant increase in household savings.  I understand that the last set of figures that were produced by the Central Statistics Office indicated that the level of household savings in the economy for the quarter in which they measured it had increased by nearly one third.  Such a level of increase is a significant economic development.  I very much agree with what the Minister, Deputy McGrath, has said that many in our society are saving more.  Many others in our society are using their savings to live on and to support their businesses at a time of significant strain.  Those savings can mean very different things to different people.</p> <p>  As the Minister, Deputy McGrath, said, how that money is released into our economy is also tied into confidence regarding the sustainable opening of our economy in the future.  A key factor that will influence how savings are used is whether those who are saving more believe their income and their employment will it be stable over a longer period of time than it was in 2020.  </p> <p>  The consumption mix as those savings are used within our economy is of course critical in being able to understand what effect it will have on our economy.  For example, if that money is spent on exports other countries will benefit from the use of those savings.  That is not necessarily a bad thing because, of course, our exporters can benefit from the spending of savings in other economies and so the two things go hand in hand.  If that money was to be spent over time within our hospitality and services sector, within domestic tourism for example, the release of that level of savings into a part of our economy which is really hurting could have a particularly positive effect.</p></speech>

What is the Minister's thinking on that?</p> <p>  My final question will not get answered but the Minister, Deputy McGrath, might be able to come back to me.  It relates to how Covid has redefined what essential workers mean to an economy and has opened our eyes to the importance of those working in retail right through to nursing and health, etc.  What is Government thinking on that?  I will accept a written response on that, but I would like a reply on the Amazon piece.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#L00600"><p>I have heard the principle floated in the UK and in other countries, but I would like to see the details of how it would actually work.  Let me use Amazon as a good example.  I know the Deputy is a big reader and maybe he might be a customer of Kenny's or so many wonderful independent bookshops at the moment.  It is not clear to me how it would be possible to design a tax that would be fair and would apply only to a particular scale of an online retailer.  Our taxes at the moment, particularly VAT, do not differentiate based on the scale of the retailer.  Using the book example, I would like to see how anybody could come up with a tax that would apply to Amazon but would not apply to Kenny's, Tatalia Books or Books Upstairs.  Irish companies, including Irish retailers, need to increase their online retailing as well as being able to reopen physical retail stores.</p><p>While I have heard many float the idea of being able to charge online retailers specifically, I have yet to see how that could be done without disadvantaging small and medium-sized retailers that are using an online presence to grow their business.  I have questions on that approach, and I would not like to do anything that would damage the ability of small and medium-sized retailers to use an online presence to sell goods and services into Europe and throughout the world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.382" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#M00200"><p>I thank both Ministers for giving the committee their time and for their openness.  This is my first term as a member of this committee.  I am struggling somewhat to understand how we do this oversight.  The information is often produced in a language that suits the members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council but does not suit parliamentarians.  We need to produce more common-language reports so what we can have better understanding of what is going on.</p> <p>  I ask both Ministers to consider having engagement with our committee prior to the publication of the summer economic statement so that the committee is better placed to consider that because it is usually over the summer.  If we could have some engagement with the Ministers or their officials in May, it would help us in our work.</p> <p>  We talk about the well-being and the measurement of the broader living standards in Ireland.  However, the north and western section of the country has been downgraded in its status to a region in transition, which means that our output and our economic derivative have fallen.  How will that be tackled in budgets in coming years?  This does not come from me but from the EU, which has written to Ireland about this.  There is a significant difference and we should be positively discriminating towards the north and western region.  I ask the Ministers for their comments on that.</p> <p>  I often say that the biggest problem we have with budgets is looking at what the outcomes are.  We set the budget and we get reports, but we do not actually see how the budget works.  For instance, I have tried to elicit information from different Departments about how their capital projects are performing and if they are overrunning.  They are struggling to come up with the information.  It beggars belief that we are spending billions of euro on capital projects and we do not have readily to hand how each project performs, and if we have overruns why we have them and whether we should take corrective action.  There are many strategic issues we have not taken into account when we are spending billions of euro.  Nobody, apart from officials from the OPW, has come back to me how they are performing on their capital spend and whether their final accounts are exceeding their tenders.  It is a very simple process.  I ask the Ministers to comment on those matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#M00300"><p>I will take this to begin with.  I thank the Deputy for those observations and I agree with much of what he said.</p><p>What I will say, however, is that in recent months, in finding my feet in the Department, I have come to the realisation that there are a lot of very good reports written that do not get the attention they deserve.  I would point to the spending review papers, for example.  Since 2017 more than 100 spending reviews, including 25 last year, have been completed and published.  They look to the very point the Deputy raises.  We spend all this money in different areas and do we look back and see how it worked out?  Can we learn lessons?  Did we get the outcomes we were trying to achieve?  I urge this committee and the respective line committees to undertake work with the spending review papers because there is a wealth of information there.  Similarly, the public service performance report is published annually, normally in spring.  Again, there is a huge amount of information there which measures performance.  Ultimately, from my perspective as Minister with responsibility for public spending, it is important we measure outcomes because that should inform better decision-making going forward.  I would really welcome any feedback from the Deputy or the committee on the language, the terminology and the presentation format in the various reports we publish because we need to make them as understandable, meaningful and accessible as possible.</p><p> As for the north and the west, we are currently undertaking a review of the national development plan, NDP, as the Deputy will be aware.  That is out for public consultation until 19 February.  One of the objectives is to make sure that the aim of balanced regional development is progressed.  I encourage all stakeholders in the north and the west to engage in that process.  Over the course of the coming months we will finalise essentially the new NDP for the next decade, and there is a fantastic opportunity there to have the voice of the north and the west heard.  If Deputy Canney needs any information on any of the capital spending programmes and is not getting information he believes should be made available, I ask him to contact my Department and we will make sure that whatever information is at our disposal is made available to him.</p></speech>

I agree with the point the Deputy made about the language of how we communicate where we are on economic policy.  I was engaged in a one-man campaign in the previous D&aacute;il to banish the terms "gross fiscal space" and "net fiscal space" from any conversation in which I was involved, and the Deputy's words will encourage me to keep at it.  We need to challenge ourselves in the language we use to make it as clear as possible.</p> <p>  In truth, I think we can work with the committee to explain the principles behind the summer economic statement and its work before decisions are made and how it works, but I do not believe we can engage with the committee on the content of the summer economic statement before we in the Government agree it.  It is a decision by the Government on future budgetary priorities and has to be agreed within the Government before we can take that strategy to the Parliament and to our country.  Yes, there are definite opportunities for us to engage, to explain the process and to make it as clear as possible, but it is appropriate that we engage with the committee on the content of the statement only when it is agreed by the Government.  We have to put enough time into doing that inside the Government.  When that is done, that is the right point at which to engage with our Parliament on the content of the statement.</p></speech>

Finally, when we start to come out and come into recovery, how we will budget for remote working into the future and plan our development?  I do not like the use of the word "remote"; it is just off-site working.  I see that as an opportunity for the regions to grow their population and create a balance throughout the country.</p><p>Perhaps the Ministers would give their thoughts as to how, from a budgetary point of view, the Government might positively discriminate towards such a scenario in which we spread the population from the major centres of population out into the regions to support them.  We have proven we can work remotely.  The national broadband plan will deliver and reinforce that over the coming years.  However, how do we put in place the backup to make sure that people move to the regions and create populations and a critical mass within the regions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#O00200"><p>I will take that.  I thank the Deputy for the question.  There are undoubtedly opportunities for the regions in the post-Covid world that we are all really looking forward to.  Many of the changes that have occurred in the past nine or ten months have been forced upon us, and we would not be having this engagement in this format were it not for Covid-19.  The truth is that many people have now realised they do not necessarily need to be at their normal place of work five days a week.  If that enables more people to spend time in their local communities, that offers a lot of opportunity and potential.  I think the truth is that we will be looking at a hybrid.  I think it will take us a while to figure out the appropriate balance.  We also need to have strong cities.  That is important for our country as well.</p> <p>  We are working under the umbrella of an overall national planning framework, as the Deputy will be aware, which is to be reviewed in the coming years.  That is the overarching strategy for Project Ireland 2040, with the NDP sitting alongside the national planning framework.  Certainly, from the point of view of the work ongoing in my Department, I anticipate that the issue of remote working and the opportunities it presents for towns and villages across regional Ireland will feature strongly as part of the review of the NDP.  The Deputy will have already seen a number of different Departments invest public money in different initiatives to facilitate people working in their local communities: in remote working hubs, co-working spaces and so on.  There are a whole range of programmes in that regard.  I think we will see much more of that but it will be a hybrid.  I do not think that into the future the current position that pertains during the crisis will be the permanent situation.  It will move back to probably a more balanced combination, which I think would suit an awful lot of people and which presents opportunities for rural Ireland for sure.</p></speech>

We have been lucky enough over recent weeks, both before the interim report and afterwards, to talk to a number of parliamentarians and the counterparts of the Parliamentary Budget Office in various countries, and a number of issues have emerged which I would like to put to both Ministers.</p> <p>  The first is the issue of a hands-free budget.  This came out particularly from discussions with some counterparts in Austria.  One of the issues that has come to the fore for us is the timing of the mid-year expenditure report and whether it is too late to allow for a proper budgetary oversight review of that document before the budget process is in place.  Linked to this is the treatment of the Finance Bill.  I think we can all agree that the Finance Bill properly belongs in the finance committee, but there was a suggestion that we could support some of that work by looking over the course of a year at things such as tax expenditures in order that we might formulate some kind of position on a hands-free budget.  I put that to both Ministers.  It is the idea of producing a more detailed overview of what a hands-free budget would look like every year.</p></speech>

Clearly, the sooner we can have material shared with the committee the better, but we do face challenges in doing that from a departmental point of view.</p><p>A concrete example would be the stability programme update, SPU.  We would struggle to do an SPU any earlier than we do at the moment because even when we do that update, we only have a single quarter of tax revenue available to analyse.  Our ability to form a projection regarding our economic performance for a year any earlier than April is limited.  If we were trying to produce forecasts for this committee in quarter 1 about the economic outlook for the year, we would only have a month of two worth of data available to us and we would run the risk of sharing forecasts with the committee that would be plain wrong and that could cause difficulty later in the year.</p><p> The option for a no policy change budget is, in effect, made available when the White Paper on expenditure and receipts is published but that does not happen, typically, until the Friday night before the budget.  Perhaps in the coming year we could look at the possibility of providing the committee with some kind of a starting position for the budget before any new policy decisions are made.  A considerable amount of information is made available about the budgetary process.  The wealth of information contained in, for example, the tax strategy group papers gives a sizeable amount of advice and perspective to the committee.  If the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform manages to repeat the expenditure review process that has happened in other years, a huge volume of data regarding how we spend money within our country is available.  There may be opportunities to bring it forward to a little bit earlier in the year but I am not sure that we can do that in the way the Deputy is suggesting without undermining the accuracy of what we are doing.</p></speech>

We would like to see the select committees then considering the Estimates as early as possible in the year.  I remember when I was first elected, we dealt with Estimates months into the year to which they related and I questioned the relevance of it.  Committees only consider the Estimates and do not vote on them because that is a matter for the D&aacute;il as a collective but I think it is important for committees to consider Estimates as early as possible in the calendar year.  That is important.</p> <p>  We then have the SPU in April and the summer economic statement, which is normally around June.  The mid-year expenditure report gives an update on the Department's estimate of where expenditure stands and is likely to go at the midpoint of the year, as well as taking into account the multi-annual ceilings.  We will publish a mid-year expenditure report this year in the normal way because, as I acknowledged earlier, that did not happen during the pandemic in 2020.  A considerable amount of information is available but if the committee has any specific suggestions as to how we could bring things forward, we will certainly consider them and my Department will help in any way it can to provide information to the members of the committee.</p></speech>

We have seen examples of effective communication of financial information with the public in other countries, which we hope will be in our report.</p> <p>  He touched on the issue of Estimates and I would like to go back to it.  We in the committee have talked a lot around the treatment by sectoral committees of budgets in general, Estimates and Supplementary Estimates.  One issue that arisen is the fact that we are somewhat an outlier compared to other EU countries.  We do not approve or take a view on Estimates or Supplementary Estimates and get them quite late in the budgetary cycle.  The Oireachtas does not approve the SPU, for example, and unlike almost every other European country, there is no facility for the Opposition to amend the budget.  Is there any particular reason for that?  We know from the parliament in Westminster that part of that is historic, in its view.  We had a particularly interesting conversation with representatives of the Scottish Parliament which, because it was set up more recently, has more effective mechanisms for this kind of oversight.</p><p>I would like to hear the general approach of both Ministers to the lack of opportunity for the Oireachtas to approve things such as the stability programme update, sectoral committees' inability to take a position on Estimates, and the inability to amend the budget.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#Q00200"><p>If I could come in there, I believe that the balance of decision-making between the Oireachtas and the Government is broadly correct.  Putting together a budget, with all the decisions relating to it, is at the core of the ability of a Government to do its work, meet its commitments in the programme for Government and to have the ability to initiate and complete an annual budgetary process.  There are always opportunities for us to engage with and better explain our work to the Oireachtas and hear the views of others.  I have been present at many such debates over the years and have always listened to what the members of the committee have said and tried to respond to them.  There are core issues that are fundamental to the Government regarding its being charged with producing a budget and then, because we have a history of majority governance in our country, although that changed during the previous D&aacute;il, the Finance Bill and Estimates have been the preserve of the Government.  It is not a balance I would be recommending we change at the moment.  I am sure if there was a majority Green Party government, the Chairperson would be eager to ensure that its budget reflected the majority Green Party within that government.  It is a balance that I think is appropriate, but there are always opportunities to look at how we can share information more effectively and hear the views of others.  I will try to do that in this D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

The legal basis and authority for the expenditure of public money ultimately comes from a vote of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I know the committee in its interim report touched on the possibility of the committee playing an enhanced role when it comes to Supplementary Estimates.  As committee members know, Supplementary Estimates go to the line committee in the same way as normal Estimates. They are scrutinised before they come back into the D&aacute;il.  Some thought needs to be given as to the exact demarcation of the responsibilities and roles of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which would perhaps focus on the overall framework.  We should then ask whether we can enhance the work of the sectoral committees when it comes to considering the annual Estimates and Supplementary Estimates which are considered in committee and then come into the D&aacute;il for an actual vote.  That is the current legal framework.  A vote of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann gives us the authority for spending public money.</p></speech>

The basic point of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight is to ensure the sustainability of the public finances, to oversee the moneys that are allocated, what we get for those moneys as they are allocated in different areas, and whether they are achieving their ends.  I want to put to the Minister something obvious to which he has alluded, that is, all bets are off during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many of the normal signposts or markers for the budgetary cycle have been put off.  The summer economic statement was not produced.  An extra &euro;6 billion had to appear days before the budget.</p><p>All of this is happening because of a pandemic, a virus that does not give a hoot about the budgetary cycle, fiscal rules, summer economic statements, projections or anything else.  It seems to me that we are flying blind until we get this virus under control and that all of the chatter about sustainable public finances is borderline meaningless until we get it under control.  I would like the Minister to respond to that point.  In comparison with other countries that have the virus under control, where most of the time most people are living normal lives and they can plan, such as New Zealand, Australia, Vietnam, Taiwan and much of China, we are not doing as well.  We have no idea what is coming down the line.  This week, we had Ministers making statements about arbitrary dates for the reopening of sectors of the economy which seem to bear no relationship to the level of Covid infection.  At the current level of 800, it is four times higher than it was when the Government made the decision to reopen sectors of the economy prior to Christmas, with disastrous effect not only in terms of infection but economically, the full ramifications of which we still do not know.  I put it to both Ministers that if this happens again, maybe two or three times this year, our ability to manage the public finances and be sustainable in our approach to them will be somewhat difficult.  </p><p> The budget deficit was &euro;20 billion extra last year and is projected to be &euro;20 billion extra this year.  The debt increased by 10% last year.  I ask the Minister to confirm if that &euro;219 billion will rise by another 10% if his plans come to pass this year.  Would the Minister agree that in the interest of sustainable management of the public finances, we need to get control of the virus.  Will he acknowledge that trying to live alongside a virus that does not want to negotiate with us is not a very good idea and that we need to get control of it by adopting a different strategy?  I am serious in saying that because this has a bearing on everything we and the Minister have to deal with for the next year.  I ask the Minister to respond to that point as well.  It seems to me the current plan is not working and it is costly us a great deal at every level.</p></speech>

Most of the figures he referenced in regard to the debt forecast are correct.  By the end of last year, our debt stood at &euro;219 billion, which is an increase of approximately &euro;15 billion versus what we estimated it would be.  Taking the two year period of last year and this year together, there will be an increase in our national debt of &euro;33 billion.  We are seeing a very considerable increase in our national debt, albeit an increase in the stock of our debt that is in line with what we are seeing happening in other countries.  This is additional debt which we have been able to refinance at a next to zero interest rates due to the manner in which we have managed our public finances and the work of the European Central Bank.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked if we need to take a different approach to Covid.  We have to be open to all debates and points of view in regard to what we are doing and not dismiss each other's point of view out of hand, which Deputy Boyd Barrett rarely does on important issues and I do not propose to do so now.  I will offer three points that matter to me in relation to the points the Deputy made.</p><p>First, the Deputy spoke about the need to reduce radically the presence of the disease within our country and its transmission.  That is what we are trying to do.  As a country, we have taken the most extraordinary measures over the past year to do that.  Second, the Deputy seemed to suggest we should go beyond that and have a target of zero Covid.  As I understand it, zero Covid is defined by some people as zero community transmission for 14 days consecutively.  When community transmission was at its lowest level, we did not get to that point.  Third, if we were to set that objective, it would require public health measures that would stretch beyond what we are proposing to do in regard to travel and borders within our country because the origin of much of this disease is community transmission as opposed to travel.  It would require very significant and sustained measures in terms of the contact we have with each other, our society and how we organise movement within our country that would stretch beyond how we manage travel.</p><p> I would like to make a further point genuinely to the Deputy who I know is raising this point genuinely.  I have heard him speak eloquently about the personal and social consequences of demanding public health measures.  It is at least implicit, if not likely, in the approach he is suggesting that those public health measures would be of greater severity for longer periods.  That is a factor in evaluating the case the Deputy puts forward.  As demanding as the management of mobility in and out of the country is - the Deputy will know that travel accounts for less than 0.5% of recorded Covid cases over the past number of weeks - far more would be required to deliver zero Covid.  If that is what the Deputy is looking for, even stronger measures will be required in regard to travel.  It is important to outline what those measures are and what effects they would have on our society and the well-being of many people about whom I know the Deputy is concerned, which is why he raised this issue.</p></speech>

We know that the Government is planning to ratify CETA.  As the Ministers are aware, it provides for the investor court system, which is a legal mechanism that will allow large corporations to sue the State for massive sums of money.  This has the potential to have a significant impact on the budgetary position both directly in terms of a reduction in available spend because of legal costs incurred and indirectly in terms of tax foregone because the presence of the investor court system may act as a deterrent to Governments using the tax system to modify corporate behaviour.  My question is for both Ministers.  What risk analyses have been done by the Department of Finance with regard to the corporate tax base and by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to the impact legal payouts would have on public expenditure?</p></speech>

We have outlined many other issues that could impact on corporate tax revenue and on the performance of different tax heads but we do not assign a risk to the future of CETA in terms of the impact that it could have on our tax flows.  It is not recorded as a risk in our tax revenue forecasting models.</p></speech>

I would point to the overall context within which our economy operates and our experience over the last ten or 11 months of living with Covid-19.  The reality is that the role of FDI in Ireland and our position as an open, trading economy has, in many ways, helped us to absorb some of the enormous shock of Covid-19.  This is clear from the number of jobs that have been sustained, the corporation tax paid and the income tax receipts underpinned by employment in the FDI sector.  Ireland's place in the world is as a small, open trading economy with a very strong enterprise sector.  That is why the Cabinet today approved an additional &euro;90 million for Enterprise Ireland for the sustaining enterprises fund.  Many of the businesses that will avail of funding from a scheme like the sustaining enterprises fund will be seeking export opportunities to countries like Canada.  In that regard, from the perspective of the Irish Government, the opportunities of CETA far outweigh the risks.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is something that should be considered.  The Minister mentioned performance budgeting in his opening statement and referred to the need to manage public sector pay.  The Public Service Stability Agreement, PSSA, rules on lateral movements within the public service stipulate that lateral redeployments within the civil and public service should not attract additional salary increases.  If, for example, a nurse moves from Beaumont Hospital to St. Vincent's Hospital while remaining at the same grade, there is no automatic salary increase.  We are all aware of the anger and frustration surrounding the proposed increase of &euro;81,000 for the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  If it turns out that a Secretary General undertakes a lateral move to the Department of Health on a permanent basis, I ask the Minister to assure us that such a move will adhere to the PSSA rules on redeployment and will not attract an unnecessary and exorbitant salary increase.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, which the Minister discussed with my colleague, Deputy Doherty, earlier.  Will the Minister be including businesses such as taxi-drivers, manufacturers under licence and those without fixed premises in that scheme?</p></speech>

He has launched a fund today that is designed to support businesses that have premises but those premises are not public facing.  For example, it could be a premises of a business that does not have customers but has been very badly affected by Covid.  That should help some of the businesses to which the Deputy has referred.  Very broadly, the supports we now have in place are supporting 1 million people in our country today.  They all need and deserve this help and we are doing all that we can to keep this help in place.  I do accept, despite the variety of schemes that we have, that not every business can avail of them in the way they would want but I hope the initiatives announced today will offer further help.</p></speech>

I asked that the Minister would prioritise reaching a solution for these very deserving people.  These are people who keep initiatives like meals on wheels and Tidy Towns alive, and in the midst of a pandemic their work is even more valuable.  Is there any solution on offer for these people?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, responsibility for policy for community employment schemes sits with the Department of Social Protection but we are working on this issue on a joint basis.  We are continuing the work that my predecessor as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his colleagues did in the previous Government.  We are trying to find a way through this that respects the Labour Court decision of 2008 but avoids much wider ramifications across the system.  I am hopeful that we will make progress.  There is an outstanding issue here that must be addressed.  The Minister for Social Protection and I are working very closely together on it and I am hopeful that we can bring it to a conclusion very shortly</p></speech>

Reference was made earlier to the fact that in the 2021 Estimates, there is a reduction in current spending on housing and that while there is a small increase in capital spending, it is not a corresponding increase.  What is meant by that phrase?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#U00900"><p>I do not have all of the figures in front of me but there certainly was no reduction in current spending for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for 2021.  As the Deputy has acknowledged, there was an increase on the capital side of in excess of &euro;500 million.  The overall Vote and allocation for the Department increased very significantly, including on the current side.  We have provided a lot of extra money for the housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies and additional funding for homelessness services.  I can arrange for all of the details to be provided but it is certainly not the case that there was a reduction in current funding on the housing side.  In fact, it went up quite significantly.</p></speech>

Finally, I am concerned about the Estimates for spending on justice.  We have seen a 1.2% increase in current spending for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but on the capital side there has been a 10% reduction.  There has also been a 24% decrease in spending on the Courts Service and a 21% decrease in spending on the Prison Service.  We should be investing more to reduce crime.  I understand that some of the reductions in capital spending are due to Covid restrictions.  There have been hold-ups at the planning, procurement and construction stages of capital projects.</p><p>What efforts will be made to catch up on projects that were delayed because of last year's underspend?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.443" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021020900002#V00200"><p>That is a really important issue.  We have a record overall budget for capital expenditure for 2021.  If one includes the carry forward from last year, it is approaching &euro;11 billion.  Of course, the reason we have that carry forward is because of the underspend in 2020, which can, in part, be attributed to the restrictions imposed earlier in 2020.  We had an overall underspend on the capital side of more than &euro;900 million, of which over &euro;700 million was carried forward to 2021.  We are in 2021 and, again, a large part of the construction sector is shut down so inevitably that will have an impact on the delivery of projects, the timeline and the spending of that money.  I have asked my officials to monitor that very closely and, as the year progresses, to provide options to me, as Minister, on what we can do to make sure that as much as possible of our public capital investment programme is delivered.  The definition of capital expenditure includes areas of expenditure that one might regard as not traditionally capital such as digital or research and development.  A certain amount of grants that can be provided constitute capital spending as well so the Deputy will be aware of all of the money we provided for the restart grants for businesses in 2020, which was in the region of &euro;700 million, and the funding we provided to our schools with regard to minor works grants and the ICT grants.  That all counts as capital expenditure so if the major building projects get delayed, we will see what other ways there are of supporting the sectors that will be impacted negatively by that.  The Deputy raised a very fair point and one that I-----</p></speech>

We heard from one of our counterparts in Canada that it had introduced performance metrics and that they had not really been the transformative measure they had hoped they would be.  Obviously, I am a great proponent of well-being indicators.  Do the Ministers have any thoughts on how they see well-being indicators or budgets being implemented so that they are effective and not just a reporting mechanism?</p></speech>

If I was to look at how we could do better than that, I think we should pick a very particular area of Government expenditure that could have a larger effect on well-being and make some choices, for example, about spending more there or gaining more integrated Government decisions in that area.  Over time, we will see change and if we were to look for some change more quickly, it could be to our benefit to pick a very specific area and make more bigger choices about that area.</p></speech>

I have always made the point that narrow or traditional economic indicators only tell us so much.  The memorandum that was brought to Cabinet today by the Taoiseach is really important in that respect.  It sets out the approach that will be taken in developing a well-being framework building on the extensive work undertaken in the area, including the recent report prepared by the Department of Finance and the OECD framework for measuring well-being and progress.</p><p>A lot of work has been done internationally in this space.  In terms of where we go from here, step one will involve defining what exactly we mean by the concept and taking the 11 dimensions of the OECD framework as a starting point.  Designing the dashboard will involve deciding which indicators to include under each of the agreed domains.  The CSO has indicated a willingness to assist in hosting and updating the dashboard on an ongoing basis.  The work will lead to the production of an initial output by the summer of 2021.  It is proposed that the National Economic and Social Council will provide a vehicle for consultation with stakeholders.  I know the committee has expressed an interest in this issue so I hope it will participate and share its perspectives and expertise.</p></speech>

We know a number of schemes are in operation.  Some of them have been tapped out.  Ulster Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland seem to have used all of the resources related to providing the recovery funds.  I am interested to see if there is a view on extending that or increasing the amount of allocation, given that the credit guarantee scheme does not have the same type of appeal to businesses and is not as sought after as the other scheme.</p> <p>  In the context of that recommendation, the Minister will be well aware that there is ongoing discussion and increased activity regarding the future of Ulster Bank in this State.  This is potentially a huge blow to consumers, the financial sector here and small and medium enterprises, in respect of which a quarter of lending is done through this institution.  The Governor of the Central Bank has said that a decision to withdraw is likely to push up interest rates, which would be a problem in a jurisdiction which already has the highest interest rates in Europe at double the European average.  At my request, the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has asked that the Minister for Finance formally engage in this process.  I expect that there will be an announcement, probably next week at the latest, in respect of this issue.  There are a number of State-owned banks or banks where the State has a majority shareholding.  The worst option in all of this would be that the loan book would be sold to a vulture fund.  The best option is for Ulster Bank to confirm that it is here to stay and that its footprint, staff and presence in the Irish market is here.  Some of this is outside our control but I would seriously encourage and ask the Minister to explain to the committee whether he has stepped up his engagement not just as Minister for Finance but as the person who holds the shares in AIB and Permanent TSB on behalf of the Irish people in respect of the very clear discussions that are ongoing and that have in my view have moved beyond the exploratory to actionable.</p></speech>

We are reviewing the operation of the different schemes.  The Deputy's analysis of them is pretty fair.  Some of them have been successful in releasing credit to particular kinds of companies while with other schemes, in particular the credit guarantee scheme, we have not seen the drawdown of a large amount of much of that facility yet.  I am looking at the schemes and their future because how we provide liquidity and credit at this time of strain for so many smaller companies in particular is an important priority of mine.</p> <p>  I wish to confirm that there has been no public statement about the withdrawal of Ulster Bank from the Irish banking sector.</p><p>The statements that are made about Ulster Bank continue to state that it is engaged in a review of its presence here and of its future.  On what I have done about this, I have engaged directly with NatWest.  I have spoken to the chairperson of NatWest and I have reiterated to him what I have said in the D&aacute;il, which is that I am concerned about the commentary and speculation, what it will mean for our economy and what it would clearly mean for those who depend on Ulster Bank for employment, credit or investment.  I have conveyed that directly to NatWest.  I have also raised the issue in engagement I have had with the British Government, by means of a phone call I had with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  I have, therefore, raised this on a number of different levels.  It is not an issue, as the Deputy knows and has acknowledged, that I play a formal role in at all.  This is a commercial decision being made by a larger parent company in which we clearly do not have a share and which is making broader decisions regarding its future.</p><p> On other banks here-----</p></speech>

There has been a serious slowdown in the number of inspections being carried out.  I have figures stating that almost 13,000 households which qualify for the scheme and have applied for it have not had an inspection carried out.  Some of this is due to the Covid restrictions but some of this happened in 2020.  I am wondering if the allocations made within last year's budget are being carried forward on top of the money that has been announced for 2021.  How is that being accounted for in the budget?</p></speech>

We also increased the SEAI's operational budget so it has the capacity for a major retrofitting programme which the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is very anxious to deliver, as are all of us in the Government.  Any underspends on the capital side can be carried forward subject to a limit.  In overall terms, the underspend was over &euro;900 million across all the Departments and about &euro;710 million to &euro;720 million of that was carried forward into 2021.  I do not have the precise figures for that Department with me but we can get them for the Deputy.  However, based on that overall picture I envisage any overspend on the capital side was largely or substantially carried forward.  I will get that detail for the Deputy.  There is no such provision on the current spending side but I expect those grants constitute capital spending.</p></speech>

The scheme is failing on the basis that it is being run centrally by the SEAI.  I suggest that the rolling-out of the scheme by local authorities be looked at.  They could do it in conjunction with the disabled access grants and the housing aid for older people.  The local authorities have the network to carry out the inspections and to allow the work to go ahead.  It seems the SEAI has created another layer of approvals and whatever else and is excluding many local contractors from doing the work.  We are talking about value for money, but I think we would get a hell of a lot more value out of it if we put the additional resources into the local authorities and asked them to run the scheme.  We would deliver quickly to where it is needed to help people in fuel poverty.  It is something that might be considered in the context of how the whole scheme has performed since its introduction.  It has failed many people and there are many people waiting from 18 months to two years to have an inspection, which is totally unacceptable.</p></speech>

Deputy Canney is right that some people have been waiting for between 12 and 18 months to get this work done.  That is why we have provided the extra money and capacity to the SEAI.  I do not believe the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, plans to transfer responsibility for those schemes back to the local authorities.  That is an issue the Deputy should probably raised with the Minister himself.  I will get back him on the other issues.</p></speech>

The State previously declared a climate emergency and we know there is a huge job of work to be done in relation to that.  It is clear that semi-State companies will be key to investing in a just, green transition.  Would the Ministers support amending the state aid rules for semi-State companies when it comes to investing in a green just transition?</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that the borrowing limit for the ESB has increased significantly to enable it to fulfil the huge ambitions it has <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the sustainability agenda.  We are, therefore, supporting the work they are doing.</p><p>The Minister for Finance may wish to come in on state aid.</p></speech>

Those concerns are really important and I take them very seriously.  Ulster Bank is a very important part of the Irish banking sector and its sudden withdrawal and the consequences of same for our economy, for employment and for credit are very serious.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1548" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021020900002#C00100"><p>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and his officials to the meeting today.  Following events surrounding the Northern Ireland protocol, the committee welcomes the opportunity to engage and ask questions about the sequence of events that ultimately led to the European Commission triggering Article 16 before it made a U-turn on that decision.</p> <p>  As members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, we feel we have a twofold responsibility in this regard: first, to ask questions at a Government level as to what happened and how it happened and, second, we must have accountability at a Commission level.  We want to ensure what happened does not happen again and that we can have public trust and confidence in the protocol's procedure in the future.  We look forward to the engagement today.  The Minister of State will get a feeling and a sense from the members as to where they are on this issue.  Last week, however, there was a certain anxiety and obvious desire to deal with this issue.  We appreciate the Minister of State being with us today.</p> <p>  Before we begin, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask that all members confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contribution to the meeting.  For anyone watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only the Chairman and the necessary staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask that everyone bear with us should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  I now call the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm aon eolas at&aacute; agam a scaipeadh.</p> <p>  This is my first appearance before the committee since the trade and co-operation agreement was reached between the EU and the UK.  I will first speak briefly speak on that before I talk about the issue of the protocol, which is obviously of huge concern not only to the committee but to Government as well.</p> <p>  The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is the framework for the relationship between the European Union and the UK into the future and complements the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Northern Ireland.  Like any international agreement, it is the product of compromise and give and take.  Neither the European Union nor the UK has got everything it would have wanted but there is much to recommend it.</p> <p>  The agreement provides for zero tariff, zero quota trade in goods of EU or UK origin.  This is a major priority of the Government and is vital for sectors such as our agrifood industry in particular which would have been devastated by tariffs.  It provides robust safeguards to ensure there is a level playing field between EU and UK businesses to protect Irish businesses and our future prosperity.  It provides for close co-operation with the UK in the energy and transportation sectors, which are essential to making our economy work.  It allows for close co-operation between the police and judicial authorities in Ireland, which is essential to effective policing on the island of Ireland.  I pay tribute to Mr. Michel Barnier and his team in the European Commission for their tireless work in securing the agreement.</p> <p>  Separately, and as the committee will be well aware, the Northern Ireland protocol came into effect on 1 January 2021.  It plays a vital role in protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including a key priority of the Government to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, as well as protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  It ensures that Northern Ireland traders continue to have access not only to Great Britain but also to the EU Single Market of 450 million consumers, access that is unique and vital for all-island supply chains.</p> <p>  For Northern Ireland, and indeed for businesses across the island, adapting to the changes is undoubtedly a challenge.  It is important, however, not to lose sight of the overall purpose of the protocol, what it is for and the role it plays in providing as much certainty as possible under the difficult circumstances caused by the UK leaving the European Union.  After four years of painstaking negotiations, it is clear there are no easy alternatives to the protocol.  It is clear that the European Union and the United Kingdom will have to continue to work closely together, particularly in the first weeks of the protocol&rsquo;s operation, as traders adjust to the new rules in place.  Every effort will need be made within the framework of the protocol to iron out any challenges that emerge.</p><p> It is very unfortunate that the protocol got caught up in the issue of the European Union vaccine procurement last week.  It is entirely regrettable that the Commission did not consult us in advance of the ostensible decision it contemplated with regard to invoking the protocol's safeguard clause.  The decision was, rightfully, rescinded shortly after the Taoiseach spoke to President von der Leyen on the Friday evening in question.</p><p> The European Union has a legitimate aim, on behalf of all of us, of protecting vaccine supplies.  Ireland will continue to work closely with the Commission on this issue.  However, that is entirely separate, and should be entirely separate, from the operation of the protocol.  We will be working with the Commission to review this matter and to continue to ensure that the protocol and its political context are properly understood.  All sides must now redouble their efforts to make the protocol work for Northern Ireland and all its people and businesses.  It is important to take a calm and measured approach based on trust and pragmatism to any issues that arise in regard to its implementation.  </p><p> I welcome that a call took place last Wednesday between the Vice-President of the European Commission, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Mr. &Scaron;efovi's opposite number in the UK, and the First Minister, Arlene Foster, and deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, of Northern Ireland.  In a joint afterwards, the EU and the UK described the discussion as a constructive one and stated they had agreed to work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues.  This approach is best managed through the established mechanisms and communication channels to address practical issues around the operation of the protocol, including the specialised committee on the protocol and the withdrawal agreement joint committee.  Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and Chancellor Gove agreed to meet again this week in London and to keep in close contact as this work progresses.  EU-UK channels must remain the primary recourse for addressing any issues that arise in the interests of stability, clarity and sustainability.  Unilateral approaches to working through issues are unhelpful, no matter what the source.</p><p> The committee will also be aware that certain staff working at border control posts at the ports of Larne and Belfast were advised not to present for work on 2 February owing to concerns arising from intimidation and threats.  I condemn the intimidation of port staff and the menacing threats that have appeared as graffiti in Northern Ireland.  I welcome that the PSNI is actively engaged and taking appropriate measures.  I also welcome the confirmation that Larne council staff have returned to their duties.  All staff should be able to carry out their work safely and political leaders should make every effort to reduce tensions.</p><p> The Government is closely engaged with its counterparts in the Northern Ireland Executive.  We are also listening carefully to business representatives on this and other issues.  We have been consistent in our position that we want the protocol to work as smoothly as possible for the people of Northern Ireland and people and businesses across the island of Ireland.  Trade volumes between Ireland and Great Britain remain low but they are gradually increasing.  We had 61 inbound movements on 1 and 2 January.  The figure reached its peak so far this year with 1,344 movements on 3 and 4 February.  </p><p> The Government understands that new controls have created challenges for many traders.  We will continue to help traders and hauliers to make the adjustment.  The changes are not temporary.  It is important that we all work together to adapt to the new trading environment.  A range of advisory, upskilling and support services remains available.  Over &euro;9.4 million has been allocated under our ready-for-customs grant that provides funding of up to &euro;9,000 per eligible employee.  It is also very important that, in line with its border operating model, the UK will introduce new checks and controls on imports from the EU in April and June.  We are working with our exporters to help them prepare for these changes.</p><p> No new controls apply on direct continental routes, which are proving very popular.  Freight volumes on these services are up 100% on last year.  We now have daily direct services to France, which was a key ask of the haulage sector.  In January there were 62 roll-on roll-off freight sailings in a typical week, which is up from about 26 such sailings last year.  We have 36 sailings to northern France per week as well as sailings to Spain, Portugal, Belgium and the Netherlands.</p><p> Brexit means change in the short, medium and long term.  Ireland will need to respond to the challenges and opportunities that this brings by playing a leadership role in shaping and developing our common European Union.  The relationship between Ireland and Britain is always close and special but our home is at the heart of the European Union.  I am very happy to take questions.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it as a chuid oibre go dt&iacute; seo.  I have a couple of questions for the Minister of State and a couple of thoughts.  He is right to acknowledge the huge work that has gone into getting us to the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  It was a massive achievement in very difficult circumstances.  The support we as a country have got from the European Commission since the Brexit referendum in 2016 has been immense; it has effectively been hand in glove.  The Minister of State is also right to separate the protocol from the triggering of Article 16.  I will discuss the protocol later.  The support and co-operation from the Commission makes what happened with the triggering of Article 16 on 29 January even more unbelievable and harder to get our heads around.  The triggering apparently happened without our knowledge.  Apparently it happened without the knowledge of the Irish nominee to the Commission.  Given that the European Commission has shown a massive understanding of the sensitives of relationships and of the protocol and the background to it, has the Minister of State learned anything in the intervening period about why it was triggered, who ordered its triggering and why the European Commission saw fit to trigger it without consulting the Irish Government in advance?</p><p>The Minister of State referred to the meeting with the Commission and the British Government last week.  The meetings were positive.  I understand that there is to be a meeting today between European Commission officials and Irish representatives and that proposals to manage this issue going forward are to be tabled.  When it comes to our neutrality we have a triple lock.  We need some kind of a lock mechanism such that in future Article 16 can never be triggered without the agreement of the Government or without consultation with it.  The Minister of State is closer to this than we are and he has seen at close hand the damage done by the triggering, including the damage done to trust.  It is being reported on RT&Eacute; today that we will get some sort of vague comfort blanket assurances that this will not happen again, that there will be consultation with the Government around legislation and that if there is a problem, it will be put through Commissioner McGuinness's <i>cabinet.  </i>Instead, we should have something substantial, an actual formal process that would involve the Government in a formal way rather an <i>ad hoc</i>one.  I genuinely think the damage done by this triggering has been so immense that we now need a process to ensure it does not happen again.</p><p>On the protocol, I absolutely condemn the violence and threats being issued to people doing their jobs in the last few weeks.  It brings us back to a much darker time.  On the general matter of EU-Britain trade, we are currently running at volumes that are around 50% of what they were this time last year.  Revenue has declared 1.8 million custom declarations in January alone, which is more than the total for 2020.  Who in the Government is co-ordinating the response so that we will be ready when trade returns to full volumes?  Can the Minister of State say we will not have any major difficulties or delays with goods going to Britain and coming in from there when trade is hopefully restored to full volumes?  The lower volumes at the moment are presumably due to Brexit stockpiling before December and to the pandemic.  Who in the Government is going to co-ordinate this to ensure there is no disruption to supplies either between here and Britain or the reverse in terms of the food industry, etc.?</p></speech>

If it is agreeable to the Minister of State, to do justice to the range of questions the members have, I will take them on an individual basis.  I therefore ask for his indulgence in relation to replying specifically to the questions.  That will potentially allow for members to come in a second time as well.  The Minister of State may now reply and Deputy Howlin will follow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.485" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021020900002#E00400"><p>That is probably a better approach.  Deputy Calleary has asked some very important and fundamental questions on various aspects of this.</p><p> On the question of Article 16 being triggered, while we might not be as shocked now two weeks on, the reaction Deputy Calleary shows today is similar to the Government's reaction on the day, namely, one of complete shock and surprise.  It is absolutely the case that we had no knowledge of what was being planned.  We had spent the previous weeks being asked about Article 16 from another perspective, and quite rightly pointed out that this was a pretty standard safeguarding clause in trade agreements and was not designed to eliminate the protocol or be used except in the most extreme circumstances.  It came as a complete surprise to us when we saw that it was invoked.  In my case, I saw it on social media at 4.30 p.m on the Friday while I was out for a walk.  I was a bit shocked.  It went against everything we had been considering and planning for over the previous weeks when this was an issue.  It has caused continued consternation and has been deeply unhelpful.</p><p> On the how and the why the article was triggered, these are questions for the European Commission.  Clearly, it should not have happened.  There was a commercial dispute with AstraZeneca.  We stand in solidarity with the Commission on that and on the vaccine purchasing arrangement.  Article 16 should not have come into that at all, however.  As soon as the Taoiseach was informed of this by his chief Sherpa he was immediately on the phone to Ursula von der Leyen.  There was ongoing engagement in the early evening, but the Taoiseach will have to speak for himself on that because he was the one making the calls.  There was subsequent engagement with Boris Johnson.  We continue to engage with the Commission and other member states, at my level, at the Minister for Foreign Affairs' level, at the Taoiseach's level and at ambassadorial level.</p><p> The point of concern for the moment, and which Deputy Calleary has hit upon, relates to how will we ensure this does not happen again.  The Government wants an early warning system to be put in place.  Whatever meeting is reported today, there are also ongoing meetings.  I will have a range of meetings with my counterparts too.  There is a view, which is a risky view, that yes the Commission made a mistake and has acknowledged the mistake and that everything has been resolved.  Clearly, that is not the case because the consequences of this matter are continuing.  We must apprise our colleagues around the EU of the lasting consequences of what has happened around the protocol, and that when one action is taken it inevitably provokes an opposite reaction.  Members may have seen press reports where our ambassador gave a full-blooded account of the consequences of invoking Article 16 to other EU ambassadors at a meeting of the Committee of the Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States to the European Union, COREPER, last week.  I have also done this with my colleagues, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the Taoiseach in his interactions.</p><p> This has not been good and we want an early warning system.  I am not sure about a formal process, as Deputy Calleary referred to, but engagement is ongoing to make sure that it does work.  Before my time in the role, a great deal of work was done in recent years to keep the Commission and the other member states apprised of the actual situation on the ground in Northern Ireland.  We cannot assume prior knowledge.  We were lucky with Michel Barnier in that he had a long history in the context of the various roles he has held.  He was a Minister for agriculture and for foreign affairs and then he was in the Commission when the PEACE programme funding was first put in place.  Mr. Barnier had a deep knowledge of the situation in Northern Ireland but this may not be the case for everybody else, which would be natural.  That is one of the first points.  We must make sure that people know what the situation is like on the ground, that it is not simply something that can be put in writing between the EU and Britain and that there are many complicated aspects to it.  Whatever meeting is reported today, I will not come here and describe this as a key, crunch meeting.  There is ongoing engagement under way and we may not have a resolution on it today.  It is safe to say that people are fully aware of the significance of what has transpired.</p><p> I will now turn to the Deputy's point on trade volumes and the concern about co-ordination.</p><p>A group comprised of representatives of all Departments meets on a daily basis to examine all of the issues around trading goods, particularly between Britain and Ireland.  We are also, as I am sure are members, engaging with hauliers and logistics companies and their concerns are being fed into the system.  I compliment officials and Government agencies on taking on board some of the concerns.  People at the coalface and on the front line of importing and logistics need to get things done.  Much of this work is time sensitive.  They have brought many issues to our attention and I encourage them to continue to do that.  The numbers show that some trade has moved from the land bridge to the direct routes.  We can see that by volume.  It is not possible to do an exact comparison but some trade has moved.  Numbers on the Ireland-Britain route are down but they have increased dramatically on the direct continental routes.  </p><p> I mentioned in my earlier contribution that Britain has not yet introduced checks to the extent that we have.  Businesses will have to start preparing for this and Government will be trying to help them prepare for it through the various schemes.  Businesses need to be aware that things are going to get more difficult.  It is important to remember that checks are taking place for a reason.  This is our contribution to the European Union Single Market and customs union.  The Single Market was created to avoid red tape and border checks.  Britain decided to leave the Single Market and that has inevitably resulted in checks raising their heads again.  They are not temporary.  This is an obligation we have to take seriously because our economic prosperity and the protection of our public health and safety depend on it.  The Single Market is essential to our economy.  That is an important message.  We do not want these checks but they are essential to our membership of the Single Market.  Revenue has introduced some easements to help the situation and that may continue but these are not exemptions or free passes.  We have to implement the new arrangements in the most practical way possible.  </p></speech>

With the agreement of members, we will try something different.  I have no doubt Deputy Howlin has a number of questions.  I suggest he engage in a questions and answers session with the Minister of State as that might lend itself to the answers being more direct.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.491" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021020900002#G00500"><p>I am in the Chairman's hands.  I confirm I am in Leinster House.  It is snowing outside; I hope I will be able to get back to Wexford.</p> <p>  I want to deal with the same two issues from a different perspective.  There is no point in underscoring our collective reaction to the decision to trigger Article 16.  It went beyond unfortunate and regrettable, but I suppose the Minister of State has to use those words.  I am interested in getting behind the process.  The Minister of State said that is a matter for the Commission, but it is a matter for all of us to know how the Commission operates.  The President of the Commission said this was a decision of the college of Commissioners but we heard from our Irish nominated Commissioner that she was not alerted to it.  Does the Minister of State know how this came about?  It is akin to a Government decision being made without members of the Government being aware of it.  I am sure that happened in the past, but it should not happen.  There is a process.  One would imagine that on something as sensitive as this there is a clear process.  It undermines my confidence in the decision-making processes for the future.  I would like to know how this happened, as I am sure would the Government.  Where was the mistake or is there a structural difficulty in regard to all of this?  In terms of this not happening again, the utterances of the Commission immediately afterwards did not indicate that would be the case.</p><p>It basically reserved the right, maybe, to exercise Article 16 again.  As I said, I listened last week at the meeting to the EU ambassador to the UK, and he was less than clear in saying this was an action we should not have taken.  That is the first question.  I want to talk about ports on my second question shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.493" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021020900002#H00200"><p>I have no problem answering that.  The President of the Commission herself has taken full political responsibility for this, and I think that is where accountability lies.  Again, I am not running away from the question because I am as concerned as the Deputy.  However, I cannot answer for the Commission.  It is accountable to the European Parliament and the parliamentarians plan to question Commissioners, and maybe the President as well, and she has already addressed people.  I am not here to defend the Commission in any way but I cannot be accountable for it either.</p> <p>  All of us, when we see a decision of the European Commission, are entitled to assume that the Commission has decided to do this in accordance with its powers and the way it does business, and we are entitled to assume that the College of Commissioners, in general, is part of the decision-making.  As to the exact mechanics in this regard, the Commission will have to explain that, and we are in ongoing engagement with the Commission on that.  Obviously, with trade policy, the Commission has the competence and it makes decisions like this, I am told, on an extremely regular basis in terms of safeguarding measures.  Unfortunately, it appears to be the case that while the trade experts crossed every t and dotted every i, and made sure there was no possible theoretical escape route, somebody with a political sensibility in terms of the actual reality of the ground, and the lived lives of people in Northern Ireland, was not in the room making that decision.  That is fundamentally the problem here.</p> <p>  It is a decision that I certainly hope will not happen again but Deputy Howlin is right that we need to ensure it does not happen again.  As I said, we have ongoing engagement and that will need to continue.  I strongly encourage members of the committee in their engagement with the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, and with their counterparts not just to say that a mistake was made here but to state that it cannot happen again, because to do otherwise would be to state we are okay when, in fact, we are not okay because we see the ongoing consequences in Northern Ireland.  All of us here on this island, as Europeans, need to let our European colleagues know, in whatever capacity, what the consequences are to ensure more people know what the actual situation is on the ground in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  Fundamentally, she has taken political responsibility and will have to be accountable to the European Parliament.  I know the Vice-President of the Commission has been invited before the committee and I sincerely hope he attends and answers its questions.  That would be very useful both in terms of accountability and in making sure that all of our Commissioners, who are our Commissioners, are fully apprised of the situation in Northern Ireland, and that would be a tremendous opportunity.</p></speech>

It says that 80% of vehicular traffic coming in is green-lighted, which means that one in five vehicles is stopped.  That is a very significant volume.  I acknowledge not all of that is within our remit, inasmuch as the preparedness of many of the British authorities and companies was not what it should have been.  However, we have a real problem in regard to that level of stoppages in a situation, first, where there are already derogations from some elements of the protocol for a period and, second, where the volumes were down to 50% in January.  There will be a chaotic build-up if 20% of vehicles are being stopped when it is at full volume.  While it is not entirely within our remit, we need to have flexibility within Revenue if its systems are not working.  I want to know what the Government wants to do about that.</p> <p>  Second, I listened to Revenue yesterday stating that, because Britain is now a third country, it is applying the standard checks for third countries, with something like 5% or 6% of vehicles being checked at random.  It is not as if Britain had not got identical standards to us up to four weeks ago.</p><p>I am interested in the Minister of State's view on whether that volume of checks is immediately required, with the consequences of delays and frustrations, as we ease this in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.496" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021020900002#J00200"><p>I thank Deputy Howlin.  The Government has put significant time and resources into Brexit preparations.  Overall, it has been well managed.  We have not had the physical manifestation of delays in the form of traffic but I acknowledge that there are other delays.  We will never get to 100% of traffic going through green light channels.  That is just not possible.  The Single Market was built to avoid this type of bureaucracy, paperwork and checks.  Britain has left the Single Market and some checks are inevitably necessary.  There will always be some checks.  There were checks previously but they were not for customs.  One in five trucks is stopped, which goes up on certain days, and shows an increase since the start of the year.  I am concerned that it would get to a higher level and am concerned about the future.</p> <p>  There are issues with UK trader readiness, as the Deputy mentioned.  There are undoubtedly issues with Revenue's computer system.  I understand that it has been rectified.  Traders bring these matters to my attention.  I am not in Revenue or a Minister for it, but in fairness to it, it responds to these issues, which arise regularly.  That caused difficulty and there are no two ways about it.  Some volumes have reduced, possibly permanently, because of the direct route through the Continent rather than using the land bridge.</p></speech>

Internally, I challenged the view that the market would respond.  It has responded so far, which is welcome.  Any shipping company which has provided more routes has seen significant amounts to transport.  When we talk about one in five, the vast majority of checks are documentary.  The stops involve paperwork.  Much of that paperwork can be rectified.  That will take some getting used to, with companies getting used to the new procedures and finding it difficult to get customs experts, which is why there is Government support.  UK trader preparedness is also an issue.  It was at 85% in Dublin over the weekend.  We keep that under review.  It was at 70% a few weeks ago.  It is a slow increase but it is increasing.</p> <p>  Revenue is willing to listen to people and when issues are brought to my attention or the Deputy's attention and the officials find out about them, they try to find solutions.  In one case where there was a customs delay, Revenue helped out so that it could move more quickly, but if animals have to be checked, they have to be checked.  There will always be stops and checks.  That is the unfortunate reality of Britain's decision to leave the European Union and the Single Market.</p></speech>

Is the damage caused by this really appreciated by the European Commission and the Minister of State's colleagues in the EU?  There is lasting damage.  In the days after this happened, people leapt at the opportunity.</p><p>Everybody makes mistakes but how one learns from them is the most important thing.  Moving on from Article 16, my next concern is twofold.  Does the Minister of State think that the British Government is now in danger of pushing this too far?  We see extra demands and a consistent underlining that it is now prepared to trigger Article 16.  If one looks at the albeit typical British newspapers, they are demanding a renegotiation less than six weeks since the trade deal was agreed.  A British minister on national radio this morning accused the EU of being unreasonable and changing its position.  I am very worried that less than six weeks in, people are damaging the house of cards.</p><p> My final question comes back to the protocol which the Minister of State referred to briefly in his intervention.  To what extent is engagement taking place between the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive in relation to the operation of the protocol?  Are there any opportunities that may be pushed up to Michael Gove and Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi when they have meetings?  I am quite worried by some Northern Irish politicians demanding that all North-South relations in this area be cut off.  I do not see what that achieves.  I would really appreciate the Minister of State's take on those three related but quite worrying issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.501" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021020900002#K00300"><p>That first question about the damage caused by this and whether it is fully appreciated is quite useful.  That is a point I have been making.  Many people said yes, put up their hands and said that a mistake was made and that it has been acknowledged.  Some people said we should move on but obviously we cannot move on when we see the particular situation on the ground in Northern Ireland.  As I said already, it is up to all of us, in whatever interactions we have with our interlocutors in Europe, to make sure the situation and the damage done is if fully appreciated by them.  The solution then is to have this early warning system which will presumably ensure that this could not possible happen again.  Nobody will want this to happen again but the important point it is to make sure that is does not happen again.  With colleagues, I am certainly making it very clear that damage was done and that is continues to be lasting.</p> <p>  There is on going contact between Britain and the European Union, in particular between the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and Michael Gove.  In Northern Ireland, there has been much engagement.  By the way, there has been a North-South Ministerial Council since this happened.  There is ongoing political engagement as well in relation to Northern Ireland.  We were getting many calls about Article 16 before all of this happened and, indeed, its invocation was suggested at very high levels in Britain in January.</p> <p>  The important point to remember is that the protocol is a legal agreement between Britain and the European Union and its function is basically to make the best possible job out of a bad job, which is Brexit, for the island of Ireland.  Even the attempted invocations of Article 16 a couple of weeks ago, did not eliminate the protocol.  It did damage but it provided for a very limited arrangement there.  That is what Article 16 is there for.  Anyone who is going to invoke Article 16 needs to realise doing so will not eliminate the protocol.  The protocol is there to avoid the hard border on the island, to make sure people and good can move freely, and that Northern Ireland remains part of the Single Market of the European Union.</p> <p>  There is very close contact with the British Government at all levels.  Late last year Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and Michael Gove, in terms of their plan to implement the protocol, showed their good working relationship and that they are practical people who will get the job done.  They need to be given time to agree flexibilities that will help the protocol to work more effectively for all people of Northern Ireland.  It is not about Article 16.  It is not about getting rid of the protocol or replacing it.</p><p>The protocol is there and will remain, but it is about working to make sure it is as flexible as possible within its terms.  I am confident we can do that.  It will not make everybody happy but we do not have a winner takes all system in Northern Ireland.  It is a complicated system where we try to make the best possible arrangements to make sure that each community can benefit to the fullest extent from the arrangements entered into.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.503" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021020900002#L00200"><p>I have a couple of questions about the statement by the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, that she takes full responsibility for what happened.  The problem is that it is saying there is a veil to be drawn over this, in that she takes full responsibility and nobody should pierce the veil or ask for further transparency.</p><p>Is the Irish Government going to insist on knowing exactly what happened and who made the decisions?  If it is going to do that, will it be kept in competence?  Will we, as parliamentarians, be told exactly what the process was that led to this?  </p><p>While we can say it is unfortunate and regrettable, to use the Minister of State's language, it is also inexplicable.  If one considers Article 16 and the seventh annex to the protocol, it is very clear it had no application.  As the Minister of State's statement says, it is a separate matter.  It had no application to an attempt to stop vaccine being exported through Ireland.  Is it the case that whoever made this decision did not read and did not understand the extent of the protocol?  If that is the case, we are left in a situation not merely in which damage was done but the operation of protocol is in the hands of people who do not understand it.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on that.</p><p>I appreciate the Irish Government's position is that negotiations on the protocol between the UK and the EU is a bilateral process.  It is not a multilateral process in which we step in or out.  However, it seems that since we have a very clear national interest in this matter, we should have a <i>de facto </i>presence in the process of negotiation between the vice-president with responsibility for trade and the UK Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, and their officials, so we can see for ourselves that what is being negotiated is reasonable and not damaging to us.</p><p>There should be transparency and that the Irish public and the European Parliament are entitled to know what happened.  There must be some mechanism so that people who are in charge of any process involving the Irish protocol understand when it cannot, legally, be deployed.  If the same people who invoked Article 16 are conducting the trade negotiations, Ireland needs the maximum transparency for the Irish Government, either with a <i>de facto</i>presence or some form of immediate consultation on the process of negotiations to make the movement of goods between the UK and Northern Ireland as transparent as possible.</p></speech>

It is a bilateral agreement between Britain and the European Union.  However, we are fully part of the implementation committees, the joint committee and the special committee, on the protocol.  Added to that, there is ongoing, significant contact, not only between Ireland and the European Union at all levels, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, the Taoiseach and the President and vice-President of the Commission, but also between Dublin and London.  That is absolutely ongoing.  We have a formal role, as every member state does, and member states will often take our particular line on Northern Ireland issues.</p> <p>  Regarding the Senator's second question, I have said publicly that whoever did this did not fully appreciate the political situation in Northern Ireland.  There are no two ways about that because they would not have done it had they known.  There are discussions on an ongoing basis to make sure that, not only do we put the hands up and say it cannot happen again, but that it actually cannot happen again.  The Government is involved at all levels in discussions in relation to that.  </p> <p>  Regarding President Ursula von der Leyen's statement that she accepts full responsibility, that is an important political declaration.  On whether we insist on knowing who exactly made the decision, I do not know the answer to that.  There certainly have been suggestions made, many of them publicly.  Ultimately, in the first instance the Commission is accountable to the Parliament and I have absolutely no doubt that the Parliament will be demanding, and is entitled to demand, an explication of what exactly happened.  Many of our parliamentarians are already making those particular points.</p> <p>  We have ongoing engagements at the General Affairs Council.  We will have discussions and these are questions and points I will be more than happy to put to the General Affairs Council, which will be in two weeks' time.  Our ambassador has been extremely forthright at meetings with his counterparts as have the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  The message has got across loudly and clearly and the most important thing is that it does not happen again.</p></speech>

I was not saying that whoever made the decision was unaware of the political consequences.  It was that it was, legally, completely wrong.  The annex and Article 16 are not applicable, as the Minister of State's own statement says, to the moving of vaccines through Ireland into the UK.  It simply was an abuse of the protocol and in flagrant breach of the annex which requires prior consultation.  That is the point I was making.</p></speech>

What the committee is doing and intends to do at subsequent meetings is to find out what actually happened.  We need to learn the lessons from it.  I know the Minister said that we cannot really move on from it, but we will eventually.  We need to learn the lessons and to move on from it eventually perhaps by, as other speakers said, putting the early warning system in place.</p> <p>  I have two questions and a few thoughts.  Problems were always going to arise with the implementation of the protocol for business and consumers in Northern Ireland.  It is fair to say that many businesses in Northern Ireland were simply not prepared for Brexit.</p><p>Trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland has been disrupted.  Supermarkets in Northern Ireland have experienced shortages of time-sensitive goods, such as fresh produce and chilled meats.  Many sorts of horror stories are emerging concerning people not being able to bring their pets into Northern Ireland from Great Britain because of issues with vaccination etc.  It is clear in that context that practical and sensible modifications are needed regarding the operation of the protocol in Northern Ireland.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that such practical and sensible modifications can be made to sort out these types of problems?  Do such possibilities exist?  For example, is an extension of the grace period a possibility?</p><p> My second question concerns the Northern Ireland peace process, which we are all worried about.  The Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and unionists in general have always seen the creation of a border in the Irish Sea as some sort of step in the direction of Irish unity and the holding of a border poll.  Therefore, the sensitivities involved with this issue are clear to everybody.  The DUP has not had a good Brexit.  The party supported Brexit in the first place and then opposed the deal reached by the former British Prime Minister, Theresa May.  The members of that party are of course going to exaggerate the consequences of the Northern Ireland protocol for political purposes.  We saw the DUP put forward a five-point plan to have the protocol abolished, which of course is not going to happen.  The party is, however, calling on the UK Government to invoke Article 16 and to have the protocol abolished, if possible.</p><p> In respect of the threat to relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, I was interested to hear the Minister of State say that there has been a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  The DUP had threatened to cease co-operation with such bodies, and that would be a serious issue.  We all agree with the call to calm things down because of the sensitivities involved in this situation.  I take it that the Minister of State agrees that North-South relations are extremely important, but will he reassure me that things are being done to repair the damage done?  We are obviously not responsible for that damage, but we are seriously concerned about this deterioration in relations.  We must improve those relations and take positive steps to bring that improvement about.</p></speech>

The North-South bodies are limited anyway, and we would like for there to be more of them.  It is important, however, to note that meeting did happen.  I share fully the Deputy's concerns regarding North-South relations.  It is important to keep everything on an even keel in that respect.  This situation has clearly interrupted that endeavour.  There are many other threats to the peace process in Northern Ireland, but what has happened has shown us that if something in this vein occurs, then it can cause immediate harm.</p> <p>  When I said we cannot move on from this, my point was that at this particular moment we cannot accept people just putting their hands up and saying everything is now fine.  Clearly, it is not fine right now.  Deputy Haughey is correct, though, that we need to move forward.  People calling for the protocol to be abolished must realise that is not going to happen, and that is a fact.  The protocol is a legal agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union and it is not going to be abolished.  Ultimately, these problems have been caused by Brexit.  The protocol exists and is designed to alleviate the problems of Brexit.</p> <p>  Trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is about where it was previously.  It has not gone down.  Some of that is possibly a reflection of trade coming here, and there has definitely been some movement from Dublin to Belfast.  It may seem, therefore, that trade is down.</p><p>In actual numbers, however, it is not; it is at a similar level.  It is important to remember that there is a huge amount of trade getting through between Northern Ireland and Britain, as well a lot of people doing works.  Even after the threats last week, which were repulsive and are to be condemned, a great number of checks still were happening because much of this is done on a documentary basis.  There are issues, however, that are causing annoyance.  They can be dealt with within the structures of the protocol that might help the situation but that does not mean that the protocol is going to be changed.  The UK has set out some things it is asking for some of which reflect demands in the North, including businesses there.  Modest extensions of the existing grace periods would definitely help reassure the business sector and moderate voices and Northern society broadly that they are being listened to and that we genuinely want to make the protocol work for every section of the community in Northern Ireland.  That is important to all of us.  </p><p> It is not about winners and losers but about trying to make the best possible situation out of what is a very difficult scenario in Northern Ireland at present.  I am convinced that if we can get over the current difficulties, recognising that a great deal of trade is happening and that many goods can come in, we can solve some of the issues the Deputy raised.  I cannot give any commitments on them but I know some can be resolved.  Some cause particular anxiety, such as the issue concerning pets.  The Alliance Party proposed a veterinary agreement between the EU and Britain and that certainly is in the range of possibilities in the medium term.  It is not something that will provide immediate answers but it is something with which we would have no difficulties whatsoever.  We want to make this work and work for everybody.  </p></speech>

The big question in relation to the European Commission is how exactly it happened and in ensuring that it does not happen again.  Whatever meetings in which the Government will be involved will be absolutely necessary.  It is a case of finding out exactly what happened from the perspective of ensuring that there is no room for a move such as this again.  We have all seen its outworkings.  I agree with much of what others said that this is Brexit coming home to roost, unfortunately.  From a unionist perspective, supporting it was absolute madness.  It is the most destabilising thing they could have done from the point of view of the Union.  So be it, that is done.</p> <p>  I welcome the Government's engagement on the need to retain the protocol.  While we all accept that modifications were necessary and will be carried out, whether it relates to grace periods etc., we need that to be sorted, North and South.  I welcome that the Government is taking on board issues brought to it by people involved in supply chain logistics and so on, as the Minister of State noted.  </p> <p>  What I think has happened is that unionist politicians have looked at their polling numbers,know they are under pressure and are using tried and tested methods from the 1880s nearly or from the 1980s.  If we accept that the Irish protocol and the withdrawal agreement are international agreements that are not going anywhere, it could be another case of leading people up the hill, which is not helpful.  Nor is it helpful when one hears about Michael Gove's ultimatum letter or hears Arlene Foster speak of how she has Boris Johnson on side from the point of view of introducing legislation that would negate elements of the Irish protocol, as well as the fact that he might simply invoke Article 16.  I have no doubt that the Government has engaged with the British Government on this issue.  I would like to think the engagement is robust.  I seek an update from the Minister of State on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.512" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021020900002#P00100"><p>There is a hugely changed political situation in Northern Ireland, and we see from opinion polling that it is changing all the time.  There are many nuances of opinion; it is not one side versus the other.  I think we can all agree now that there are significant nuances and a broad range of the public there who want to live decent lives, have prosperity and be able to move around the place.  The Irish Government will try to ensure the best opportunity for the North.  When these issues are solved, and work is ongoing to solve them, Northern Ireland will have a huge opportunity to be part of the Single Market of the European Union.  If one's perspective is on the unionist side, Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of Britain as well.  There are therefore huge opportunities there for the economy, and it is up to all of us, but particularly leaders in Northern Ireland, to help drive that forward and to make sure those opportunities are seized.</p> <p>  I cannot get into what questions officials or others have asked many times.  The Commission as a body signed off on the measure which included Article 16 and political responsibility rests with the Commission.  Ursula von der Leyen has accepted that and there will be accountability to the European Parliament.  I accept that there is a point in trying to find out who did what to make sure that we have the right people there, that this cannot happen again and that somebody knows about the situation.  When I think of our system, however, which is slightly analogous, if a government were to make such a mistake, that government and its Ministers, not individual officials, would be accountable to the D&aacute;il.  The reality is that this was drawn up.  Commissioners, who are in regular contact with their counterparts here and indeed with the British Government, did not see fit to take out this provision or to say to themselves, as I did and, as I am sure, all committee members did when we first saw this on social media at about 4.30 p.m. that Friday, "What the - ?" I could not believe it.  I would like to think Commissioners would think in that same political way that this is something that just should not have happened.  That did not happen and, ultimately, there has to be political responsibility.  I know the European Parliament will do its job in that regard, but the lessons are very important too.</p> <p>  I will repeat this.  The protocol is there.  It will not go away.  Nobody has the possibility to remove it.  There is no possibility of negating elements of the protocol either.  There is the possibility of all of us working together to make sure it works in the most flexible way possible, consistent with everybody's demands that there be no hard border on the island of Ireland.  This is really important for the economies north and south of the Border, and we cannot lose sight of this when we talk about checks and customs.  It is really important that Ireland protects its place in the Single Market and that no questions are asked about that.  It is absolutely central and essential to our economic policy and our economic growth into the future.  That is very important, and I think everybody recognises that, but sometimes when we talk about difficulties and inconveniences we can perhaps put to one side the fact that the Single Market is so important and so central to us.  The invocation of Article 16 has already happened, almost, and we see the fallout from that, so I think it is very unlikely that that will happen again.  The point is that nobody can invoke Article 16 to eliminate the protocol or to change its terms.  The protocol remains and always will remain, and there are ways of making sure we all work together to work it as effectively and efficiently as possible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.514" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021020900002#P00300"><p>Yes.  I appreciate what the Minister of State has said.  I will ask just two very quick questions.  Is he happy enough that the structures exist such that we can deal with whatever modifications are needed for a better operationality of the Irish protocol?  I am very glad he has reiterated what I myself would accept, that is, that the withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol are international agreements and are not going anywhere.  They are absolute necessities.  Unionists are doing whatever unionists are doing, but some of the rhetoric and the likes of the letter of ultimatum from Michael Gove are not especially helpful.  What has been our engagement with the British Government from the point of view of dialling down that rhetoric, particularly if it is only a case of fanning flames and it is not actually going anywhere?  I accept that the British Government may be looking for modifications.</p><p>In that regard, I believe there is a difficulty in respect of a customs database to which the European Union is seeking access to facilitate addressing some of these problems.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021020900002#Q00200"><p>The simple answer to the first question on whether the systems are in place to address all these issues is "Yes".  They are there in a formal sense within the withdrawal agreement, the trade and co-operation agreement and the protocol.  The Irish Government is fully part of that.  Despite the fact that it is directly between the EU and Britain, we are fully involved.  Those systems were not used in this particular context.  That is part of the problem but there are ongoing engagements between Dublin and London also at a political level, which is very important.  When this matter first arose the Taoiseach was in touch with Commission President Ursula von der Leyen a number of times.  He then took the opportunity to speak to Prime Minister Johnson.  There is still ongoing contact between Michael Gove and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, as well as ongoing contact at official level and on the ground.  I am absolutely satisfied that the contact is good.  It is fair to say also that Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and Chancellor Gove have shown themselves to be very good at working together in everybody's interests.  I am absolutely confident that will continue.</p></speech>

I have no doubt he will get a sense from this meeting that this conversation will not finish today.  There is an appetite among committee members to ensure we get accountability and transparency.  I believe that no single person made a decision of such magnitude and impact.  My belief is that a group of individuals came together and that people in the Commission know their identity.  For us to have confidence in the Commission into the future, it is imperative that we find out who made this decision of such magnitude because it had consequences.  For every action there is a reaction.  We only have to think of the time, effort and diligence invested in this by officials in the Commission such as Michel Barnier and his team and the individual countries throughout the European Union which knew of the sensitivity of the Northern Ireland peace process and went out of their way to send ambassadors here.  I met the Danish and the Dutch ambassadors in my county.  Many other ambassadors went to County Louth and different parts of the Border region over the past four and half years to get a sense of the situation.  Individual countries of the European Union understand the importance of the peace process and protecting it.  However, this decision, which was made very quickly by a group of individuals on a Friday evening, had drastic consequences that could have had a deeper impact on Northern Ireland.  It was a very serious decision.  It is very important that we as a nation have confidence in the European Union and have a Commission that is accountable.  It cannot be a powerful entity where individuals can be protected.  The message in that regard is strong.  The Minister of State need not address that again as he covered it to the best of his knowledge.</p> <p>  The Minister of State may not have an answer to this specific question.  What assurances can he give that the protocols around strict veterinary distribution practices employed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are replicated in Northern Ireland?  I have a concern that protocols similar to the very strict regime we have in place, through the Department, for ensuring traceability and quality of produce are not replicated in Northern Ireland.  The Minister of State might ask his officials to follow up on that and revert directly to my officials in this committee.</p> <p>  I thank members.</p><p>Ba mhaith liom m'aitheantas agus mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il chuig an Aire St&aacute;it f&aacute; choinne na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta inniu.

While there was a spectacular mistake two weeks ago, it is important to remember that there has been solidarity.  Owing to the engagements we all have with our European colleagues, they are listening to what we are saying now.  They are probably listening to the proceedings of this committee also.  Anything we say by way of criticism is welcome but it is part of normal accountability in what is a democracy and considering what the EU is.  It is our European Union; it is not some administrative structure's European Union.  It is the Union of the citizens.  I did not want to let the meeting go without acknowledging the solidarity we have all noted over recent years, but that does not in any way take from the requirement of accountability of political leaders.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Kieran Harkin and Dr. Aisling McMahon who represent Access to Medicines Ireland, and Ms Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS.  We will be joined later in the meeting by Dr. David Nabarro, the special envoy on Covid-19 for the World Health Organization, WHO.  They are welcome to our engagement.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as in any way damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that compliance with any direction be observed.  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations in respect of parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  In this regard, witnesses who are participating in this committee meeting from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised also that they should be especially mindful of the domestic law in the jurisdiction from which they speak and how it may apply to the evidence that may be given.</p> <p>  Members are reminded, and I thank the witnesses for their forbearance, of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex, either here in the D&aacute;il Chamber or remotely from offices within the precincts of the Houses.  For anybody watching this meeting online, some Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everybody to bear with us should any issues of a technical nature arise.</p><p>In anticipation of a successful engagement, I express my appreciation to those people in the background, comprising our broadcasting team, sound engineers and everybody associated with what, on the face of it, seems a straightforward engagement.  A lot of work has gone into this meeting and I am very grateful to members for their attendance and for the efforts of everybody involved.</p><p> I call Dr. Harkin to give his opening statement.  He will be followed by Dr. McMahon and Ms Byanyima.  I will then ask members to participate by way of a question-and-answer session, starting with Deputy Brady.</p></speech>

We would like to explain why we believe that Ireland should formally endorse the World Health Organization's, WHO's, Covid-19 technology access pool, C-TAP, without delay.  I am a GP based in Dublin.  I am joined by Dr. Aisling McMahon, an assistant professor of law at Maynooth University with a special interest in patent and health law.  Access to Medicines Ireland is a membership group, an organisation of relevant workers.  We are honoured to be joined by Ms Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS, and a leading advocate of the People's Vaccine Alliance.<br/><br/>To date, more than 3,600 people have died from Covid-19 in Ireland, and more than 2.3 million people have died globally.  The global economic cost of Covid-19 has been estimated at $3.4 trillion per year.  Furthermore, Oxfam has calculated that the economic impact of the virus could push 500 million people into poverty and nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost, according to UN estimates.  While the arrival of effective vaccines has brought an expectation that the pandemic can be brought under control, that is threatened by an inadequate supply of vaccines.  Most lower income countries are not expected to be vaccinated until 2023 or later.  Vaccine scarcity and slow roll-out will ensure a prolongation of the pandemic as outbreaks re-emerge due to travel between and within countries.  Even more worrying is the risk that variants of the virus will emerge, which will be more infectious, more dangerous and resistant to current vaccines, as we have seen in South Africa in recent days.<br/><br/>Ongoing research into identifying and addressing these problems before they arise is essential.  For these reasons, efficient mechanisms for scientists to collaborate and accelerate research and to achieve faster global roll-out of effective vaccines is essential.  The reality is that the current vaccine scarcity is artificial and can be resolved by increasing production capacity globally.  However, to do so, companies must share their know-how and intellectual property rights to expedite research and enable others to produce vaccines.  Given the extent of the extraordinary health crisis and a significant public investment that has supported the creation of many Covid-19 vaccines, this is not an unreasonable expectation.  As Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO said:</p> <blockquote> 	We have got to get it together as a society.  Social justice is only a dream if we don't put health justice at the centre ... </blockquote> <p>Rapid, equitable, global access to vaccines must be a key priority and to achieve this, we urge the Government to endorse the WHO's C-TAP.  I will hand over to Dr. McMahon who will detail this model.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.528" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aisling McMahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#B00300"><p>In May 2020, the WHO initiated the solidarity call to action, launching its support for the C-TAP and urging key actors, including governments, to take action.  Put simply, the C-TAP is a platform to facilitate the sharing of intellectual property rights, data, know-how and cell lines related to Covid-19 technologies, including vaccines.</p><p>Its end goal is to increase equitable access.  The C-TAP model is needed because production capacity for vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for Covid can be increased globally but, in order to do this, more companies must license and share intellectual property rights, know-how and technologies to enable others to produce them.  The C-TAP sets up a mechanism to facilitate this.  It is a voluntary model that is subject to the agreement of such companies.  Participation, depending on the context, could include compensation in the form of royalties where appropriate.<br/><br/>Countries must learn from the past.  The use of intellectual property rights in a manner which hindered access to medicines has had devastating impacts previously, particularly in the HIV-AIDS crisis, with many millions of lives lost as a result.  We must ensure that in this health crisis, that does not happen again.  In short, supporting the C-TAP provides a way to achieve global equitable access to vaccines.  It would maximise the manufacturing capacity globally by enabling more companies to make vaccines.  It would accelerate the development of new technologies by encouraging the sharing of data and know-how, thereby increasing transparency.  It would facilitate more accessible access.  The C-TAP works in collaboration with the existing UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool, which has extensive experience in pooling intellectual property rights for public health.  Furthermore, support for the C-TAP aligns with the European Commission's recently published intellectual property strategy and the Word Health Assembly's Covid-19 response resolution, both of which encourage voluntary pooling and licensing of intellectual property for Covid-19.  Addressing vaccine inequality in this way also gives us a better opportunity to ensure that the core values and intentions of Irish Aid's policy, A Better World, are put into practice, reaching the furthest behind first and leaving no one behind, which is Ireland's approach to realising the UN sustainable development goals.  It is fully consistent with Ireland's foreign policy goals of openness, global solidarity and a commitment to multilateralism.<br/><br/>The C-TAP is also vital if COVAX, the vaccine pillar of the WHO's Access to Covid-19 Tools, ACT, Accelerator is to be a success.  C-TAP and COVAX are complementary to each other.  On 5 February, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus of the WHO, in discussing COVAX's first interim vaccine distribution forecast, cautioned that:</p><blockquote>	Countries are ready to go but the vaccines aren't there...  We encourage all manufacturers to share their data and technology to ensure global equitable access to vaccines. </blockquote><p>However, it must be emphasised that the C-TAP will only be a success if more Governments and companies support it.  On the other hand, if voluntary mechanisms like the C-TAP do not achieve sufficient support, then mandatory measures for suspending intellectual property rights under the WTO Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver proposal will be needed, and should be supported, to encourage and achieve change.<br/><br/>Access to Medicines Ireland is joined by ActionAid Ireland, the Irish Global Health Network, the INMO, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res Ireland and Oxfam Ireland in calling on the Government to support the C-TAP.  To date, 40 countries worldwide, including five European countries, have endorsed it.  Furthermore, last September, the President, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, indicated his support for the WHO's global solidarity call to action in his speech at the UN General Assembly.  Most recently, on 3 February, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that rich countries had a moral responsibility to help countries unable to access vaccines.  This could include supplementing their own ability to produce vaccines with co-operation from the pharmaceutical companies regarding relaxation of some of the patent situations.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that we have got to get the entire world vaccinated.  Global multilateral action is needed and Ireland can and should be a leading voice in this regard.  Access to Medicines Ireland encourages the Government to endorse formally the global solidarity call to action and the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool as soon as possible and to take action at an EU level to encourage greater support for the C-TAP.  Alongside this, we urge the Government to increase financial support for the WHO's ACT Accelerator.  We thank the committee for granting us this opportunity to share our views.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.534" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Winnie Byanyima" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#D00400"><p>Yes.  My name is Winnie Byanyima.  I lead the United Nations joint programme on HIV-AIDS.  It is called UNAIDS.  I am grateful for this opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the critical issue of Covid vaccine equity.  I am also happy to let the committee know that I am the proud daughter of Irish missionary sisters of St. Francis.</p> <p>  In the early years of the AIDS response, millions of lives, as Dr. McMahon said, were needlessly lost because life-saving treatment remained out of reach for people in poor countries as people in rich countries benefited from antiretroviral treatment and went on to live long, healthy lives.  In poor countries 9 million people died waiting for the prices to come down.  It was a deeply painful lesson that many of us know very personally and one that the world, it seems, is having to learn again.</p> <p>  Ten months ago world leaders declared that any Covid-19 vaccine would be a global public good, a people's vaccine, but we now face a situation that the South African Government has called a new global apartheid.  Nine in ten people in the poorest countries are set to go without a vaccine this year.  A small group of rich countries representing just 14% of the global population have bought up most of the supply of the Covid vaccines that are available until the end of 2021.  I am sure the committee is as shocked as I am that pharma companies are charging developing countries more than they are charging rich countries, in some cases more than double.  My country, Uganda, will pay $7 per dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and South Africa will pay just over $5 whereas the European Union will pay just over $2 per dose.</p> <p>  The problem is not only one of money or unfair allocation; it is also that not enough vaccines are being made.  Even rich countries face challenges over production quantities in this year.  What the European Union is experiencing now is deeply troubling, and we empathise.  It is a taste of what Africa, Asia and Latin America have been experiencing.  This is why approaching vaccination as a competitive race between countries and regions means that everyone loses out.  What Europe thought was defending Europe was really defending the profits of the owners of big pharmaceutical companies.  The vital decisions of production, supply and price and, therefore, who gets the vaccine and when have been left in the hands of big pharmaceutical companies.  How is that right?  Our best chance of all staying safe from Covid-19 is to have vaccines, tests and treatment available for all, for the whole world.  As the Irish President, Michael Higgins, noted when he and I spoke on the same platform at the UN last year, "Unless such medical tools are fully accessible to all on an equitable basis, the world remains at risk."  Right now, however, big pharma is protecting its monopolies, technology and intellectual property and thus restricting production.  We know how to solve this problem: it is to open up production.</p><p>Maximising global production can happen only if all companies that can produce vaccines have access to the vaccine technology, know-how and intellectual property.  Pharma companies will not share unless pressed to do so.  Governments have that leverage and there is a mechanism to enable the sharing that Dr. McMahon described, namely, the WHO's C-TAP.  It is a one-stop-shop for pooling all data, know-how, biological material and intellectual property and then licensing production and technology transfer to other potential producers.  So far, pharma companies have not joined C-TAP and the proposal presented by the Governments of South Africa and India at the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, council for a temporary waiver of certain TRIPS obligations has been blocked by the rich countries that host the pharma companies with a vaccine.</p><p> This is not only about access for the poor.  The longer the virus is left to ravage developing countries, the longer people in rich countries will remain at risk.  The virus is mutating, as Dr. Harkin stated.  This threatens the efficacy of vaccines, as we have seen with the so-called South African variant.  Yesterday, the South African Government had to postpone its roll-out of the AstraZeneca vaccine because, having bought millions of doses, it realised that the vaccine did not have efficacy against the variant.  The slow pace of vaccination everywhere means that we risk seeing more dangerous variants developing.  As Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO, a wonderful Irishman, often remarks, no one is safe until everyone is safe.</p><p> The economic cost is also great.  New research from the International Chamber of Commerce predicts that delays to vaccine access in poorer countries will cost the global economy an estimated $9 trillion, with nearly half of that being the cost to wealthy countries.  These vaccines were developed with public money and these companies depend on government support.  Whenever we raise the question of leverage over companies, though, we are told by rich countries' governments that there is COVAX.  While support for COVAX is welcome, it cannot solve the supply problem on its own.  Indeed, COVAX can only complement C-TAP.</p><p> We need to ensure that constraints on licensing and know-how no longer obstruct mass production of Covid vaccines.  We must make companies take part in C-TAP.  It is their governments that can make that happen.  We also need to speed up agreement on a waiver at the WTO, especially if C-TAP does not work.  I hope that the Irish Government will consider joining C-TAP.  I join Dr. Harkin and Dr. McMahon in urging the committee's parliamentarians to ask their Government to do so.</p><p> Like AIDS, Covid is revealing the underlying fissures of inequality, how they hurt all of us and how outdated rules and approaches obstruct us from overcoming them.  Fixing them is a policy choice.  It is a moral, public health and economic imperative to ensure that everyone gets vaccinated in 2021 and that no one is left behind.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak.</p></speech>

Since my understanding is that we have not been joined by Dr. David Nabarro yet, I will commence the questions and answers session with the three witnesses who have already contributed.  I call Deputy John Brady.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.537" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#F00100"><p>I thank all our guests for their very insightful contributions, containing important information and statistics that are shocking and alarming.  As we face into the ongoing commitment for global solidarity and social justice, the contributions are very timely.  Unfortunately, the big pharmaceutical companies continue to profiteer on the backs of people throughout the world.  I believe one of the witnesses said countries are ready to go but the vaccines are not there.  That is the call from throughout the world.  It is very clear that the pandemic can only be ended by protecting all nations.  It is interesting to hear the comment that no one is safe until everyone is safe.  That is the only way we will get on top of this global emergency.  No pharmaceutical company should profit from the pandemic.  We need to ensure widespread availability across all nations.  It is shocking that nearly 70 countries will only be able to vaccinate approximately 10% of their populations next year.</p> <p>  Another shocking figure that was given related to the cost of one of the vaccines.  The term "morally corrupt" springs to mind when some countries are being charged &euro;7 per vaccine.  South Africa is being charged &euro;5, but some of the better off countries in Europe are only being charged &euro;2 per vaccine.  That clearly shows everything that is wrong with the roll-out of the vaccines.  </p> <p>  Wealthy countries will have enough vaccine to protect all their citizens three times over in 2021 and yet some of the poorer underdeveloped countries are struggling to vaccinate their citizens.  Lessons need to be learned from the AIDS crisis.  I believe 9 million people in African countries alone died of AIDS while they were screaming out for access to the medication to help with AIDS.  </p> <p>  I believe five European countries, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal and the Netherlands, have signed up to support the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, CTAP, along with 40 countries globally and a list of organisations that were mentioned earlier.  Several Irish experts, including Professor Luke O'Neill, Dr. Sam McConkey and many others, support it.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the programme.</p> <p>  We also support another initiative and I might ask for views on this.  I refer to the Right to Cure initiative, a European citizens' initiative that was launched last year, which proposes to put public health before private profit, and to make anti-pandemic vaccines and treatments a global public good, freely accessible to everyone.  As we need 1 million signatures to move that initiative forward, I appeal to anyone who is listening to sign up to support it.  There is significant crossover in the objectives of CTAP and that particular initiative to ensure intellectual property rights and patents do not hamper the accessibility or availability of any future Covid-19 vaccine or treatment, and to ensure that EU legislation on data and market exclusivity does not limit the immediate effectiveness of compulsory licences issued by members.</p><p>There are a number of other points there as well.  Is this something our witnesses also support?  I have a question relating to the failure of countries to support C-TAP and the dire consequences of that.  Do we have expectations or analysis of what the impact will be?  We see some of the financial impacts, which are shocking, and how it will affect some poorer countries.  When we speak about people and individuals, how will the failure to introduce C-TAP affect them?  </p><p> It is unbelievable that the Irish Government has not signed up to support this.  What engagement, if any, has taken place between Access to Medicines Ireland and the Government?  What do the witnesses feel as organisations, doctors and people about this issue?  What are the largest obstacles blocking C-TAP?  Are there particular interest groups such as shareholders?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.540" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran Harkin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#G00300"><p>I am very pleased to hear the endorsements from Deputy Brady.  We have been disappointed in some sense that no more than four EU countries have supported it to date.  There will probably be much greater interest now that the US Administration has been led and encouraged by Dr. Fauci to take an interest in it and move in the direction of supporting C-TAP.  While the UK Government has not formally endorsed C-TAP, it has certainly made a number statements suggesting that it agrees with the principles underlying it and in reality, is not too far away from supporting it.  Every day, it is becoming more and more clear that the current system is failing and that we cannot rely on the pharmaceutical industry to guide us through this pandemic as its eye is clearly directed towards its shareholders rather than public health.  That is the way the industry is set up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.541" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aisling McMahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#G00400"><p>We really appreciate the endorsement in terms of C-TAP.  In terms of the Deputy's question about the failure to support C-TAP, we are seeing the consequences of it since the vaccines have been approved, particularly since they have started to be rolled out.  It is fantastic that we have these vaccines but, unfortunately, we do not have enough of them.  That is becoming more and more clear for Ireland and other European countries and all over the world.  C-TAP would facilitate the manufacturing of vaccines and the ability to make more.  There is an artificial scarcity because the rights holders are simply not sharing intellectual property data and know-how.  Know-how, data and intellectual property are needed to make these vaccines.  Rights holders could be willing to come on board, take the opportunity to share and realise that we are in an extraordinary crisis and pandemic and need to bring it under control and that the only way to do that is increase the production of these vaccines.  C-TAP is a direct avenue that would facilitate that.  We support the COVAC scheme but, unfortunately, the target is that they would have enough vaccines for 20% of populations, which is nowhere near the figure we would need to achieve herd immunity or a population-wide spread of vaccination.  The consequences of not supporting C-TAP are that we will at best achieve 20% and that is assuming we even have a supply to achieve that.  C-TAP can deliver more vaccines for the likes of COVAC and facilitate that so it is important to stress that C-TAP would provide a mechanism to deliver more vaccines if it was supported but it needs support.</p></speech>

We have a mindset that is completely taken over by the notion that profit is as important as health and life.  It is a big problem for all of us that we have developed a mindset that justifies profits coming before life.  The second issue is that the rules themselves, which we should be challenging, are not being challenged.  Why is that?  It is because shareholders in this modern world of trade have become so important in businesses that their voice is more important than that of workers, communities and ordinary people.  We had a form of trade and business 30 years ago that allowed profits to be ploughed back into workers' wages, research and community development.  Shareholders took only 10% of profits in the UK, for example, but today, shareholders take 70% of total profits.  The voice of shareholders is so dominant in the politics of our countries.  Their voice is heard before the voice of ordinary people, including consumers and workers and that is part of the problem.</p> <p>  We would like to see countries that do not host the pharmaceutical companies that produce the vaccines joining C-TAP because they do not have anything to lose.  We salute Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Norway for supporting C-TAP, as well as many other developing countries.  Of course, countries like Germany, the USA and the UK oppose C-TAP because the pharmaceutical companies and their shareholders have a powerful voice in those countries.  We would like the countries that do not have a stake in the companies producing the vaccines to come together and insist on fairer rules that allow sharing of the technology.  We urge them to back the WTO waiver that is being requested at the TRIPS Council or to join C-TAP.  These are two avenues that will assist in maximising vaccine production for the world.  The interests of big companies and their shareholders are blocking progress towards justice and equity in access to vaccines.</p></speech>

Approximately 40 countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Norway in Europe, have supported the WHO's solidarity call to action and C-TAP.  Can our guests give us any insights into why other countries have not done so?  I also note what Dr. McMahon said earlier about the fact that we are very fortunate in now having a number of vaccines that seem to be effective.  When the virus emerged initially, there was concern that it might take a very long time to develop vaccines to combat it.</p><p>Thankfully, this has happened very quickly within a year.  We are all concerned about the possibility, and the fact, that the virus is mutating and is changing and has the potential to change into something even more deadly.  I note Dr. Nabarro is also online and I welcome him.  Perhaps when he speaks he might comment on questions such as access to non-government controlled areas of Syria.  There is no guaranteed channel for vaccines for people in this area.  There are other areas of conflict in the world such as Tigray, Mozambique, Libya and Rohingya in Bangladesh, and places with many refugees in Uganda and Lebanon.  Will our guests comment on the possibility of these people getting vaccinated?  I am also interested in hearing the views of our guests on whether these areas could become centres for more changes to the virus, leading to deadlier strains, if the people in them are not vaccinated.</p><p> It is also quite interesting to note the Government here has not said "No" to joining the call for action, but if some of the recent responses from the Minister are to be considered, is examining the situation fairly strongly.  I hope we will be in a position to do so before too long.  This time last year, this issue was just starting so things have moved very quickly.</p><p> The AIDS epidemic was absolutely catastrophic.  I take on board in particular what has been said by the director of UNAIDS.  This pandemic is even more deadly because it is even more transferable and has the potential to really and truly cause devastation throughout the world.  The Government here should sign the solidarity call to action as soon as possible.  I note a number of other European countries have done so.</p><p> Throughout the world, is there a lot more capacity to produce the vaccines to the standard required?  I stand to be corrected but in Ireland we have many pharmaceutical companies but I am not aware of our companies producing any vaccine.</p></speech>

My Green Party colleague has written to the Department of Foreign Affairs, which provides the lion's share of Ireland's overseas development assistance, to request that Ireland uses its seat on the UN Security Council to advocate on behalf of the countries worst affected and least capable of overcoming the pandemic.  In addition, Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has written to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, inquiring as to whether he will support C-TAP.  Our party believes further avenues of international co-operation and assistance in addition to COVAX should be explored and leveraged to maximise equitable access and distribution of vaccines in developing countries now and in the longer term.</p> <p>  With respect to international efforts, the fast response of Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO in initiating and leading of the work of COVAX should be applauded.  It is an important demonstration of collaboration and solidarity to support vulnerable developing countries as they work to overcome Covid-19.  It is important that Ireland supports this initiative to the greatest extent possible through funding and our knowledge and experience of public health emergencies.  It is also welcome to see the aim of the COVAX initiative is to protect at least 20% of each participating population by the end of the year.  Given the task at hand, this is no small feat but the efforts of COVAX will not be sufficient to fully address the challenge and its various aspects.</p><p>Some issues and questions that come to mind are technical, operational and political.  Could the witnesses address whether health services will be sufficiently staffed and trained to administer vaccines in a timely manner and how we can ensure the safety of access in countries that are politically fragile?  There is a question about adequate storage and transport facilities and how we put those in place for the distribution of vaccines at centres and hospitals.  I thank the Chairman for bringing me in early.</p></speech>

Before I call Dr. Nabarro, I want to revert to the panel with the questions from Deputies Stanton and Leddin.  I refer to Dr. McMahon's response to the points raised by Deputy Stanton.  Could I put it to her that the herd immunity through vaccination that we thought was possible late last year and early this year is now unlikely to be possible because of the emergence of further and new variants such as, for example, the strains in South Africa and, we suspect, South America?   Does she agree that we are seeing a movable feast or shift in the projected goalposts, which adds to the challenge involved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.549" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aisling McMahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#K00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I will start by answering some of the questions raised.  On Deputy Stanton's question on why other countries have not joined the CTAP initiatives, 40 countries worldwide have done so, as was noted, including five European countries.  In terms of why others have not, that is the question we are also asking.  In our minds, CTAP will facilitate more access to vaccines.  I can only speculate as to why countries have not signed up so far.  I wonder if perhaps it is only now that as vaccines have thankfully come on board, we are seeing gaps in terms of access, supply chain issues and that do not have as many vaccines as we initially thought we would.  Now would be an opportune time for people to reflect on that and countries to put themselves behind some of the initiatives such as CTAP which will, if it is supported, facilitate more people being able to make these vaccines.</p> <p>  Another important point was raised, which relates to the Chairman's point on the new variants that are arising.  It is a worrying time.  Others are more qualified to speak on those points and I am sure we will hear from Dr. Nabarro later on this.  In terms of the intellectual property perspective, one of the obstacles to having access to vaccines is intellectual property, data and the sharing of know-how, in particular.  This also relates to the point on the safety of the production of vaccines.  We need companies to share their know-how to facilitate and enable others to produce vaccines of the same quality standard.  CTAP would facilitate that.  If we had more vaccines, we could deliver more vaccines.  That would mean more people could be vaccinated and, it is to be hoped, reduce the number of new variants emerging.  I will not speak on that.  I am sure others can speak later on it.</p> <p>  On whether there is excess capacity in the system, we have looked at some of the research produced by other groups such as Knowledge Ecology International, KEI.  It suggested that there is untapped potential.  We know there are various different pharmaceutical companies, including in Ireland, who could facilitate and help with the production of vaccines.  In recent times, some pharmaceutical companies have entered into voluntary licensing deals where they have agreed to help in the production of vaccines.  For example, as far as I am aware, Pfizer and BioNTech recently reached an agreement with Sanofi to help to increase its production.  We are calling for more of this. </p> <p>  Reference was made to shareholders.  The traditional shareholder model involves a focus on profit.  Some of the work we are now doing suggests that a small group of shareholders see themselves as stewards of resources.  Actions are being taken in other countries, such as the US, where there have been shareholder motions, in particular in a pandemic context, to state that profits should not be the main priority and instead other goals such as delivering global equitable access should be prioritised.</p><p>We must consider who the shareholders are, which in some cases are pension fund or investment companies.  There is potential for the public to leverage their voices by saying that in this pandemic we must see a change and the sharing of intellectual property and data to facilitate this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.551" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Winnie Byanyima" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#L00200"><p>I will reply to some of the questions that were raised.  There was a question about refugees and internally displaced people, whether they will be catered for, and if not, whether the communities of refugees and internally displaced people could turn out hosting new and dangerous variants of the virus.  This is the case but there are some good practices.  For example, in Jordan, one in every four people is a refugee.  It is rolling out its vaccination programme to include refugees and it has the support of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  We also heard from the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies last week, which launched a plan to help vaccinate 500 million people globally.  There is a need to pay attention to those people with weak citizenship rights and have them vaccinated.</p> <p>  We have looked carefully at the question of capacity in the People's Vaccine Alliance, estimating that the three biggest vaccine producers - Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford AstraZeneca - are producing enough vaccines for only 1.5% of the global population, which tells us how small is the supply.  We are looking at how much capacity is being used by the other big vaccine producers.  When we started probing, we saw some of the production companies moving very fast to try to conclude agreements with some of the major vaccine producers in Europe and America to license them.  They have really been holding on to their technology and know-how to first try to scoop as much profit as possible before they license others.  That is why we need the pressure.</p> <p>  The capacity is there and we will estimate those figures.  This capacity is not only in Europe and North America.; there is also capacity in the emerging economies.  There is huge capacity in India, with some companies licensed to produce the AstraZeneca vaccine, for example.  There are other Indian producers with capacity that is sitting there.  There is also capacity in Indonesia, China, Russia and so on.  There is capacity and we will estimate those figures but we must put pressure on those companies.</p> <p>  I also wanted to speak to the question of the pandemic being really more devastating than HIV/AIDS.  I agree.  In developing countries like ours in Africa, the economic devastation is worse than the health devastation.  For some reason our people have not had as many deaths or even infections as in Europe.  Perhaps it is because the populations are younger or we have suffered many infectious diseases previously but nobody knows yet.  Infection rates are lower and deaths are fewer.  Nevertheless, the economies had to be closed completely so the economic devastation is huge.  People have lost jobs and their income so they have nothing to eat.  It is devastating.  The need to recover is global and this pandemic is more damaging than HIV.  Every life is important.</p> <p>  Many countries and governments support CTAP, but they have not yet signed up to the Costa Rica resolution.</p><p>I think that has to do with some fear of the pharmaceutical companies because this is now about survival of the fittest and booking supplies with a few companies.  I suspect that some governments did not show up to sign up to the common technology access pool because that would be seen as perhaps "anti" the pharmaceutical companies.  I suspect one is seen as in conflict with the other.  While some governments have signed on to the People's Vaccine Alliance and the People's Vaccine Alliance is demanding support for C-TAP, the same governments have not signed up to C-TAP or the Costa Rica resolution.  That tells us they will sign onto the People's Vaccine Alliance, which is campaigning for C-TAP, but they will not go to the WHO pool.  Something there suggests that one is in conflict with the other.</p></speech>

I am pleased that we are joined this morning by Dr. David Nabarro, the special envoy on Covid-19 from the World Health Organization.  I thank Dr. Nabarro for joining us.  I trust that he will make a brief submission to our committee and will be in a position to stay with us until approximately 12 noon.  Several members have offered for questions.  I am pleased that Dr. Nabarro has joined us for this formal public session and I call on him to commence his contribution.</p></speech>

There is a requirement as we go into the evidence process for me to state that, although this is a formal meeting of the committee, my representation of the WHO has to be seen as informal.  It cannot be, we respectfully suggest, an alternative to the formal governance process of the WHO through the UN World Health Assembly or other similar mechanisms.</p> <p>  I wish to start by acknowledging the incredible work being done by Dr. Kieran Harkin, Dr. Aisling McMahon and Ms Winnie Byanyima.  I may have got the order wrong but that was the order I was given.  What the committee has been hearing this morning is really important.  I was proud to be able to join and hear Dr. McMahon and Ms Winnie Byanyima talking and explaining their points of view, and I am pleased indeed to be here.</p> <p>  I want to talk about three things.  The first is Covid-19 and the pandemic.  The second is the way in which efforts are being made to improve access to vaccine through something called COVAX, which the contributors have been describing.  The third thing I want to talk about is improving access to technologies through initiatives like the People's Vaccine initiative and C-TAP.</p> <p>  We will start with the pandemic.  I imagine everyone in Ireland knows but perhaps I will say it again.  This pandemic is nowhere near finished.  This is nowhere near the end.  Some people say there is light at the end of the tunnel but from my point of view, I am not sure how far away that light is.  I have no idea how long it will take to reach the end of the tunnel.  I am prepared to say to committee members that I believe there are some really difficult and rocky periods ahead of the world to get through it.</p> <p>  This is a new virus that has appeared and entered into the human ecosystem, just as HIV did some decades ago.  The world needs to adapt to a new virus.  That adaptation process takes time, especially given that the virus will change.  Humanity's response to the virus will change as well.  The adaptation will be continuous.  Right now, we are in a phase where the incidence of reported new cases of Covid-19 in Europe has gone into a decline.</p><p>This is in particular since the beginning of January and is super-welcome news.  It has gone into decline because of the extraordinary effort by the people of Europe and, increasingly, the people of North America to take this virus seriously by maintaining physical distancing, wearing face protection, practising incredible hygiene, self-isolating when ill and protecting the most vulnerable.  These are the tried-and-tested measures through which people can reduce their risk.  That has to be accompanied with well functioning public health systems that can detect people with the disease, enable them to isolate in a decent way, trace their contacts and enable those contacts to isolate and, when necessary, deal rapidly and robustly with outbreaks that occur.</p><p> These are big shifts happening in humanity.  We are all working out how to come to terms with it.  We have had various moments when we have been able to learn: the first acceleration in March and April of last year; the second acceleration at the end of the summer months of last year; and the dramatic third acceleration towards the end of last year and over the new year period.  We have been learning such a great deal, perhaps most importantly that the virus is the adversary and people are the solution.  There is a requirement to enable people to be strong, connected and empowered to fight the virus despite the fact that this entails massive social and economic dislocation.  It hits poor people the worst and it often hits people who have different ethnicity from the dominant ethnicity in western European countries the worst.  Dealing with Covid in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe means empowering people to respond and enabling those most affected, particularly the poorest and those with least access to resources, to be strong.</p><p> Having said that, there are ways in which it is possible to help people.  The ways to help include all those I have mentioned and now we can add vaccines.  Who should be receiving vaccines now?  In our view, it is clear that it should be the people who are at risk: older people and people with simultaneous illnesses; and those who are most exposed to the virus, namely, people dealing with Covid in their professional work all the time, particularly in healthcare, residential care, dentistry or other professions where one is in contact with the exhalations of people with the virus.  If the vaccine is helpful in protecting people, there is one priority for the world, as stated clearly by the Director-General of the WHO and the Secretary-General of the UN.  That priority is to make sure everybody in need of the vaccine can access it on the basis of need first, not on the basis of geographical location or nationality.  Right now, the people who must be a priority for any vaccine are health workers, older people and people with concomitant illness, wherever they live.</p><p> That is why at the request of the different member states of the WHO, the COVAX scheme was set up as part of the access to Covid-19 tools, ACT, accelerator.  COVAX is a scheme to enable the pooled purchase of vaccines at a negotiated price, ideally a low price.  The vaccines can then be made available to countries to purchase with their own funds or, if their GDP is low, to purchase with aid funds.  It is an advance purchase scheme like what we have used for other vaccines around the world to enable everybody to get the lowest possible price.  By negotiating with the producers, we are able through COVAX to get the price low.  In order for that to work, there has to be vaccine in the system and there is not enough for COVAX to work right now.</p><p>Anybody who criticises COVAX needs to be clear about what he or she is criticising.  Is it that it does not have enough vaccine coming through or is it because it has design flaws?  At the moment, the people who run COVAX tell me they want more vaccine in, which means, first, expediting the regulatory approval of existing vaccines that are currently on the edge of COVAX but not in it because COVAX can distribute only vaccines that have an emergency use licence from the WHO advisory committee on vaccination.  Second, we have to get some of the new vaccines properly into the COVAX portfolio, that is, the ones that use messenger RNA.  These are very exciting vaccines.  At the moment, they have to be kept super cold, which makes them a real challenge to use, but the technology will improve and we have to get them in.</p><p> Third, countries that have purchased their own vaccine through bilateral deals and have some to spare should give it to COVAX immediately.  It should become a movement everywhere that whenever there is some spare, it is given over.  The key question is what is spare.  My colleagues and I are asking whether, given the current availability of vaccines, any country should be planning to vaccinate all its adults against Covid or whether they should carry out vaccination of the at-risk groups and then share the rest with COVAX so that it can go to other countries where it is needed.  Moreover, COVAX needs to take on new products and new vaccine production needs to come in.</p><p> Another key question is what is the hold-up.  What could allow there to be more vaccines?  I certainly agree that the resolution produced by Costa Rica before last year's World Health Assembly, which led to the C-TAP proposal and the associated medicines patent pool being set up, is very important.  It is a mechanism that has worked for voluntary licensing for vaccines and treatments for other products, and it is surely the right way to go in the long term.  In the meantime, let us try at least to get existing schemes working as effectively as possible while, at the same time, exploring possibilities for upgrading the C-TAP system.  To get vaccines moving now, we need not only more vaccines coming in but also to scale up the potential of different manufacturers working to the full.  When that happens, each scale-up has to be individually licensed by the WHO system.  That is absolutely essential for quality assurance, safety and efficacy.  Let us ensure that all the approval processes happen quickly.</p><p> It will not be possible to get vaccines into the arms of people everywhere without an enormous global support programme for vaccine administration throughout the world.  Without that, we might end in the embarrassing scenario of vaccines becoming available more and more, particularly during 2021, with the inability to implement them.  For polio, we have had to have a global immunisation programme, while for measles and other childhood illnesses, there are strong global programmes.  There will need to be the global support of countries so that they can implement the vaccines.</p><p> Some of that is available through COVAX but, frankly, I know from experience that the world will have to get behind poorer countries to help them carry out their immunisation programmes.  That is where we will need continued commitment from the G7, the G20, the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly and other global bodies to ensure that the money moves.  That is absolutely the key.  Colleagues have made that point and I endorse it.  COVAX will work if it gets the support it needs from rich countries; it will fail if countries go round the back, do not give it enough money or discredit it.  Let us work together to make COVAX a success.  In the longer term, let us use the C-TAP system and other medicine patent pools to increase the availability of supplies in poor countries where they are needed.</p></speech>

Before we return to questions, I remind members that the clock is ticking and we have to conclude our deliberations by 12 noon, in accordance with the Covid-restricted atmosphere in our Parliament.  I will group the questions, therefore, which I am sure they will assent to.</p><p>I will call Senator Joe O'Reilly, to be followed by Deputy Berry and Deputy Gannon, and will then come back to the panel.  The four witnesses are now in attendance.  On the next round, I will start with Deputy Clarke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.559" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1692" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#P00200"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I will do my best to heed his suggestion that members try to be efficient.  I welcome the witnesses.  I congratulate Dr. Harkin and Dr. McMahon on their voluntary and moral leadership.  It is important.  I also congratulate Ms Byanyima.  It was great to hear from Dr. Nabarro as well.</p> <p>  As I stated at a previous committee meeting, it is interesting that we have a case where self-interest and the morally correct thing to do coincide.  They often do not coincide, but in this instance they do.  As Dr. Mike Ryan would say, no one is safe until everyone is safe.  It is very scary that 2.3 million people have died globally.  Dr. Nabarro's interpretation of the future is also frightening.  The economic cost of &euro;3.4 trillion per year is shocking.  Basically, we need the global south, the developing world and all other parts of the world to be on board.  As the world is now a global village, one cannot assume that because what are, from our perspective, isolated areas are not covered, we are safe.  As a result of the prevalence of travel, we are not safe.  The issue of variants then arises.</p> <p>  I refer to two stark and frightening figures.  The first is that it will be 2023 before several countries are looked after.  The other figure, if I picked it up correctly - I may be corrected if I did not - is that only 1.5% of the global population would be covered by the existing supply of vaccines.  Those are stark figures.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Stanton, raised the issue of capacity.  We should have reassurance in that regard.  I intuitively think there would be far more capacity available if there was a will to use it, but I would like to hear more on the issue.  Ireland now has a particular role in the context of the UN.  The Government must join and sign up to the international statements on this issue and use our position in the EU and the UN.  </p> <p>  I recently had a discussion with the Palestinian ambassador to Ireland.  She explained that the Palestinian people have particular difficulties with access.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.  Of course, that links to the issue of refugees.  It is obvious that where there is a density of people, such as in refugee settlements, etc., and indeed in places such as Gaza, there is a greater spread.  I would like the comments of the panel on that but I think it is a pretty basic point.  One assumes the spread is more difficult to halt in the normal ways.  </p> <p>  I ask Dr. Nabarro to address the issue of the Russian vaccines and what is happening there.  I have been told that the Russian vaccine is very effective.  We in this western part of Europe do not know much about it.  I ask him to comment on that issue and how the vaccine is being used internationally.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the issue of capacity and the Palestinian question specifically.</p> <p>  I was here all day yesterday, when there was a full Seanad sitting at which many important issues were discussed.  I am sure many important issues were also discussed in the D&aacute;il in recent days.  However, without being ridiculous or melodramatic, I believe this is probably the most important meeting that has been held in these buildings for many months.  The issue we are discussing is the most serious in terms of morality, expediency, the economy of the world and the lives of people.  This is of mammoth importance.  I am certainly unequivocal in my support of what our guests are doing.  I am very proud to have the opportunity to say that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1587" speakername="Cathal Berry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#P00300"><p>I thank our guests for their very informed commentary and testament.  As a Member of Parliament hundreds of whose constituents are currently deployed overseas as UN peacekeepers in resource-poor countries and are themselves awaiting vaccination, I can completely identify with the issues the witnesses have highlighted and rightly raised this morning.</p><p>The case they put forward is compelling.  They have our full attention in Dublin this morning.</p><p> I have three questions.  First, while the case the witnesses made is compelling, is there any way we can strengthen it further.  For the benefit of the committee, maybe one or two of the panel could outline diseases for which the patents on vaccines or medications have been waived in the past.  If there was a list of diseases for which medicine patents had been waived in the past, it would certainly strengthen their case because precedents are important.  Second, have the three pharmaceutical companies that make Covid vaccines formally declined to become involved or are we still awaiting a response?</p><p> My third question is perhaps a technical one to which the witnesses may not have an answer.  When countries in the EU signed up to this new mechanism, the C-TAP, that has been described, did their minister for health sign off on it or was there a motion on the floor of parliament?  What technical mechanism was used?  Is there a document to sign or does one merely have a press conference and make a formal pledge across the airwaves?</p><p> I will summarise my questions.  Have the pharmaceutical companies formally said "Yes" or "No" at this stage?  What technical mechanism was used at parliamentary level to sign up to the pledge?  Is there a list of diseases for which vaccine or medication patents have been waived before they had elapsed?</p></speech>

I will keep my questions brief.</p> <p>  My first question pertains to wealthier countries which are hoarding vaccines.  Canada, a high-income country, currently has enough vaccines to vaccinate its population several times over, yet it is hoarding some of its vaccines.  It still intends to secure 1.9 million vaccines through the COVAX system.  Will the witnesses comment on wealthier nations hoarding vaccines?  What can we do to stop that practice and what will be the outcome if it persists?</p> <p>  As part of the COVAX initiative, pharmaceutical companies have pledged that no country will receive vaccines for more than 20% of the population until every country has enough supply to vaccinate 20% of its population.  Currently, we are well off target, with 16% of the world's population having received 60% of the vaccine supply.  Pfizer has only supplied 2% of its vaccines to COVAX.  I ask Ms Byanyima or Dr. Nabarro what steps are being taken to ensure that pharmaceutical companies fulfil their pledges to the COVAX initiative.</p> <p>  Many international NGOs, including M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, have called for a relaxation of intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines and technologies to ensure the scaling up of production and access in the global south.  What steps should the Government be taking, be that independently, as part of the EU or through our role on the UN Security Council, to press pharmaceutical companies to open up intellectual property or support initiatives such as the C-TAP?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.564" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#Q00400"><p>Perhaps we will start with Dr. Harkin, who has not contributed for some time.  Members asked a number of specific questions.  I ask that we focus to some extent on Ireland's role, as highlighted by Deputy Gannon.  Dr. McMahon spoke of the Government's leverage in this matter.  Having regard to the fact that we are all agreed that the concept of vaccine nationalism is somewhat disturbing, what role could Ireland have, as a member of the EU, UN and UN Security Council?  I suggest we address the questions posed by members under that umbrella.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.565" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran Harkin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#Q00500"><p>In reply to some of Deputy O'Reilly's questions on capacity, it is worth bearing in mind that this time last year, there were no Covid vaccines available.</p><p>We have come a long way in a relatively short time.  While the mRNA vaccine is a very sophisticated vaccine, some of the advantages are that it can be produced quite quickly and the manufacturing set-up can be done in a relatively short time, within three months.  It is interesting that Knowledge Ecology International, KEI, an international organisation, has identified more than 100 plants capable of producing Covid vaccine.  Six of those are in Ireland, four from Merck, which had attempted to develop its own vaccine which failed recently.  Two of the plants are in Cork, one in Carlow and one in Swords. </p><p> On what Ireland should do on the waiver on the national stage, our priority would be for Ireland to support CETA but we would also suggest that the waiver or the suspension of intellectual property rights in relation to Covid-19 products as proposed by the Indian and South African governments also warrants support.</p><p> On when a patent has been suspended and used from before, it has happened a number of times.  It is what brought an end to the HIV epidemic in Africa when the pharmaceutical industry and the governments which support them caved in under pressure and relented and allowed HIV drugs to be produced and manufactured generically.  Notable times this happened was when the US Government was threatened by anthrax and overnight brought in a law lifting patents on ciprofloxacin, the only antibiotic that would have been effective.  There are other examples which I do not have to hand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.567" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aisling McMahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#R00200"><p>This is a situation where the self-interested, pragmatic, and moral things to do are the same.  Unless we get more vaccines to more people globally and equitably, it is not in anyone's interest.  It is correct to emphasise that.</p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. Harkin, spoke on the capacity issues.  We also know there is capacity because we see the pipeline of vaccines.  We see other companies are working on vaccines, both mRNA and other vaccines.  Thankfully, there is a great number of them, which indicates capacity.</p> <p>  Given that there has not been voluntary sharing or co-operation, there is a need to share intellectual property.  To get that, some countries propose that there would be a waiver or a suspension of intellectual property.  The preference would be for companies simply to share but if that is not achieved, there has to be support for mechanisms such as the waiver.</p> <p>  The AIDS HIV crisis is one example of where intellectual property has been relaxed.  There was ongoing petitioning from civil society organisations and developing countries for years.  Several years were lost while that petitioning was going on because it simply was not being heard.  Eventually it led to an announcement and a declaration under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, which is the overarching laws on intellectual property, that public health would also have to be prioritised and that intellectual property would have to be used in a way that was compatible.  There are certain measures within that framework that allow, for example, for compulsory licences for a certain period of time which would allow a third party to make a drug without the intellectual property holder's permission.  That is perfectly legal and provided for within TRIPS under certain circumstances.  It was one of the key mechanisms during the HIV AIDS crisis that facilitated access.  It was 7 February 2001, so 20 years ago nearly to the day, that Cipla, the Indian generic company, made the announcement, and it was such a striking announcement, that it could produce HIV-AIDS antiretrovirals for less than $1 a day.</p><p>That was a game changer in this context.</p><p> Since then, the Medicines Patent Pool, which is the body that works with C-TAP, has produced generic products for more than 141 countries worldwide.  On top of this, some of the statistics from the Medicines Patent Pool suggest that those generic products have facilitated 38.75 million patient years of treatment.  Those generic products are being facilitated through the pooling of IP and they work for HIV-AIDS but also hepatitis C, TB and various other diseases.  The pooling of intellectual property rights is a system that has worked before.  C-TAP in particular is, in our view, a key mechanism.  Not only does it share IP, but in the vaccine context it shares know-how and know-how is particularly crucial for producing these vaccines.  We call on companies and governments to support this.</p><p> On the question regarding whether companies have refused to sign up to C-TAP, I cannot answer that.  It is not my knowledge that they have refused.  I do not have that information to hand.  I would encourage companies to consider supporting this and countries to encourage companies to support these initiatives.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.570" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David Nabarro" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#S00300"><p>I will answer as best I can.  The WHO has had a number of exchanges with the manufacturers of the Russian vaccine, the Gamaleya company, and it is continuing to seek from the very co-operative Russian manufacturers all the data that are needed for an emergency use authorisation.  It is complex.  For this process to go through, first one has to look at the vaccine and the results of the phase 1, 2 and 3 trials of the vaccine.  Second, under the WHO rules that have been approved and requested by the national Governments of the member states of the WHO, a certificate of good manufacturing practice is requested from the manufacturer.  All of these issues are being looked at.  In regard to other vaccines that are going through this system, I cannot tell the committee when the effort will be completed.  In regard to Gamaleya and Sputnik V, this is a work in progress that is being done with the greatest possible speed while at the same time maintaining the requirements for quality assurance, safety and efficacy.</p> <p>  Senator Joe O'Reilly asked about ensuring access for refugees and other disadvantaged people.  It is important to stress that the COVAX scheme has been designed such that it includes capacity to ensure that when vaccines are available they get to disadvantaged and refugee communities.  Deputy Berry asked about the situation where patents have been waived, to which I think Dr. McMahon gave a pretty good answer.  I do not want to add to it.  In 2002, I was working with the director general WHO and the Secretary General of the UN.  The key issue is that company CEOs came to us.  As a result of an environment which created some pressure, they came to us and I recall that eight of them said they were going to find a way to reduce their prices and to deal with the various concerns raised previously around doing so.  The rest is history.  What a transformative change.</p> <p>  On the question regarding whether pharma companies have agreed to voluntary licensing in regard to Covid vaccines, the answer is that they have.  The agreement between AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India or between Sanofi and BioNTech are examples of where this is happening.  The key question that we all need to ask is what can be done to speed up things and make sure that the right amount of vaccines are available.</p><p> That brings me to Deputy Gannon's questions.  He asked if wealthy countries were hoarding vaccines.  I checked that with people who have the answers when I was getting briefed for today's meeting.  It is not that wealthy countries have got a lot of vaccine.  In fact, each of the wealthy countries that has a mass vaccination programme under way, including the United Kingdom and countries in the European Union, are short of vaccine.  They are worried about supplies because they have made advance purchase commitments, which means they got an option on vaccine with the manufacturers but there is such competition for supplies among governments that have made pledges to vaccinate large proportions of their population as well as those who have made pledges to support COVAX.  There is a terrible competition under way and I cannot underestimate the severity of this competition.  One just has to look at newspapers in European countries right now to see, for example, the frustration being expressed towards European leaders that there is not more vaccine becoming available.  That is creating a competition with COVAX.  Quite simply, that is what is happening now.  It is because the countries that are committed to vaccinating all their populations for the very good reason that they see this as the best way out of the pandemic are putting such huge pressure on the very limited supply that availability of COVAX is always in question.  That is our difficulty.</p><p> Deputy Gannon brought up this point by asking if wealthy countries are hoarding.  I do not want to use the term "hoarding" but they are certainly putting immense demands on the manufacturers in the current vaccine shortage to take vaccines away from COVAX so that they can fulfil pledges they have made to their citizens for widespread vaccination.  This situation is very difficult.  If a political leader has said his or her people will be vaccinated and after they have done the people most at risk - the health workers - they will go to teachers, then first-line responders like ambulance workers and then essential personnel like security guards, who have a lot of contact with people and we know have a higher incidence, it can be seen that the political pressure in Europe is huge, yet at the same time here are we, with COVAX, saying, as we have heard even in what has been going on here today, that the situation for health workers in poor countries is desperate.  Thousands of health workers have died as a result of Covid-19 in the past year.  Yes, we want to protect these health workers but there is this terrible conundrum, and I believe everybody sees it.  Unfortunately, increasing the licensing and using the Medicines Patent Pool and C-TAP will not deal with the acute problem right now.  The problem right now is that there is limited capacity.  We are in a shortage situation.  It should get better in the coming weeks and months but the competition for this small amount of vaccine right now is huge.</p><p> Deputy Gannon's question, and I do not want to answer it exactly as written, was how to get Pfizer to fulfil its responsibilities to COVAX.  Pfizer has got responsibilities to a number of different groups which have made advance purchase agreements.  It has also got shortages of production because, when vaccines are being produced, things do not work smoothly.  Batches go wrong.  Whole batches have to be thrown away.  Pfizer has licensed the Serum Institute of India, a Korean company.  It has also got its own plants in Europe and they are not all able to produce what is needed.  Given the demand that is coming, often backed by lawyers from European governments and from the European Union as well as from the UK and, I am sure, from other countries in the world, and it is building up, it is super hard to understand precisely what is going on.</p><p>One concern is that COVAX works if there is transparency about pricing, delivery dates and to what degree the company is able to say that it did its best but could not deliver.  Right now, we do not have full transparency, which makes life difficult.</p><p> In response to Deputy Gannon, the lack of transparency makes this difficult.  What steps should the Government take to support the matters we are talking about?  Everything that has been said in the chamber is right.  This requires political action, not just within the nation but also across Europe and through the UN Security Council.  There is a core question that comes back to members here, representing the Irish people, which is what the Irish people want.  My colleague, Dr. Mike Ryan, who is the greatest Irishman working on infectious diseases, works as head of emergencies at the WHO.  He talked to me last weekend as I was preparing and said that it is difficult because politicians believe that it is their job to always fight for the interests of their constituents, which, right now, is for as many people as possible to be vaccinated with a safe, effective and functional vaccine as quickly as possible.</p><p> Is there any way that we can get a message to politicians that perhaps the population of Ireland is prepared to look at an alternative proposition, which is for high-risk people in Ireland to be vaccinated now with whatever spare vaccines are available being shared with other countries in the world so that they can vaccinate their high-risk population?  Once we have all high-risk populations vaccinated, then we can complete the vaccination of the adult population.  This is a political dilemma.  I do not know how one gets to know the mood of the population but there surely needs to be a test of what the people of Ireland and other European countries want right now, whether it is fairness for the world or trying to get as much vaccine as possible for people in the country.</p></speech>

While as politicians, the likelihood is that we will seek to prioritise our constituents, we know, as has been said here this morning and repeatedly over the last weeks and months, that nobody is safe until everybody is safe and that it is not a question of engaging in a type of vaccine nationalism.  Unless the EU, US and UN work together to ensure that everybody is lifted and has access to vaccinations, then our constituents will not be safe themselves.</p></speech>

I find it morally reprehensible for any pharmaceutical company to engage in extortion of poorer countries by price gouging.  I cannot think of a worse action by any company at a time like this.  Dr. Nabarro is correct that people are the solution, but we will only be the solution if we are willing to take on the role of being global champions and ensuring equal and proper access to all vaccines and treatments used to save the lives of those affected by Covid.</p> <p>  There is another issue that has not been touched on.  EU member states, like other countries, have contributed billions of euro and dollars to the pharmaceutical companies over past years, through taxpayer funds, research and development funds or other tax breaks.</p><p>This is not the time for anybody to be getting into a bickering match over intellectual property rights; it is the time to simply step up, stick on the big girl pants and do the right thing.</p><p> My questions are quite simple.  One concerns C-TAP and COVAX.  In the opening statement, 2023 was given as the year when people in some poorer countries will be vaccinated.  Is there a tipping point whereby that target could be moved out further or brought closer depending on the level of buy-in to C-TAP?  Other contributors have spoken about manufacturers refusing to engage.  Have manufacturers been asked to engage?  Have potential producers in other countries being directly asked to sign up to and support the programme?</p><p> On the companies based in Ireland that could manufacture the vaccine, do we know whether there is a relatively available supply of what they would need to facilitate their doing so?  I believe there are half a dozen such companies.  What engagement has taken place with them to determine whether they would come on board to engage in manufacturing if the conditions were right?</p><p> I understand certain countries have either overbought or over-ordered based on their populations.  I stand to be corrected but I believe New Zealand either over-ordered or overbought not for its own population but for neighbouring territories that may not have been best placed to order for themselves.  Is this a global trend?  Is there more evidence of this solidarity or is New Zealand very much an isolated case?  Of the countries that have over-ordered or overbought, how many have made an offer under the COVAX system?</p><p> We have touched on conflict zones, refugee movement and the vital job the Red Cross is doing.  Regarding occupied territories, who is present to ensure people were most vulnerable are vaccinated?</p></speech>

It strikes me that the appalling mix of the animal instincts of capitalism is meeting up with competitive races.  The competitive race is not just that towards vaccination as it concerns individuals themselves.  As an individual sitting here, I watch every day to see how close my age group is to the next stage of vaccine roll-out in Ireland.  That is human nature.  All of us want to be vaccinated.  We want all the vaccines to be shared equally, but not just now.  It is a case of saying, "I am all for it.  As soon as I have been vaccinated, let us get the rest of the world vaccinated."  That is a human response.  The animal instincts of capitalism are driven by the ownership of the intellectual property rights.  When we talk about declaring something a global public good, we are saying to the shareholders of the drugs companies and manufacturers that we do not want them to have super-normal profits, which is what they normally earn from the development of a drug of one type or another.  There are two ways of dealing with that.  One is that national governments would tax the shareholders to take the super-normal profits off them in order that the drug could be redistributed globally along the global network, but that is highly unlikely to happen because we are politicians and we ultimately answer to our local constituencies.  The other solution, therefore, is that we cough up and pay the super-normal profits to the manufacturers to have a free licence throughout the world to get manufacturing done.  I would be interested in the panel&rsquo;s view on that.</p> <p>  We have heard about occupied territories and war-torn areas around the world such as Syria and Yemen.</p><p>Where a totalitarian government is in place, do the witnesses believe, or is there any evidence to suggest, the denial of access to a vaccine may become another form of human rights abuse?</p><p> The other terrible term I heard this morning, which is quite frightening and I believe is happening in the United States, is "vaccine chasing".  People are moving from one geographical area to another because the roll-out of the vaccine is faster in the second area.  I am quite concerned about that.</p><p> I must ask this question today with respect to Covid-19.  Part of the argument or solution is vaccination, the other part is in testing.  There is a reluctance in Ireland to use antigen testing, which many European countries have taken up and are using to see schools and manufacturing plants open up.  What is the panel's view on the antigen roll-out?</p><p> The final question goes back to the issue of interpersonal competition for vaccine.  My colleague, Deputy Berry, referred to Defence Forces personnel who are going into extremely testing conditions.  Under normal circumstances, they are exposed to all sorts of infections, but in this particular instance they are exposed to Covid-19 on top of everything else.  I fully support what Deputy Berry is talking about.  Yesterday, however, we had a debate in this Chamber on special education.  The question arose as to whether those who are on the front line and will have to visit five or six houses a week now qualify as front-line workers.  The quite natural instinct is to stretch out the definition in order that we can bring more groups under the term "front-line workers".  I would love to hear from the panel as to how we might tie down what in fact constitutes a front-line worker and then work to that definition.</p></speech>

Having discussed it with my Seanad colleague, Senator Higgins, I know she would have intended to ask this question if she could were it not for the Covid-19 restrictions.  She understands and appreciates that.</p> <p>  Building on Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s question to our panel, there are public health concerns internationally, specifically around Israel's unequal distribution of vaccines and access to vaccines for Palestinians in the occupied territories.  As our panel will know, the Palestinian human rights group, Al-Haq, joined by more than 100 Palestinian human rights and civil society organisations, called Israel's vaccine policy discriminatory and unlawful due to its complete disregard for its obligations toward Palestinian healthcare.  I believe one of our earlier contributors spoke to global apartheid with regard to the vaccines.  Article 56 of the Fourth Geneva Convention stipulates that the occupier has a duty to ensure the application of necessary preventive measures to combat the spread of diseases and epidemics.</p> <p>  So far, more than 172,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories have tested positive for Covid-19 and there have been more than 1,900 deaths.  As other members have said, I note the Government is contributing to COVAX.  In keeping with the Chairman's advice, however, I have a specific question.  Not least in the context of Ireland's often-cited and often-lauded soft power on the global stage, whether that is in the context the of the EU, UN, the Security Council or our historic and long-standing links with North America, will the panel give us their views on what more could be done specifically by Ireland and this State to support Palestinian equitable access to vaccinations?</p></speech>

In the past we have seen, for example, UN-convened and sponsored pledging conferences where money has been raised on the international stage.  My understanding is that up to approximately $40 billion will be required to secure in excess of 2 billion vaccines.</p><p>Is there optimism, for example, or any signs coming from the US where the Biden Administration might wish to see the manifestation of its engagement on the multilateral stage?  How soon does this need to happen?  Are there signs that it is happening?  If there is a pledging conference, how do we ensure that the pledges are ultimately implemented and given?</p><p> We may not get a further round.  I would like to hear concluding remarks from Dr. Harkin, Dr. McMahon and Dr. Nabarro.  Deputy Clarke has indicated.  I will let her in with a very quick, specific and brief question.</p></speech>

What stage is that at?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.583" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aisling McMahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021020900002#X00400"><p>On the current state of affairs with the TRIPS waiver proposal, this was discussed before Christmas.  If my recollection serves me right, it was put forward by countries in October and it has been discussed since then.  There were informal discussions again, I think, last week, and as far as I am aware there will be further discussions.  In March, there will be more discussions within the formal meeting context on the TRIPS situation, so it is still ongoing.</p> <p>  In response to some of the other questions, the C-TAP initiative is a voluntary system.  It does not suspend and instead encourages companies to share their intellectual property rights.  They retain those rights.  It is also a non-exclusive system so they would still be able to have licensing agreements.  That is the key difference between the two.  The other difference is that C-TAP encourages the sharing of know-how, which is crucial within the vaccine context.  Both of those measures are ongoing and, as we have said, both are ones that we support.</p> <p>  On the first question that Deputy Clarke asked about the figures that we mentioned earlier of nine out of ten people not being able to get vaccines, and some of those figures are for Oxfam and other groups, our hope is that is based on projections around the current vaccine situation.  We hope that with agreements like C-TAP or, indeed, if more companies are willing to engage in voluntary licensing, that would either increase the capacity, because we are going to have more and more manufacturers producing these vaccines, or it would build capacity.  It would mean new manufacturers coming on board to produce those vaccines.  Our hope is that that would then increase the numbers available and bring the figures down, thus making sure we have a more equitable spread because, essentially, the aim is to produce more and have more manufacturers doing more.</p> <p>  In terms of IP, that currently is tricky.  If companies have intellectual property and if they are not sharing the know-how, then other manufacturers cannot come on board because it would be in breach of intellectual property rights, but also they may not have the know-how to do that.  They need the know-how and the sharing.</p> <p>  On who else supports or whether any pharmaceutical companies support the C-TAP measure, there is news that 18 generic companies, that is, 18 companies that could produce generic products, have come on board and are supportive of the C-TAP arrangement.  As I have said, I am not aware of the current picture and to what extent they are coming on board, although I am sure they are, and there are negotiations between the WHO and the pharmaceutical companies that have some of the rights at the moment.  Certainly, generic companies are coming on board, and the latest figure is that there are 18 companies that are generic producers and that are willing to do that.</p> <p>  In terms of Senator Craughwell's questions, one was very important as it mentioned the idea of human rights.  This is something we have touched on briefly.  It has to be said and must be emphasised, however, that there is a human right to life and there is also a human right to health protected both under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and under international agreements such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  All countries that are party to those would have obligations to protect and promote human rights, and not just a legal obligation, although clearly there is one, but also a moral obligation in terms of these issues.</p> <p>  I know, given the time, we may not get the opportunity to say more on the following, so we would like to thank the committee again today, but one of the things that I would ask for is that there would be consideration given to or discussion of formal endorsement of C-TAP.  It is very important.  Others have mentioned Ireland's place on the international stage.  It is not enough just to support C-TAP.  We certainly support that and hope that the Government would do that, but also, if possible and ideally, the Government should be advocating for C-TAP and other mechanisms at an international level, particularly at the  EU level but also, given its role internationally in terms of the UN Security Council, being an advocate and being a part of that.</p><p>The other thing is to encourage other pharmaceutical companies to join.  Some companies, it must be said, have already engaged in and entered into voluntary licensing deals and I know this has been mentioned.  These include Pfizer and BioNTech with Sanofi, AstraZeneca with the Serum Institute of India.  More of that needs to happen and C-TAP, if they supported it, could facilitate that at a larger scale.  The idea of whether a D&aacute;il motion might be something that would be possible was also mentioned earlier.  We would particularly welcome a D&aacute;il motion or Seanad motion tabling these types of issues if it was something Members were willing to consider, particularly an endorsement of the C-TAP initiative, but also the other initiatives such as the waiver or other proposals to facilitate equitable global access.</p></speech>

Speaking as a public health professional, as well as an envoy for the WHO, the tipping point is now.  There is no time down the road.  We are watching extraordinary and dramatic damage occurring to the fabric of human society everywhere as a result of Covid.  It is very active now; there are a lot of issues all over the world, including deepening inequities and real frustration and anxiety on the part of millions of people.  Now is the time when the leaders in the rich world must take the initiative and must focus on equity.  All that has been said by Dr. McMahon, Dr. Harkin and Ms Byanyima is so right.  I say do not wait.</p> <p>  The second point is how many countries are doing what New Zealand has done in terms of actually taking advantage of their skills in dealing with Covid and postponing an option they have got on a vaccine?  I have not heard of any others and it is time we had a vaccine solidarity challenge where heads of government, through their legislators, are invited to indicate what are the circumstances under which they will be ready to share.  Of course, they will all say they are worried about variants but the whole world is worried about variants.  Variants can affect poor countries just as badly as they can affect rich ones.  The key thing is to protect those who are most at risk.  The responsibilities of occupiers, as was brought out by Deputy Clarke, and the responsibilities of governments are well set out.  Dr. McMahon is much better qualified than me to talk about it but again, as a public health professional, I am really concerned when groups of people inside a national border are denied, for some reason or other, an opportunity to access a vaccine and I am sure that those who have occupational responsibilities will do everything possible to be transparent about how they are dealing with it.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell raised many points and I got five of them down.  I feel I have the responsibility to deal with the third question, on vaccine sharing.  I stress that one of the things we all must work on at the moment is vaccine hesitancy.  There are people who are not quite sure about whether they want to take the vaccine.  It is really important that in all societies they are given a second, third or fourth chance if they are uncertain when first asked.  Thus I am kind of advocating for a really tolerant approach and for offering people, as I said, a chance to think about things and not requiring them to make a decision now on the basis that otherwise they will not get a chance.</p><p>On testing, I stress that while there are concerns about the reliability and positive predictive value of some of the antigen tests available, the committee should watch this space.  I believe that more reliable rapid tests will come on stream.  That will make such a difference.  We do not talk so much about testing.  I believe that access to rapid and reliable tests is absolutely key to an equitable response.</p><p> On the question of the definition of "front-line personnel", countries could really take advantage of the opportunities they have in the international system through the UN to debate these things.</p><p> The Chairman said something that is very important about the money that is needed.  The Chairman asked where the impetus will come from for a real initiative in this regard.  There have been calls for a vaccine summit involving the new US Administration and perhaps involving the G7.  It is very important that we go beyond just saying there needs to be a summit.  World leaders have got to come together in a constant format to deal with this crisis as a global crisis now.  It cannot be dealt with by individual national leaders working on their own, which is bound to cause terrible problems.  The kinds of issues we are discussing today need solidarity in the responses.  The WHO and the UN Secretary-General are constantly asking for greater and more joined-up leadership by leaders.  I propose not just a summit but a global Covid response programme that deals with all of the issues such as access to tests, access to treatment, access to vaccines, travel issues, the problems of obligations of occupiers and all the other problems we are talking about.  This needs ongoing attention now because we do not know what a failure to deal with Covid in a joined-up way worldwide will lead to.  We do know that 2020 was a year like no other.  Who knows what will happen in 2021 and 2022 if we do not deal with this as the global emergency that it is?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.600" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Robert Landers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020900002#A00700"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to join in today's discussion.  As members are aware, the IHCA represents more than 3,200 hospital consultants, around 95% of the total number in the country.  First, I will address the current staffing situation, including the level of absenteeism.  There is a severe shortage of hospital consultants in our public health service.  We have the lowest number of medical specialists on a population basis in the EU.  We are 41% below the EU average.  We have a serious recruitment and retention crisis, with more than 700 permanent hospital consultant posts vacant or not filled as needed.  This in large part has been caused by a flawed Government decision in 2012 to cut the pay of newly appointed consultants.  Our younger consultants, who are being discriminated against, have been front and centre in providing care in the ongoing Covid crisis.  They have carried an extremely heavy burden of work during this period and will continue to do so.</p> <p>  The leaders of all the parties have agreed that ending the discrimination against consultants appointed since 2012 is essential to attract and retain the number of consultants we need.  The Government's failure to address the recruitment crisis and restore pay parity is bordering on negligence and only serves to exacerbate the extremely challenging task in dealing post Covid with the massive backlogs and waiting lists that are accumulating across all specialties.</p> <p>  In a survey of members last week, more than half said there are moderate or high staff absentee levels that are having an adverse impact on service delivery.  Of the medical and dental staff, we had an absence rate of just 2.3%, around a quarter of the rate of other staff categories.  However, more than half of the absences were due to Covid, which is the largest proportion for any staff category.  The closure of schools is impacting on the availability for work of healthcare workers and it is increasing workloads and stress levels for those at work.</p> <p>  I will move on quickly to Covid transmission within hospitals.  In the survey, around half of all respondents confirmed that improvements are needed to increase the number of single-occupancy rooms and beds in dedicated isolation wards.  Our members also expressed concerns about the lack of regular testing and screening of staff.  In the nine weeks to the end of January, more than 12,000 healthcare workers had been infected with the virus, including more than 560 doctors.</p><p>A total of over 1,400 confirmed cases were linked with hospital outbreaks in the same period.  Four in ten of those infected in the hospital outbreaks were healthcare workers.  Of the 1,400 cases linked with the hospitals, 30 were admitted to the intensive care unit, ICU, and, sadly, 124 died.  When community transmission rates are at such high levels, it is almost inevitable that there will be outbreaks in hospitals.  However, more must be done to prevent Covid infections being acquired in hospital settings.  It is clear for infection control purposes that our pre-Covid bed occupancy rate of around 95% needs to be reduced to between 80% and 85%.  To put that in perspective, this requires approximately 2,000 additional hospital beds to maintain current service levels.</p><p> In terms of long Covid, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association is concerned about the effects of long Covid and believes a HSE policy on long Covid is required for healthcare workers.  Regarding the availability of protective equipment, IHCA members in our survey reported high levels of availability of personal protective equipment, PPE, of an appropriate grade, albeit there are some small glitches at individual sites.  As regards the mental well-being of staff arising from the Covid crisis, a large majority of consultants in our survey said that Covid-19 has had a moderate or severe impact on their workload, general well-being and mental health.  More than one-fifth of respondents are experiencing symptoms of burnout and work-related stress.  Two in five doctors in Ireland now say their mental well-being is worse compared with what it was at the start of the pandemic.  Worryingly, there is a high risk that when the pandemic eases there will be increased mental health issues impacting on our health staff.  Returning to the stressful overstretched business-as-usual model is not an option if we are to avoid an even worse workforce crisis than was the case before Covid-19.</p><p> Regarding additional staffing requirements to deal with the non-Covid backlog, over 70% of our respondents confirmed that low numbers of consultants available to deliver care will have a moderate or severe adverse impact on the capacity to deal with the backlog in non-Covid care.  More than 840,000 people are on some form of hospital waiting list.  With over 700 permanent consultant posts vacant, our acute hospitals are very poorly positioned to provide timely care to patients.  While the Government has committed record funding levels for health in 2021, until this money is channelled effectively and speedily to where it will make the most difference for patients, through the recruitment of additional consultants with supporting teams and infrastructure, public hospitals will continue to have record waiting lists and struggle to address the backlog of treatment due to Covid-19.</p><p> The Government can no longer ignore the fundamental requirement that essential treatment is delivered by consultants and that no amount of investment in hospital services will reduce waiting lists unless we recruit and retain the necessary number of hospital consultants to deliver timely care.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.603" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Owens" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020900002#B00300"><p>There can be no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on our already overstretched front-line health service staff.  In a recent survey that was carried out among the thousands of members of the IMO we sought to determine the exact impact.  The three main impacts cited were preexisting staffing shortages exacerbated by Covid illnesses and requirements to self-isolate; the growing backlog of waiting patients; and the impact on doctors' personal health and wellbeing.  However, we should be under no illusion, as these issues existed long before the pandemic struck.  What is deplorable is that it is now almost one year since the first case of Covid-19 was diagnosed in Ireland, yet no substantial and systemic action has been taken to date to address the crises in recruitment and retention of medical expertise across our health system.</p><p>As a consequence, waiting lists have grown and stress and burnout are prevalent among the medical workforce.  In an as yet unpublished IMO survey, 80% of doctors across all grades cited feelings of depression, anxiety and stress, particularly emotional stress.</p><p> Although public health medicine is the first line of defence we have against Covid-19, we have 60 public health specialists compared to 180 in Scotland and New Zealand where the population is of a similar size and is similarly dispersed.  Public health specialists have the expertise and training to carry out risk assessments and manage and control outbreaks of infection in our healthcare settings and in the wider community and yet public health specialists have still not been provided with a consultant contract and the resources necessary to allow them to carry out their statutory duties.  It beggars belief and should be a cause of considerable shame that these doctors, who are our front line in this battle, had to ballot for industrial action in the midst of a pandemic to have their long-running grievances considered in a serious fashion.</p><p> In the past year, hospital waiting lists have grown by approximately 70,000 or 9% and now stand at 838,000, yet the number of vacant consultant posts or posts filled on a temporary or non-substantive basis has risen to 730, more or less.  The supply of medical specialists simply fails to meet demand.  The HSE itself estimates that we require a minimum of 1,600 additional hospital consultants to meet the needs of our current population.  If we include psychiatry and public health specialists, and we should, the shortfall is closer to 2,000.  Still, however, no concrete measures have been taken to address the twotier pay structure among hospital consultants, which is the major factor contributing to the consultant recruitment and retention crisis.</p><p> There is no doubt that staffing shortages are impacting significantly on the mental health of our medical workforce and we have surveyed to establish that.  Long working hours, excessive workloads, redeployment, requirements to cover for absent colleagues, the inability to get proper rest and take proper breaks and difficulties in accessing childcare are all contributing to high rates of stress and burnout among doctors.  This is particularly evident among non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, or doctors in training, who are seeing their training eroded by Covid-19.  It is also the case among public health specialists where morale is at an all-time low.</p><p> General practice is not without its capacity issues.  Some 600 GPs are due to retire over the next five years while the HSE's national doctors training and planning unit estimates that up to 1,660 additional GPs will be required by 2028.  GPs are encountering difficulties in recruiting additional practice staff and accessing locum cover.  Young GPs are finding it prohibitively expensive to establish themselves and build their own practices.</p><p> What can we do to address these matters?  We must urgently strengthen public health medicine services through the immediate awarding of a consultant contract to  specialists in public health medicine, as recommended by the Crowe Horwath report, the Scally report and the report of the Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel.  We must ensure that adequate risk assessments are carried out across all healthcare settings.  We must complete the vaccination of all front-line healthcare workers as a matter of absolute national priority.  We must ensure that adequate supplies of quality personal protective equipment, PPE, for all front-line healthcare workers are available for hospital and community staff.  We must encourage continued adherence to National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, guidelines through public education campaigns.  All healthcare workers should have access to appropriately resourced and consultant-led occupational health services, including necessary mental health supports.  In addition, all healthcare workers should be aware of their occupational rights and entitlements during this pandemic.  This is not the time for fighting employers; this is the time to be on the same side.</p><p> We cannot hope to address the backlog of nonCovid patients on waiting lists, running at nearly 850,000, without addressing the recruitment and retention crisis as it affects hospital consultants.  This is a longstanding issue that now requires an urgent solution.  The Government needs to urgently address the twotier consultant pay issue.  The HSE is not an employer of choice as the Public Service Pay Commission, among others, has found.  Health service leaders know that to be the case and we suspect that many of our politicians also recognise that fact.</p><p> In the meantime, all higher specialist trainees, SpRs, who have finished training should be offered a temporary consultant locum post to get us through this crisis.  We must also ensure a sufficient number of intern posts and training posts for those who wish to come into the service and contribute at this time.  Once we get them in, it absolutely behoves the service to ensure that the working hours of our exhausted non-consultant hospital doctors comply with the European working time directive and the Organisation of Working Time Act.  We know that they do not.</p><p> Finally, we need to provide additional support for established GPs to allow them to recruit the staff they will need.  We also need to provide supports for newly establishing GPs to allow them to get through the difficult first few years.</p></speech>

Finally, I invite Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha to give her opening statement and she has five minutes to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.607" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020900002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to make a presentation on behalf of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.  We set out in our submission to cover the matters that we were asked to deal with, namely, issues to do with Covid infections and healthcare workers.  The first issue to which we draw attention is the rate of infections among healthcare workers.  This week, the International Council of Nurses confirmed that the rate of infection among Ireland's healthcare worker population, at 12%, is the highest it has recorded.  This is a worrying trend which we have raised previously with the committee.  We believe that the delay in the introduction of protection for workers by ensuring that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, has a role to play in examining workplaces has certainly contributed to this high rate of infections.  The INMO and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, sought for the HSA to amend regulations and that the Government would insist that they be regulated from the time that the pandemic was declared on 11 March last year.  Unfortunately, that did not happen until the biological hazard directive was introduced by the European Union on 24 November.  That interim period led to a lack of focus on the principle of preventing infections among healthcare workers.  These workers are in the eye of the storm.  The settings in which they work are workplaces and the HSA must conduct inspections where we know there are continuing clusters of Covid-19 infections in workplaces.</p> <p>  The data show that the prevalence of infection among females is highest in the health service because the number of female worker is higher than in other sectors.  The reports from the HSA confirm that if one is a woman working in the health service, one is at the highest risk of contracting Covid-19.  The issue is huge for us because a large portion of our members are women.  Stress levels and mental health issues surrounding the provision of childcare and the difficulties in attempting to secure childcare, when decisions have been made, for example, to close schools, are combined with the difficulties of going to work in a high-risk environment and fighting to have personal protective equipment, PPE, provided that is adequate.  That equipment is continually being assessed for its efficacy.  We had to do so again in January, unfortunately, having previously, last April, sought a policy change to allow all healthcare workers to wear surgical masks.  We had to repeat that process and seek the upgrade of those masks as what we know about the virus showed there was a higher risk.  We were tracking the numbers of infections rates and this demonstrated that the new variant was far more infectious than existing variants.  It took almost three weeks for the HSE policy to change to allow healthcare workers the right to wear the higher-grade mask.</p> <p>  Many other issues in our submission point to the fact of the precautionary principle and healthcare worker protection not being to the forefront.  We are and have been very critical of this.  It is a real issue for our members, who are putting themselves at risk on a daily basis in moving past all the obstacles to get to work, including incurring additional personal costs for the provision of childcare, in order to provide a service.  We believe that their health and safety has not been protected to the level that it should and must be.</p> <p>  In regard to the vaccine roll-out, we point out in our submission that the trajectory and statistics we have from the HSE show that some counties, including, for example, the Border counties of Louth, Donegal, Cavan and Sligo, had very high population incidences, yet vaccine administration was not concentrated in, and prioritised for, those areas.</p><p>Our members in those areas were absolutely devastated when they were not prioritised for the vaccine roll-out.  Today the HSE portal to allow healthcare workers register for vaccination opened and we are very worried that the same thing might happen again.  We hope it will not.  We have worked hard with the HSE on a sequencing document, which was issued on 19 January, to ensure that front-line, patient-facing healthcare workers are prioritised for the vaccine that is available because clearly this is their line of defence.</p><p> The long-term Covid effects are another issue on which we believe the committee must comment.  The long-term Covid effects are real.  Many of our members report to us that they have not recovered, that they continue to fight Covid at home, that they have long-term fatigue or long-term neurological or cardiac presentations post infection at work.  There is simply no fast-tracking or clinical pathway for them, despite numerous requests for same.  We believe that, as an employer, the health service has to do better and that there must be real precautionary and preventative measures in place.  There must also be very real measures now to deal with the long Covid effects.</p><p> In addition, we know from all the studies we have done or which other health services across the globe have looked at that the mental health effects post pandemic will be of huge significance.  More than 80% of our members have said their mental health has been affected by working in these conditions.  Now we have to prepare for that and make sure we are putting in place supports to allow recuperation and to allow the healthcare workers who have been working at 120%, 140% and 150% to recuperate when, it is to be hoped, the vaccine is fully rolled out and we have a reprieve.</p></speech>

We have gone over time.  As members are attending virtually from their offices and therefore cannot see the clock to monitor their speaking time, I will try to advise them when they have a minute remaining.  I ask them again to stick to their time allocations in order to facilitate all members' participation in the meeting.  I think most of them have experience at this stage of how it works.  There are ten minutes for the first questioners and as part of that, we ask witnesses when replying to try to be as concise as possible and to stay within the time limit.  Our first questioner this morning is Senator Kyne.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.610" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020900002#E00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance and their presentations and welcome them all.  I will start by thanking all healthcare workers for their diligent and compassionate work and care for people during this pandemic, the likes of which none of us have seen on this scale before.  Obviously, top of that queue are nurses, consultants and GPs but also all healthcare staff - cleaning staff, cooks, catering staff, maintenance staff, secretarial staff, administrative staff, porters, nursing assistants, managers, social workers, chaplains, pharmacists and physiotherapists - who have had front-line roles.  The importance of caring has been recognised more now than ever before.</p> <p>  I recognise that resources are not endless and that spending more in one sector always means spending less in another.  Perhaps all witnesses could comment on the &euro;21 billion budget, which is the highest ever, with an additional &euro;4 billion this year.  That is certainly very welcome.  I think Professor Landers has stated that that money is not being spent effectively.  Perhaps he could advise how it should be spent, whether more should be spent or what he suggests we should not spend money on within the health sector.  That is important.  As I said, money is not endless.</p><p> What percentage of members of the witnesses' organisations have not been vaccinated?  They should have been.  That was, and should still be, the priority.  What are the reasons for them not being vaccinated?  Some were missed because, when their hospitals, HSE nursing homes or whatever were vaccinating, they were out, isolating or had Covid and that caused a delay.  What is the relationship in that regard?  Front-line workers must be the first priority.</p><p> Professor Landers and Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha made reference to the benefits of single-occupancy rooms.  Will they expand on that?  How do single-occupancy en suite rooms protect patients and staff?  The new 75-bed unit in Galway is an example.</p><p> There are consultancy posts being advertised that are not being taken up.  Does that suggest it is just about pay or are there also certain hospitals that are not as attractive as others, if I can say that, because of their size, location or so on?</p></speech>

This year's money is being spent in an emergency situation and with little in the way of planning.  That has been necessary, but we now need to plan into the future.  As I alluded to in my presentation, we need at least 2,000 additional beds.  We also need to examine the infrastructure.  In other words, the majority of facilities need to be single-room accommodation, which would bring us into line with the modern, developed world.  Any new hospital being built these days is all single-room accommodation.  The virus will spread in any congregated setting, be that a two-bed, three-bed, five-bed or six-bed ward.  Single-room accommodation greatly cuts down the virus's ability to spread.</p> <p>  Consultancy post vacancies exist across all model 2, 3 and 4 hospitals.  It is true that some consultant posts are not as attractive as others depending on someone's interests, but there are vacancies across all specialties and hospitals.  This issue needs to be sorted out and we need to make consultant posts more attractive so that we can attract and retain consultants.  We do not have a hope of matching the demand for post-Covid care until we sort that out.</p></speech>

The number in question is 49,500 healthcare workers, but we do not have a breakdown by grade.  There is a long way to go, given that people must have a first and then a second vaccination.  There are nurses and midwives working in ICUs and emergency departments today who have not had their first vaccinations.  They must be prioritised.</p> <p>  We worked hard to get the sequencing document, which has been in place since 12 January and was reiterated on 19 January.  It is key.  Those who are patient-facing, front-line healthcare workers have to be prioritised for a vaccine.  It is a health and safety measure to ensure that their risk is mitigated.  In our view, the State, through the HSA must have an involvement in ensuring that happens.  Under the European directive, the HSA has a legal imperative to ensure that workplaces are safe.  To date, we have been critical of the lack of focus on that imperative in respect of healthcare workers.  Just because they are working in the health service does not mean their environment is safe.  In fact, it is the opposite.  We know that the rate of infection among workers in the health service is very high.</p><p>Those working on the front line of the health service, particularly women, are at higher risk.  This is very problematic, and we must find out why it is.  We cannot just look at it as we have been doing with the trolley count for years, nod our heads and say, "Yes, isn't it terrible?"  This is very real.  It is high risk.  The after-effects of contracting Covid will be with us for a long time.</p><p> In respect of the service plan, we have had an agreement since 2016 that the HSE would sign off the service plan with the union in respect of the funded workforce plan for nursing and midwifery every November.  It happened once in 2017.  This year we still do not have a service plan for the health service, a funded workforce plan or otherwise, signed by the Minister.  Today is 9 February.  It is imperative to focus on how we staff the health service, what is funded and how we recruit, particularly now in a pandemic when we know that more than 6,000 staff are unable to come to work because of being affected themselves.  It is a matter this committee should raise with the Minister for Health.  Why is the service plan not signed off by 9 February?</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for his questions.  He asked about vacant consultant posts in certain sites.  I would overlay that because we have many vacant consultant posts in certain specialties.  Right now, we need emergency medicine consultants and ICU consultants where we have many vacant posts.  We also need mental health consultants, psychiatrists, and they will be particularly needed when, touch wood, we get out of this.  We also have many vacant posts there.  Therefore, it is sites and specialties.</p> <p>  The Senator also mentioned the vaccine roll-out.  Many of our non-consultant hospital doctors came to us with a particular issue.  As he knows, non-consultant hospital doctors have a rotational pattern and quite a few will rotate from one location to another in January every year.  This year we had a particular problem.  Many of them who were leaving site A to go to site B were told in site A to hang on and get the vaccine in site B and others were told when they got to site B to go back to site A to get their second dose.  There are issues which affect numbers of doctors.  In the great scheme of things, it might seem relatively small but the fact of the matter is a vaccination campaign, which is our way out of this, should not make our doctors anxious and should not give them concerns or pause for thought.  It should not give us reasons to approach the HSE and ask, "Would you please vaccinate front-line healthcare workers?"  That should just be happening.</p></speech>

We currently have 728 consultant posts that are not filled on a permanent basis, which is 20% of our current consultant numbers.  The national doctors training programme estimates that we need to increase the number of acute hospital consultants by 51% by 2028.  It is critical that we not only fill those posts, but then recruit another 50%.  Those calculations are all pre-pandemic and, as we all know, the 840,000 people waiting for care is only growing.  The Senator asked what would help to fix it.  The reality is that for many of my peers, with whom I have considerable contact in my role, the 2012 decision makes working abroad more attractive.  It is simple as that.  As long as we are paying two people differently for doing the same work, people who are away will not come home.</p> <p>  Members of the committee, as public representatives, need to see that there is value for money and that people are delivering the care.  That is something we are doing every day.  If we look to what we have shown in the past year, the leadership, the innovation, the agility, the commitment shown by our members, we have shown what is possible and how we can turn around how we deliver care during a pandemic.  Where people previously thought that the health service could not change and could not be agile, that has all been turned on its head.  It has been down to the local teams and the local services, the doctors, nurses, the health and social care professionals, and the porters.  All of us working together have delivered for patients.</p> <p>  As long as we have the 2012 cut and a 30% pay differential, we will continue to have trouble filling those 728 or 1,100 or 650 posts.  The Senator is right; it is not just pay but also conditions.  People have too much call and too much workload.  They are filling the gap for the consultants who are not in post.  It all fills in together and ultimately it is our patients, particularly our poorest and most disadvantaged patients, who are affected most.</p></speech>

I will make a few points and then put a few questions to a number of witnesses.  All of the opening statements made for very difficult listening and should be for all of us but there is a very clear relationship between the burnout facing front-line staff and low morale on the one hand and the lack of capacity across the system, the failure to deal with the two-tier pay inequality issues that have been in play for a long time and the lack of supports in terms of occupational health on the other.  If we do not sort out these problems, we will lose more nurses, doctors, consultants and front-line staff.  It is as simple as that.  Student nurses and midwives have been campaigning for the past number of months - years in fact.  The public health specialists have pay demands, as do hospital consultants operating on lower two-tier contracts, so we need to sort out all of these issues.</p> <p>  I will make a number of points about occupational health.  It is outrageous to learn from the opening statements that there is no serial testing for front-line staff in hospitals.  If there is any place to use testing to hunt down the virus, it should be the front line in hospitals.  I cannot believe that serial testing is not being done or is only being done when there is an outbreak.  The fact that the roll-out of the vaccine has been haphazard and did not follow the infection rates is deeply troubling, as is the fact that there have been very few inspections by the Health and Safety Authority.  I make all of these points because staff are exhausted and facing burnout, their morale is low, they want us to fix these problems and they are facing into what, in my view, will be a tsunami of missed care that must be caught up with in the time ahead.  We cannot expect all of those people who have been through very difficult circumstances with all of the challenges they faced over the past year to face into all of that catch-up care if we do not support them.  </p> <p>  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha stated that the lack of routine testing and monitoring for exposed nurses, midwives and other front-line workers had exposed them to a greater risk of infection.  She said that, put simply, if we cannot see a problem, we cannot deal with it.  What was the response of the HSE when told by the INMO that serial testing was not happening?  We should bear in mind that over 50% of front-line staff who have been infected with Covid have been nurses and healthcare assistants, mostly women.  What was the response of the HSE when the INMO raised issues relating to testing?</p></speech>

There is serial testing in long-term care but there is none in the acute hospital system or in the community outside long-term care.  The study undertaken in Tallaght and Galway demonstrates that this means we do not pick up asymptomatic presentation and 34% of the asymptomatic presentation was not picked up.  According to that study, this means that people were going to work with Covid-19 but without any symptoms.  We have been very critical of that.  Our members have sought serial testing.  To date, the HSE has been unable to give us a satisfactory answer.  It is now saying that antigen testing may be introduced.  Again, there is a lot of information around the efficacy and accuracy of antigen testing.  We believe that until the vaccine is rolled out completely with both doses, it is imperative that we know the status of healthcare workers when they are at work and this requires a routine testing regime to be in place.  We believe this is the role of the Health and Safety Authority.  It must look at the staff and the areas with the highest level of infection and where outbreaks continue to occur.  We know from staff that the acute hospital system continues to have a very high infection rate.</p><p>Evidence suggests that some policies of the HSE such as the derogation for staff who were close contacts to return to work did not assist in reducing infection levels and may have actually increased the infection rate.  Those policies must be tested from the point of view of the safety of the worker.  </p><p> In terms of staffing, I agree with my consultant colleagues on the issue of the two-tier system and I am glad the Deputy raised the issue of student nurses because not only are student nurses going into the eye of the storm, they are not being paid at all.  They are on zero salary and this committee must make a stand on this.  We met the Minister last evening and he is still standing by the position that that is okay.  Frankly-----</p></speech>

I have met hundreds of these students and what they are telling me is that fourth years are still in the hospitals and have been since the pandemic struck.  There was a pause in the placements for some of the first, second and third years but not for all.  Is it the case that the pay and allowance issues have not been resolved, despite the recommendations of the independent report?  Those recommendations have not been implemented but the reality is they do not go far enough.  I ask Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha about the level of anger among student nurses and midwives.  In her view, is what we are seeing clear exploitation?</p></speech>

I do not accept, nor do they, that they are standing in a supervisory capacity and not engaged in the business of work.  Of course they are working and they are not getting paid.  The Collins report looked at the period between September and December and concluded that if the situation in the health service changed, it was open to the Minister to revert to the situation that was put in place by his predecessor last March.  We asked the Minister last night if he was going to do that but his answer was "No".  Nobody can argue that the situation has not changed.  Since January the situation has been, by any examination, much worse than it was last March.  Many students had three weeks of their placements suspended but fourth years have not had their placements suspended.  The Department of Health has advised that student nurses in first, second and third year will gradually return to clinical placement but it is extraordinarily haphazard.  The higher education institutes cannot tell us if those students will have to redo the placements that they could not do because their training was suspended.  Not only are they not paid, they will actually be the only students in the country for whom the higher education institutes did not provide an alternative learning option.</p></speech>

We cannot do justice to all of these issues today.  We have only ten minutes to go through them all.  Obviously, I accept the constraints but it is very difficult, given the number of issues involved, including the haphazard roll-out of the vaccine and the battle that healthcare unions are having to wage to secure access to PPE for their members, which is ridiculous.  It is crazy and the fact that there have been very few, if any, inspections by the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in hospitals is a scandal.  We need to hear from the HSE, the HSA and others.  All of the opening statements today are harrowing and that is the reality for those on the front line.</p> <p>  Mr. Landers made reference in his opening statement to an issue that I have also spoken about, namely the tsunami of missed care that is facing our healthcare services.  A huge volume of care, described as non-essential, was paused but that care becomes essential very quickly.  This will put enormous pressure on staff on the front line.  What needs to be done to best position us to deal with that missed care, given the burnout and low morale among staff, not to mention the lack of capacity in our hospitals?  I ask Mr. Landers and the IMO if it is the case that we are facing a tsunami of missed care and to outline what needs to be done.</p></speech>

It is huge and it will stretch our health services to the absolute limit.  Equally, there is no doubt the public health system as structured does not have the capacity, either in terms of personnel or in terms of infrastructure and beds, to deal in a timely fashion with the tsunami.  In the short term, we will have to work with private providers to address care.  In the medium and long term, we need to start planning now.  We need to put this capacity into our system to build up the number of consultants and the number of public hospital beds available so that people will not wait.  As I have said, this was entirely predictable.  We can go through it specialty by specialty in terms of the numbers but we need to act now.  There is no point in waiting for six months on this.  We need to start planning now and we need engagement with the Department of Health and the Minister on this.</p></speech>

It has been coming down the track for a number of years.  It is just picking up speed.  When I started in the IMO there might have been 100,000 people on waiting lists and we now have well over 800,000 people.  We need to get serious about tackling this.  We need to get the 720 or 730 vacant posts filled properly.  We need to take advantage of the fact that at present we have the biggest intern cohort we have ever had.  We need to keep these doctors here.  We need to get them working on the patients they should be working on.  We should also be paying our student nurses, by the way.  We need to take advantage of the circumstances.  They are not great but what we have we should take advantage of.  There is goodwill towards the health service.  We have more doctors than we have had previously because they cannot leave the country.  Let us look to get them in and then we can begin addressing these huge waiting lists.</p></speech>

I echo the comments of previous speakers.  Will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha give us some kind of taste of what life has been like for nurses in hospitals with the third surge?</p></speech>

The winter of 2019 was very busy.  We had a lot of overcrowding and our members were very tired coming into February and March 2020 when the pandemic struck.  When we hear the account by the HSE of changing capacity and surge capacity, what does it mean?  It means nurses and midwives in the main changed their roles.  Many of them moved from the areas where they practised and worked and went to work in intensive care surge capacity areas and changed their shifts and their attendance.  They worked extra shifts and continued long after their shifts ended to make sure the patients were cared for.  That is the reality.</p> <p>  Now, in the third surge, it has been more difficult because the requirement to provide high-level intensive care outside of intensive care units, with a total of 13 intensivists in the country, has put an enormous strain on the expertise of ICU nurses, who are in short supply, and on those who have assisted in recovery rooms and theatres.  There are also Covid wards with very high dependency patients.  Again, there is a high level of skill required.  It is the perfect storm of very low staffing to begin with, high levels of sickness and the requirement for the same pool to provide continuously the extraordinary work they have been providing.  This coupled with childcare means there are very real issues.</p><p>When our members heard about school closures they wondered how they were going to get to work.  It is unfortunate that this is the second time decisions have been made at that level without taking into consideration the effect that would have on this population of essential workers.</p></speech>

That cost has been their own.  Many have changed their shifts or, with the assistance of family members and partners, come to all sorts of arrangements.  There are myriad arrangements.  People have made extraordinary efforts to ensure they can go to work.  There has been an additional cost to them in terms of personal out-of-pocket expenses in order to make sure they can come to work.  That is a significant issue.</p> <p>  The numbers in our survey who cited childcare as a matter of huge stress for them were very high.  When school closures were announced during the third wave no provision was made for the largely female workforce that comprises nursing and midwifery.  I will ask Ms McGowan to outline the front-line experience.</p></speech>

As Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha has stated, staff have experienced different scenarios, often not very desirable ones, such as arrangements with colleagues to mind other children.  The mixing of households and so on complicates everything.  It is extremely difficult.  A lot of our members have elderly parents who would have normally looked after their children, but are not in a position to do so now because they need to cocoon.  This has resulted in a significant cost for them.  They have had to hire people to take care of their children privately so that they can make sure they can go to work.  It is a significant burden for our members.  I am hearing day in and day out that it is a huge problem.</p></speech>

It stated that it pulled together the Departments for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Health, Public Expenditure and Reform, etc. and they are not going to do anything about it.  The Department does not care about the additional costs that people incur to ensure that they can go to work on the front line of the fight against the pandemic because it is not going to do anything about it.  That is the correspondence that all unions received from the Department of Health yesterday, which is an absolute disgrace.</p> <p>  The schools closed.  Healthcare workers had childcare arrangements that did not cover school hours.  They went out of their way to do whatever they could.  The workforce is 75% female, with a lot of childcare issues.  Some 92% of nurses and 98% of midwives are female.  The Department of Health did not care.  Those people did what they could, put arrangements in place in a very difficult scenario and went to work.  They turned up for their patients, but unfortunately the Government and HSE have not turned up for healthcare workers in that scenario.</p></speech>

Since the pandemic commenced, they have advised us very clearly that they do not have that luxury.  They go into work and are assigned patients, and the person assigning them has no choice because the workforce is not there.  There are over 6,000 healthcare professionals out sick with Covid or through being close contacts.  When they turn up, these student nurses are a pair of hands and assisting in the delivery of healthcare.  They are not paid.</p> <p>  Fourth year student nurses are paid &euro;10.70 per hour for 36 weeks but they advise us that what they are doing is way beyond what is in the learning contract they have with their employer.  In March 2020, an arrangement was arrived at that they would be paid as healthcare assistants, with a rate of &euro;14 per hour, while student nurses in first, second and third year would get contracts as healthcare assistants while their learning would also be credited.  We are saying to the Minister for Health that this arrangement should now be in place and there should be recognition that it is.  There is only one definition for somebody who goes into a workplace during a pandemic and does not get paid for the work; it is exploitation.  We simply cannot accept that the matter is not being addressed by the Government.</p> <p>  We met the Minister for Health last evening and the provision is unchanged.  We appeal to the committee to make very clear representations on that matter.  It is simply not good enough.  We want these people to stay in Ireland when they qualify and we have been battling with measures to retain qualified nurses for years.  Now we have this, which is an own goal by the Government.</p></speech>

The country owes a huge debt of gratitude to them, which makes the circumstances in which they are expected to work all the more shocking.  Their conditions have not improved, instead they have worsened significantly over the past year.</p> <p>  All the witnesses have been before this committee previously.  In the earlier part of last summer, they came before the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response and spelled out in stark terms just what was facing the health service and the country.  It seems that no progress has been made since they outlined those problems.  Is there anybody at any level in any Department who is focusing on the crisis being faced by the health service from a recruitment perspective?  We have heard about vaccines and the management of Covid-19, which are really important, but who is addressing the matter of recruitment?  I fail to see where it is being addressed by the Government at any level.</p><p>I hope I am wrong but I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on the engagement they have had.  Is any work ongoing at Government level in respect of this crisis?  It is a vicious cycle because for years the service has been understaffed and under-resourced in terms of facilities and beds in particular.  I ask each of the organisations about this in turn.  What engagement, if any, is taking place on this?  Who is taking responsibility for this recruitment crisis?</p><p> It seems to me that the number of hospital consultant vacancies is increasing all the time.  We are now talking about over 700 vacancies and another 1,000 Sl&aacute;intecare contracts were also promised.  Is there any progress in either of these areas?  Who is taking responsibility?</p><p> I will ask the IMO representatives specifically about public health doctors.  It beggars belief that, in the context of a pandemic, the Government has not responded to the three reports in the past three years on the shortage of public health specialists and the failure to upgrade those roles.</p><p> I will ask Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha about the nurse experience.  We have talked about the lack of a funded workforce plan.  Has there been any discussion with the INMO on the service plan?  We are still waiting to see that.</p><p> There is another point relating to childcare.  What is the position in respect of an allowance?  Mr. Fitzpatrick said that has been ruled out.  Has the INMO made a specific proposal to the Department on a specific allowance for childcare?  It is madness that this issue, which is fundamental to the workforce, has not been addressed.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the short answer is that there has been a lack of engagement by the Government and management despite our best efforts.  We are seeking practical workable solutions.  As Deputy Shortall outlined, when I was before the health committee some years ago there were 500 vacancies.  There are now 728 vacancies.  We are also facing a glut of retirements in the coming two or three years because of the way posts came on in the late 1990s.  Those retirements are coming.  The national doctors training and planning unit of the HSE is telling us we need a 51% increase in acute hospital posts.  I look to the excellent trainees I am involved in supervising and training.  They look to me and ask whether there is a solution coming and whether they will have enough colleagues for manageable workloads and safe call rosters.  They ask whether they will have to work in a system where there is consistent moral injury from the lack of capacity.  I am concerned we will see them leave once travel opens up again.</p></speech>

It is really concerning that in the midst of a pandemic our colleagues in public health are not being given a consultant contract commensurate with their specialist training.  That has to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  We were asked about the recruitment of future consultants.  It is absolutely the case that the 30% cut is the major barrier to our ability to be able to recruit the specialists the country needs.  Our non-consultant hospital doctors are our doctors in training.  We have 250 additional interns in the system currently, but there has been no commitment to date to provide training posts to expand that number and make these posts available for these staff.</p></speech>

That has not happened since 2017.  There have been public announcements that there will be recruitment of more than 6,000 staff into the health service but we have no details.  In the last engagement we had with the HSE, we were told the Minister has not yet signed off on the service plan for it for 2021, and today is 9 February.  A service plan for this year has not been signed of at Department level yet so it is difficult to get engagement when that is the case.  This is hugely problematic because-----</p></speech>

Deputy Shortall asked about childcare.  The unions collectively wrote to the Ministers for Education, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Health, Deputies Foley, O'Gorman and Stephen Donnelly, respectively, on that issue.  We have had no response from the Department of Education.  We asked that schools consider opening for healthcare workers to allow them to continue to go to work.  A nurse in Cavan does not have that facility but a nurse in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, does because they have kept the schools open for healthcare workers in that jurisdiction.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's specific asks, the unions have asked that if healthcare workers secure childcare within their bubble or anywhere else and there is a cost associated with that, the cost would be reimbursed to them in order to allow them to go to work, care for their patients and have the security that childcare costs will be covered, particularly as the day is much longer now that the schools are closed.  We asked for this before the new year.  Up to last week, we were told it was under consideration by three Departments.  Yesterday, it was confirmed that those involved would not do anything about it.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses.  It is humbling to hear about the superhuman sacrifices our healthcare workers have made.  That rings hollow because we could spend half a year clapping them and then spend the next year and a half insulting them with the sort of letter they got yesterday stating that childcare was their own business and the Department would not do anything about it.  That is quite shocking.  We should published the letter and show how disrespectful the Department of Health is to all front-line workers in the healthcare service.  It is outrageous.</p> <p>  There are some things which jump out at me that have not been asked.  One relates to the Be on Call for Ireland initiative.  All of us remember that last year something of the order of 73,000 people responded to that initiative and that only 7,000 were interviewed.  Of those, only a few hundred have started work.  Has that been frustrating for the witnesses?  Do they believe the matter was handled badly?</p> <p>  References were made, I think by the INMO, to the way recruitment takes place to the effect that it is cumbersome, that it is a burden and that it should be changed.  I would like to tease that matter out, if possible, because it is shocking to see the number of vacancies that exist, including the 728 relating to consultant posts.  Our public health system just does not function.  I think it was the CMO who replied to a question last week by stating that the public health system would not be able to handle this surge we have in the virus.  If it is not able to handle it, then serious questions need to be asked of those who administer our health services.  Will the consultants comment on what is required for a decent public health system that can control the virus, administer vaccines and give control and power to the consultants to lead on these matters?</p><p> My final question is for Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha from the INMO.  In light of her comments on long Covid, the psychological impact on nurses of having worked through three surges in our health system and the numbers out sick, should we still recognise Covid as an occupational disease, particularly given the impact it has had on nurses and midwives, including student nurses and midwives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.670" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gabrielle Colleran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020900002#P00200"><p>I am happy to address the consultant question.  It comes down to capacity and is about having enough beds and staff.  We have the lowest number of specialists in Europe, with 728 unfilled posts and significant unmet need.  We are asking for there to be enough colleagues for management workloads and safe call rosters, that is, just the basics so that we can do our jobs.  As for the infrastructure, what we have seen in terms of nosocomial infections is that our hospitals are just not fit for modern infection control, so we need rapidly to replace many of the acute beds in our system with single-room hospitals, that is, modern hospitals for modern infection control.  We know from history that it takes too long to provide public beds in the Irish system.  It takes seven to eight years, while it is turned around much faster in the private sector.  Some of that is tied up with tendering and processes.  We have a great deal of public land and we need to get new beds into the system that are built for modern infection control.<br/><br/>The 30% pay cut is the big barrier; we know that from talking to consultants who are on fellowship abroad.  Fairness is important in every aspect of life.  If two people are being treated differently and one is being paid 30% more than the other, it is not a recruitment and retention strategy.  That is the biggest barrier.  If that is addressed and more staff come in, people will be able to get through the work.  I cannot describe to the committee what it is like when one sees the impact on a child or adult who has been waiting so long on a list that he or she has a worse outcome.  There is a moral injury with that and it damages doctors, nurses and health professionals.  We need to remove it from our systems because when trainees who grow up in the system go away to Australia, New Zealand or America, as I did, and they work in systems where they can consistently feel proud and they do not have that moral injury and damage, they do not want to feel it again.  That is part of why they stay away.  If we fix the system so that it works for patients, and if we have capacity to meet need, that is when we will attract and retain people because of that feeling of being part of something excellent.<br/><br/>In many pockets of our health service, people are very satisfied with the care when they get in because we have excellent teams.  We saw that in the way that our healthcare workers responded to this crisis and stepped up, but too many people wait too long for access to scheduled care.  &quot;Elective&quot; care makes it sound as if it is not urgent, but if an elderly person cannot walk to the shops or to mass because he or she has hip pain, or if he or she cannot drive because he or she has not had a cataract operation, that elective care is essential.  We have to get the capacity into our system.  The belief that, somehow, our public health system cannot be fixed has to be tackled.<br/><br/>While I have this opportunity, I must talk about psychiatry.  There is a critical lack of beds in the psychiatric system.  When psychiatric consultants are on call, they do not have beds even for people who are suicidal.  They ring around trying to beg and borrow beds for people who acutely need admission with suicidal ideation or psychotic episodes.  We are discriminating against psychiatric patients and people with mental health issues.  We allocate 6% of the total health budget to mental health, whereas it is 12% in the UK and it still has issues.  There is an urgent need for parity of esteem for mental health in this country.  We are letting down a generation of Irish people.  We are seeing the impact of the pandemic on our children.  There has been an increase in the number of presentations with mental health issues to our paediatric emergency departments.  We really have to address this issue.<br/><br/>When I look to the trainees coming behind me, I want to fix the system so that they see a future leading and innovating in it and so that they will want to stay in the system.  As soon as the world opens back up, we will see an exodus because of the trauma of what has happened during this pandemic to our trainees and because of what they are seeing in terms of how our healthcare workers are being treated.  As Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha so eloquently articulated, we were abandoned when the schools were closed, with no plan for us.  In Northern Ireland and Britain, children of healthcare workers are going to school, whereas my children and my colleagues' children are being traumatised.  They are falling behind and we are too tired and burned out to help them with homeschooling when we get home.  I got home at 9.15 p.m. on Monday last and my seven-year-old was sitting there with her <i>Abair Liom</i>on the table, waiting to do her Irish homework with me.</p><p>I burst into tears.  I had nothing left to give.  She is stressed because she is falling behind.  The anxiety is through the roof.  We are not working from home, so we are not there to support our children.  We feel we have been abandoned by the State at exactly the time when we have all stepped up.  We went into work every day before we were vaccinated, putting our own lives on the line, seeing colleagues getting sick, seeing colleagues being out with long Covid and not coming back, knowing that we were at risk of that ourselves, but there was no plan for us.  The schools just shut and there was nothing to help us, but it was our problem and our cost to absorb.</p></speech>

The HSA has had responsibility for this area since 24 November.

To address Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's question, none of our members will hear it as a hollow gesture.  They appreciate the supports they get from the public and all parties who say that their contribution has been extraordinary.  We ask that the committee support our call, which was lodged last November, for compensation for them for how they have gone over and above and delivered in excess even when doing so was very difficult for them.</p> <p>  The point we make about schools is that, when a decision was made by the Government to close them based on public health advice and for a variety of reasons, that was fine.  We are not making comment on that.  Rather, we are saying that the Government cannot make that decision and then abandon a force of what it calls "essential workers" and require them to turn up to work without providing a plan B.  It has not been thought through.  That is our criticism.  Many in the healthcare workforce have family responsibilities - 72% are female, and in our case 92% of nurses and 97% of midwives are female.</p><p>When schools are removed at short enough notice, it is simply irresponsible.  It abandons the workforce and actually imposes a cost on them.  As my colleague, Mr. Fitzpatrick, pointed out, this has now very definitely been presented as, "That is your own problem.  Sort it out."</p></speech>

It is largely Covid-related illnesses that have caused the additional absence from the front line but it is a fact &ndash; we quote the HSE's information &ndash; that the highest incidence of infection in any single occupational health group is among nurses and midwives.  The second highest is among healthcare assistants.  Therefore, the groups that are patient-facing and closest to the patient comprise between them 50% of all the infections with Covid-19.  That is very high.</p></speech>

I represent Clare.  Many INMO members in Clare were quite upset and annoyed about how the vaccine was rolled out in the mid-west by comparison with other regions.  In the first allocation, 3,500 were allocated to the mid-west hospital group.  In west Cork, including Kerry, 19,000 vaccines were made available.  Has Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha any views on how the roll-out was handled and the lessons that have been learned?</p></speech>

I have the statistics.  In week 53, for example, there were 506 cases per 100,000 of the population in Cavan.  In Clare, there were 397.2 cases, in Donegal there were 554 cases, in Limerick there were 613 cases, in Louth there were 773 and in Monaghan there were 858 per 100,000, but those counties were not prioritised.  That is the point we are making.  Where the incidence rate was highest, the vaccine should have been prioritised.  We got calls from our members in Louth and Letterkenny.  The Senator might recall that the ambulances were backing up at the time in Letterkenny General Hospital.  Nurses and doctors were going into the ambulances and they had not been vaccinated.  The point was that the roll-out was haphazard.  I hope we have got over that and that the sequencing document we produced subsequently, through negotiations with HSE, on 12 January and 19 January, should prevent it from happening.

My question will be quick.  Regarding moving forward, we are being told that there could be ebbs and flows with the roll-out of the vaccine.  In respect of engagement with the HSE, and the sequencing document, is there confidence that proper protocols and structures are in place to deal with those ebbs and flows and future difficulties which may present?  Is Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha satisfied with the arrangements in place?</p></speech>

We are absolutely adamant that those arrangements must be adhered to.  We are stating that the HSA, which is the statutory authority responsible for ensuring the welfare and safety of workers, must also provide commentary on this process.  It cannot just be left to chance, as it was with there being no plan B in place when we got more dosages out of a vial than we originally thought would be possible.  In that case, we had no plan B for who should be vaccinated, and we saw what happened and what decisions were made.</p></speech>

I have been in this job for less than a year, and I am already becoming weary of the constant conversations about how the system was not able to deal with things before the onset of Covid-19.  Given the way things are now, and considering I am already weary of it, I can only imagine how utterly wearying and draining it is to be working in the system.</p> <p>  I cannot get over the stark situation regarding the low numbers of staff and their low morale.  As everyone has remarked, the information we have and which we are discussing is all from before Covid-19 struck.  We now have this explosion of chaos, if I can put it so delicately.  Not only were the numbers short before this, we now have appalling treatment, if I could be so bold as to put it that way, of the staff in the system.  We have as a result the double whammy of trying to keep people in the system, while also trying to recruit people into the same system.  Arguably, people would have to be mad to come into a system like this one.  It seems incredibly bleak.  I commend wholeheartedly, therefore, all the work being done by staff.  </p> <p>  It is fair to say that the conditions in which work is being undertaken by these staff include being overworked, underpaid, stressed and burnt out in respect of mental health.  In respect of several articles and studies having been published on this aspect, I also think it is fair to say that many people will exit the system at the other side of this crisis.  People here have referred to that prospect already.  We not only have a problem, therefore, with getting people into a system which is already drastically understaffed, but we are also going to have people scarpering out the door as soon as it is reasonably safe to do so.  I think that would be a fair enough assessment.  </p> <p>  Is the answer to addressing this situation an extremely aggressive recruitment strategy, involving elements such as pay parity and improvements in conditions?  It seems to me that the solution on paper is quite simple, namely, better conditions, better pay and getting going pretty lively in recruiting people into the system before other people head out the door when it is safe to travel again.  How do we get all of that happening, though?  It seems these committees have Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha coming in repeatedly to lay out the details of these bleak situations, but we are not moving anywhere in addressing them.  We are not going anywhere with getting solutions to these problems.  I do not know what to do as a public representative in order to bring these solutions about.  I am at my wits' end, and I am only here a few months.  What is it that needs to happen?  </p> <p>  Turning to the issue of student nurses, which is my favourite topic to talk about, some 93% of student nurses in 2014 said that they were considering emigrating.  I would not be surprised if 100% of student nurses were now considering emigrating.  Again, here we have another problem coming down the line.  It seems that we are constantly talking about this problem coming down the line, but that we have already jumped over it because we have now been landed with Covid-19.  I am so flabbergasted as to how we are supposed to deal with this issue.</p><p>I am astonished by the patience of those presenting today and their ability to keep their decorum, as it were, when this situation is so ridiculous.  Many here have spoken about student nurses.  The Labour Party has published a Bill to pay student nurses and midwives.  I am really excited to see the appearance of the cross-party support that would be needed to get it over the line.  It seems to me that everyone nods and agrees that student nurses need to be paid and the situation is not good enough, but people are not willing to put their money where their mouths are and support changes in the legislation to do that.</p><p> Those are observations that Dr. Colleran or Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha might respond to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.703" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gabrielle Colleran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020900002#T00200"><p>The Senator has hit the nail on the head.  Many of us here today are saying the same as we said before, but it is actually worse.  With time, one does start to lose the belief that people will listen meaningfully and then act.  Sometimes we come here and speak but we do not feel heard when we do not see action.  We have to see engagement and action and that is what is missing.  Those of us on the consultant front just want to have enough colleagues for safe manageable workloads, for call rosters that are safe to be able to provide the care for all the patients that need to see us.  I just want for anyone who needs to see a consultant to see them within six weeks so that no patient has a worse outcome because of the wait.  These are basic things.  We are not asking to have the highest number of consultants in the EU.  We are just asking that we can aim to be average.</p> <p>  We know from our consultants that they go above and beyond but I will say, without being too pointed, that sometimes we are our own worst enemy.  We take a vocational approach and, as a result, it is used as an excuse to treat us badly and breach our contract.  The same applies to the other healthcare workers here too, and that is just not good enough.  We have seen the agility and the innovation and commitment shown during the pandemic.  We do not want claps; we do not want nice words.  What we want is a system with capacity to meet need so that we can do our jobs safely and our patients get an excellent service.  Supporting us is the thanks we want.  Talk is cheap but support requires resources.</p></speech>

That is what we are doing.  She is right that we do need a recruitment strategy, but at the moment we have something more like a removal strategy.  The safest and surest way to build up the consultant capacity that we need is to train our own consultants.  We are not doing that.  We do not have enough training places and we are not bringing people through who could get into those consultant posts.  This is something that will become very real.  We took in the biggest ever intern cohort last year and the system has not put training places in place to get those people going through the system to be trained to be consultants.  We are going to lose many of them.  That is a removal strategy; they are going to go.</p> <p>  When people come to a consultant post, if they have had experience abroad, as Dr. Colleran said, they will not come back to work here for 30% less than their colleagues.  They are not going to do the same work.  Why would they?  Why would they not stay in Australia or the NHS and be treated with respect and dignity in a system that actually values their contribution?  That needs to be addressed and reversed.  There are 728 consultant posts vacant or not filled substantively.  That is incredible.  These posts used to be like Olympic gold medals.  We are not doing that properly.</p> <p>  I have referred numerous times today to the fact that public health medicine is our insurance policy.  We have one third the number of the public health specialists who should be consultants as there are in Scotland, which has a similar population size and similar geographic dispersal of population.  By virtue of the age profile, we will also lose a lot of people there and we will not be able to replace them.  The next time this happens, if it happens again, we will not get away with it.  We need to stop the removal strategy and move to a proper, sustained and focused recruitment strategy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.705" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020900002#T00400"><p>The Senator asked what the Joint Committee on Health can do.  The first thing it can do is make sure that there is a policy decision that the moratorium on recruitment, if and when it is reintroduced, can never apply to nursing and midwifery, as it has in each of the moratoriums that have happened since 2008.   It has not applied to consultants but it has applied to nurses and midwives.</p><p>We have, therefore, been constantly running to try and undo the damage done by the moratorium.  One should remember that we are still very reliant on overseas recruitment from non-EU countries.  That is a major issue right now, because we have a lot more evidence that this pandemic affects communities from the black, Asian and ethnic minority groupings to a greater extent.  We have to look at that and put specific protections in place because we are very reliant on that community of healthcare workers in Ireland and that will continue into the future because there is a global shortage of nurses and midwives.  The first ask, therefore, is policy to ensure that moratoriums cannot apply.  Thankfully, we now have a scientific tool as part of Government policy to determine how many nurses we need but that must be funded and rolled out across the health service.  We cannot just decide how many nurses and midwives we need based on the available resources.  There will be science behind it and it will be based on the patient dependency.  The framework on nursing and midwifery staffing is accepted as Government policy, but it has to be funded to be rolled out.  If one wants to open one ICU bed, seven ICU nurses are needed.  That is not possible to do overnight, so one has to pre-plan and put a lot of planning in place.</p><p> The health and well-being of all front-line health workers who have been battling this pandemic will be severely compromised.  We have lodged a claim to have respite for them, hopefully when the number of admissions to hospitals and community care areas reduces, the workload reduces and the vaccines take hold and reduce infection rates.  That must be addressed.  The committee should promote that.  We should do what other countries have done.  We should show appreciation for the extra give in response to the ask.  Compensation must be afforded to the health service workforce for that.  Senator Hoey is very familiar with the student nurse issue.  I have heard her speak on it previously but this committee must comment on it.  It cannot be silent on it because it is exploitation.  This is 2021 and we are in a pandemic and there is no excuse for trying to portray what student nurses have contributed as not being work.  It is simply not credible.</p></speech>

I join others in thanking all the front-line health service staff for everything they have done.  We are approaching a year of this crisis and it looks very much like the situation will be prolonged for a number of months to come.  We are certainly not out of the woods and yet there is some cause for hope with the roll-out of the vaccine, albeit it at a slower pace than everyone in the country would like, but it is progressing nonetheless.  The situation should improve.  As the witnesses have articulated, staff on the front line are still exposed to the ferocity of the situation and the risk involved every day.  That must be acknowledged, appreciated and supported in terms of responsive actions by the Government and partners.</p> <p>  In recent weeks, Hazel Hartigan has been on "Operation Transformation".  She is a nurse and a member of Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha's union.  She has flown the flag so well for the nursing profession.  We have had a glimpse behind the scenes each week as she bares her soul on RT&Eacute;.  We can see the stresses that it has put on her and her colleagues.  The stresses do not stay behind in the hospital when staff close the door and sit into the car; they are carried home with them.</p> <p>  I wish to put a number of questions.  The first relates to the vaccination of mental health staff.  We continue to see real difficulties in the mid-west region.  A fortnight or three weeks ago I put a number of questions to the Minister for Health.</p><p>He advised me there has been a devolved function in terms of vaccination roll-out for front-line staff, that each hospital group has received a certain number of batches of the vaccine and, using the disbursal criteria, the groups are ensuring their staff are vaccinated.  In the mid-west and particularly in Ennis General Hospital the mental health nurses have been passed over.  The front-line medical nurses have all been vaccinated and vaccination has moved down through other elements of the staff, including administrative staff, ground staff and people who during their working day, even though they are in a risk environment, have some mitigation measures around them such as perspex and the like.  However, the mental health nurses continue to circulate and go into homes without the benefit of vaccination.  Is the INMO aware of that?  It is not to blame, of course, but is it aware that some of its members continue to be outliers and have been passed over in the chain on command?</p><p> I saw with great interest about two weeks ago that Bantry General Hospital in west Cork was a poster boy for vaccination.  It had gone through all its staff and had started calling in the local GPs.  The mid-west does not appear to be at that point.  Will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha comment on that?  Is she aware of that breakdown of the chain of command there?</p></speech>

That is why we have the agreed sequencing document which will see patient-facing healthcare workers prioritised.  We believe independent scrutiny of that is necessary.  Mental health nurses, public heath nurses and community registered general nurses, RGNs, were going into people's homes, but not being prioritised for the vaccine.  There is much criticism from the front line of nursing and midwifery in respect of the manner in which the initial roll-out of the vaccine was organised.</p></speech>

Many doctors have been in contact with me and told me about the early days when the portal opened in which they had to register for vaccination.  Many of them went through the first and second pages of inputting data, but then the system crashed several times.  Some of them did not get around to it a second time because of the immense workload they take on each day, or when they did, a week had elapsed.  Some of them tried a second time, but again the same technical glitches were encountered.  Basically, they did not get to register properly and by the time they did, they are of the view that it set them back in the roll-out calendar, as it were.  They have fallen further back.  I note that Dr. Colleran has her hand up, so perhaps one of the witnesses can deal with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.711" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Owens" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020900002#V00400"><p>I will comment on it.  Absolutely, there was a design flaw in the roll-out of the vaccine.  The sequencing document is the document that ought to be followed, but I am not entirely clear that it was interfacing with the portal on which one would go and register one's interest in getting the vaccine.  We are told that it has been fixed, that the sequencing document has been brought up to date and it is now fixed with the portal.  There are still issues in terms of getting registered for vaccination.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to mental health.  I will say a few words on mental health, which is important.  We have been contacted by doctors, both NCHDs and consultants, who are mental health doctors, psychiatrists and trainee psychiatrists and are employed by one arm of the HSE but who work in the acute hospitals.  They have experienced difficulties in getting their names put on a list in an acute hospital by virtue of the fact that their payroll is somewhere else.  Those are the types of issues we are still trying to iron out.  They have damaged the confidence we can have in this vaccination campaign.  Hopefully, we are approaching the end of such problems.  We need to be because the psychiatrists I mentioned have unscheduled care commitments and see patients who present through emergency departments and wards.  They absolutely need to be vaccinated.</p></speech>

Dr. Colleran might intervene in a moment, but I wish to make a final point and she can respond to the points generally.  My last point relates to long Covid, which a number of people have mentioned today.  Typically, in a work environment if one is out for a long period, one is referred to Medmark Occupational Healthcare and there could be certain screening barriers to somebody returning to work or remaining out of work.  Are front-line staff encountering any of those barriers?  Is it accepted that one may not present with antibodies but one still has the symptoms of long Covid?  Is that generally accepted across all strata of the health service or are people being referred to Medmark Occupational healthcare, being scrutinised and having those barriers put before them?</p><p>The final thing I will say is that the vaccination of healthcare staff, across all spectrums, is important.  There are ancillary or therapeutic staff who enable children with learning and physical difficulties to attend education as best they can.  I was teacher until the general election.  There are still many services, such as the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, that are not engaging with children online or face to face.  It is not for our guests to solve but, as some of those staff are members of some of our guests' unions, we need to see those people out there and offering supports to children at this time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.714" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gabrielle Colleran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020900002#W00200"><p>There are very high levels of Covid-19 among mental health workers and consultants.  Services are under extreme pressure because of the number of acute presentations and the lack of beds.  It is essential that they are prioritised.</p> <p>  I want to take this opportunity to emphasise something that is key for us to talk about, that is, our public health specialists and infrastructure.  People sometimes get confused between the acute public hospitals and the public health infrastructure and the staff who provide it.  As the IHCA does not represent public health specialists, I cannot be accused of having a vested interest in this matter, other than the same vested interest that we should all have in having a public health system that works.  We do not give consultant status to public health specialists in this country.  We are an outlier in that regard and it massively impacts our ability to manage pandemics and to plan healthcare.  It is essential for that to be addressed and all of the outbreak management and contact tracing falls under the auspices of, and is led by, public health consultants.</p> <p>  The elephant in the room is that vaccine roll-out is hampered by the fact that we do not have a universal health identifier for people.  We do not have public health IT that is fit for purpose, compared with the UK and other countries.  Those other countries are well able to prioritise people and have back-up lists because they have a universal health identifier and the required IT infrastructure.  We have the specialists.  Public health specialists are trained to consultant level in public health.  If we actually pay them properly, give them the tools that consultants have in terms of teams and software resources, they will optimise our response and we will reap those benefits, societally and economically.  It is incredible to me, as an individual watching this, that 11 months into the pandemic, there are only 60 public health specialists in the country, as Mr. Owens earlier outlined.  In Scotland, which has a similar population, there are 180.  That we have not addressed that and upped the numbers of public health trainees, given them proleptic appointments with consultant status at the end of it, is incredible and must be addressed.  This is not the last pandemic.  We may not even be experiencing the last surge of this one.  Until we tackle climate change, we are going to have more and more pandemics and our ability to respond to them without locking down our society is dependent on having the public health infrastructure, including the people, IT and structures.  If this committee takes just one lesson from this meeting, that is it.  It is essential.  It is what has hampered us and is a part of why we are rolling from one lockdown to another.  We do not have the public health capacity.</p></speech>

Has a deadline been set for the roll-out of vaccines for all front-line staff who are in contact with patients or potential patients?  If not, why not?</p> <p>  My second point relates to student nurses.  Has the emergency nature of the call to student nurses to work in extraordinary circumstances in which they would not normally have to work been established?  They are putting their health and lives at risk to a large extent.  Has the emergency nature of the need to respond been conveyed to the HSE and the Minister?  If not, why not?</p> <p>  How should the concerns raised today be relayed through the system to the appropriate authorities?  Delays have taken place and I understand why all of the people concerned are upset and annoyed at the delay that follows the need for action in any particular area.  I do not want to go into particular details.  We, as a committee, need to know how best we can deal with that in order to bring it to the attention of the powers that be.</p><p> Have any of the witnesses been told the reason for the delay in the service plan?  Will that become a job for us in this committee?</p><p> What is happening with the consultant posts to which people have been recruited but whose training has not been progressed in the meantime?  Is there a cost to the system as delays continue to occur in this regard and, if so, what is that cost?</p><p> Finally, I congratulate all involved in the delivery of health services.  It has been all hands to the pump.  The health service providers in this country, as represented by the witnesses, did very much better than counterparts in many other countries, even though they were coming from a position of there being serious gaps in the system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.717" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peadar Gilligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020900002#X00200"><p>I will address the Deputy's initial question on when all healthcare workers will be vaccinated.  We have been meeting with the HSE on a weekly basis on this matter.  As it stands, only 49,000 are fully vaccinated.  I know figures are thrown out about so many doses, so many vaccines etc., but that is the reality.  The figure I gave refers to those who have received their first and second doses.</p> <p>  It is nearly by chance that healthcare workers are getting the vaccines this week.  If the decision had not made regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine, healthcare workers' access to vaccines would probably be delayed until next week or the week after.  When the decision was made in regard to the over-65s and over-70s, it meant that the vaccines in question were available to healthcare workers this week.  We understand the portal is open and live today.  We understand that front-line healthcare workers began to be vaccinated yesterday and are being vaccinated today.  That refers to first doses; they will have to get a second dose in 21 to 28 days and, in the case of AstraZeneca, after a longer timeframe.  It is going to be a significant period down the line, into March and April, before those healthcare workers are fully vaccinated.  The understanding from the HSE at the moment is that by the end of February, all of those staff will have got their first doses and some of them will start getting their second doses.</p> <p>  I know my colleagues would like to respond on the other matters raised by Deputy Durkan but I have a couple of other points to make.  We have said all along that the vaccination portal, which is only working today, or at least we hope it is working today, was meant to be in operation from 28 December last.  Six weeks later, it has only begun working from today.  That has been a major failing on the part of the HSE in terms of its IT infrastructure.  The portal was meant to be up and running when the vaccinations were up and running.  It is clear that healthcare workers have delivered.  Nurses and doctors on the front line administering the vaccines have delivered.  They have done so across seven-day weeks and covering long hours.  Some of them have gone in voluntarily in their own time to get the vaccines rolled out.  Front-line healthcare workers have rolled up their sleeves and really delivered in that regard as well as trying to provide a Covid service and a normal healthcare service.</p> <p>  In regard to student nurses, the dithering that has gone on by the Minister and the Department of Health is completely unacceptable.  I am not making any political points here, because I am completely apolitical, but when the situation was bad last March and April, the former Minister made a clear decision to utilise the student nurses to allow the health service to respond to the crisis.  No one can doubt that January this year was much worse than the scenario that existed last March and April.  Why the dithering?  The Government must make the decision to utilise these valuable, skilled individuals to allow the health service to respond in a situation where we have had 7,000 to 8,000 people absent from work.</p> <p>  An issue that we have not focused on at all is the situation in long-term care facilities.  The reality is that we talk about the numbers in ICU and in our acute hospitals but many patients with Covid-19 are in our long-term care facilities.  Many of them are not even going to acute hospitals.  Many of them are on syringes and are receiving a high level of care at a time when staffing is decimated in those services.  We have had staff from across the public service redeploy into our long-term care facilities in order to care for those patients.  That situation has been overlooked.  It is time to start publishing the figures for Covid-19 patients in our 582 long-term care facilities as well.</p></speech>

There is no cost to the system; the cost is to the patients if we do not address the issues.  The cost is to our brothers, sisters, fathers and mothers.  It is not just cancer care.  It is the cataract operations and hip operations.</p><p>It is like the child who has got publicity in the past day or two and who is waiting until 2024 for an MRI scan.  There will be a scandalous, unsustainable cost to patients unless we address the issues.  The solutions are hidden in plain sight.  We must sort out the recruitment crisis by ending the discrimination, and we have to do so now.  There is no point waiting six to 12 months for this.  We know what to do.  Let us get on and do it.  Let us get engagement from the Minister and the Department on this and then we can begin to make progress.</p></speech>

They went way beyond the call of duty.  I know this full well because members of my family were involved in the healthcare sector in a number of different areas.</p> <p>  I will start by asking just three or four questions.  The first is to Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha.  She spoke at the very start about the failure to respond quickly enough to the demands of the nursing staff.  Nursing staff are on the front line.  They know sooner than anyone else when change is required.  I was looking at the HR report from the HSE.  There are 7,800 nurse managers.  Nurses, obviously, will go to the nurse managers.  Is it the case that nurse managers are not getting the response quickly enough from the administrative level of the HSE to make the changes that are required?</p> <p>  My second question concerns nurses who have retired from the system and now want to get back in.  I understand that the Nursing and Midwifery Board is looking for a fee of &euro;350 for such nurses to re-register.  Has the INMO engaged with the Nursing and Midwifery Board on this issue?  It sounds like an extremely high charge to impose on people who want to come back in and give assistance at present, when there are huge demands.</p> <p>  My third question concerns consultants.  We have seen the figures for the number of GPs who are due to retire over the next few years.  There are around 600.  Have we any idea of the number of medical consultants who are to retire over the next three to five years?  Are there particular areas where we do not even have people in training to fill those vacancies?  The second issue I wish to ask the consultants about concerns the number of specialist registrars who are in training at present.  What is the total number per annum across all areas who are in training?  What kind of increase do we need to put in place in order that we have an adequate number of people to take on the vacancies as they arise?</p> <p>  Finally-----</p></speech>

There is not at present.  The WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, for example, were advocating that we look at the wearing of FFP2 masks for greater protection in early January.  We had to lobby the HSE and wait for a national circular from it before the practice was allowed to change across the health service.  Nurse managers gave a testimony to us that they went and sought these masks and their release to staff when they asked and they were refused.  In one location staff were threatened with disciplinary sanction if they continued to ask for those masks.  Eventually, we got a letter from the HSE which opened the door and allowed the policy change in respect of what was appropriate to wear during the third wave and, obviously, with the higher contagion of the new variant.</p><p>I hope that answers the Deputy's question.  It illustrates how bureaucratic the system is.  There is a significant amount of national control.</p><p> Health and safety measures have to be put in place much more quickly.  It cannot be a case of always waiting for an incident to occur.  Preventative measures have to be in place and thought about because this pandemic is changing all the time.  With new variants, we will need agile and quick responses to protect workers.  That is simply what is missing.</p><p> On the issue of the availability of staff etc., I refer to the whole area of Sl&aacute;intecare and the fact that 82% of care of older persons services are privatised.  There are many waiting lists etc., but there is 30% availability of private hospitals.  Surely the committee can comment on that, considering that there is bed capacity of 1,900 beds, a large proportion of which are single rooms, in the private sector.  They should be playing a greater role during a pandemic.</p></speech>

That will add to our recruitment problems.  It is not just retirements.  We anticipate there will be an exodus of younger consultants abroad as a result of the working conditions they are being offered here unless we sort that issue out.  In addition, workforce planning indicates that we need an increase of 51% in the number of consultants.  That equates to approximately 1,600 extra consultants needed in the system to match the current demand.  There is no sign of that happening, apart from some promises in the Sl&aacute;intecare proposals.  We need to recruit significant numbers of consultants, we need to do it fast and we need to do it on attractive terms and conditions to be able to deliver the care required.  If that is not done, we will be in very serious trouble.</p></speech>

The number is whittled down a little such that approximately 500 get into higher specialist training.  That is the kind of number with which we are dealing over several years.  We will need an additional 600 GPs to cover those who retire as well as 1,600 more GPs to meet demand.  We will need more than 2,000 consultants if public health specialists are included.  We are facing into a yawning chasm and deficit and we need to address it quite quickly.</p></speech>

My apologies to anyone who wished to contribute further.  I thank our witnesses for the sacrifices they and their colleagues have made.  I am particularly conscious of the sacrifices their families are making.  I have spoken to healthcare workers.  One of their significant concerns is that they may bring infection into their own homes.  The committee has listened today to information that will help us to respond to some of the challenges that are facing the witnesses and their cohort of workers.</p> <p>  As a committee, we have a strong view in respect of student nurses.  It is wrong and unfair that they are not being paid during the pandemic, especially given the fact that they are doing work.  That needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  It is clear that vaccines for front-line workers need to be fast-tracked.  We are 11 months into the pandemic and we are still talking about PPE.  The response in that regard needs to be upgraded.  The Health and Safety Authority needs to step up to the challenge and be more proactive in protecting workers in that area.  All members of the committee were shocked to hear this morning about the letter regarding additional childcare costs.  We will follow that issue up as a committee.  We certainly agree with the submission in respect of additional beds.  A policy in respect of long Covid is needed.  The committee will take that issue up with the Minister and the Department.  Doctors and consultants should not have to threaten to go on strike during a pandemic.</p><p>It is totally wrong that it is necessary for them to do so .  There is also the fact that there was no meaningful engagement.  We heard about staff being burned out.  People are tired, frustrated and feel let down.  There is an expectation that support should be in place for the witnesses and for other workers on the front line.</p><p> The committee will discuss this matter later in private session.  It is to be hoped that we can put some of the practical ideas the witnesses have put forward through the system and bring about some meaningful changes.   I again thank the witnesses and apologise for cutting them off during some of the submissions.  I look forward to meeting them again and I thank them very much for all their work.</p></speech>

We are joined remotely by officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I welcome Mr. Barry Quinlan, assistant secretary of the housing, affordability and homelessness division.  From the capital infrastructure and affordability unit I welcome Mr. Robert Nicholson, principal officer.  They are joined by Ms Marian O'Driscoll, assistant principal and Mr. Alan Smith, assistant principal.</p> <p>  Members have been circulated with the opening statements and briefing material.  I now invite the officials to make their opening statements and then members will ask their questions.  I ask members to identify themselves clearly and whether they are in the confines of Leinster House, as this helps the Debates team here.</p><p>Members attending remotely from the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity and a member is directed by the committee to discontinue remarks, it is imperative that he or she complies with the request.</p><p> There are some limitations on parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity to legal proceedings as a person who is physically present.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> I remind members of the requirement to be physically present in the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the convention centre, in order to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Any member who intends to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on its website after this meeting.</p></speech>

I am assistant secretary in the housing, affordability, inclusion and homelessness division in the Department.  I thank the committee for facilitating this early consideration of the affordable housing Bill, the general scheme of which was approved by the Government in December last year and which was published on 20 January this year.  I am accompanied today by colleagues who are working on affordable housing and the Bill, Robert Nicholson, principal officer and Marian O'Driscoll and Alan Smyth, assistant principal officers who work with Mr. Nicholson.  We welcome the views of the committee on the provisions contained within the general scheme and together we will try to address any questions the committee has.</p> <p>  I will start with an outline of the main provisions in the Bill.  The Bill is made up of three Parts and 23 heads.  The bulk of the heads deal with amendments to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Part 5 of that Act deals with affordable dwelling purchase arrangements and the provision of affordable housing led by local authorities.  The approach taken has been to seek to utilise existing provisions, where possible, to facilitate as early as possible the delivery of affordable housing for purchase by local authorities.  The Bill contains new provisions to facilitate delivery of affordable housing through new channels, such as cost rental, delivered by local authorities, approved housing bodies and the Land Development Agency, LDA.</p> <p>  Given the nature of affordable housing, we have sought the optimal blend of necessary facilitating measures in primary legislation, while allowing for flexible responsive requirements to be set in regulations.  Our work has been informed through engagement with key stakeholders and delivery partners, including local authorities, the Housing Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, approved housing bodies and the Land Development Agency.</p> <p>  To give a breakdown of the Bill, 20 heads contain amendments to the 2009 Act dealing with local authority-led affordable purchase, one broad head puts cost rental on a statutory basis, as a new form of tenure, for the first time, and one head provides for the Housing Agency to administer the new cost rental equity loans announced in budget 2021.  There is also one head to facilitate Government investment in a new national affordable purchase shared equity scheme for the purchase of private homes, which was also announced in budget 2021.</p> <p>  Regarding the local authority-led affordable dwelling purchase arrangements, the majority of the amendments to Part V of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 are administrative and intended to improve its operation.  Key amendments relate to the following areas.  One is assessment of purchaser eligibility, involving an amendment to the criteria to replace the current provisions with a more workable assessment regime on the basis of regulations to be made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Regarding the scheme of priority, following engagement with local authorities, it is proposed to streamline the ministerial power to make regulations to cover the issues such as the suitability of the home for the eligible household, the length of time a person has been living in the administrative area and the time of application.  Rather than lapsing after a charging period, an amendment is proposed to allow the local authority charge or its equity stake on the property to remain in place until bought out by the household.  This charge or equity stake would become enforceable by the local authority on a breach of the agreement or at the end of a given period to accommodate the senior mortgage maturity.</p><p>In respect of the Land Development Agency, a new section is proposed to allow for affordable purchase of homes provided by the LDA to local authority eligible and priority households.  </p><p> Other key provisions cover the cost rental scheme.  For the first time, a legal definition of a cost rental tenancy will be provided.  The Minister will be given the power to designate cost rental tenancies and ensure that the rent is set at a cost-covering level, including cost elements to be prescribed in regulations.  The head also sets out the manner in which rents for a cost rental tenancy may be increased each year to ensure they remain stable in real terms, while continuing to cover costs.  The head contains provision to allow for the setting of eligibility criteria for entering a cost rental tenancy, and the Minister would be given the power to set household income thresholds by regulation.  The head also clarifies that cost rental tenancies are a new tenure and confirms it is not a social housing support.  Cost rental tenancies will generally be subject to the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Acts, with a number of exceptions to provide even greater security of tenure to households.</p><p> In respect of the amendment to the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971, the proposed amendment will allow the Housing Agency to administer the new cost rental equity loan scheme.</p><p> Finally, on the issue of affordable privately provided housing, the proposed amendment will allow for the contribution of funds towards a special purpose vehicle to purchase an equity stake in homes for affordable housing provision.  The head sets out what the terms of a memorandum of agreement may provide for, including purchaser eligibility, types of dwellings, charges that may be applied, etc.</p><p> The provisions contained in the Bill, subject to their progression through the legislative process, will help provide the legal basis for the delivery of more affordable homes to eligible households under each of the programmes outlined during this year and beyond.  Importantly, these measures will not operate in isolation.  In parallel, and to help respond to housing affordability challenges, a broader range of longer term and complementary measures are in place or are being developed in line with programme for Government commitments.  Taken together, they will represent a significant and expanding level of interventions to support affordable housing provision.  We welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee on the provisions.</p></speech>

It is most important legislation and I am delighted we have an opportunity to scrutinise it.</p> <p>  A major chunk of affordable housing will obviously come from the new builds that will be delivered by the local authorities, the LDA and the approved housing bodies, AHBs.  That is most welcome.  I am fully supportive of the commitment to a new housing plan this summer.  I appreciate that the national development plan has to be reviewed and that takes a bit of time, but the new housing plan is important.  I ask Mr. Quinlan to provide us with an update on how it is progressing.  </p> <p>  In respect of the serviced sites fund, from the numbers I have seen, there is funding for more than 6,000 units, at least in the initial stage.  The local infrastructure fund is also key.  It is very important for unlocking land and for the building of affordable homes.  Will Mr. Quinlan give the committee an indication of the number of units that can potentially be funded through the local infrastructure fund?  In respect of the cost rental scheme, I know 400 units will be provided.  The affordable rental scheme will make affordable rental an option for the first time in the history of the State.  The three AHBs have been announced.  Will there be a second round of announcements for cost rental later this year?  While the scheme is very welcome, we would like to see it scaled up.  What are the Department's plans in that regard?</p> <p>  I apologise for not raising the purchase of affordable housing under Part V earlier.  I am going backwards.  Affordable housing purchase under Part V was abolished by a former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, in 2011.</p><p>What is the Department's thinking on reinstating that as an option?  </p><p> On the shared equity scheme, I understand that regulations have to set the eligibility criteria.  It is my understanding that those eligible will be people who do not qualify for social housing because their income is marginally above the social housing income thresholds.  Can Mr. Quinlan confirm that?  Will having a local connection be part of the regulations?</p><p> On the issue of repayments, having spoken to people in Dublin about this, some of them estimate they could potentially save &euro;11,000 per year.  If people can make those savings, can they repay the equity within the first five years without incurring a penalty?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.743" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Quinlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020900002#D00200"><p>I will go through the questions in the order I have them.  On the new housing plan, the Minister has signalled his intent to have that ready in the summer.  Work has commenced on it.  It will be a cross-government plan.  Within the Department, the teams are in place to review Rebuilding Ireland and to prepare the information, etc., for the new plan.  That work is under way with a timeline of the summer.  At the same time, the review of the national development plan is under way.  Again, the Department is inputting into that in terms of future investment in social, affordable and other forms of housing on a multi-annual basis.</p> <p>  With maximum funding of &euro;50,000 available per home, around 6,200 homes could be facilitated under the serviced sites fund.  So far, more than 3,000 homes have been facilitated across 14 different local authorities on the basis of the &euro;50,000 maximum funding.  To date, around half of the fund has been approved in principle.  The Minister has approved a number of sites more recently, including St. Michael's and other sites in Dublin.  </p> <p>  On the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, I will bring in my colleague, Mr. Nicholson, when I have responded to the other questions.  </p> <p>  On Part V, a review was signalled as an objective in the programme for Government.  It has been carried out by the Housing Agency and is now under consideration in the Department.  Again, depending on what changes come about as a result of that, there will be an impact on affordable housing plans going forward.  </p> <p>  In respect of the local authority equity scheme and the eligibility piece on that, the plan is to change that from what is currently in the 2009 Act to a more workable solution which will be based on individual ability to buy a home.  It is trying to link the eligibility in terms of income to an individual's ability to buy the home that is available from the local authority.  The local connection piece is a simplification, more broadly, in respect of who would be eligible.</p> <p>  On the issue of repayments, the overall objective of the equity schemes we are bringing forward is that people will own their homes.  They are help-to-buy schemes.  Therefore, the sooner people can buy out the equity share and own their homes in full, depending on how house prices go, the sooner it can be of benefit to people.  That is an objective.  In other schemes and in international comparison, we have seen significant buy-out in the first five years, so that people own their homes fully.</p> <p>  With the Chair's agreement, I will ask Mr. Nicholson to respond on the LIHAF.</p><p>Could Mr. Nicholson please cover the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.745" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Nicholson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020900002#E00200"><p>As the members will know, the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, was a scheme introduced in 2017 with &euro;200 million to fund 20 large infrastructure programmes around the country.  Those programmes intended to deliver approximately 20,000 social, more affordable and private homes.  To the end of 2020, based on incomplete data - we are still looking for figures - approximately 2,703 were homes delivered.  Of those, 1,129 had some form of cost reduction and 251 were social.  The rest were private.  Everyone accepts that the local infrastructure housing activation Fund, LIHAF, delivered more slowly than anticipated originally.  That is largely because they are very complex infrastructure programmes and take quite a deal of time.  Delivery is beginning to significantly ramp up.  We saw an announcement by Cork City Council yesterday that it was going to tender for 600 homes in Old Whitechurch Road.</p> <p>  What we are seeing around the country in respect of the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, programme, where the infrastructure comes first and the housing comes thereafter, local authorities tendering for the delivery of housing.  We expect a significant delivery of those in the next two to three years across all of those programmes.  It has been confirmed that two of the 30 will not progress based on local authority decisions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.746" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020900002#E00300"><p>I thank Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Quinlan for the presentation and the work on the legislation.  This is approximately two and a half years in gestation under two Governments, so I do not envy Mr. Quinlan and his team's difficulties in this regard.  It is also important to point out that the serviced sites fund of &euro;300 million was to deliver those 6,200 homes by the end of 2021.  That was the ministerial commitment on the D&aacute;il record.  Only &euro;2 million of it had been drawn down by December of last year.  While &euro;50 million has been allocated in budget 2021, that would only deliver 1,000 homes.  While they would be very welcome, those 1,000 homes are not under construction.</p> <p>  In terms of the serviced sites fund, how many units of accommodation, including the 50 cost rentals on Enniskerry Road, will be completed in 2021?  There will be 390 through the cost rental equity loan, but how many will be delivered and completed under the serviced sites fund this year?</p> <p>  Many of us were surprised there was not more detail in the legislation on the eligibility criteria for the serviced sites fund and the cost rental programme.  Will the Minister and the Department consider releasing the draft regulations in parallel with the Bill, when it comes before us?  All members would like to know, when we are debating and voting on the Bill in the D&aacute;il later this year, who will be eligible and within what income and what will be the criteria.  Publication of draft regulations would be very useful.</p> <p>  Is it significant that the income eligibility criteria in terms of percentage of household income has been removed and replaced by mortgage criteria for the serviced sites fund?  Why is there no consideration of clear income-related criteria for what one is paying back on the mortgage for the serviced sites fund and on the rent as opposed to market discount considerations?</p> <p>   I refer to the shared equity loan.  I will not bore people with my strong opposition to it.  People know our party's position.  Can Mr. Quinlan confirm what the entry level interest will be from year six or at least what the range is between what the Department wants, 1.5%, and the 3% proposed by the Banking and Payment Federation Ireland?  Can Mr. Quinlan confirm that the interest will increase over time and if the proposition is to index link it to something such as inflation or have a step stair ladder?  </p> <p>  Can Mr. Quinlan clarify how the shared equity loan will relate to the help to buy scheme?  The Minister indicated one would get some level of help to buy to combine with that.  Can Mr. Quinlan clarify whether or not the shared equity loan can be combined with the serviced sites fund in an affordable purchase with the Land Development Agency or a local authority?</p> <p>  I have other questions, so I ask that I be put on the list for the third round.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.747" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Quinlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020900002#E00400"><p>I will bring Mr. Nicholson in again at the end on the detail on the serviced sites fund.</p><p>Regarding the regulations, I will bring that back.  I can see exactly where the Deputy is coming from on that.  There is a move to move it.  As I said, it is the optimal in primary and regulations.  The rationale for that is really around operations.  We have had much interaction with local authorities in terms of people being able to access mortgages and so on in order to be able to buy.  I take the Deputy's point that they are extremely important so I will bring that back.  It is a fair point so we will endeavour to try to do that.</p><p> Regarding the change itself, it is very much linked, as I mentioned at the outset, to individual affordability and what is affordable for an individual in terms of buying a home that a local authority can make available.  There are many inputs into that but it ends up with an individual who we want to help to buy and a local authority-led unit that it is able to deliver.  There is much discussion around costs and so on and the Department is again looking at those closely following the SCSI report.  The lower one can get the unit cost of delivery then people will be able to buy.  We are trying to get the best value and the lowest cost for homes that are to be provided for purchase and rental.</p><p> Regarding the individual, it is very much targeted towards people who would not qualify or be eligible for social housing but would have an affordability difficulty in being able to buy or rent a home.  That is the general approach we are taking in trying to make units affordable for individual households.  We found that the legislation, as drafted, made it difficult, particularly when the macro-prudential rules came in after the 2009 Act.  In fact, one could have a situation where somebody is eligible but is not able to access the mortgage required to buy the home.  It is really about being able to operate in practice.</p><p> The final question was around the shared equity scheme.  The Government decided to fund that for this year so that units could be delivered.  That had to be done in budget 2021.  I, along with Mr. Nicholson and the team, are mandated to work with other stakeholders.  We work closely with the Department of Finance and the retail banks and engage with Homes England and others on various schemes.  As regards the detail of that, much work has gone on and much interaction has happened.  However, at this stage we have not brought those final proposals to the Minister for agreement in terms of interest rates, how they might change over time and the interaction with the help-to-buy scheme.  The proposals are very developed and we want the scheme introduced as early as possible this year, so we will be bringing them to the Minister in the next number of weeks, but they are just not quite there yet.  They are ongoing.</p><p> As regards interaction with the LDA, with the publication of the LDA Bill, we work very closely with the LDA in a number of ways on what it can do.  It is very important that it understands the various schemes as they are developed and rolled out.  We are making sure it does and will engage with the schemes.  We facilitate as much as possible in the Bill that the LDA can participate with local authorities and others in delivery of the units under the various measures.</p><p> I will bring Mr. Nicholson in on the specifics of the serviced site fund.</p></speech>

We are out of time and I am going to move to Senator Cummins.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.750" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020900002#G00100"><p>I thank Mr. Quinlan, Mr. Nicholson and all the team at the Department.  The legislation is a long time in gestation.  It is very welcome that the area is being prioritised.  If we are honest, it is probably an area that has not received a massive amount of attention as the focus has been on social housing.  The social housing output has been increasing considerably.  It takes a long time to deliver houses.  We cannot magic them out of thin air.  It takes a lot of foundations being filled and building blocks to put them all in place.  It is all very welcome.</p> <p>  On the schemes and who they are targeted at.  The legislation focuses on first-time buyers, but there is a cohort of people who lost homes at the start of the economic crisis, before we introduced fantastic schemes such as mortgage-to-rent and the changes to personal insolvency.  They have been stuck paying very high rents in recent years with no prospect of getting back on the ladder because they are unable to get a commercial mortgage again.  Is there provision in the legislation to enable us to cater for those people and families?  There are specific clauses in the case of marital breakdown but my point is more specifically related to those who lost homes at the start of the crisis.</p> <p>  The applications to the cost rental equity loan, CREL, scheme were oversubscribed.  What is the situation with the other applications?  Are we prioritising the other applications that were not successful?  The Minister announced schemes in Dublin and Cork yesterday but schemes were submitted for other urban areas, including Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  Can we prioritise those so that they can commence construction before the year end to deliver cost rental units early in 2022 rather than wait until the end of the year to get them going?</p> <p>  There has been considerable public criticism about the equity scheme for the provision of affordable homes in private estates.  Will the officials comment on this, specifically on the argument that it will result in cost inflation?  What has the Department stitched in to ensure that will not be the case?  I understand there are specific provisions to prevent the cost inflation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.751" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Quinlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020900002#G00200"><p>On eligibility and priority, we have heard a lot of feedback on how society has changed and on the need for schemes to be able to cater for new household formation.  As the Senator observed, there is some allowance for marital breakdown.  We can consider further eligibility criteria.  Predominantly, these schemes are aimed at first-time buyers.  Capacity in output is limited but we would welcome the committee's feedback on targeting schemes beyond first-time buyers.</p> <p>  On the cost rental equity loan scheme, the Minister announced the first 400 units today, which will be the first cost rental units in the State, in the Enniskerry Road development, which is led by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  That scheme was oversubscribed.</p><p>As Senator Cummins said, there are a number of other very good proposals within that, and I am in discussion with the Minister regarding them.  I think he would be minded to try to support other proposals if possible.  I think the intention would be to try to do that if we could, but at the moment it is fully subscribed.  The &euro;35 million that was allocated in budget 2021 has been fully allocated and is supported by a further &euro;100 million in loan financing from the Housing Finance Agency.</p><p> The shared equity scheme is a market-based scheme.  It is one element of the affordable proposals coming forward.  It is designed to try to boost affordability and to help people to buy in the immediate term.  As well as boosting realisable demand in the short term, it would lead to a future increased supply of housing, but that will not happen unless the people who can buy the homes are there.</p><p> We have done a significant amount of research on this, dealing with our own internal stakeholders in Ireland like the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency, and we also met Homes England.  We discussed in detail the experience in the UK, which was that the National Audit Office found that it did not hugely inflate prices on a like-for-like basis in terms of buying the same home before or after the scheme and it did lead to an increase in supply.  As I said to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, we are working on the final details of the scheme.  We very much take those points on board.  They are the key risks in a scheme like this.  We are trying to work through the detail of the scheme to mitigate those types of risk in terms of putting a cap on the price of the homes that could be bought to ensure to the greatest extent possible that we mitigate against inflation.  We have seen and heard that criticism and we have taken it on board as an important piece of feedback.  We are endeavouring to mitigate against that in the detailed design of the schemes because, obviously, that is not the objective of the scheme.</p></speech>

It is great to see them back before the committee.  I wish to focus on the affordable house purchasing scheme.  I will to refer to an article I read recently in the <i>Business Post</i>.  It raised a number of questions in which I have a particular interest and I will tee up my questions around the article.</p><p>The main points relate to the potential breach of the Central Bank mortgage rules, the potential to drive up house prices, and the potential to increase personal debt.  They were the three issues discussed in the article.  I will tee them up as four or five questions.  What assurances have been given or sought from the Central Bank that it will approve the scheme?  If not, why not?  What evidence or data does the Department have to ensure that the scheme will not increase property prices, given that we know it will do nothing to increase the supply of houses?  Will the witnesses outline for us precisely what the buyer's responsibility is in relation to the State's equity share?  That is an important issue that has been raised.  How will councils be funded for their affordable purchases?  That is also an important issue.  What risk will councils carry?</p><p>I want to touch on recent statements in the media which refer to a costs-based model but then refer to it as a scheme, which will offer rents at 25% below the discount.  Either it is a costs-based model or one which is based on reduced market prices.  Those are a few questions I would like the Department to address.</p><p> I have two comments also.  The scheme involves the buyer paying the State's equity stake in due course and it could be argued that he or she is not really getting an affordable home but will carry a burden of debt that may be more than he or she can manage, and that is something that has to be addressed.</p><p> It would be also good to know what data and model the Department has studied on a similar scheme, design or type of project.  Apparently, in the UK, there was some success but it drove up the cost of property.  I would like to hear the Department's views on that.  I heard that the Minister suggested that this was not the case but let us hear the evidence around that.</p><p> Those are my few points.  I would like to give my time to hear the answers rather than to me to keep talking on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.758" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Quinlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020900002#J00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  In terms of the shared equity scheme and the Central Bank, we are working with the Department of Finance and, as I mentioned earlier, the various stakeholders.  In terms of the engagement with the Central Bank to date, that has been led by the Department of Finance.  While the Central Bank has made some comments so far, it really needs to see the full details of the scheme to be able to make its final informed judgment.  We are working towards that but we are keeping them informed through the Department of Finance, particularly around the policy objectives of what we are trying to do, which is to help people to buy their own homes sooner than they would have been able to otherwise but, ultimately, to own their full home in as affordable a way as possible.  The Central Bank also needs to see the final details to be able to make their final judgment on it.</p> <p>  As for house prices and supply, and the international evidence, I will make a couple of points.  We have looked at the reports from the UK.  I mentioned the UK National Audit Office and it reported a double-digit increase of 14.5% in supply and a 1% increase in prices.  They were very much on a like-for-like basis.  There were some other reports but the National Audit Office report was the one that we looked at in particular.  We also met Homes England, which administers that scheme.  In the UK, more than 200,000 homes have been delivered under its equity scheme.  It is a very big scheme.  It has some differences.  We have been closely examining it in terms of what worked and perhaps elements of it that did not.  We are very much looking at both of them.</p> <p>  In terms of supply, the Ministry is engaged regularly with home suppliers in Ireland.  One issue in this regard is that we have a lot of planning permissions.  There were 47,000 approvals last year and only half of those commenced.  Our sense is that if we can help people to increase realisable demand, the supply will follow.  Obviously, some of that remains to be seen.  The plan would be to review the scheme after a year to make sure, for instance, that it was increasing supply etc., to check for inflation, to safeguard on those.  A lot of work has gone in to inform the development of the scheme and then there are safeguards in terms of the final details.  I mentioned some of those, such as price caps etc. that we are working in.  It is only when we have the final detail of the scheme that people will be able to fully judge it.</p> <p>  As for the equity stake, the plan is that people would secure a mortgage to be able to buy a large percentage of the home and then be helped to buy that final element and that the State would take an equity stake, either through local authorities or central government, and the person would buy back that stake and own his or her home fully.  In the UK model, 50% of households bought out the equity stake within the first five years when there was no interest rate on it.  At the cheapest that one could, many people got in and bought their stake.</p><p>Consequently, the participants were really helped to buy.  They got in and they got to own 100% of the home quite quickly.  We are looking at all of those issues.  We have tried to bring them all together in the design of the scheme here.</p><p> In terms of local authorities and funding, the serviced sites fund was mentioned earlier.  That is currently available to local authorities to support enabling infrastructure that can then go on to be contributed towards the delivery of affordable homes for purchase or rental.  That is a multi-annual scheme as it is but we are looking at it in the context of issues such as the review of the national development plan, NDP, and how the Exchequer might be able to support local authorities in the delivery of affordable housing moving forward.  The serviced sites fund is available already with up to &euro;50,000 per affordable home delivered.</p><p> The cost rental model is new to Ireland.  The way the homes announced today will be delivered is through State support, in terms of the cost rental equity loan up to 30%.  That is capital at the start to support the approved housing body to be able to acquire the homes.  The Housing Finance Agency has provided long-term low-cost lending to match that in order that the AHBs are able to acquire the homes.  By minimising costs, we are able to achieve - this was the minimum - 25% below market rents.  It is really a cost minimisation model whereby those savings are passed on to the renters.</p></speech>

First, if I could say, the cost rental is very positive.  It is something that we have been looking for for a long time.  Particularly, the Viennese model is one that we had proposed.  The tenure security that is contained in it and the link in the rental review are excellent.  If we could see that across the entire private rented sector as well, it would be marvellous.  I know that is beyond our scope here.  Could Mr. Quinlan explain what the term "equity return" means and what that equity return would be used for?</p></speech>

In the first instance, most of these developments would be explicitly on balance sheet and in some way subvented by the State.  That, obviously, has a particular limitation in terms of the amount of funds that might be made available.  What we want to do over the longer term is get proof of concept as to how the model works and then introduce, and make it attractive, to the likes of international pension schemes.  At the same time, we want to put a limit on what those returns might be in order to prevent the resulting impact on rents and the required level of cost rents.  Typically, internationally, there would be an allowance for a level of return and pension funds might look for 3% or 4% return on their level of investment.  What we are trying to do in the legislation is to provide for the Minister, in the future, to put a cap or regulation on what that level of return might be to expand beyond purely the State sector into private finance such as international pension funds to deliver much greater numbers at scale.</p></speech>

Effectively, the Minister would designate a cost rental tenancy.  There would have to be an agreement, obviously, under the legislation, with the Minister as to what those costs would be.  The Minister could set a regulation, for instance, to say that any private funds put in to developing cost rental units would have a maximum return of 4% or 5%, or something like that.</p><p>The legislation, as we see it, is modelled to a significant extent on that in Vienna.  We got translations of that legislation and we talked to our colleagues over there, and this resulting legislation is informed by the approach they have taken.  It basically allows the Minister to temper private returns on long-term investment in cost rental units.</p></speech>

Does the rent become the equity return once the initial costs have been covered?</p></speech>

There would have to be an open book policy, similar to what we have just gone through regarding the cost rental equity loan, CREL, where the providers demonstrate all their costs and those costs are then vetted, effectively.  In the case of the CREL, that would be the Housing Agency, and these loans would be vetted for accuracy and maintained then over a long time.  When we identify the total costs involved in a development, therefore, we can then see what is coming out the other end in respect of the number of units being made available and the level of rent which must be set in those units to repay those identified costs.  It is really an open book scenario, where designation for cost rental requires the provision of proof that all regulations have been adhered to etc.</p> <p>  As I said, the equity aspect is more a longer-term element in respect of trying to harness the private sector after we get proof of concept for all the ongoing projects.  It is effectively, though, a case of trying to set the scene for that to happen.  We will learn the best way of doing this as we go through CREL and some of the Land Development Agency units.  We are working with the European Investment Bank, EIB, now on some of this material, and a report is due relatively shortly on the optimum financing model for cost rental.  Once we get these initial units up and running, that report will inform us about how best to structure the system to achieve an economy of scale in larger numbers over what we hope will be a relatively short time.</p></speech>

It may be accommodated in regulations, but it is absolutely something we must think about.  A broader question is contained within this issue that goes beyond housing and into the areas of pensions policy and the welfare system.  It is a question which must be addressed.  Most of our concentration from the outset, however, has focused on getting this initiative up and running and getting this system established so we can deliver units and house people.  Some of those issues regarding the longer term direction of pensions, housing and welfare policy must be addressed in the round.  I do not have an immediate answer to that question, therefore.</p></speech>

I will read some quotes from officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding their thoughts on this shared equity loan part of the Bill.  One official stated that the:</p> <blockquote> 	... key point is that this is a demand led scheme.  [The Department of Finance] and [the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage] have spoken to banks and developers who apparently suggest that it will unlock supply.  We think it will push up prices in a supply constrained environment, most likely at a time when prices are starting to rise anyway. </blockquote> <p>Another senior official wrote that:</p> <blockquote> 	Apart from the concerns we already voiced ... around the appropriateness of the shared equity scheme, which appears to us a demand side measure which is unnecessary in a market like ours which is chronically undersupplied, it does not appear that the policy proposal has been sufficiently analysed. </blockquote> <p>She went on to say that, &quot;An effective affordable housing policy would deliver the right types of units in the right location at an appropriately affordable price&quot;.  In addition, another senior official stated that, &quot;The property industry want[s] an equity scheme because it will increase prices&rdquo;.</p><p>In that context, where is the analysis for this scheme and can we see whatever analysis that has been done by the Department?  This is important, because serious questions have been raised about this scheme.  Can we see the analysis that the Department has done which justifies the equity loan part of this Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.776" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Quinlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020900002#L00800"><p>The Department has been looking at this proposal from our perspective, as have the Department of Finance and the banks from their side of things.  We did significant work on it ourselves and in conjunction with the Housing Agency.</p><p>We were looking at it in the Department and the Department of Finance and the banks were also looking at it from their perspective.  We were doing significant work on it ourselves and with the Housing Agency.  We would have measures that would bring affordability in the medium to longer term, and what we were looking at from a policy perspective was whether one could boost supply in the short term on the basis of it being a demand-led scheme designed to turn potential demand into realisable demand and through that process then to boost supply.  It would give assurances to the construction sector that if it builds homes that they would actually be sold.  When we look at the planning permissions that have turned to commencements and been sold, they are based on a certainty around demand, whether that is demand from the private sector in terms of purchase or from the State in terms of social housing, student housing and other housing.  The housing that has worked to deliver the supply tends to be based on a high certainty of demand.  That linkage was a key policy consideration.</p><p> Significant analysis has been carried out.  That is very much part of the deliberative process at the moment.  The Minister has yet to finalise his proposals in terms of the underlying detail of the scheme.  That is close to finalisation, but it has not been finalised yet.  There would be commercial sensitivity in terms of the various elements.  I do not think it would be appropriate to release those at this time, but that may change as time passes and decisions are made.  The funding has been set aside so that this could be delivered, and units could be delivered this year.  We are working now with the various stakeholders to put in place the details of the scheme, but the Minister has yet to sign off on them.  This is designed as one of the overall suite of measures.</p></speech>

It is important that there has been a significant critique of this aspect of the Bill, both from the perspective of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and also a significant critique on it in the UK.  As we are doing pre-legislative scrutiny, it is very important that we would see the analysis from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage that justifies this measure.  It is very important for the committee to see that, so I would request that we could see the analysis.  I do not see why there should be commercially sensitive information given that it is a public policy proposal, but if there is then we do not need to see that part of the analysis.  The Department should let us see the rest of the analysis.</p> <p>  I wish to ask one final question.  It has been said quite a bit today and also elsewhere that the 2019 report from the National Audit Office in the UK states that price inflation is only 1%.  That is not my read of that report.  On page 34 of the report it talks about the price premium paid by people who availed of the scheme in the UK, but it does not say that price inflation was just 1%.  In fact, the report states that price inflation during the scheme from 2013 to December 2018 in England was 41%.  Could Mr. Quinlan clarify what part of the report he was referring to in the context of his reference to price inflation being just 1%?  I can only see a reference to a price premium of 1%, which is a totally different thing from price inflation.</p></speech>

In terms of that point, we are very sensitive to this, and the last thing we would want to do is increase house prices and not have an impact on supply.  That is not the intent.  We discussed this in detail when we spoke to representatives of Homes England.  They are the people who have delivered this scheme and Homes England has supported home purchase to the tune of more than 200,000 in the UK.</p><p>Their sense of it was that when the same unit is compared - a person buying a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Dublin, for example, where the median price at present is around &euro;355,000 - the person buying the same unit supported by the scheme did not see any significant inflation on that unit.  That is the feedback we received directly from Homes England when we spoke to its representatives.</p><p> However, there are many homes in it and many different things, so it must be safeguarded.  We have made this point to home builders in Ireland who have looked for this scheme.  Many of them did and said that supply would respond to the realisable demand.  We have received many assurances, and some of them would be large plcs and so forth, that they would be willing to show that there was no price inflation if a scheme like this was put in place.  That would be very important.  As I said earlier, the plan would be that the scheme would be reviewed after perhaps a year of operation just to safeguard that those unintended consequences had not occurred.</p><p> What the scheme is designed to do is to boost realisable or actual demand.  We are hearing that, given the house prices we have for new homes, particularly in places such as Dublin, people are being approved but perhaps not approved for a sufficient mortgage to be able to buy those homes.  That is really the policy intent and we are going to put in every safeguard we can to the detailed design of the scheme, and then we, along with other stakeholders, are going to monitor the scheme's operation very carefully.  There was a good and correct exchange across the Government in bringing this proposal forward.  Those points have been taken on board and every effort is being made to safeguard against those potential risks.</p></speech>

It is very kind of the Deputy to let me contribute.  Affordable housing and affordable cost rental have been probably the biggest issues I have faced as a councillor and now as a Deputy.  We want a robust and fair affordable housing and cost rental scheme, but there is a major lack of detail and information in the scheme here.  The witness made a point about the Central Bank giving its judgment.  For us to give our judgment, we would need that type of detail.  There was mention earlier about the families who are trapped in the middle.  These families cannot get on the social housing list because they earn too much and they cannot get a mortgage from a bank because they are not earning enough.  We must deliver affordable housing for these people, because they are trapped and have been waiting.  There has been talk about an affordable housing scheme for years, but we could be looking at months if not years more before this delivers houses.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a point on which Mr. Quinlan or Mr Nicholson can respond.  Cork City Council owes &euro;36 million on unsold affordable houses from the previous downturn.  It also owes &euro;36 million on land it purchased to build social and affordable houses.  Cork City Council, alone, owes at least &euro;72 million.</p><p>If the council owes that, I imagine most other local authorities have similar debts for either unsold social or affordable housing and land that they purchased to build housing.  We want this to continue, but how can local authorities move ahead when they have this large debt hanging over them?</p><p> Can we get more clarity about the criteria for how people will qualify?  Then there are the issues of what affordable houses will be, because I am from Cork and, obviously, Cork will be different from Dublin, Limerick and Galway.  We need affordable housing that will work for everyone.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.790" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Quinlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020900002#O00200"><p>In the first instance, we work closely with Cork City Council.  The council has been to the fore in trying to deliver affordable housing, and we work closely with the team there on Boherboy and other sites.  Boherboy will be one of the first sites that will come forward for affordable purchase under the new scheme.  In addition, a great deal of support will be given to the council under the serviced sites fund and under LIHAF, as Mr. Nicholson mentioned earlier.  One part of trying to help councils is the Exchequer funding towards delivery.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point regarding unsold affordable housing.  It is not universal.  There is quite a rump in Cork, but it was not the same everywhere.  Part of that was because it was a very successful scheme there and there were many units.  Obviously, when circumstances changed, the situation with those units changed.  As I understand it, they are predominantly used at present for social housing, so they are being utilised for an important purpose.  That is important.</p> <p>  I also take the Deputy's point about land.  Again, land was generally bought by local authorities on the basis of it then being used for social or affordable housing.  As things turned, some local authorities were left with land debt and land that was not capable of being developed at the time.  A large amount of that land has now been worked through the various programmes in terms of social housing and so forth.  There are some lands left.  We also had the land aggregation scheme, which helped local authorities with the debt issue.  There are some local authorities left that have significant land debt and no immediate pathway for the development of those lands for financial reasons.  We are working on that with the CCMA at national level, so we are trying to work through some of those issues.  However, I take the Deputy's point about them being legacy issues in the sector.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Nicholson to respond on the point about eligibility.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.791" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Nicholson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020900002#O00300"><p>As we said, the detailed criteria have to be finalised, but we can give the shape of our thinking.  On both affordable purchase schemes, it is intended that they would be targeted at those who can afford the home with the equity stake.  If one is in a position where one can afford any home that is made available, depending on the area, through a standard mortgage, one is not eligible.  If someone is on an income level where he or she cannot afford to buy that home and it is a home that is suitable for his or her needs - they are all modest - he or she is in the space of being eligible, if the equity stake that is available can bridge the gap.  They are the general criteria.  Measures on affordability can be very blunt instruments if one gives a straight percentage, so what we suggest is that we try to develop the schemes around the individual.  We say affordability is not a question of how much, but how much is too much for whom and in what circumstances.  That is the broad model we are trying to use in the affordable purchase schemes.</p> <p>  On cost-rental, again the criteria are not finalised, but the likely lower threshold will be those who are not eligible for social housing, somewhere around the space of middle income earners just over the gap.  We have not fixed on the higher threshold.  Obviously, it is going to be informed by the ultimate rents, and the rents are informed by the cost of construction and the level of subvention provided.  However, we can explicitly say that it will be hard-pushed middle income earners.</p> <p>  I wish to clarify the affordable purchase scheme and some of the references earlier to the UK.  It is important to say that the affordable purchase scheme, at present, would probably only assume approximately 1% of the transactions in the market, and perhaps a little above.</p><p>Compared to some of the other schemes it is relatively low in terms of its capacity to impact on inflation more broadly.  If it is only 1% of housing transactions per year or a little over, it is relatively low.  I can comment more on the UK scheme in terms of the 1% figure.  The people referenced were explicit around the inflationary effect being 1%.  In fact, when they looked at it in detail, they referred to some of the other published reports that analysed the help-to-buy scheme.  They commented that those reports referred to inflation rates of between 5% and 20%.  They looked specifically at those reports and found that the estimates did not compare similar properties and so did not accurately assess any additional premium paid by those using the scheme.</p></speech>

I will give some time at the end of my contribution because he was making an important point.</p> <p>  It is clear from discussions at the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage that probably all of us have a little scepticism around any measures that are coming in terms of interfering with the property market.  That is totally correct given the experience so many of us have had at local authority and Government level with property developers in the past, perhaps with unfinished housing estates and the property market generally.  It will be critical for us to get the information to give us a certain comfort level.  When we get the detail of the scheme, it will put us all in a different position.  I hope that when we get the EIB report, it will help us all as well.</p> <p>  A report from the London School of Economics is referenced.  One of our concerns as parliamentarians is that there is no one source of information on the EU scheme that has not been in some way criticised.  Of course, that is natural because that is what happens when governments bring in schemes.  One statement Mr. Nicholson made that stuck with me was the reference to hard-pushed middle-income earners.  This question is one all of us on the committee are here to help to resolve.</p> <p>  Mr. Quinlan has gone through with much detail the schemes we have been focused on, namely, the cost rental and shared equity schemes.  I have two quick questions on each of these.  Will Mr. Quinlan give a little more information around why HAP tenants are excluded from cost-rental?  Again, there is a push to try to get to the middle-income earner who might otherwise be caught in the private rental trap.  Will Mr. Quinlan give us a little more information around how the long-term tenure leases are going to be built into schemes?  What level of information is available at this stage?</p> <p>  My next question is on the shared equity scheme.  Is it possible for Mr. Quinlan to spell out the &euro;75 million that has been allocated?  How will that be drawn down? When will it be available to be drawn down?  What is it likely to yield in terms of house buyers and home buyers who would be able, hopefully, to afford their own homes?  Is there information around how the cap will be determined at local authority level?  When will that information be announced?</p> <p>  That is important from my perspective.  My thanks to the officials for going through this.  It is highly detailed and there is so much information on it.  Mr. Quinlan, Mr. Nicholson and their team have shown themselves to be real experts and I really value that.</p></speech>

I will comment on cost rental generally.  This is a point I made at the start in terms of social housing and HAP.  We really want to distinguish cost rental in particular at the outset as a new form of tenure.  What is proposed is that this will not be social housing at the start.  It will be separate and distinct and more targeted at the squeezed middle, the people who do not qualify for social housing but who have affordability challenges.  At the outset, that is important to note.  We have put in a safeguard so that if a person's circumstances change, and after a period he or she goes from private cost rental on to social housing where the rent was being paid through HAP, then it would be facilitated so that the person would not necessarily lose the tenancy.  That is an important element of it.  At the outset, we want the scheme designated for the people it is targeted at, which is a different cohort.</p><p>That is the rationale behind that.</p><p> There was a question about the &euro;75 million.  It was an important signal of intent for the Government and the Minister in budget 2021.  It has given momentum and impetus to us in our work in trying to design the scheme and have it operational this year.  It will depend on the amount of equity stake that the State would take in an individual property.  It depends on how many home buyers can be supported.  The scope is in the thousands.  We see it beginning this year in the low thousands or perhaps hundreds - these are the numbers.  As Mr. Nicholson said, that is the scope generally contemplated for the scheme at the moment.  It is a targeted, immediate measure to boost realisable demand and supply in the short to medium term.  A good deal of planning permission has not commenced.  Mr. Nicholson may wish to address the other technical question.</p></speech>

Deputy Higgins asked about the shared equity scheme.  What we are informing ourselves with around eligibility is effectively the first-time buyer new home median price for the past rolling 12 months.  We are informing ourselves by geographic area.  We are trying to ensure that development happens in the places where we want development.</p> <p>  I will bring in the point again around the suggestion that there are no income caps.  By virtue of the handbrake of requiring that individuals avail of full eligible mortgages under the macroprudential rules, house price caps are set.  If a buyer can afford a house at normal market prices, the buyer will not be eligible for the scheme.  That is a fairly significant difference from the scheme in the UK.  There is a handbrake relating to income caps and those income caps are discrete to the individual.</p> <p>  Again, the national planning framework influenced price caps.  We intend to ensure that we have developments in the areas where we want them and that we do not have sprawl whenever we can prevent it.</p> <p>  I will come back to the cost rental question.  A question was asked about HAP tenants.  Effectively, there is a limited available budget for particular measures.  Cost rental is explicitly targeted at earners, people who have the capacity to cover the cost rent and cover the development over the long term.  Then, as it matures, it becomes more beneficial to the ultimate renter and more sustainable.  That is the reason for the provision, in short.</p> <p>  There is also an element of ensuring we have a good blend of tenants across social, cost rental, private, affordable and whatever it may be.  Indeed, some of the cost rental programmes we are working on will be approved.  The 390 units referenced yesterday are in developments where there will also be social tenants.</p> <p>  I will comment on leases and the types of leases.  We are working off security of tenure.  Again, we will learn from this as we go in the roll-out of the cost rental equity loan.  Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act provides long-term tenure for individuals.  Typically, six-year leases would be the intent.  Again, we will learn from that and it is our opening gambit in terms of ensuring we can get these schemes up and running and in place.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.799" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Nicholson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020900002#Q00400"><p>Deputy O'Callaghan was referring to the premium in the UK schemes.  I cannot remember the exact figure but there was a particular premium.  I think the premium referred to in the report was the fact that these were newly built homes as opposed to second-hand homes.  Straight up, there is a new-build premium for new-build homes as opposed to second-hand homes purely based on efficiency and the increased standards that have come in over the years.  It did not relate to an inflationary effect.  The report referred to house inflation in the round over a long period when it referred to the higher percentage rather than house inflation for homes that were bought with an equity stake as compared to equivalent homes that were bought without an equity stake.  Our reading of it, backed up by our conversations with officials in the UK, was that there was a like-for-like increase of 1%.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said, there are various reports available that give different takes on that, and the matter is open for debate and discussion and so on.</p><p>What we have learned from it is we have put as many handbrakes in the system, if I could call it that, to make sure that, in the round, the system does not lend itself toward house price inflation, while trying to deliver on those two goals of increased supply - the UK scheme increased supply by 14.5% - and increased levels of home ownership.  However, as all present have recognised, there is a necessity to make sure we include the appropriate checks and balances.</p></speech>

I have no doubt there will be more questions on that issue.  There will be time for such questions.</p></speech>

In some ways, that gives me an opportunity to reflect on some of the suggestions being made, in particular members of the committee who are in opposition.  Effectively, what the affordable housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill are doing is giving tools to local authorities to develop mixed-income and mixed-tenure estates for the first time in a long time.  Significant amounts of public money have been put in to allow land owned by local authorities to be developed.   Where that is not possible, the LDA has been given the opportunity to develop other public lands.</p> <p>  Part of the issue is that it is a significant departure to allow public lands be developed for public housing.  Part of the reason some Opposition members are focusing on the shared equity purchase loan, which forms a very small part of the Bill, is that it is a significant departure and a substantial attempt by the State to provide affordability.  The shared equity loan scheme accounts for 2% of the total housing budget for next year.  On the affordability element, the elements not related to that scheme account for 84% of the total spending to provide affordability.  In reality, the shared equity scheme is a short-term measure with a review clause and regional price caps, which is limited to first-time buyers and is not comparable to the UK scheme, yet much of the debate on the Bill has focused on that rather than on the 84% of spending that provides affordability.  </p> <p>  My questions are on managing delivery because local authorities now have no excuses to fail to develop lands in their control.  They cannot now argue that mixed-income or mixed-tenure is not provided for, that the financial models are not there or that it is not on a statutory footing.  What will the Department do in terms of managing its expectation for local authorities to deliver using all of these schemes?</p></speech>

Significant work has been done by Mr. Nicholson and his team, working with the serviced sites fund.  Many of those schemes are now much closer to being able to start to deliver.  It is actually very timely.  We recently met the CCMA, whom we meet all the time, regarding the publication of the Bill in particular.  The feedback we are getting is that, as was mentioned throughout the discussion today, affordable housing is in significant demand across council chambers, particularly in the greater Dublin area and other cities where housing affordability is an important issue.  My sense is that local authorities are absolutely committed to delivering and being the key delivery partner and facilitator of affordable housing.  We are now working through that with them, building on the pipeline that is there in the serviced sites fund.  We are working on that with reference to what could be delivered over several years.  Much of that is being factored in to the work we are doing on the Minister's detailed housing for all plan, which will, as I stated, come on stream in the summer, while, in parallel, looking at the funding streams.  It is obvious that local authorities have a very important role.</p> <p>  We will also work closely with AHBs on the new cost-rental scheme.  There is significant commitment across the AHB sector to deliver affordable housing.</p><p> We regularly meet the LDA.  It is and will be increasingly important for it to understand in detail the various schemes and the role of local authorities as housing authorities and planning authorities, as well as how it can contribute in terms of, for example, the 400,000 homes that are available from its immediate land bank.  As the Deputy stated, it will also be increasingly important for the LDA to be able to aggregate land, including public land, and develop into the future in that regard.  As we now have the tools in the toolkit, as the Deputy put it, and given the funding that is and will be available, we will be working through those detailed plans with local authorities, AHBs and the LDA.</p></speech>

Local councillors often do not have transparency in that regard.  The argument is sometimes made that a submission has been sent in and the Department is approving it.  We need to make sure that there is more transparency in that regard so that the real ambition of local council officials is actually tested.</p></speech>

It is fantastic to see these provisions for affordable housing.  I am especially happy that the Bill will, for the first time, enshrine the definition of cost rental into Irish law, which is most welcome from the perspective of the Green Party.  I do have some clarifying questions relating to cost rental and the shared equity scheme.  Some of them have probably been covered to some extent but I will go at them again.</p> <p>  With regard to the definition of cost rental tenancy and the term "equity returns" which is included in the Bill, do the witnesses agree that this makes or may make cost rental indistinguishable from the private rental sector?  If so, can the terminology be amended to mirror the limited profit regulation under the Vienna model, if that is what the European model is, such that we are not pushing it and making it a private sector kind of model but, rather, more going down the line of the Vienna model?</p> <p>  My next question may have been answered already.  Once the up-front cost of cost rental delivery has been repaid, what will happen to the rental price?  How will that money then be used?</p> <p>  Can the witnesses provide any examples of the new shared equity scheme?  How do they think it will work on private and local authority lands, respectively?  In what way will it improve housing supply?  Has the Department worked out models of how this will play out?</p> <p>  Will the cost rental equity loans and other supports for cost rental only be made available to public bodies, AHBs and non-profit housing providers?</p></speech>

At the outset, cost rental is designed to be a completely new form of tenure rather than just being market-based private rental sector, PRS.  Whatever safeguards are needed within the legislation for that to be clear will be provided.  As Mr. Nicholson outlined earlier, the intention is very much to be clear to funders about the level of returns that will be tolerated.  The intention is to put the shape on that.  As the rents are so linked to the costs, it is critical that the allowable costs are clearly defined.  Whatever is needed to be clear in that regard will be provided and we will definitely take the feedback from the committee into account.</p> <p>  I might bring in Mr. Nicholson on the longer-term financing piece around cost rental.  Part of that relates to the Vienna model.  We have given the Vienna model a significant amount of consideration.  It really is an incredible model, not just because the cost rental there is so effective, but it is often voted as one of the best places in the world in which to live.  Much of that has to do with the fact that they got housing right to a large extent.  It is a very successful model, but the authorities there have been pursuing it for a long time.  As such, there is a significant amount of stock for which the costs would have been divvied up.  The front-end costs would have reduced over time.  There is a whole piece around the long-term sustainable financing element.</p><p>It is possible when one builds up scale over time.  The income from the cost rental projects will allow for the funding of new projects.  I will bring Mr. Nicholson in later on that point.</p><p> In regard to the shared equity scheme and supply, the concept is a simple one at its base in that, as I said, supply tends to respond to demand, but a realisable rather than theoretical demand.  In terms of the launch of various schemes, there are schemes around Dublin that are delivering, but not the types of numbers that we need to be able to reach the output levels that we require.  The proposal is that to the greatest extent possible we seek to facilitate people to buy those new units.  As mentioned by Mr. Nicholson, these are, or can be, more costly units because much of the time they are premium units built under the new standards.  The median price in Dublin for a first-time buyer is approximately &euro;355,000.  As I said, the objective is to facilitate more people to buy and realise their homeownership sooner.  As supply responds to realisable demand - also known as definite demand - the response would come.  The supply response is capable of being delivered because the planning permissions are in place.  There are schemes that are delivering.  We will deliver 21,000 homes this year.  The estimated need is approximately 33,000 homes per year, so there is a gap.  We are trying to bridge that gap by bringing realisable demand to the market.  </p><p> I will bring in Mr. Nicholson at this point to address the longer-term financing piece around cost rental.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.810" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Nicholson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020900002#T00200"><p>We looked at the Vienna model.  We had its regulations translated to inform us and we also spoke to the relevant people.  The Vienna model has a couple of different delivery streams.  Broadly speaking, it allows for a return of approximately 3.5%, in the same way as we are catering for some form of percentage of a return.  To a decent degree, we are mirroring what Vienna intends to do, but are open to reviewing the regulations as we go in terms of the work we are doing with the EIB.</p> <p>  On the question regarding what happens to units in the longer term, as things stand we have a few different delivery methods or potential delivery methods.  We can deliver through the LDA, through local authorities via the serviced site fund and through approved housing bodies with CREL.  Each of those would have characteristics of its own.  However, we are intending that these would be long-term units.  For example, on Enniskerry Road there is a long-term covenant.  I cannot recall the exact details, but I think it is 150 years.  The scheme at, say, Shanganagh would go to the LDA for 150 years.  In short, developments that are supported either by CREL or other Government funds will stay in the system for a long time.  Typically, as those systems mature all sorts of scenarios such as cost subsidisation and more competitive rents develop and this allows the bodies involved to generate more equity or loans for them to develop more housing based on the returns they get from the units.  They would be getting a level of rent over and above what it is costing to manage particular units.  That is a long-term transition.  It is 30 to 50 years hence, but we are factoring in that those units that are supported stay in cost rental for a significant period of time and, in many cases, in perpetuity.</p></speech>

My question is on behalf of Deputy Flaherty, who has recently joined the committee.  He has asked me to thank the Department for the work it has done.  He is particularly interested in hearing feedback from the witnesses on how the shared equity scheme will work to stimulate the provision of affordable homes in rural counties such as his home county, Longford.  The issue, as he has explained it to me, is that there is a real challenge with the sale price being below the cost of building locally.</p><p>That is a real barrier to the delivery of housing.  Deputy Flaherty would like the witnesses to advise on how the Bill and the initiatives therein will address that issue.</p></speech>

I am concerned that cost rental is not exempt from the principle of mixed income and mixed tenure.  Obviously, mixed tenure would not apply.  We cannot allow middle-class enclaves to develop for cost rental.  It is not in spirit with any other element of development.  It is very important for senior citizens, retired persons within schemes or nominations by local authorities of tenants into schemes that the principle of mixed income is adhered to within any cost rental scheme.  I accept it is the overall model that we are seeking to approve here but we need to ensure the principle of mixed income applies in the same way as it does in a private housing estate, a social housing estate and an affordable housing estate.</p></speech>

I will start with the question on cost rental.  I accept Deputy McAuliffe's point.  From a policy perspective, I have worked in social housing for a long time and I have a lot of experience in that area.  Everything we are trying to do around affordable housing would be complementary to social housing.  We are seeking to build sustainable long-term communities.  The cost rental projects that are being brought forward include significant elements of social housing as well.  More broadly, we will be working with local authorities as housing and planning bodies to ensure cost rental is part of thriving, sustainable communities.  In the first instance, it is important to get the cost rental model up and running.  One of the points made to us by people in Vienna that have worked in cost rental for years is that it is really important to get started and build up the stock.  Over time, cost rental units should be part of thriving communities.</p> <p>  In terms of older people and people with disabilities, this matter also comes within the remit of my new division within the Department.  I know from working with local authorities that they want to integrate all forms of housing into the communities of the future.  I take on board the point made.  It will be a key part of the schemes as they come forward that to the greatest extent possible they bring all forms of housing together in communities.</p> <p>  On the question of rural counties, if I am not mistaken County Longford has the lowest median and mean house prices in the State.  The all-in median figure is &euro;108,000 and for first-time buyers it is &euro;130,000.  In that type of scenario, it is difficult for new-build products to compete with the existing housing available.  In the first instance - we touched on this earlier - it is important that the State targets its affordability measures towards the parts of the country that are experiencing the most extreme affordability challenges, such as the greater Dublin area and the other cities.  There is an understanding within the Department that other measures are needed over time to support new home building in parts of the country where that is not currently viable.  It is a slightly different issue from affordability.  In terms of current rural house prices, affordability is not the issue.  It is more about the viability of building a new unit versus what is available from the market.</p></speech>

We cannot forget that the goal should always be to have mixed tenure.  We saw the problems which existed in the past when we focused on one type of tenure.  Let us not forget private development in that context.  The mantra that seems to be put forward all the time now is that the approach taken must be the construction of social and affordable houses.  Private housing is also an essential part of the mix, however.  This endeavour cannot just have two elements in operation.  We should try to ensure in everything we do in the area of development that we have social, affordable and private housing.  I do not buy into the narrative being painted by some people that development must be focused on just two of those three aspects.</p><p> In that regard, there are areas in the country, especially in my constituency of Waterford, where the collapse in the housing market meant we only had social housing developments, because that was the only housing being built in recent years.  We have excellent infrastructure, such as roads, schools and libraries, but we just have social housing.  Private housing has not followed.  I see the affordable housing product as a way of stimulating private development and ensuring we have a mix of those three strands in areas.</p><p> If we are in search of such a circumstance where ownership is in the hands of private owners, how do we stimulate that aspect, aside from the equity side of things?  Will the county councils be able to work with private developers to ensure we get mixed and varied developments?  I am also acutely conscious of those areas of the country where the local authorities do not have land banks.  How do we address that situation?</p><p> The cost rental model has got a good bit of airing from Mr. Nicholson, and he has explained it quite a lot in respect of the goal of getting to the pension funds and expanding these schemes.  We cannot scale up this scheme and the product solely on balance sheet through the AHBs.  We are trying to prove the model, as has been said, but the only way we can really get scale in this regard - and it can be achieved quickly - is via attracting finance through pension funds examining a 40-year term of investment and in turn giving people security of tenure for 40 years.  This approach can and will work in Ireland, but we must look at loosening the rules in this context and our sole focus on the AHBs, although I appreciate that we are first trying to prove the model.</p></speech>

When we look at this situation in the context of housing policy, we look at it from the perspective of citizens and social housing, and people who require assistance in that regard.  Those eligible for affordable housing are a different group of people who would not be eligible for social housing, but who can have difficulty accessing the market.  There is also an element of housing provision where the market can respond and people have sufficient incomes to enable them to buy or rent a housing product.</p> <p>  Overall, from a planning perspective and in the context of the national planning framework, the vision is for mixed communities which really work.  As I said, we must ensure some special areas of housing, such as housing for people with disabilities and older people, are integrated.  These are exactly the types of conversations that we have with our colleagues in planning and with the local authorities concerning the implementation of these various mechanisms to build communities.  The private part of this policy, therefore, is encompassed in two ways.  First, in the area of planning, there is a role for the local authorities in planning overall development in an area.  Second, the approach that has been successful in social housing is an element that will be available in this context.  I refer to local authorities having multiple mechanisms to make affordable housing available.  Those mechanisms can work, and if the local authorities have problems with land, they can have various partnerships to deliver the same product.  Consumers get affordable houses sooner, and the local authority has a mechanism which it can access more quickly and which allows it to deliver housing more quickly.</p><p>Turning to the development sector, the homes are generally built by the same builders.  Much of this approach involves giving certainty in respect of demand and that the product will be taken up.  That is what we are trying to do in working with the local authorities, AHBs and the LDA.  </p><p> There is a very co-ordinated approach in the Department, and all the policies and programmes seek to complement each other.  We were really careful, in respect of cost rental and other things, to ensure cognisance is taken of the other policy objectives regarding social housing, private development more generally and, ultimately, the planning requirements for areas.  </p><p> There has been much discussion regarding pension funds, and there are two sides to this issue.  The Senator is correct about the issue of capacity and that it becomes an issue when there is a deficit in the provision of the numbers of homes we need.  We must in that context open as many channels as possible for that delivery.  On the other hand, as we discussed previously, we must also carefully manage those approaches so the costs do not render the cost-rental model of housing as unaffordable as it would have been if we did not manage this area.  There are two sides to this issue, therefore, but I take the Senator's point regarding overall capacity.  </p></speech>

I think we have covered everybody due to speak in that round.  I will follow up briefly on the point made by Senator Cummins on the public-private mix in trying to achieve the target of building the 33,000 units we need each year, initially anyway.  Where the State invests significantly in the provision of infrastructure, and especially in public transport, it also provides an economic benefit to private landowners.  We must ensure that the value added in that context is captured by the State and not the landowner, through mechanisms such as a site value tax and-or special contribution levies.  I call Deputy &Oacute; Broin, who is first up for the third round of questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.821" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020900002#W00300"><p>I would like Mr. Nicholson to answer briefly my first question regarding how many homes he expects to be completed this year under the serviced sites fund, which is obviously separate to the issue of cost-rental equity loans.  There has also been some confusion regarding what is known as the help-to-buy premium, which is part of the British scheme, and the impact of shared equity schemes on inflation.  Mr. Nicholson has outlined that the help-to-buy premium is the difference between two comparable properties, one of which was bought with a shared equity loan and one which was not.  As Deputy Cian O'Callaghan rightly pointed out, that is not an aspect that we are concerned about; we are concerned with the overall impact of shared equity loans on house price inflation.  Those are two fundamentally different things.</p> <p>  I have furnished the committee with a reference to a report by the London School of Economics because it is the most up-to-date empirical academic study on this topic.  It concludes that the impact of shared equity loans on house price inflation in London, where demand is highest, is 6%.  Across England and Wales overall, the rate of inflation is between 3% and 5%.  While the study found that while the shared equity loan scheme in Britain increased supply, it also explicitly states that the resulting increased supply was provided in the wrong areas.  In many cases, it was on the Welsh-English border and not in the major urban centres, where affordability was most difficult.  The report went on to say that hard-pressed working families, which it calls "cash-constrained households", did not benefit from the scheme, and "Only developers or landowners, not new buyers, benefited from the policy".  I appreciate that Deputies and Senators supporting the Government must defend its policy in this committee.  I understand that, but all I ask them to do is to read this report, because it shows that in areas of high demand house, price inflation is driven up and those people we all want to help do not benefit. </p> <p>  I will make one small correction to what Deputy McAuliffe said.  Of the three schemes we are dealing with today, the shared equity loan scheme is the largest, at &euro;75 million of public expenditure this year.  The serviced sites fund will have &euro;50 million in expenditure this year and cost rental is &euro;35 million.  The shared equity loan scheme, therefore, accounts for almost half the affordable housing expenditure in this year.</p><p>He is right that we should look at all three but shared equity is much bigger than the other two on their own.  That being the case, perhaps Mr. Nicholson can give me a direct answer on how many serviced sites fund homes will be delivered this year.</p></speech>

I must add that that was pre-Covid so obviously there has been an impact from the pandemic but we know for certain that homes will be delivered in Boherboy.  I would caveat that by saying that, in a similar way to LIHAF, when initial proposals come in, they are largely concepts.  The Minister has kind of flagged this frustration with the speed of development himself.  The proposals go from concept to detailed design, planning, procurement and then there is the construction period.  Typically, infrastructure comes first and houses second but to be frank delivery has been slower than everyone would like.  The Minister has said-----</p></speech>

Just to flag future development, local authorities are telling us at the moment that there will be about 700 in 2022 and close to 1,500 in 2023.  We have approved, overall, funding for approximately 4,000 units.  In terms of a very similar scheme we are now seeing payback from LIHAF in the form of homes being delivered.  Again, it is slower than everyone would have anticipated and wanted but at the moment we have homes available in Adamstown for between &euro;300,000 and &euro;320,000, somewhere around 300 homes.  Meath, Glanmire, Cherry Bank and a number of programmes are due to be delivered and that will increase over the next year or two.  A number of those homes, and a significant number in some cases, will be cost-reduced.  Some will be relatively modest cost reductions and some more significant.  They will be sold under the provisions of the 2009 Act and the shared equity scheme.  On another point------</p></speech>

There are some very significant ones around Guinness Lands and Curragower.  I must say we have strong engagement with Limerick City and County Council and both the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the Housing Agency in terms of supporting them.  There are either four or five in fairly brownfield sites in the middle of Limerick which the council is trying to progress at the moment.  I think they are a mixture of cost-rental and affordable purchase but again, as always, plans and development rest with the local council for that detailed design and planning.</p></speech>

All the examples Mr. Quinlan has been using are Dublin, Dublin and more Dublin.  The examples in counties Limerick and Cork are very different and we have the same issues in counties Limerick and Cork.  If one wants to build houses, one needs infrastructure.  I welcome the serviced sites fund, it is a way of helping things move forward.  However, we need to move out of cities.  People are moving out of cities.  We have seen this during Covid, they want to get out to rural areas and move into towns and villages.  On that basis I welcome the fund because it will help as services are lacking.  Mungret is another site which is ideal for the serviced sites fund and will bring more housing to County Limerick.  I would prefer it though if, when the officials are doing presentations, they move them out of Dublin and look at the figures around the country.  There are a lot of TDs from around the country who represent different counties and I would like to see County Limerick mentioned the next time the officials are presenting figures.</p></speech>

While Deputy &Oacute; Broin is correct to say &euro;75 million is one of the larger figures, it does not take into account the &euro;50 million for the serviced sites fund, &euro;35 million for the cost-rental equity loan, &euro;210 millon for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, &euro;60 million for the Land Development Agency, LDA, and the &euro;38 million for LIHAF.</p> <p>  We are not going to solve the housing crisis with one scheme.

Only the Chairman and necessary staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everyone to bear with us should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  I now call Mr. Kent to make his opening statement.  He has five minutes as we are limited to an hour due to Covid restrictions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.847" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Kent" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021020900002#C00200"><p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for today's invitation.  Currently, Bus &Eacute;ireann provides more than 220 State-supported, or public service obligation, PSO, routes nationwide.  We also have a fully commercial intercity service, Expressway, and we operate the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department of Education.  In the 2019-2020 school year more than 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to schools throughout the country as part of this scheme.  This is unparalleled in its scale throughout Europe.</p> <p>  We are in our 35th year. While the last year has been one of the most challenging in our history because of the impact of Covid-19, we are delighted last year to have introduced the single most significant enhancement of public service obligation services, PSOs, with the support of funding from the National Transport Authority through the July stimulus.  The link between investment, improved services, higher levels of customer satisfaction, which leads to increased usage is very clear.  This type of initiative demonstrates a commitment to maintaining growth in public transport, notwithstanding the current challenges we face during Covid-19.</p> <p>  Our 2,700 employees have been at work throughout this pandemic.  They have ensured that essential services continued to be delivered for those who depend on them most.  I would like to pay tribute to the dedication of all the employees and many who deliver services on our behalf.  These people were very steadfast right throughout the crisis in demonstrating a very strong public service ethos associated with Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>  The board and management are very thankful for the ongoing support from the Department of Transport and the Department of Education, the National Transport Authority, NTA and CI&Eacute; and for the very constructive engagements we have with the trade unions which represent many of our staff to ensure safety continues to be at the forefront of everything we do.</p> <p>  In 2019 Bus &Eacute;ireann carried 89.4 million passenger journeys.  It was our highest level since 2008.  The company  saw a return to profit for the first time in five years.  However, in 2020, Covid-19 related drops in passenger demand and public transport capacity restrictions created financial challenges for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It forced us to take some very difficult decisions on a number of our commercial services.  We had to do that to protect the remaining network in the longer term and continue serving more than 150 communities which rely on our Expressway services.</p> <p>  Our commercial services are currently relying on temporary support for the next three months under the commercial bus operator direct award contract but every route needs to be sustainable in the longer term.  If there are any issues of connectivity, we liaise very closely with the National Transport Authority, NTA, as it has the ultimate responsibility to assess demand and provide connectivity if it is needed.</p> <p>  We believe Bus &Eacute;ireann has a central role to play in many of the ten strategic outcomes outlined in the national development plan, so for the convenience of committee members I will make my comments under some of the headings outlined in the plan.  The first is compact growth, strengthening rural economies and communities and enhancing regional accessibility.  What we would say in that regard is that while the National Transport Authority is responsible for overall connectivity nationwide, we work closely with it to ensure integration of services across our nationwide network.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has the reach and transport skills to participate in any plan which connects Ireland and to support sustainable urban and rural development, efficiently and effectively.</p> <p>  In recent years, we have experienced significant growth in regional cities and towns.  In particular, when we have investment that goes in by way of additional fleet and increased frequency.  Some examples I cite are that in 2019, we grew city passenger numbers by 50% in Waterford, by 70% on route 220 in Cork and by 60% in Drogheda with a doubling in frequency.</p> <p>  Having the right infrastructure in place for buses to operate efficiently and on time, such as bus priority measures, real time information and ongoing investment in regional roads and motorways is key to incentivising people to make the shift from car to bus.  Where infrastructure is in place, the impact is clear.  We look forward to planned BusConnects projects sitting under this plan.  We see it as a key in transforming bus transport in our cities.</p> <p>  It is essential that sustainable funding is in place for all routes that have a public service obligation and that supply and demand is carefully considered and balanced for routes which require a commercial licence to ensure that these services can become sustainable again when the recovery begins.</p> <p>  We also provide services to more than 1 million people through our free travel scheme.  As our population continues to age and grow more generally, demand for our services will increase again.  The demand-led school transport scheme we operate on behalf of the Department of Education continues to grow.</p><p>We look forward to actively participating in the Department of Education review of the needs of the scheme, including the sustainable transport plans for schools for the future over the coming months.</p><p> Under the headings of sustainable mobility and a transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society that are called out under the national development plan, this year we have confirmed orders for 204 new vehicles and we are making considerable improvements in the transition of our fleet to greener, cleaner, more accessible vehicles.  We will not be introducing any diesel-only buses to our city and town fleets.  We are beginning the process of switching to hybrid vehicles in our city and town services very soon and that will start in Galway over the next couple of months.  For longer routes, we are exploring hydrogen fuel cell power and investing in Euro VI diesel vehicles.</p><p> In 2020, we were the first transport company to operate Ireland&rsquo;s first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle in a unique trial between Dublin and Meath.  That was led by Hydrogen Mobility Ireland and we plan to add three hydrogen buses on route 103 in Meath in quarter 2 of this year.  We are also leading on a project to roll out the electrification of Athlone town services in partnership with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and our company car and van fleet will all be fully electric by 2025.  By 2030, half of our fleet will be zero emissions and all diesel vehicles will be at least of Euro VI engine emission standard, which have up to 90% lower emissions than some of our current diesel fleet.  We need multi-annual funding commitments to continue.  We see them as being critical in ensuring we can deliver on these targets.</p><p> In summary, we believe bus and coach transport is highly flexible, safe and demand responsive.  It produces much less carbon dioxide per passenger kilometre than the private car, and can increase passenger numbers more rapidly than any other public transport solution.  It can do that within a year to 18 months of investment approval.  The current national development plan includes very ambitious plans to grow and to green public transport nationally.  Both will help to deliver economic recovery post Covid-19.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is looking forward to the opportunities presented by both the growth and the greening of public transport.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

We will now move on to members' questions.  The first slot is the Fine Gael one.  Deputy Carey has three minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.850" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1517" speakername="Joe Carey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021020900002#D00300"><p>I confirm I am in the precincts of Leinster House today.  I thank Mr. Kent for his presentation.  I want to ask him a question on a proposed service for the town of Ennis.  He will be aware that Bus &Eacute;ireann has delivered new services to areas like Kilkenny.  The NTA has been working on a proposal for a long time.  Has Mr. Kent held discussions on the provision of a town bus service for Ennis?  It is incorporated in a document called Ennis 2040, which will shortly be published by Clare County Council.  Similar services are being rolled out in towns the size of Ennis.  I would like to hear his views on that.</p> <p>  We have had different results over the last number of weeks in relation to some services being delivered by Bus &Eacute;ireann in County Clare.  I welcome the fact a service, around which there was a question mark and which delivered people from Broadford to Limerick city, has been reinstated.  I received calls from people living along the estuary in a village called Labasheeda in west Clare.  Basically, their service has been discontinued but the slack has been taken up by Local Link, which is very welcome.  Funding has been provided to do that through the job stimulus and I welcome that.</p> <p>  This leads on to my next question.  What other services has Bus &Eacute;ireann discontinued in County Clare?</p><p>I ask him to expand on that.  Perhaps Mr. Kent could respond to the issues I have raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.852" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Kent" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021020900002#E00200"><p>In the first instance, we currently operate services on behalf of the National Transport Authority, NTA, for a number of towns around Ireland.  We do not operate the Kilkenny town service.  That service was put out to tender and is operated by another operator.  The Navan town service, for example, is one that has been significantly enhanced most recently, in respect of frequency and buses that were added in to the service.  I am not aware of any direct conversations with the NTA to date in respect of the town of Ennis.  Obviously, much of what we have put into operation over the last number of weeks has resulted in a significant enhancement both for Limerick city and connections for west and east Clare.  However, on the actual specifics of the town service, we would be very interested in discussing potential movements with the NTA, if it were to be considered.  All activities and the plans going forward as part of this, typically go out to consultation.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct to state that Local Link has been used very effectively as a service by the NTA to integrate with services that are included in the direct award contract that we have.  We operate 220 routes within that.  Typically, those routes are integrated for connectivity with other services that might include Local Link or, indeed, other operators, commercial or rail services.  That is typically where it has happened.  If demand is not currently at a certain level, or if it is more efficient for the State to deploy funding in a way to provide more of a feeder service onto the main arteries, that has been typically the approach that has been developed.  Other than that, in respect of the development of the main arteries, all of the main issues can be seen in the national development plan to address capacity.  If capacity is required, we deploy it.  Speed of service and the ability to go from A to B are things Bus &Eacute;ireann and the NTA are continuously trying to address, so that we can get the right levels of frequency and coverage in places like some of the towns.</p> <p>  As the Deputy said, particularly as the Covid pandemic unfolds, it is possible that many more people may decide not to live in Dublin and to settle elsewhere.  We have watched the news like everybody else.  That is going to be an interesting part of how things will develop in the future.  The aspects of interchange, directness of service, having the right levels of capacity and deploying it efficiently, dictate the way things are happening.  If there is demand for a service, then it will have to be considered in that context.  If there is a possibility to provide that service, we will be very willing to engage in relation to that.  That is all I would say.  Typically, where services have been redeployed into Local Link, it is because it is more efficient to do so.  On the main services that we are deploying, we are trying to make sure that we are deploying them with the right levels of capacity, speed and frequency, and to do that in unison with the other operators if they are involved.  That is what is happening at this particular point.  This has been the approach since 2019 and there is a broader project in relation to connecting Ireland under way.  That is all I can say in response to the Deputy.  If the question needs to go further, we can probably bring it to and discuss it directly with the NTA, because ultimately it has the responsibility for connectivity.</p></speech>

Mr. Kent will be aware that there are a significant number of foreign direct investment companies based in Shannon.  There are more than 10,000 jobs there.  There is a bus service that connects both Ennis and Shannon, but I have received numerous complaints in respect of the frequency and the timing of the service.  Looking at the service itself, it is not overly crowded.  Certainly, Bus &Eacute;ireann could up its game in relation to providing a better, more dependable and more frequent service, and one which operates in line with the opening hours of these companies.</p><p>Would Bus &Eacute;ireann be open to consultation regarding delivering a better service and to talking to employers about improving that service between Ennis and Shannon?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.855" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Kent" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021020900002#F00200"><p>We certainly would.  In fact, I met members of Shannon Chamber of Commerce some time ago.  Plans were probably in place for further improvements on the route directly serving Limerick, Shannon and Shannon Airport, and we knew all that information.  While I was there, I went for a walk around the park and I saw that several new companies were coming in.  I guess we were right, in advance of the onset of Covid-19, in giving some consideration to providing enhanced infrastructure, such as bus stops, and achieving a better understanding of some of the shift pattern movements.  Some of those changes were certainly in train before Covid-19 struck.</p> <p>  I reiterate that those changes are still encompassed in many of the plans being considered.  An example is route 343, in respect of enhancing that service with better buses and ensuring they will be more accessible.  I can tell Deputy Carey that I would be very happy to engage in what he has just suggested.  It would be subject to funding, however.  Providing the additional frequency of services and redeploying the buses required is something we would depend on the NTA to do.  To be fair, there is no lack of willingness on its side.  We are all reliant to a great extent on funding coming through so we can provide that better service and bring in the improvements of which the Deputy spoke.</p></speech>

There are significant levels of unmet needs across the country.  I am thinking of areas and new communities in my constituency which have no bus services.  Some 4,000 people live in Stamullen and hundreds of people live in Kentstown.  I could list all these areas.  It is the same with the school bus transport scheme and the situation with concessionary and non-concessionary tickets.  The unmet need this year was unprecedented.  Is this a matter entirely for the NTA?  I ask that because surely Bus &Eacute;ireann's drivers know these areas and the communities which are growing very well.  What upward pressure is coming from Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of the NTA and delivering services in those areas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.860" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Kent" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021020900002#F00700"><p>I will take the last question first.  We have regular weekly interaction with the NTA regarding planning teams.  We have a network planning team and the NTA has a similar team, which is looking at all those issues.  The Deputy is right about small villages like Stamullen.  There are many such towns and villages that, typically, we would be looking at.  All these aspects again come back to the fact that within the direct award, as granted to us, there are still 220 routes.  Several of those routes could possibly be changed and extended, as that is allowed under the direct award contract.  Those changes allowed can involve alterations to scale and frequency and additional permeation.  We know society is always changing, so the NTA addresses those aspects when it is possible to do so and it works on that process with us.</p> <p>  Turning to additional villages that may come on stream, the Deputy might be aware of an example of that happening just before Christmas when the small village of Portroe got a bus service for the first time and was connected to Limerick city.</p><p>That was certainly a part of the consultation with the NTA.  However, it is the NTA that would make that decision and then we deploy the services to do that.  Therefore, we are entirely reliant on funding being made available to pay for driver hours, to pay for the fuel, to pay for the maintenance and to pay for the vehicle.  If that funding has been available, we have been providing it.  As I said, we had a unique opportunity at Christmas.  There were 112 jobs created in this business here and 26 additional vehicles deployed for a fleet, but that was all part of the Government stimulus that was created to connect all those additional frequency services in towns that went in.  It came with an additional price tag.  From the NTA's point of view, it was an investment by the State of an additional &euro;10 million.  That is what went in to deliver those levels of service.  As I said, it is probably, certainly in my tenure here since 2013, the largest investment I have seen.  We believe it is the largest, maybe, in 15 years.  It was part of a Government stimulus package and I think that we will see the results of that.  It is very encouraging if we can bring those in and connect them but, as I said, it still has to be the subject of an effectiveness and efficiency review.  If a smaller village is not best suited by us, it may be addressed by Local Link or by another operator.  That is typically the way it may end up happening because all of the PSO services are supplemented by commercial services.</p><p> Returning to Deputy O'Rourke's question on the State support, we have been very thankful during Covid because there has been a huge amount of additional funding provided for services, in particular, on the PSO side.  We are currently recovering many of our costs, including lost revenue.  During parts of Covid, we lost up to 80% of revenue and, in one extreme, 90%, which was at the very beginning.  That, obviously, oscillated through the summer as reopenings occurred.  The revenue deficit has been made good and the costs have effectively been recovered for the NTA during that period, including, as I would say here for the benefit of the public, a large amount of the additional investment in all of the sanitisation regimes and everything that we could deploy to make the service as safe as possible.  I am glad to see, even at this point, that we have not had any Covid-related-----</p></speech>

Like my colleague, Deputy Carey, I want to impress upon Mr. Kent the necessity for him to engage with the NTA in the provision of that long-awaited service for the town of Ennis.  It is something that has been in the offing for a long time and Mr. Kent's skills and understanding of what is involved would be helpful to the debate.  Hopefully, Mr. Kent can address that.</p> <p>  I will also address the issue of the service that was discontinued from my own part of the county, from Whitegate, through Scarriff, Tulla, Broadford and onwards, to Limerick.  I thank Mr. Kent for his engagement and for reversing that decision.  Unfortunately, it should not have happened.  When Bus &Eacute;ireann is offering some good news, we all get the press release.  It is important, too, that Bus &Eacute;ireann engages with us when it intends to change a service.  As others have said, it is appropriate that some of the routes are handled by Local Link rather than through Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. Kent probably needs to engage the NTA and Local Link a little more to ensure that we do not have that drop in service as was talked about there.</p> <p>  Deputy Carey referred rightly to west Clare.  That is being resolved through Local Link.  There was a conversation with Local Link, probably, a month or six weeks in advance, which meant that there would be no discontinuation of a service.  That is the way to go when Bus &Eacute;ireann is changing its services and I recommend that.</p> <p>  I also want to recognise Bus &Eacute;ireann's staff and Mr. Kent for what they have done for us through the pandemic.  That has been really helpful to consumers.</p> <p>  I am glad Mr. Kent raised the issue of the Portroe to Limerick service.  It is just across the water in County Tipperary but it has potential positive implications for County Clare.  Mr. Kent may be familiar with the twin towns of Ballina and Killaloe and I would hope that he could see some possibility in that service taking in Killaloe.  As the service transverses from Portroe to Limerick, a loop into Killaloe would enhance the service greatly, would give many more people an opportunity to avail of the service and would see greater passenger uptake.</p><p>Quite some time ago, Bus &Eacute;ireann had a plan to introduce bus rapid transit in and around Limerick and onwards to Shannon.  Has further consideration been given to this or are there any plans in Bus &Eacute;ireann to consider rolling out bus rapid transit between Limerick city and Shannon Airport?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.867" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Kent" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021020900002#H00200"><p>I thank the Senator for all his comments about the staff.  Our collaboration with him in the past has been very productive and we continue to try to do what we can for the area.  If there is an opportunity for Killaloe and Ballina - particularly as summer services and tourism comes back, where these services are critical - I would hope that they could be included.  Again, it would be subject to the conversation with the NTA but now that we have a service and can see it bearing fruit, hopefully we will get to a point of talking about that.  We will keep it under discussion.</p> <p>  Bus rapid transit will be part of the consultation that the Chair of this committee has been involved in and the Limerick consultation happening with the NTA.  It will all be integrated into that.  All the measures that were talked about in the past are hugely reliant on infrastructural investment to make them happen.  There is no lack of willingness to participate positively in all those initiatives.  What we will need to do, as I said earlier, is anything that gives us more directness, coverage and speed, all the things that customers usually need if they are going to make a choice to convert from the car to public transport.  It is under consideration.  I understand the consultation is back out and, from the NTA last week, that it may be back before people in May.  We will be active participants in that and those ideas.  We will participate in anything that can progress this.</p></speech>

I have three questions.  First, what is the policy of Bus &Eacute;ireann, working with the NTA and local authorities, on bus shelters?  Clare County Council recently had a big discussion on this.  When Cork City Council did a great deal of work around the Broadale estate and up Maryborough Hill, it did not put in any bus shelters despite the work of Councillor Deirdre Forde, myself and others.  What is the policy on the provision of bus shelters?</p> <p>  Second, on the strategy of additional growth and increasing connectivity, will Mr. Kent explain the rationale behind the cutting of some of Bus &Eacute;ireann's Expressway routes?  </p> <p>  Finally, some 1,758 students were unsuccessful in obtaining school transport.  Deputy O'Rourke mentioned this earlier.  Will Mr. Kent give some clarity on that?</p> <p>  I thank the Bus &Eacute;ireann staff for their courtesy and work in this difficult time.  I appreciate the work done by everyone in Mr. Kent's organisation.</p></speech>

That is very much appreciated.</p> <p>  The provision of bus stops and bus shelters is the responsibility of the NTA in conjunction with ourselves.  Consultation is a part of that.  Obviously, we have some liaison with councils.  Typically, all of those inputs are made.  There has been great progress in recent years, particularly with shelters and trying to ensure bus stops are made more accessible in cities.  A lot of that work is continuing.  That is a steady state investment plan that is rolled out.  The NTA is at an advanced stage of procurement for bus stop infrastructure, which it has been trying to put in place for a number of years.  We are on the other side - we serve just short of 10,000 bus stops around the country, some of which probably need reinvestment.</p><p>Where shelters are put in place, that is typically by way of consultation with the city council to make sure that can be provided for and that footways, clearance areas and so on are all there.  I will take back the point the Senator has made.  He mentioned Maryborough Hill so I will ask what our input has been to that.  That might progress it on the Senator's side and if he keeps pushing on the council side, maybe it will come together.</p><p> The Senator asked about Expressway routes.  It was a difficult decision.  We are very reliant on Expressway, which is integrated in the business.  We have a large number of drivers, mechanics and staff that continue to work and deliver those services.  They are commercial in nature and, outside of what we have with Covid at the moment, they are completely reliant on the cost recovery that is happening.  Most commercial services out there are low-margin businesses.  That is just a fact.  For every route we operate, that is important, particularly when we are not in receipt of State money.  We do not get subvention for those routes other than what we are getting currently.  We were not getting a subvention in the period until July, so we ran many of those routes at a loss.  Revenue loss went to 90% and even at the height of it during the summer, we operated at about 50% of revenue.  One cannot operate a low-margin service with such extreme revenue loss.  In that period, we ended up having to look at the routes individually, which was done with detailed consultation with the Department and discussions with the NTA.  We had to take a view on the projections as to whether some of these routes would come back.  Our view on some of the routes was that their long-term viability could threaten the long-term viability of the other routes we are doing.  We took a decision on the 18 routes we operate to effectively come out of four.  As members saw last week, we came out on the Limerick route on 29 January, we came out on the Belfast route and, currently, in relation to the Senator's area of Cork, the X8 services and connectivity have been reduced but the long-term plan will be to come out of that.  That will be in consultation with the NTA so connectivity solutions can be identified in advance of any further decision.  It is pure economics.   We have to make sure a route can generate money to pay wages, to pay for investment in a new fleet because one cannot continue running old fleet and to pay for maintenance.  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>

They are commercial licences that we hold and we have to try to operate.  An issue we have at the moment is that when operating commercial services, we have to ensure they are sustainable.  It is as simple as that.  It is not that we do not want to operate connectivity.  A huge amount of our purpose is to connect people to who and what matters to them.  We say that openly as a company but there is only so far we can do it.  To do that, we have been reliant on funding from the NTA.  Where it is in place, we have stood up and been able to deliver and deploy that.  However, on other routes, where there is no possibility of revenue covering our costs, we get to a place where, as a commercial semi-State company, we have to make sure we can keep it all operating and we did not want to endanger the other routes that have a greater chance of coming back.  Those decisions, difficult as they may have been, have been taken so we can maintain connectivity for 150 other communities on the other 150 routes.</p> <p>  This was an existential crisis and we are not out of it.  There is a way to go in this Covid piece so we have to monitor it.  We have to make those decisions now and we will continue to do so.  It will be a commercial decision.  If routes come back in the future, we will look and if there is an opportunity to run them, we will try to run them.  At the moment, there is no prospect and we are trying to make a decision for the rest of the network.</p></speech>

I have a few points that my colleagues would like me to put to him, the first of which is in regard to the Expressway service.  He explained with great regret that, due to economic circumstances, some routes have to be pulled.  What is some of the reasoning behind that?  He stated it was down to flat, baseline economics, but looking at the whole itinerary of Expressway services, it seems to be those that depart from the largest population centres that are under threat.  Will Mr. Kent confirm that Bus &Eacute;ireann will continue to operate Expressway route 51, a return service that operates frequently from Cork to Limerick, Shannon, Ennis and Galway?</p></speech>

In fact, we hope in due course to deploy some new vehicles on that route so that we continue to enhance the service between Galway and Cork and to serve Shannon Airport.</p></speech>

Will it remain a linear route, straight up along the corridor, or will adjacent communities along that motorway corridor, such as Sixmilebridge and Newmarket on Fergus, benefit from it?  Is Bus &Eacute;ireann committing to using the same stops it has always used?</p></speech>

While I acknowledge that schools are not open at the moment, a large volume of students this year have not yet been able to reconcile the difficulties they have had with Bus &Eacute;ireann with regard to school transport.  It remains a big issue and I am glad a national review is under way, into which Bus &Eacute;ireann will have significant input.  Its staff have probably been pulled 100 ways by the public and public representatives.</p> <p>  As an example, Corofin in north Clare is a typical Irish village.  Mr. Kent may or may not know it.  It is quite close to the Burren.  As one leaves the village, one can see the typical typography that is around any village, such as streams, dykes and ditches, and they form the parish boundaries.  They are the very parish boundaries that become the hard cut-off point between a student qualifying or not for a ticket; it is totally illogical.  This probably worked in the 1940s and 1950s, when buses started to be seen going down rural roads.  They would pass people going to the local creamery and the parish boundary was a drain or a stream.</p> <p>  It is totally illogical in 2021.  It forces some people to go three miles one way to a primary school, while the cr&egrave;che or childminder might be six miles across the Burren, and then they have to drive to Ennistymon school afterwards.  It is illogical that large numbers of people pass one another unnecessarily on the road each morning, and that is just one example, although it could probably be applied to every village in Ireland.  The case of Corofin is replicated throughout Clare and Ireland.  The new model for school bus transport has to be based on supply and demand.  If there are five or six kids in a community, that should logically dictate that there be a stop.  It should not come down to streams, drains and ditches; that does not work.  I would like to hear Mr. Kent's views on that.</p> <p>  With regard to the overall bus service, I accept that Bus &Eacute;ireann is constantly seeking to enhance its offering to villages and communities.  I recently made a number of submissions to the company, particularly regarding the south Clare area, such as Parteen, Meelick, Ardnacrusha, Clonlara and Cratloe.  They are in the south of the county, a stone's throw from Limerick city, but they do not enjoy the fabulous city bus service that operates into the north suburbs of the city.  As Bus &Eacute;ireann examines rolling out an improvement in the service, it might also factor in these villages.  The two most recent censuses identified this corner of Clare as the largest population growth area.</p><p>I would like to hear the views of Mr. Kent in respect of the prospects for an orbital bus service around Ennis town, as raised by other members.  It is the largest town in Munster that does not have city status and is home to 18,500 people.  There is a significant hunger and demand for a bus service there.  Just last week, Ms Anne Graham of the NTA gave some positive vibes when I asked her about this issue.</p></speech>

In this particular case, eligibility criteria apply.  We do not have any discretion in that regard, but we will participate in the process and we will look at the issues raised by the Deputy with regard to particular locations.  More than &euro;200 million has been spent by the State to try to deliver school transport services.  In fact, coming into Covid, additional moneys were deployed so that we could do that in a socially distanced way for post-primary children.  On the issue raised by the Deputy, there are definitely opportunities within the scheme but it is always subject to review.  There has been massive growth in the scheme.  As I stated, whatever about 2019 when there was demand for 120,000 seats and that was growing towards 125,000, even during Covid there was still demand in September for 114,000 seats.  There was a very small fall-off in demand.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to places such as Corofin.  I understand that the school transport scheme is critical for rural villages around Ireland.  That is absolutely intrinsic to the scheme.  Bus &Eacute;ireann understands that better than anybody at the moment.  The company has been carrying out planning and making the effort currently being made in this area for more than 50 years.  However, our planning and effort are subject to the eligibility criteria, which are specified and agreed by the Department and signed off by the Government.  Whatever way it is done, it has to be all done as part of a wider review.  From our perspective, we stand ready.  We will do what we can do to deploy the services.  That is all we wish to do at the moment.</p></speech>

As things stand, we will certainly participate in the review.  Ultimately, how the NTA decides to award the services is at its discretion.  As members may be aware, in the case of Kilkenny, for instance, the NTA decided the services in question had to be tendered.  As such, Bus &Eacute;ireann would be like any other organisation and would have to participate in a process.  I cannot prejudice anything that is in the thinking of the NTA in respect of those services other than to state that I understand the way the Deputy is thinking.  There are several towns around Ireland of which I have been made aware that fall under the review of the NTA.  Depending on how those are done and whether they are awarded under direct contract again or are tendered, we will certainly participate in that process, whether it is for Parteen or somewhere in Donegal.  We know there are places that are being looked at in that context.</p></speech>

I reiterate the remarks of my colleagues in terms of the thanks we wish to pass on to the staff of Bus &Eacute;ireann for keeping services going, especially for those who depend on public transport and do not have access to a car to get them through these difficult times.  It is much appreciated and acknowledged.</p> <p>  I wish to elaborate on the last point made by Mr. Kent.  I believe we need to shift the focus a little from investment in roads to investment in public transport, both bus and rail.  The national planning framework seeks to ensure balanced regional development.  The NDP is up for review.  I believe there has to be significantly higher investment in public transport to meet not just the objective of balanced development, but also to ensure that when we seek to build houses, it is transport-orientated development.</p><p>We cannot be building houses everywhere depending on car transport.  When Mr. Kent looks at how Bus &Eacute;ireann can deliver balanced development, and he said that he knows rural transport as well as anybody else having been at it for so long, is the organisation limited in its fleet numbers?  Obviously it is limited in its fleet numbers to the service.  Is there a service static steady State view of public transport so that if Bus &Eacute;ireann had more fleet and higher ambition that was supported it could supply a lot more rural bus transport?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.884" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Kent" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021020900002#M00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments about staff.</p> <p>  To answer the question, there are two aspects.  One aspect is the infrastructure that the Deputy has talked about.  As he can see, under the consultations that we will have on the city, there is massive change required for a number of those cities.  There is just 30 km of bus prioritisation available outside Dublin, which is a radically low number.  If one looks at the consultation that is put in place for Limerick, for instance, where it proposes to get up to about 84 km in the city alone from its current 12 km.  Places like that, and putting that level of prioritisation in, will ensure confidence in the service and reliability regarding all of those issues that the Deputy talked about.  There is massive infrastructural development required in the regional cities to get bus prioritisation measures in place.  They need to be supported, with all of the things that he mentioned, bus gateways and all of those things that would allow buses to come in to closures and to give them prioritisation.  Nobody likes to be here, on my side of a table, ever having to apologise for the fact that the service has run late.  In fact, everything that we are trying to do every single day is to work on punctuality and service improvements.  So we are doing that in a measured way but to make the step change one needs the infrastructural change that the Deputy talked about and that investment needs to come.</p> <p>  The second part is vehicle investment.  Currently, we operate with a fleet of 1,100 vehicles and a lot of those are mixed age vehicles.  I am delighted to say that we had tranches of investment that came in in 2008 but then there was nothing until 2012 and another burst in 2015.  One needs steady State investment for a fleet and all of those things will get addressed now.  That is why I am delighted, under the national development plan, NDP, because it will provide capacity needs.  I must say that in the last of couple of years there has been huge investment by the National Transport Authority, NTA, to move from single decks to double decks so one will see, in regional cities, that a lot of those have come in in the last couple of years.  Now there are better energy efficient vehicles and everything is targeted at trying to move to having low to zero emissions.  So having the investment for those reasons alone is worthwhile.</p> <p>  On schools, it has been a very difficult part because we operate less than 10% of the services directly, under school transport, and a lot of those are reliant on vehicles that are cascaded old to new.  We have not secured investment at the levels required for school transport at this point and that is the subject of analysis with the Department.  To answer the Deputy's question, we need investment for school transport because I do not believe that children should be treated any differently.  In fact, a greener cleaner school fleet turning up at schools is such a positive message.</p> <p>  On the NTA, it has made great strides with investment in vehicles.  The NTA has funded double decker hybrids and hydrogen buses.  The only issue that we have, for instance on the Expressway routes, is that there is not currently anything outside of Euro 6 diesel engines for longer intercity routes but there are trials under way and we hope that things like hydrogen technology might come to bear to make them better.  On investment, particularly in commercial, people want toileted buses.  They want a relatively good standard of buses for their journeys and we need to be able to make sure that we give them that relative to the power.  We used to promote Expressway with the line "like the car, only better", and that is exactly how I feel.  It is what people get out of it.  As members will know, three out of four journeys in this country are by car.  That is a lot and we have to change that mindset.  So what I see in the NDP is investment in infrastructure, quality of service and fleet, and all of those things combined will move us a long way on the green agenda.</p></speech>

Who knows what the future will bring in terms of technology.  Has any work been done by the company to quantify its carbon emissions now or even two years ago?  What are the projections as the fleet modernises?   This is a very forward-looking, progressive move.  For a company the size of Bus &Eacute;ireann to show some leadership on how carbon emissions can be reduced and to have that quantified would be very useful for other states and also private actors.  I ask that the company have a look at doing that in the interests of furthering the good news story.</p><p> I echo the sentiments of others in thanking all the company's staff for their work during this pandemic, from those who are driving the buses to those preparing them and to everyone behind the scenes.</p></speech>

On the carbon emissions, as I have said, the biggest contributor to energy emissions we have at the moment is fuel and diesel types.  When one adds it all together, 97% of what we contributed goes out in fuel type.  As I said, when we start transitioning to modes such as hybrid that will provide around a 30% fuel saving on the current level.  Moving to electric will obviously have a huge additional benefit as we will effectively go to zero emissions at that point, and then there is hydrogen.  I have mentioned some of the other developments, whereby even where we have to settle for a Euro 6 versus what we used to have back in 2006 or 2008, it will deliver major savings in emissions.  We are tracking this.  To give the Deputy more confidence, our board has set up a sustainability committee which will commence in the company in March.  We are developing a full sustainability plan that will tie into many of the goals that will be set out across the whole business on everything we have to do to achieve the climate action plan.  We have started a lot of energy and climate action projects.  We will do that in consultation with the people who supply us with goods.  While it is a small step, last week we even had a vendor coming in who planted trees on our behalf in and around some of the places.</p> <p>  All of these are small measures but, collectively, the big issue we must address is the transition into more energy-efficient fuel alternatives.  That is the path we are taking.  I have no problem providing the Deputy with information on our current carbon emissions.  We can measure those and return with them.  I am delighted to say we are making progress and setting ourselves up to align with the 2030 plan.</p></speech>

Mr. Kent will be aware that we wrote to him as a committee about the Limerick to Dublin Expressway service, specifically the X12 route.  Can Bus &Eacute;ireann see a way to restoring that route or is that a decision for the NTA?</p> <p>  On the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area plan, Bus &Eacute;ireann took part in a public consultation I held on that particular plan.  Ms Anne Graham of the NTA was before the committee last week.  The NTA has agreed to do a further round of public consultation with a revised draft plan.  Has Bus &Eacute;ireann had any interaction with the NTA on the further revised draft plan to go out to public consultation in Limerick in April?  Furthermore, Mr. Kent spoke about increasing the footprint of routes around the urban area of Limerick from 12 km to 84 km.  What is the status of that at the moment and how will it fit into the roll-out of BusConnects formally in Limerick?</p></speech>

On most of the routes, when we analyse all the cohorts, we find they are made up of commuters, people who travel for retail, people travelling for the airport, tourism and so on.  At the moment, the corridor is well served.  There has been a lot of competition on that route which has been an essential element.  From our perspective, it is supply versus demand and being able to make a sustainable return on the route is very challenging in our view.  That is the difficult decision we have in that regard.</p><p>That is currently not there but anything related to connectivity issues and so on is absolutely a matter for the NTA.  If we are asked to participate in a process, we will do that.  Effectively, as we see it, the route at the moment is not viable and would ultimately require funding support if it was to be continued.  That is just the pure, hard, commercial and economic call that we are forced to make.</p></speech>

We are still consulting every day and our network planning team are engaging in respect of that.  On the infrastructure and the Chairman's point about routes around the urban area of Limerick from 12 km to 84 km, this is published in the consultation as it is planned to be.  In the context of anything that is going to happen on that, I am aware that he is very supportive - as am I - of trying to see if we can move in that direction because I believe it is the right way to go.  If one wants to connect across city and across the University of Limerick, with the current arteries and when the return of business gives rise to congestion, in order to be able to maintain headways and remain on time, there will be a need for prioritisation in respect of places like that.  At the moment, the NTA will see all of the data relating to punctuality and to the service and reliability.  The NTA will use all of that data in the broader plan that will be rolled out for Limerick.  As I said earlier, we have been doing this for many years in Limerick and we want to continue doing it in order to continue offering better services to the people.</p></speech>

This year is going to be challenging.  As the Chairman is aware, everybody is seeing how we will get through Covid.  Obviously, there will be challenges but many of the plans are being developed.  Nobody is sitting back.  The committee will see that the work is being done on planning, such as for vehicles, getting our depots ready for electrification and so on.  This work is happening.  Where the seeds are being sown, they are sown.  Ultimately, it will come down to the full funding being made available and on having agreement regarding what the consultation and final plan are going to be.  We will be participating, as will a number of the committee members and some of the Chairman's constituents.  I hope we can get that process off the ground quickly.  In my interaction with the Minister and the Department, I picked up a great sense of haste to make sure that we can get bus services and public transport delivered efficiently and effectively.  Ultimately, however, it will come down to Cabinet and the funding being made available.  I am not on the receiving end of it but I will be first in the queue to say that we are ready to deliver.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Paul Hackett, board member of the Irish Travel Agents Association, ITAA, and Mr. Pat Dawson, its CEO.  From the Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, I welcome Mr. Evan Cullen, president, and Mr. Alan Brereton, vice president.  From F&oacute;rsa, I welcome Ms Ashley Connelly, aviation sector organiser, and Mr. Johnny Fox, assistant general secretary, service and enterprise division.  From Connect Trade Union, I welcome Mr. Paddy Kavanagh, general secretary.  From SIPTU, I welcome Mr. Neil McGowan, aviation sector organiser, and Mr. Tony Carroll, industrial aviation sector.  I thank the witnesses for participating at such short notice.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of the identified person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending the meeting remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses participating in this meeting from jurisdictions outside this State are advised that they should be mindful of their domestic law and how that may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are also reminded that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they physically locate in the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask that, prior to making a contribution, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I as Chair and the staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending remotely, I ask everyone to bear with us should technical issues arise.</p> <p>  I draw everyone's attention to our severe time limitations, for which I apologise.  I ask witnesses and members to operate within their time slots.  I want the witnesses to be able to give the committee their key messages and requests on behalf of the people they represent so that we can leave this meeting with a collective view.  However, I am conscious of the lack of time.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Cullen, who has four minutes.  I apologise for the time limitations, but we are where we are.</p></speech>

Mindful of the short time available to us today, this opening statement is short and focused on one or two key issues identified by IALPA members as significant for the continued survival of the aviation sector in Ireland.<br/><br/>We refer to recent news coverage and reported comments from the T&aacute;naiste in <i>The Irish Times </i>on 26 January that &quot;international travel was unlikely to reopen until sometime in the future, but certainly not for the summer&quot;.  It appears that there is now a prevailing narrative that international travel is preventing Ireland from becoming a Covid-free island like New Zealand.  Clearly, the Government shares this view and is preparing to close Ireland to international travel further for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether an international travel ban will suppress virus transmission in Ireland, we are fully supportive of any measure aimed at protecting public health and reducing the prevalence of this virus.  However, Irish airlines rely on summer bookings to make enough money to tide them over the loss-making winter season.  The loss of a second consecutive summer season after an entire year of practically zero revenue will prove fatal for airlines that have already depleted their cash reserves.</p><p> The &euro;80 million support package for the aviation sector announced in November was essentially a grant for Ireland's airports, the majority of which are State owned.  The funds left over for the airlines may have, at best, covered a few days' worth of losses.  Our airlines are intrinsic to the success of an island nation like Ireland, and they supply economic lifeblood, bringing, among other things, foreign direct investment and an estimated &euro;10 billion into the Irish economy annually.  Every aircraft that leaves Ireland will represent lost jobs and lost GDP.  It is an economic fact that if our airlines are allowed to go out of business, the consequences for the Irish economy will be devastating.</p><p> Most governments have recognised such dangers and have accepted that if they are to intervene to prevent airlines operating for the sake of virus suppression, they must ensure those airlines do not go out of business as a result.  New Zealand, so often our favoured Covid comparator, moved quickly to extend supports worth $900 million to Air New Zealand.  Much closer to home, the list includes &euro;10 billion for Lufthansa, &euro;7 billion for Air France, &euro;2.5 billion for British Airways, and &euro;1.2 billion for TAP Air Portugal.  The UK Government provided a loan worth &euro;670 million to Ryanair, an Irish airline, such was the value it placed on its contribution to the UK economy.  We have provided the committee with a copy of recent media coverage detailing the state aid approved by the European Commission for dozens of European airlines from their respective governments.  Why does Ireland remain an outlier as the only European country not to provide meaningful financial aid to its indigenous airlines?</p><p> The window remaining for decisive action is fast closing.  Airlines plan and budget for their vital summer schedules at this time of year and they will soon have to make hard decisions based on expected market conditions.  Our Government needs to understand that creditors and airline owners will not allow for yet another lost summer.  They will cut their losses and move their money and assets to other countries that support aviation.  The market will not save Ireland's airlines.</p><p> If international travel must be suppressed into the future, significant financial aid for Irish airlines is the only option available to avert sectoral collapse.  If the Government acts to suppress travel, the Government must also act to save our airlines from the destruction that such interventions cause.  They cannot have it both ways.  We implore the committee to lobby the Government to provide meaningful financial aid to Ireland's airlines before it is too late.</p><p> Over the weekend it was reported that Aer Lingus accessed that &euro;150 million loan facility.  We understand that was to address a problem it had last year.  It will not do anything for the problem that has now been created because the Government has cancelled the summer of 2021.  In our submission we also include an IATA document on the importance of air transport to Ireland.  We also provide detailed information on the dozens of airlines across Europe that have received direct government aid.</p></speech>

Eleven months of pay cuts, lay-offs, redundancies and job insecurity along with continued uncertainty about the future have put aviation workers and their families under significant strain.  For many, mortgage and other debt incurred during this period will be a burden for years to come.  It is not sustainable for these members to continue to endure this hardship.  With no early end to travel restrictions in sight, thousands of jobs will remain at risk unless the State acts now.</p> <p>  While the industry and its staff have benefited from State wage supports, Ireland continues to lack a European-style joined-up Government approach to underpin jobs in the sector, protect aviation infrastructure and ensure the survival of a viable post-pandemic industry.  This runs the risk that Irish aviation will be left behind when the rest of the world moves on, with potentially devastating implications for the national economy and employment in the aviation sector, and the sectors and communities that depend on it.</p><p>It is highly likely - if not certain - that aviation will be among the last industries to emerge from this crisis yet the Government has been slow to engage fully with stakeholders.  Recommendations from the task force for aviation and this committee have been largely ignored.  This inaction is placing an entire industry at risk along with the jobs and connectivity it supports.</p><p> F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s written submission to this committee gives a detailed assessment of the impact of the crisis across the industry and contains a range of recommendations both for the sector as a whole and for specific companies.  I will draw particular attention to three industry-wide requirements.  First, we make recommendations regarding income supports that acknowledge their contribution to the sector and its staff while highlighting the need for a flexible, industry-specific approach for this phase of the aviation crisis.  There is a strong risk that the employee wage subsidy scheme, as currently constructed, will lack the flexibility required to underpin employment relationships in the sector, which is essential if we are to position the industry to bounce back post Covid.  F&oacute;rsa is proposing an aviation income support scheme similar to that in place in Germany, which enables employers to reduce hours rather than laying staff off, with Government income support for the time employees cannot work.  Second, we emphasise the need for Government-led social dialogue with employers and unions to underpin a sustainable and thriving aviation industry as we emerge from the pandemic.  Third, F&oacute;rsa is calling for the Central Bank to adopt European Banking Authority, EBA, guidelines for the extension of mortgage payment breaks in 2021.  The European guidelines do not currently apply in Ireland, where the application process is slow and onerous.  After 11 months of income reductions and no early sight of recovery, this is placing avoidable strain on our workers.</p><p> Ireland went into this crisis as a major force in global aviation and our connectivity to the rest of the world plays a crucial role in supporting economic activity and attracting inward investment.  It is, therefore, crucial that we act collectively to ensure that the industry not only survives the impact of this current crisis but is fit to perform robustly as and when safe international travel resumes.  F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s approach has been to work closely with aviation employers to maximise job protection but this approach cannot succeed without significant and continuing Government support and intervention.  The union continues to call for any such support to be contingent on the avoidance of compulsory redundancies and the offshoring of Irish aviation jobs.</p></speech>

To summarise, since we last met in November, the situation for our members has continued to deteriorate and has got much worse.  Connect not only represents members in the airlines and the airports but also those working in production areas.  At the moment, those workers are also experiencing significant lay-offs and redundancies and an inability, particularly among younger workers, to obtain mortgages, etc., because of reduced circumstances.  We have seen situations where workers have had agreements for pay, etc., deferred.  There are deep concerns about health and safety, particularly the roll-out of vaccines for workers in airports.  If people are to be ready for the upsurge, they must be protected for when that comes.  We all know about the downturn in figures and the impact of that on numbers.  We echo what has been said about increased Government support for the industry similar to what we have seen across Europe.  We are calling for some very precise issues that we feel have been missed to be addressed.</p><p>No worker should be subject to compulsory redundancy while his or her employer is benefiting from any Government subsidy during the pandemic.  The legislation on redundancy means that workers who are currently laid off or on reduced hours cannot avail of voluntary redundancy, yet that time is not counted as service.  If we are denying workers the right to voluntary redundancy, that time should be counted as service.  This is a serious issue for our members.  We would support a system similar to the German kurzarbeitergeld system or even that of Sweden, where workers who continue to work during the pandemic are supported through better terms.  In that context, we are concerned about a future skills shortage in maintenance and specialist roles because people are leaving the sector.  When the upturn comes, there will be a skills shortage.  Our members have particular and precise specialist skills in certain areas and we are concerned that when the upturn comes, which it will, there will be a shortage of skills.  In that context, we are asking the State to see this as an opportunity to subsidise the industry for specialist upgrading or maintenance works that could be done to get the airports and airlines ready for the upsurge when it comes.  Basically, we support everything else that has been said here.  </p><p> Approximately one third of our union members are in construction.  While construction has been badly hit, we understand that the sector will resume much more rapidly than aviation.  Aviation will not be where it was pre-pandemic until 2024 or 2025 according to the latest estimates.  Workers in the aviation sector will suffer the longest hit and they must be taken care of with some sort of scheme to ensure that while they remain in the industry, their earnings are protected. </p></speech>

The Covid pandemic has had a devastating impact on the aviation industry, which continues to worsen by the day.  All workers in aviation have suffered a significant drop in income due to the pandemic.  Those that have remained in work have suffered drops in working hours and pay, thousands have faced lay off and many more have lost their jobs on a permanent basis.  Flights and passenger numbers have collapsed and the industry has been brought to its knees.  The outlook for aviation in the short- to medium-term is bleak and workers face into 2021 with real uncertainty and fear for their jobs.</p> <p>  Despite a dramatic drop in earnings, workers in aviation continued to work throughout the pandemic.  This has allowed essential medical supplies, PPE and most recently, vaccines, to continue to arrive in the country.  While State supports through wage subsidies and financial support for the regional airports are welcome, they simply do not go far enough given the depth and breadth of the crisis.  </p> <p>  To ensure that we have an aviation industry post-Covid, a number of actions need to be taken immediately by the Government.  SIPTU recommends the extension and amendment of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, for the aviation sector to ensure that employment is maintained in the industry.  The scheme should be tailored for the aviation industry so it becomes a genuine short-time working scheme based on the German model that pays 85% of pre-Covid earnings.  It must be made conditional on several binding commitments from employers, including that no worker be made redundant on a compulsory basis and that no worker suffers a permanent reduction in any terms and conditions of employment, unless by collective agreement, while the employer is benefiting from the EWSS.  SIPTU recommends that Shannon Airport be returned to the same management group as Dublin and Cork airports.  The separation of Shannon Airport has not been a success and the Covid crisis has brought into question the airport's long-term viability.  Given the airport's absolute importance to the region's economy, SIPTU believes it must be brought back into the same management group as the other State airports.  SIPTU recommends the introduction of free and rapid testing for all airport workers and that aviation workers be given the vaccine at the appropriate time.  Any financial support by the State directly to airports or airlines must be accompanied by conditionality that prohibits compulsory redundancies or a reduction in terms and conditions.  We believe that such support is required at levels well above what we have seen to date.</p><p>In the absence of the Government taking meaningful action, we simply will not have a functioning aviation sector in this country.  Given we are an open island economy, the country will not recover to the full extent without a functioning aviation sector.  The thousands of people who depend on aviation directly and the hundreds of thousands in the wider economy who need a functioning aviation industry need the Government to act now through the tailored supports for which our union is calling.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-09a.911" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Hackett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021020900002#U00200"><p>Things were bad when we spoke to the committee in October and they have got much worse.  There was no reopening date for travel back then and we assumed it would resume in the second quarter of 2021.  This has now been pushed out to the first quarter of 2022 with no prospect of international travel in 2021.  Last Thursday on "Prime Time", the Taoiseach said that travel had totally collapsed and that some of the measures are a deterrent to travel and will have an impact.  On 1 February at the daily NPHET briefing, the Chief Medical Officer said it is not realistic to expect people can fly to Europe or other destinations for summer holidays and the only beach they are likely to travel to is their local one.  We now have the &euro;500 fine for anyone travelling for nonessential reasons.  There is clearly no doubt that travel agents cannot trade.</p> <p>  We, as an industry, are responsible and customer focused.  We have always and will continue to follow public health guidelines.  However, if NPHET and the Government want to close down international travel for a year, they need to put in place the appropriate level of support if they want an Irish travel industry when international travel can safely resume.  We are a unique sector in that we have had to remain open to clients to facilitate refunds with practically zero income for almost two years.  The travel sector needs a bespoke response with a specific support as a consequence of being closed on public health grounds linked to international travel.</p> <p>  Let me summarise the supports in place.  The travel industry is accessing the EWSS similar to other sectors.  The scheme is available when turnover is down at least 30%.  We are more than 90% down and for 2021 we could be 100% down.  We also have no visibility on wage supports after 31 March.  Most of the travel industry is accessing the Covid restriction support scheme, CRSS.  This is designed to assist with nonpayroll costs.  To qualify, a business must be 75% down on turnover compared to 2019 and it applies from level 3 and above.  The travel industry has been told the scheme only applies to it at levels 4 and 5.  This is an advanced tax credit; it is not a grant.  The maximum threshold of &euro;5,000 per week seems reasonable provided turnover is &euro;4 million per year or less but for any travel company above this level the support simply does not cover non-payroll costs to any material extent.  This is a retail-focused assistance and does not cover all Irish licensed travel companies.  The CRSS does not support a downturn in business and is directly linked to the levels in the Covid framework but, clearly, travel agents are prevented from trading irrespective of the levels, and have been since March 2020.</p> <p>  The Government introduced the refund credit note scheme in summer 2020.  This is a cash flow mechanism to assist with delayed supplier refunds.  We need to be clear that the refund credit note is not a grant, a subsidy or a support.  It is a pure cash flow mechanism introduced with a nine-month delay on the assumption that the industry would be back trading.  Clearly this is not the case and we need a solution to this issue similar to the approaches adopted with EU approval in Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal, Bulgaria and others.</p> <p>  This brings us to the issue of airlines refunds or the lack thereof.  When we spoke to the committee last October, we outlined the potential reason for the delay on the part of one particular airline being down to a conflict over two EU directives that impact the travel industry.  This has turned out to be the case and we can go into more detail in the question-and-answer session.  The fact is that a significant number of refunds to customers for cancelled flights are outstanding.  Given the current talk of no international travel for 2021, we need to discuss the issue of consumer protection and refunds when flights operate contrary to Government advice on travel.  These are known as "ghost flights" and the ultimate loser is the consumer.</p> <p>  Committee members may also recall that the ITAA called for pre-departure airport testing when we addressed the committee back in October 2020.  The aviation recovery task force, the airports and airlines also called for predeparture airport testing.  What ensued was a debate with the medics over which test should be used and none was introduced.  Subsequently, we have been dealing with the issue of variants of Covid that arrived into Ireland in late 2020.  Was predeparture airport testing a missed opportunity?</p> <p>  When we addressed the committee in October, there was no talk of vaccines.  The State is spending &euro;1 billion a week in supports and related costs and we are being told there is a vaccine supply issue.  There does not appear to be a supply issue for some countries and given this is a life-saving opportunity, it appears that we are lagging well behind in getting the vaccine into the arms of our citizens.</p></speech>

I refer to Mr. Cullen's presentation.  What type of engagement has happened between airlines and Government to get the funding injection needed?  It is welcome that Aer Lingus has been provided with a loan.  To what extent do the witnesses believe that indigenous airlines need funding to keep them going so that we have an airline industry after this?</p> <p>  There is broad consensus from the witnesses on the German model.  I ask Ms Connelly to expand on what that means in real terms.  What is Germany doing that we could do?</p></speech>

It was in a closed period until a couple of weeks ago.  Aer Lingus is part of IAG and is in a closed period.  It will announce its results at the end of February or in early March.  During these periods, the airlines cannot talk to anybody about their financial state.  Other airlines have indicated to us that they asked for assistance from the Government.  If we are to believe those executives, they said none was forthcoming.  We understand however that there has been some discussion with the Government.  That is all confidential, based on market sensitive rules on share prices and so on.</p> <p>  There are aviation economists in IALPA whom we use for various negotiations.  The airlines need assistance in the form of direct State aid.  They cannot take on any more loans on their balance sheets.  It is important to note that when we last spoke, there was a reference in the committee's report to green shoots for 2021.  It came as an enormous surprise to us in January when the Government effectively closed international travel for the summer of 2021.  Every assumption we built into our plans was that we would get to a space of at least 70% of the 2019 production in 2021.</p> <p>  That has now been scuppered.  We will be lucky if in 2021 we get to 10% of the 2019 level of production.  Therein lies the problem.  We will also go into 2021 without the cash we had in 2020.  A lot of bookings were made in early 2020 for the summer of 2020.  That booking cash is no longer available and we are going into a zero revenue 2021.  Problem after problem is being heaped on us.  All the assumptions for getting out of this crisis have now proved to be false.  It looks like there will be a recovery in quarter 1 or 2 of 2022, if there are any airlines to take on that recovery.  That problem is massive and cannot be dealt with through loans from ISIF.  It has to be dealt with through direct financial State aid.  That is now the only way out of this. </p></speech>

Germany has put in place an extension to the terms of the scheme and the rates at which it is paid.</p><p>For the first three months, a person would get 60% of basic salary for days not worked.  They have looked at increasing that to 70% from the fourth to the sixth month and up to 80% or 85% from the seventh month.  Our members have now seen 11 months of pay reductions and reduced working hours, or in some cases lay-offs.  This would help shore up incomes and ensure these people do not have problems with mortgage or rent arrears in future.  We are very concerned that the debt burden being carried by our members is not sustainable.</p><p> A scheme like this will give a level of certainty for the next 21 or 24 months so people can plan their livelihood.  Many members I have engaged with found when their children went back to school last year that getting the benefits from the State could be quite complicated when in receipt of the employment wage subsidy scheme.  Many members, for example, found themselves appealing to get the third level grants.  Much more flexibility could be adopted if we engaged together on this.  We could find the solutions that would give certainty to all members working in the aviation industry, including our colleagues here today from the travel agent sector.  I hope this is helpful and I am happy to share any further information if required.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Dawson and Mr. Hackett outline the long-term threat to the Irish travel industry?  I will pick up on the point about the scale of the response from the Government being an outlier in international comparisons.  What sort of scaled response do the representatives of the aviation industry want to see?  I am conscious that the junior Minister in the Department stated last week that if more needs to be done, it will be done.</p></speech>

As my colleague, Mr. Hackett, has said, we got some help but that will certainly not keep us afloat.  We have 200 small companies dotted around Ireland and to date the support has not been tailor-made.  We will meet the Minister for Transport for the first time next week and perhaps that will bring something.  Currently we are bleeding money and new licences must be issued on 1 April.  It is a bleak front for all of us.  We have not got enough support.  We are fighting through refunds and trying to support our customers.  We have certainly got little or no meaningful help from the Government.</p> <p>  We were at level 4 or level 5 restrictions for 15 weeks of last year's 52 weeks.  The Covid restrictions support scheme has proven useless because we have seen level 5 restrictions so much over the past 12 months.  It looks like this could last for two years.  We are in dire straits.  Many Ministers have promised to help us in a meaningful way but that has not happened.</p></speech>

I and others have been really anxious to highlight this very serious matter and the witnesses have done that exceptionally well for all facets of the aviation sector.  They have rightly identified that the expectation for some recovery was this year and, quite frankly, with the current status of the virus, that will not happen.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses provide some further documentation?  I am interested to hear what a number of witnesses have mentioned with respect to Germany.  It certainly sounds like a model we could look at.  I am hopeful that when the committee receives those documents, we might put together a short presentation or report for the Department of Transport and the Government as a whole to follow up.</p> <p>  Mr. McGowan mentioned other matters close to my heart of trying to get Shannon Airport back into the cluster of airports with Dublin and Cork.  It is something I will certainly support as time goes on.  The crisis is immediate.</p><p> The witnesses rightly identified the fact that we cannot have one picking off the other.  There cannot be an opportunity now to shed employees at this time, particularly when one considers the efforts that aviation workers have made throughout the crisis.  If possible, can the witnesses provide further information on the schemes that have worked and that are working well throughout Europe?</p></speech>

Maybe we could have a little more flesh in a more condensed way.  It is a big ask but we want to do something productive on behalf of the organisations and their members.  Can we flesh out the position relating to the German model?  Mr. Cullen made reference to direct state aid being required rather than loans.  Can we hear a little more detail so that we can come back on that?</p> <p>  I have two questions for Mr. Cullen and Mr. McGowan.  They have been involved in the aviation sector over many years.  Where does the crisis rank in the context of others that have occurred in their lifetimes?  My next question is for the travel agents.  Michael O'Leary appeared on "Morning Ireland" recently.  He said that all refunds had been completed.  Is that the case?  We will hear from Mr. Cullen first and then Mr. McGowan and Mr. Hackett.</p></speech>

I was also involved in restructuring negotiations following the economic crisis in 2008 and 2009.  This is, by a multiplier of ten, far more serious.  All those crises had certainty about their ending and about what needed to be done to fix the problems.  The uncertainty created by this crisis is extraordinary.  In the context of having an entire summer cancelled after the previous one being cancelled, no airline in the world structured its finances around being able to go for two years without revenue and still pay its obligations to the aircraft lessors.  That is where the big cash drain lies.  Aircraft are extraordinarily expensive.  When they are not in operation and making money, they are very expensive indeed.  Paying those leases is what will pull us down.</p></speech>

Aviation is an industry that has been through many crises in recent decades.  Yet, the depth and breadth of this crisis is almost impossible to articulate in terms of the impact it has had on the industry.  I do not believe any of us could ever have imagined that we would be looking at a situation where almost two years' worth of activity is likely to be lost.  It is almost impossible to articulate the depth and breadth of the crisis.  It makes the issues we had to deal with in previous crises look relatively simple by comparison with what is facing aviation workers now and what has faced them during the past 12 months.</p></speech>

Ryanair has acknowledged that it has an obligation under EU Regulation 261/2004 to refund customers.  Ryanair has told us that it wants to do so directly to customers and the travel agents accept that.  We are absolutely behind the airline in getting those refunds to the customers, including families, retirees and everyone else who is due that money from last year.  That is the primary concern.</p> <p>  We have a shared objective in processing the refunds.  As part of that, we engaged in Ryanair's customer verification process.  We submitted a raft of documentation.  At some point in October or November, the Ryanair systems seemed to stall.  Some cheques issued from a German bank.  Nothing has come out since then.  Ryanair is now looking for bank details to do bank transfers.  The end customer is the person suffering here, not the travel agents.  We all accept that the refund can go directly to the customer.  We really need Ryanair to do that.  I hope that we can come back before the committee at the end of February and give an update on where that matter stands.  We will do whatever we can to work with Ryanair.  Our customers have done it and we want to do it.  Let us get the refunds processed.</p></speech>

Many IALPA pilots have contacted me about the difficulties they are having getting out of Ireland to, maybe, Heathrow to fly a service from Heathrow to China, the Far East, Australia or wherever it may be.  The supply chain pilots or pilots still working for British or continental-based airlines that need to get out on a Wednesday morning to an airport hub to take up work for the week were having difficulties.  I have written an awful lot and corresponded with the Department of Transport on their behalf.  Is that still a problem?</p> <p>  The last query I have is for Mr. Dawson and the travel agents.  I dealt a lot over the past three days with an issue in County Clare.  There is still an issue with people who booked with Ryanair through third-party travel agents and that needs to be looked at.</p></speech>

As my colleague, Mr. Hackett said, we are working through verification and onerous paperwork to send back to Ryanair.  There is a logjam and it is being slowed down, but not by the travel agents or the consumer.  The payments are being slowed down by Ryanair.  We figure that in Ireland alone approximately &euro;20 million is due back to the customers of Ireland.</p></speech>

Our witnesses have set out a bleak analysis of the sector.  The magnitude of the problem is daunting and it is an appalling vista for the sector.  I go back to previous discussions we had and the failure of our authorities to bring in proper pre-departure tests and rapid testing and tracing.   Now the Government is talking about an international travel ban.</p><p>In my view, one has to ask whether zero Covid is practical or feasible.  There would be enormous consequences and a devastating impact on the aviation sector.  The loss of connectivity would have significant implications for business, enterprise and the economy in general.  I would like to see a submission to the committee outlining the feasibility of this notion of zero Covid that is flying around at the moment and gathering credence.</p></speech>

Conditionality must be attached because if the State is to hand over large sums to employers, a social dividend has to arise from that.  That social dividend will keep people in employment and that is why conditionality in respect of compulsory redundancies is so important.  We will not tolerate employers receiving large sums from the State on the one hand, while making people redundant on a compulsory basis on the other hand.</p></speech>

We will have further meetings next week with representatives of the Department of Transport and follow-up meetings with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, the following week.  We really need bespoke supports at this stage.  We are facing 22 of 24 months with zero income.  If we do not support this industry, there will not be an industry.  It will be managed out of the UK, which is out of the EU.  The consumer will have less protection due to Brexit and we will destroy an entire sector of industry that pays close attention to consumer needs and protection.</p></speech>

I would like to revert to the committee by the end of the month in regard to what we can do.  We have to get Ryanair to get the refunds to consumers.  We accept that precedent and it accepts the issue of EU261.  Everybody around every table in this country just wants the refunds to go back to those retirees, families and couples who booked last year.  Let us continue to work on behalf of consumers to do that and to deliver it as best we can, and we will report back to the committee.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, I would highlight one proviso for the Government.  If customers in Ireland are refunded, the company will get state aid.  In the US, airlines were told they would get state aid if they refunded customers.  All the American airlines, therefore, refunded their customers and were given state aid.  We fully support the airlines but they should pay back the money that is owed to customers and they will be entitled to state aid.</p></speech>
