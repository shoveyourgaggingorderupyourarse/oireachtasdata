I remind them that apart from me and members of the committee secretariat, all other members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and from within the Leinster House complex only.</p> <p>  The purpose of the meeting is to discuss trade between Ireland and the Palestinian territories.  Some time ago, following correspondence, we agreed to a request from the group, Sadaka, to address the issue.  I remind everyone that today's meeting is about trade between Ireland and the Palestinian territories and I request that other issues are not discussed.  From Sadaka, the Ireland Palestine Alliance, I am pleased to welcome Mr. Bertie &Oacute; hAinmhire, board member, who is accompanied by two guest speakers, Mr. Hugh Lovatt, from the Middle East and North Africa programme of the European Council on Foreign Relations and Mr. Martin Konen&yacute; of the European Middle East Project in Brussels.</p> <p>  Before we start I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, I will direct them to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I now invite Mr. &Oacute; hAinmhire to make an opening statement on behalf of Sadaka.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Lovatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us to speak.  I am a senior policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, ECFR, based in London.  I will deliver some brief remarks which build on our written submission to the committee.  The submission was co-authored with my colleague, Mr. Konen&yacute;, the director of the European Middle East Project in Brussels.  We are talking today about trade between Ireland and Palestine.  Above all this, however, is a story about trade with Israel and its settlements.  Israel continues to pursue a decades-long policy of deepening its control over the occupied territories, expanding its settlement activities in contravention of international law and systematically violating the human rights and self-determination of the Palestinian people.  This creates challenges for the EU and Ireland when it comes to trade not just with Palestinians but also with Israel.<br/><br/>These challenges have been compounded by Israel's <i>de jure</i>annexation of East Jerusalem in 1980 and its <i>de facto </i>annexation of the West Bank, which the D&aacute;il has recognised.  There is ample evidence that Israeli settlements are directly benefiting from financial relations with the EU and Ireland via the trading and business relationship with Israel.  Left unchecked, this situation risks undermining Irish and EU efforts to place international law and respect for human rights at the centre of their foreign and trading relations and foreign policy.  This risks pushing further away the prospect of an independent and viable Palestinian state, hurting the long-term prospects of reaching a sustainable peace between Israelis and Palestinians.  It also compromises bilateral trade in respect of Israelis and Palestinians.<br/><br/>Against that backdrop, then, Ireland has an obligation to correctly align its external practices with its international law-based duties.  We are of course aware of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 that is currently on hold.  Working with its European partners, however, Ireland could be doing much more in this regard in the meantime.  We argue that Ireland should become the champion of what has been called the EU&rsquo;s &quot;differentiation policy&quot;.  This policy aims to fully and effectively exclude the occupied Palestinian territories, including the Israeli settlements illegally located in them, from the context of bilateral relations with Israel.  Doing so can help to ensure that trade and business ties with Israel fully and effectively respect international law and United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which was passed in December 2016.  This differentiation policy builds on well established legal principles that it is worth touching on briefly.  The first is the duty of non-recognition of forcible acquisition of foreign territory.  In the case of Israel, this includes the non-recognition of the domestic administrative regime which it has unlawfully extended to the settlements.  In effect, Israel is treating those settlements as an integral part of sovereign Israel and seeking to reflect this in its bilateral trade policy.  This duty of non-recognition has been embedded in the international legal order for nearly a century.  It is, therefore, a well established principle and has played an important role in disincentivising wars and territorial conquest.<br/><br/>The second duty I touch upon is the duty of third states to ensure that they do not assist or provide material support in the maintenance of an internationally unlawful situation.  In the case of Israel, this of course includes the expansion of illegal settlements, its annexation of Palestinian territory, whether <i>de jure </i>or <i>de facto</i>, the forcible dispossession and displacement of the Palestinian population in the occupied territories and the development by Israel since the beginning of this occupation in 1967 of a dual legal system that discriminates against Palestinians in the occupied territories to the benefit of their settler neighbours.<br/><br/>The third responsibility in this regard is to respect the internationally recognised right of self-determination of the Palestinian people within their territorial unit.  This is, as will be recalled, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.  Differentiation is also based on the proper application of EU law and existing regulations and domestic public policy decisions.  It is worth underlining that the goal of EU differentiation policy is first and foremost to protect the integrity of the EU&rsquo;s domestic legal order from Israel&rsquo;s internationally unlawful acts.  In effect, this is concerned with erecting an EU legal firewall between Israel and the settlements.  EU differentiation should not, therefore, be considered as a politically coercive action in the same way as sanctions or punitive measures.  Differentiation recognises Israel within its internationally recognised borders based on the 1967 lines.  By ensuring the correct implementation of international law and existing domestic requirements, however, it is true that EU trade can challenge Israel&rsquo;s annexation of Palestinian territory.  That annexation aims to erase any political or economic distinction between Israel and its settlements and treat them as an integral part of Israel.  It is also important to note that these differentiation measures fall far short of what the EU has done in respect of Russia's occupation and annexation of Ukrainian territory.<br/><br/>By ensuring that bilateral relations with Israel neither recognise its illegal settlement activities nor allows it to benefit from them, Ireland and the EU can help defend the territorial basis for a future two-state solution and counter the current slide towards a one-state reality of unequal rights based on the permanent subjugation of Palestinians under Israeli military control.  Undertaking this course of action would also support Palestinian economic prospects and statehood aspirations, which continue to be undermined by Israeli settlement activity.  All this aligns with the recommendations made in the report recently published by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.<br/><br/>As outlined in our written submission, differentiation has been applied in six main areas.  I will not refer to them all now, but the details can be found in our written submission.  They obviously focus a great deal on trade and business issues, while also extending into areas such as taxation, social security and research and development.  While there has been some notable progress, many deficiencies remain.  The EU's differentiation policy has not been applied coherently or enforced sufficiently by the EU as a whole or by its member states.  Ireland has an opportunity to help rally like-minded states to ensure the full and effective implementation of differentiation measures across the spectrum of bilateral relations with Israel at both EU and national level.</p><p>I will finish by noting that Ireland has made substantial and positive progress in applying the EU's differentiation policy.  We particularly welcome its public confirmation in January that its bilateral agreements with Israel do not apply to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967.  This public confirmation is very important and good to have.  However, there is far more to be done and there is no shortage of ideas.  We have outlined some in our-----</p></speech>

I also thank them for the work they continue to do.  It is important work which the committee very much appreciates, as do I.  I have a few questions.  Time is tight.  We have received and read the submissions made by the witnesses.  The Chair has to be strict on time but we received the submissions in good time.  I will ask a couple of questions.</p> <p>  We hear from the Taoiseach and from the Minister for Foreign Affairs about European aid to Palestine.  They talk a lot about this aid, the form it comes in, its cost and the mechanisms involved in delivering it.  However, we rarely hear comprehensive detail as to why exactly that aid is so badly needed.  For the record, information and benefit of the committee, will the witnesses please provide information about the impact on the Palestinian economy of the Israeli Government's actions, including sanctions and war?  Will they put on the record the impact these have had on businesses and the economy and why this impact results in the need for aid?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Lovatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#C00400"><p>I will give a brief answer and then turn over to my colleague, Mr. Konen&yacute;.  I will underscore that the EU and its member states are the largest provider of aid to the Palestinians.  This aid does much important work but we need to recall that Palestine does not need to be dependent on aid.  The reason it is dependent on aid is the ongoing restrictions on its access to natural resources and on its ability to export.  All of these restrictions are to be seen against the backdrop of the occupation.  If we want to move towards a more viable policy, we need to tackle the root causes rather than providing a technical, aid-focused bandage.  I will turn to Mr. Konen&yacute; for a fuller answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Konen&yacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#C00500"><p>Few societies in the world have been subjected to such comprehensive and debilitating economic restrictions as Palestine.  This is a well-known fact.  There have been many studies into the issue.  One study, which has been cited by the World Bank, estimates that the cost of all the Israeli restrictions on the Palestinian economy amounts to 85% of the Palestinian Authority's, PA's, annual GDP.  That is just one of the estimates.  The restrictions are all-encompassing.  It starts with access to land and water.  As the committee will know, 60% of the West Bank comprises area C, which is under direct Israeli control.  This area contains most of the agricultural and grazing land, water and natural resources.  Palestinian access to these resources is greatly limited by the occupation's restrictions.</p> <p>  Another aspect relates to trade in goods and products between Palestine and the EU.  There is an extensive interim association agreement on free trade between the EU and the PA, which offers very preferential terms to Palestinian exporters but this agreement is neutralised or nullified in practice by the Israeli restrictions that are in place.  Whenever someone wants to export something from Palestine, it needs to go via the Israeli checkpoints and needs to be offloaded, loaded again and controlled.  It is the same case in Israeli ports.  Trade, therefore, faces a lot of disadvantages and delays.  There is no level playing field between the Palestinian exporters who face all of these restrictions and the Israeli settlement exporters and businesses who export to the world and the EU and who enjoy extensive government subsidies and support.  This is something to bear in mind when thinking about this issue.  It is reflected in something we mentioned in our submission, which is the estimate that the volume of imports to the EU from settlements is approximately 15 times greater than the volume of imports from Palestinians in the occupied territories, even though there are many more Palestinians than settlers.  I have not even mentioned Gaza, which is under an even more stringent set of restrictions.  I will pause there.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the Dunnes Stores strikers.  Although I was very young, I was on the picket line with those workers.  That provided us with an opportunity to show real leadership.  We were ahead of our time.  Trade unionists, such as myself, and broader society should be proud of the leadership we showed.  We have been told repeatedly that Ireland punches well above its weight at EU level.  Do the witnesses have any views on the options or opportunities that are available to us within the EU to bring about an outright ban on trade with illegal settlements?  That is what is needed.  Is it a realistic prospect?  We should bear in mind that, when Mary Manning refused to handle those oranges, she was not told that it would start something big and change the world, despite it being very doable.  In fact, she was told there was no point, that a political decision cannot be overturned, that it would never work and that she was just one woman and that this was just a small country hanging off the edge of Europe.  Despite that, look at what we did.  I take great heart from that campaign and that strike.  Do the witnesses see such opportunities for us within the EU given that we have a deserved reputation for punching well above our weight?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Lovatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#C00700"><p>On the Deputy's last question, we all know the political conversation regarding banning certain products is difficult at both national and EU level.  However, I believe that Ireland has an important role to play in building a coalition of member states that can be supportive of such action.  It is important to note that, at present, there has been no conversation on policy at the level of the member states about the banning of settlement products.  Merely starting that conversation is important.  Ireland can do that.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  Second, there are different ways to approach this.  The Irish Parliament has suggested one way, which might be undertaken at national or EU level, but we must remember that the EU is a community of laws, Bills and regulations.  The EU regulates a number of other areas, including that of products tainted by child labour, and the import of seal products and other products.  Why not also regulate products that are derived from actions that violate the core tenets of international law?  Advancing a more regulatory approach is another possibility at either the top level, between member states, or at the level of national parliaments and the European Parliament.</p></speech>

I commend him for his words on that.</p> <p>  I want to refer briefly to the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018, which has been approved by the Seanad.  It has also been approved by the D&aacute;il.  It has not been enacted off the back of advice given by the Attorney General that it is contrary to EU law, but I will put on the record as well the fact that there is strong independent legal opinion which disputes that.  In particular, it is felt that the passing of this legislation could be defeated in the courts and that this would render it not worthwhile.  I would welcome the views of the experts on the legislation, the likelihood of a defeat in the courts but also the likelihood of success were it to be challenged in the courts if we want to take a positive view of it.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, there have been different legal opinions on the issue in Ireland, from the Attorney General and from independent legal experts.  I would add that when it comes to the possibility of adopting such a ban at the EU level, it would be politically difficult because of the divisions among member states.  It would, for example, be unlike the case of the occupied Crimea annexed by Russia where the EU was able to quickly reach a consensus on a ban.</p> <p>  There is a group of lawyers and citizens who have come up with a different idea and who have asked for a ban which would be based on the Commission's legal obligations to respect international law.  This is in order that it would not be formulated as a sanction.  They have come up with the idea of a so-called European citizens' initiative, which would take the form of a petition supported by many citizens in favour of this idea.  It was rejected by the Commission and went to the European Court of Justice.  Now, it is back with the Commission.  When it comes to this possibility at the EU level, it is a pending case to watch closely.</p> <p>  I would follow up on what Mr. Lovatt mentioned previously that the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 in Ireland has sparked discussions on possible similar legislation in several other parliaments around the EU.  That, on its own, is an important effect of the ban starting the discussion, as Mr. Lovatt has mentioned.</p></speech>

The Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018, if it was enacted, could result in a complete ban on imports of goods and services produced in illegal settlements, as the Deputy said.  It was passed by the Oireachtas, but blocked by the Government with a money message.  However, there are a number of independent experts, including the late Professor James Crawford, a professor of international law, who argued that it is lawful for individual member states to ban trade with settlements.  While it is accepted that the EU trade rules are generally uniform across member states, exceptions are granted on grounds of public morality, public policy, public security, the protection of health, etc.  There is a suggestion why not enact the legislation as per the will of the people and the will of the Oireachtas and, if necessary, let the courts decide afterwards if this is legitimate or not.</p></speech>

It is an interesting perspective that there are varying views right across the board.  There are many experts who would say that this Bill is entirely workable.  Indeed, the Members of the Oireachtas agree because we have backed it.</p> <p>  I am struck by the idea that conversations are starting in other EU countries,  I wonder how far advanced they are.  Obviously, other countries are not as far advanced as ourselves in terms of nearly passing the legislation.  I wonder are other countries at an advanced stage of what they are doing or are they still at the exploratory stages.  Can we expect to hear from other EU countries on this issue in the near future?</p></speech>

There is widespread discontent with the policies being pursued in the settlements in the occupied territories.  The issue is what way should Ireland go about addressing this.  I would like whether the witnesses support what the Irish Government is trying to achieve in making progress on this ongoing and difficult situation, which is causing so much hardship.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Lovatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#D00900"><p>When it comes to the Irish Government's approach, there are obviously two conversations, one of which is more relevant to our current exchange.  The first one is, obviously, what is the political and foreign policy approach and the second is the trade.  My understanding is that the Irish Government has tended to say moving forward with perhaps more robust measures against the settlements could undermine reaching a sustainable peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians and could undermine Ireland's potential to play a mediating role.  That was the position of the previous Government as well.</p> <p>  My view is clearly we need to acknowledge at the political side of things that there is a complete deadlock in negotiations but at the same time that the situation on the ground is continuing to deteriorate because of Israel's ongoing settlement policy in wanting to expunge the Palestinian leadership of its responsibilities.  My belief is that before entering into a process of negotiations, and for them to be meaningful, we need to be able to create the foundations for sustainable negotiations and a core part of this is, in my view, to challenge Israel's trajectory of annexation and settlement policy.  This is where the sort of policy of the requirement to trade with Israel and the Palestinians in conformity with international law has a normative and positive impact on the conflict.  I see this differentiation policy and also the idea of banning settlement services and goods as something that is not only aligned with international law but can be supportive of prospects for long-term peace.  Even if it provokes some backlash from the Israeli Government over the short term, it has important benefits over the longer term.</p></speech>

That is not helpful to developing policy in this arena.  While there can be clearly different views about what the best approach should be, it is not right that when an Irish civil servant presents the Irish Government case that should be the reaction.  I do not know whether Mr. Lovatt has comments on that situation.</p></speech>

Are there elements of the case Mr. &Oacute; hAinmhire wants to advance that are accepted as being in line with the legal advice of the Attorney General or is this down to differences of legal opinion?  We are not qualified to adjudicate on such matters.  I certainly am not.

The advice Sadaka had received at the time was fairly strong in that this was something that could have been done.  While it is accepted, as I said earlier, that EU rules are generally uniform across member states and that the EU Commission has competence in the trade area under Article 113, on grounds of public morality and policy, the occupied territories Bill could have been passed.  Even at this stage because this Bill is on the table, we would be suggesting-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.35" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>What we would suggest at this stage is why not enact the legislation which is the will of the Oireachtas and the people of Ireland after a long campaign and, if necessary, subsequently let the courts decide on its legitimacy?  If the courts decide it is not legitimate and not in keeping with EU law, we have to accept it.  After all the work that went into it and the conflicting advices, we feel it is worth letting it go now and letting the experts decide.</p></speech>

Ireland doing this at a national level, perhaps followed by parliaments in a few other member states, could add further incentive for the Commission to take more meaningful progress.</p></speech>

I have been a strong supporter of Palestine for many years.  I have done fundraising and attended many protests in Clare, etc.  With regard to the occupied territories Bill, the labelling is the big one for me in terms of trying to think of something we can handle.  Much of the stuff being asked for is at EU level.  I am not sure, as a Senator on an enterprise, trade and employment committee, what I can do to help.  I do not know if the witnesses were talking to the European affairs people.  I would love if the West Bank, as opposed to the Israeli goods labelling, was enforced from that 2015 Act in which they were going to bring in labelling, but that has never happened.  I know that is at an EU level but I wonder if there is something we could do at an Irish level with regard to saying unless it is labelled, how do we know?  Many of us want to boycott goods coming in from the West Bank but because of lack of labelling, we cannot.  I could take it up with our MEPs but I am not sure what we can do help.  That is the first thing.</p><p>The second thing is with regard to the occupied territories Bill.  Is that not being implemented because of EU law or fear of breaking EU law?  What can we do around that if the Oireachtas and everybody is supporting it?  I am not clear on that either.  I will not pretend to be <i>au fait </i>with that.  I know that labelling is a huge issue in terms of giving ordinary people a choice to show their support in that way by boycotting or purchasing.</p></speech>

We believe the Parliament can play a role in encouraging the Government to be more proactive in this because there is space for Ireland to do more on this.  When it comes to the national level and specifically labelling, the first step would be to ask the Government to assess and evaluate what kinds of imports from settlements there are to Ireland.  In my understanding, in Ireland it is more limited than in some other member states.  We did research specifically into settlement wines being imported into the EU a year and a half ago and we found many of these products in countries such as Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium and France, but not in Ireland.  Maybe the potential of labelling in Ireland is more limited than elsewhere.  First, one would need to look at the scope of the settlement products.  However, our main recommendation today is for Ireland to play a stronger role in promoting differentiation in the EU.  This is something that can be done while the occupied territories Bill is on hold.  In the meantime, there is a whole set of things that can be progressed in the EU.</p></speech>

Due to the nature of Israel's settlement enterprise which, as the D&aacute;il has recognised, has resulted in <i>de facto</i>annexation of the settlements as part of the Israeli state, it has made it increasingly difficult to disassociate business activity within the Israeli state from that which takes place in the illegal settlements.  We need clear procedures and systems to make that differentiation.</p></speech>

We have seen that some other countries have prioritised this issue and as a result, the proportion of correctly labelled products from Israel and settlements has increased.  That would be possible and may be a worthwhile issue to pick up in Ireland as well.</p></speech>

That is what Mr. Konen&yacute; is suggesting in that they should be able to do that.  I was not clear as to how it would be able to do that.

We are very grateful to Sadaka and to Mr. Lovatt and Mr. Konen&yacute; for all their work in this area.  There is a large amount of frustration with the failure to enact the occupied territories Bill.  I have a question about the enforceability or the practical implications of the Bill or the arrangement the witnesses are proposing.  With regard to the UN database of companies involved in settlements, is that something the witnesses are proposing specifically for the Israeli settlements or is it for all occupied territories across the world?  Perhaps they could give us more detail on that.</p></speech>

The UN database already exists.  It is a database of companies involved in the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory.  It was put together and made public at the beginning of last year.  It is not the only such list.  The UN has previously published lists of companies involved in human rights violations in Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  A number of civil society organisations have suggested that it would be good to apply such measures to further conflict zones and occupied territories around the world.</p> <p>  Our main point, and we mention it in our submission, is that the Irish Government has been ambivalent about the database, while countries such as Belgium and Sweden openly welcomed it.  We see a contradiction there between the usual very strong Irish position on the illegality of the settlements and the ambivalent stance on the database.  The database is supposed to be updated annually, but there is a question now as to whether this will happen.  That is why support from European governments for the continuation of this project at the UN is very important, not least from the point of view of the companies that have been listed.  If a company ceases its activities which contribute to the settlements, it has a right to be delisted.  Conversely, companies that get involved in activities supporting settlements should be added to the database.  That is why it is so important to continue the updating process.</p></speech>

Can the witnesses talk about some of the best practice in other countries with regard to that type of legislation and what lessons we might take from other countries for this country?</p></speech>

Much of this legislation builds on the UN guiding principles, which I am sure the Senator is aware of, but seeks to take that to the next level.  The effort to pass legislation requiring enhanced human rights due diligence, especially due diligence reporting, is still a new area that is being legislated and is developing.  When we look at initiatives in some Scandinavian countries, Finland has been talking about it.  Germany, Denmark and Norway have looked at it.  There are some criticisms of it.  In my view, some of the legislation does not go far enough.  Some of the technical criticism is that it only applies to medium or larger businesses and so exempts a stratum of smaller businesses.  I presume that is because of the burden of the reporting requirements.  The second technical criticism is that these reporting requirements are still mostly voluntary.  I would add my personal assessment, which is that there is a question of follow through.  It is one thing to say the company has to do its human rights due diligence reporting, but what is the standard of that reporting and how does the business actually reflect its due diligence in its practices?  That is a more difficult area.  It is not just about writing a report, but ensuring it is correctly applied on trading relations in businesses.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about best practices.  There are examples of legislation that have been discussed, but my view is that these are still very much imperfect.  When it comes to specific situations of occupation and annexation, including Israel's annexation and occupation of Palestinian territory, these Bills can do more to specifically target those instances of unlawful practices.  It is not just about doing.  Most of the legislation is about also looking at whether the chains involved in producing material conform to human rights standards.  This is also a question of whether it conforms to international law and international humanitarian law, IHL, standards.</p> <p>  The final point is that when it comes to settlements, if one is doing effective due diligence, the only outcome or conclusion of due diligence for a foreign business is that it has to withdraw from those settlements.  I do not believe there is any way to mitigate a foreign company's business relations with the settlements in a way that can avoid Israel's internationally unlawful practices.  In other words, if a business wants to respect international law and human rights, the only way to do that in the case of the settlements is to withdraw one's business practices.</p></speech>

The EU approach to the Israeli settlements is a microcosm of its general approach to Israel, which is one that is based on gross hypocrisy.  In the global context, it is happy to cry crocodile tears whenever the latest atrocity takes place, but it facilitates and gives substantial economic benefits to the Israeli state not just in terms of settlements but on a range of fronts, including trade and research funding.  That is epitomised in the question of the settlements.  The EU says they are illegal, which is fine and the correct word, but it continues to do massive trade with them.  It is an important issue to pursue.  It is a wedge issue.  What is the witnesses' perception of what the impact would be if the Irish Government were to respect the will of the D&aacute;il and Seanad and pass and implement the occupied territories Bill?  What would be its impact across Europe and internationally?  Sometimes the argument is made that Ireland is too small and that given the amount of trade it has it would not make a difference.</p></speech>

As we mentioned, it has inspired similar attempts in several other countries.  If it was adopted in Ireland, the impact we have seen already would be several times stronger because there would be a real example of legislation that has been put in place.  I do not believe it would convince all 27 member states to adopt similar legislation because of the well-known differences between them, but it would convince several other parliaments to adopt this.  Perhaps we will see this in any case, as I mentioned earlier.</p><p>If Ireland showed leadership with this Bill, it would definitely spark several other countries to follow.  There is no question about that.</p><p> We know the legislation is kind of on hold in Ireland but it is not that we must wait and do nothing in the meantime.  We know the Government in Ireland has not been in favour of this legislation but it can be a champion of the differentiation policy at EU level and with other member states.  It is something on which it can do much more than it has been doing.</p></speech>

That is very helpful.  I am a supporter of Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, BDS, in general and it has broad support in Irish society.  Many people would like to boycott products or companies that have activity in the settlements.  Will the witnesses speak a little about the activity of companies that have significant Irish operations and what they are doing in the illegal settlements?  For example, I know Veolia has an interest, although I do not know exactly what it does in the settlements.  There is also G4S and other companies where the witnesses could describe the activities they engage in within those settlements.</p></speech>

These are mainly Israeli companies but there are several international companies, including those mentioned by the Deputy.  Some French companies, such as Alstom and Egis, have been involved with projects like light rail in Jerusalem.  There are some British and Dutch companies as well.  None of the companies is headquartered in Ireland but, as the Deputy mentioned, there may be links and some of those companies may be active in Ireland.  There are some cases of European companies known to be actively involved with the occupation and contributing to the viability of the settlements and they are not listed in the database for various reasons.  That is partly because the criteria are relatively narrowly defined and this is the first version of the database and it is yet to be updated.  For example, HeidelbergCement is a German company involved in the extraction of natural resources though a daughter company.  There is also the significant case of a Spanish company, CAF, which is involved with Jerusalem light rail.</p></speech>

Beyond the individual responsibility of companies the core question is how third states transpose international rules-based requirements when it comes to the practices of their domiciled businesses.  Domiciled businesses must first and foremost respect the law of the country in which they are domiciled.  The question, therefore, is how the Irish Government and authorities would regulate the practices and behaviour of businesses.  This is a bigger point.</p> <p>  There are different ways to do this and enhanced due diligence and reporting requirements could be one way.  We could also look at supply chains.  Another possibility, which we have seen the Dutch Government pursuing, is a more proactive engagement with its companies.  Short of banning business relations with settlements, a government could at the very least actively provide advice or even seek to dissuade domiciled companies from engaging in business practices that are at risk of entangling them in internationally unlawful activities.  It is something the Irish Government could be more proactive in doing.</p></speech>

The challenge now for Ireland is to ensure the database is used as an active document that should be fully financed and regularly updated.  It is one of Sadaka's strong advocacy policies with representatives of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  The database enables us to make active choices about who to give our business to.  All the companies on the list are actively profiting from the denial of human rights to the Palestinian people and Sadaka is strongly of the view that Ireland should do everything possible to defend and protect this database and develop it further.</p></speech>

I am not somebody who would be completely <i>au fait</i>with what has been going on in Israel for the past while.  Like many, I have been detached, to a degree, in looking at it and feeling we are not empowered to do much about it.  I am shocked by the GDP figures supplied by Sadaka, particularly the idea of 100 times the value being evident in settlements than from the Palestinians.  As has been mentioned, Ireland has shown leadership in the past and from communities before any action was taken by the Government.</p><p>What will the housing and settlement policy be under Mr. Naftali Bennett?  Do the witnesses foresee a change in it?  What about the influence of the US if the EU is slow to try to adopt new initiatives there?</p><p>As I have said, I am not fully aware of what the witnesses have been doing but the database they have mentioned should be publicised.  Irish people are perceptive and receptive to such matters.  There are many people involved with supply chain and component manufacturing and it is hard to see their participation in the end product.  It is something that must be thought about.  With regard to the Palestinian GDP trajectory, the witnesses have indicated that the EU is the largest supporter in innovation.  Outside the EU, who is supporting budgets to advance innovation in Palestinian GDP?</p><p>My final point refers to the occupied territories Bill.  To what extent is our multinational and foreign direct investment sector a component in the Government's resistance to advancing the legislation?</p></speech>

On the Israeli Government's settlement policy, we are in the early days in the life of the Israeli Government, which has such a heterogenous political composition.  My view is that because of the difficulties in the Israeli Government, which needs a balance between centre left and right-wing ideology, there will be a continuation of the settlement policy under Mr. Netanyahu.  Over the past few weeks we have seen that continuation.</p> <p>  Settlement policy is not just about the building of these settlements, which is continuing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but it is also about the forcible dispossession of Palestinians.  That continues in the likes of Silwan, Sheikh Jarrah or Humsa in the Jordan Valley or elsewhere.  Some of the mood music may change in the future if, hypothetically, there is US pressure.  Perhaps they will try to row back some of the more egregious examples of Israeli settlement building and eviction of Palestinians.</p><p>While there could be some tweaks to that on the margins, the full thrust of Israel's settlement policy will remain unchanged.  It has remained unchanged since 1967, irrespective of who has been Prime Minister.</p><p> On US influence, my advice to European governments would be that at a moment in which the prospects for meaningful negotiations are not just deadlocked but have frankly evaporated and at a moment in which the US has limited bandwidth and is not seeking to prioritise this conflict beyond some minimum conflict management measures, there is clearly an opening for the EU and its member states to take a more forward leaning and proactive role.  The preference is to focus on the bigger picture political issues and the need to revive negotiations.  My advice is to focus on the fundamentals.  When it comes to Israel, the fundamental issue is the need to check its settlement activities and the effect this can produce on the domestic conversation within Israel.  My plea to European governments is to invest some effort and political capital in that.  Perhaps the US Government will, at least privately, be receptive to seeing Europe taking a more forward leaning role and investing political capital to take real action in support of the future revival of negotiations.</p></speech>

How can they also become away of the importance of looking at labelling and requesting labelling that shows exactly who is involved in the supply chain and if products are coming from the occupied territories?</p></speech>

A more popular version has been published by an organisation called Visualizing Palestine.  In that version one can easily see the different companies and their activities.  The tools and information are available on the Internet and it is about bringing that closer to the public and the broad citizenry.  That is where civil society is already playing a role and parliamentarians can also do so with their constituencies.</p></speech>

Perhaps someone Irish would be better placed than me so Mr. &Oacute; hAinmhire might comment.  On foreign support, this mostly goes to budgetary support for the Palestinian Authority and then there is also support for the humanitarian sector.  The EU and its member states lead on this.  We need to recognise that funding support has decreased across the board, especially among Arab donors.  Money from the US is mostly suspended for domestic legislative reasons.  It is a worrying backdrop that this financial support is declining.</p></speech>

The then Government had indicated that it was going to use a money message, which may not have been entirely relevant but that was the means it was going to use to not advance the Bill.</p> <p>  On the UN database, I understand that it was developed in Geneva at the UN Human Rights Council and there is a feeling that there may be some pressure not to proceed, not to fund it further and not to develop it.  It needs to be updated on a regular basis.  This is one area in which Ireland could be involved at EU level and at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to ensure the database is defended, developed and updated.</p></speech>

It has been a useful debate.  We have heard some good facts, which were horrific at the same time, on the volume of goods from the occupied territories that are making their way across the EU.  I visited Palestine five years ago and saw for myself that Israel is implementing apartheid there.  Israel is an apartheid state and it is important to put that on the record.  Like so many others, I am hugely frustrated about the occupied territories Bill in particular because we know there is good legal advice stating that it is in line with EU law.  There is no consensus on the Attorney General's opinion.</p> <p>  I have to be frank and call out Fine Gael because we know that party opposed the occupied territories Bill. The T&aacute;naiste is on record as saying that he opposed the Bill on political and legal grounds.  How is it acceptable in this day and age for the Fine Gael party to stand against a Bill that has the full support of the Irish people and which would do something concrete and would help us lead the way in tackling apartheid?  I am old enough to remember the Dunnes Stores strikers, I stood with them as a teenager and I remember the stance they took against apartheid.  I remember that there were political parties and participants that were reluctant to come on board back then too.  It is shocking that we are still in that state of play today.</p> <p>  I am intrigued by the issue of the UN database because, as many other speakers have indicated, this is important and it is a powerful means of information to help share facts relating to companies that are investing in illegal settlements.  What are the witnesses' views on why the Irish Government has not expressed support for this to date?  Surely this is the least we can do.</p></speech>

It is clear that the Israeli Government has exerted considerable political effort, in partnership with some Israeli right-wing civil society organisations, to delegitimise the database by depicting it as a blacklist, which it is not, or by depicting it as BDS, which it is not and by levelling accusations at it and at the proponents of it as variously supporting anti-Semitic and anti-Israel actions and so on.  That has created a political climate in which many governments are reluctant to wade too deeply into this for fear of exposing themselves to what has become a politically divisive conversation, which it is not.  It should be clear why this is so.  Nevertheless, that is the result of Israeli efforts to make this a divisive issue.</p> <p>  To go back to the point I made earlier, there is also a fear that we have seen echoed on other actions, whether it is recognising Palestine or banning settlement products, that this is harmful to the prospect of peace negotiations and that somehow this undercuts the prospects of peace.  We need to take a step back and appreciate the political context in which there is no prospect of meaningful negotiations at the moment.  Those are two issues but I will reserve judgment on the Irish Government's motivations for someone else.</p></speech>

I will again ask the panel about the stance of the EU because gross hypocrisy is going on.  The EU and Israel have signed an energy infrastructure agreement, which will effectively lock in the occupied territories in terms of future trade.  I appreciate what Mr. Lovatt said about the powerful lobbying the Israeli Government, or apartheid regime, has undertaken.  However, if the EU is not going to deliver is there not a greater onus on the Irish Government to act at a national level, specifically, by supporting Senator Black's occupied territories Bill?</p></speech>

There should be few illusions about how far the EU can go in its policy over the next number of years.  In the longer term, possibly, the political dynamics between member states will change but we still see distinct space in the EU both at EU and member state level - not all states but perhaps half of them - to progress the policy of differentiation.  This is where the focus should be in terms of a practical effort to move some matters forward.  It is not a silver bullet that will help end the occupation on its own but starting from where EU politics are at this point, there is space to do something meaningful which will add weight to all the proclamations and statements the EU and national governments are making about the illegality and unhelpfulness of the Israeli settlements.  We recommend that is what is focused on.</p></speech>

The EU Members of the HRC therefore abstained on the vote on the Resolution.  Despite these reservations, Ireland fully cooperated with requests for assistance [from] the Office of the High Commissioner...in the task [that] they had been assigned. </blockquote></speech>

The way the UN office handled the database has alleviated concerns that it would be too broad.  That is why countries like Belgium and Sweden, even before the publication of the database and it was clear where it was heading, expressed support for it.  We still have not heard such a position from the Irish Government which, again, is strange given its otherwise very outspoken and clear position on the settlement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#J00800"><p>I will follow up on a couple of matters.  In one sense, I imagine it must be frustrating for the witnesses contributing today if they are trying to see some advancement.  It is important to try to take something away from these actions that can be progressed.  It is very important to state that perception is reality to people.  Communication is very important.  If people are not informed or communication is not available to them, one cannot move public opinion.  I often think that politicians follow people, not the other way around.  Some politics lead but a lot of politicians follow.  Dunnes Stores was a case in point.</p> <p>  I will go back to the database issue.  Senator Garvey offered some access to two Green Party MEPs.  It is very important to progress that today in respect of labelling issues, in particular, and to try to bring it up within the EU.  Is there ring-fenced funding to keep the present database updated and supported?  The occupied territories Bill is obviously part of this policy of differentiation.  Perhaps the Bill is too far for the Government to go at this point in time but there is no reason we could not enact something to support a policy of differentiation.  Again, this will require communication and I do not know who can lead or fund that.  </p> <p>  Certainly, the Irish people are very well aware of discrimination and inequity.  They do not like it no matter where they see it, whether it is racism or anything else.  We are one of the most inclusive societies.  People would be publicly appalled if the disparity in GDP and the throttling down of the Palestinian economy by the Israelis was widely known.  Is there some way the witnesses can look at trying to get large-scale public advancement and communication, and marketing and advertising, out there to try to inform public opinion?  That is probably the best way of getting politicians to follow.</p></speech>

We will continue to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#J01000"><p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; hAinmhire but the problem I am pointing to, and I class myself as somebody who is reasonably well informed, is that I am not necessarily going to land on the Sadaka website.  I am talking about some kind of larger scale or very targeted communications to try to put these inequities out there and highlight them to people, even by getting simple messages about the ratios of Palestinian versus settler GDP into the consumer space, forcing people to think about what they buy, how they act, how they can influence what is going on and trying to inform them.  We need more than a political discussion.  We need a really public campaign on that.</p></speech>

There is far more support for measures targeting Israeli settlements than perhaps some governments would seem to indicate.  That also applies to the US, which is another conversation.  There is a support base so the question is, if the public is there, is it time for governments to build on that and to lead?</p></speech>

I am just trying to highlight it.  Mr. Lovatt is correct that the public is far ahead of the politics on this but it is a question of trying to create the pressure that will force politicians to follow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#J01300"><p>I apologise but I will have to leave the meeting after my contribution.  I am conscious of the need to put information into the public domain.  I do not want to overuse the Dunnes Stores strike example but it is my genuine belief that in that case people switched from just looking for the best value oranges or products to actually looking at where those products came from.  It was a very important moment in our history.  Deputy Shanahan made a good point on what role we might have in putting that sort of information into the public domain.  I share what I think is his belief in that once people know, are informed and have the information, they will come down on the side of the Palestinian people.  I cannot see how they would not.</p> <p>  The EU position on the databases dates from 2016.</p><p>Obviously, a lot has happened since then.  Is it possible to revisit that position?  Would there by any value in doing so?  Belgium and other countries have come out in support of the database.  Is there anything the committee could advise the Government to do in this regard?  That is a decision for the committee to make at a later date.   This might be a case where the people are, in the main, ahead of most politicians.  The committee may be able to use its position to advise the Government to follow the lead of Belgium.  From that would come a really necessary mainstream conversation.  I have been to many pro-Palestinian meetings, protests and so on during my time working for a union and up to now.  We have to stop speaking to ourselves and begin speaking to the public on this issue.  It is a message to which many people would be very receptive.  The strike evidenced that.  I refer to the fact that people in local shops are checking from where the products they purchase come.  That is certainly the case in my local shop.  It is important to make as much of that information as possible available.  Is there value in the committee deciding at a later stage to engage with the Government and request that it follow the lead of Belgium and other countries, given that there does not seem to be a significant amount of hostility from the Government towards doing so?</p><p> I am mindful of the comments of Senator Gavan.  We know from where the blockages are coming.  It would be silly not to acknowledge that we know it comes specifically from one party, but with support from the other two parties in government.  I will not give a free pass to those two parties.  Is there value in Ireland doing what Belgium has done?  Would that be a worthwhile endeavour?  I wish to take from this meeting actions that the committee can consider.</p></speech>

There are some comments I wish to make.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Konen&yacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#K00300"><p>I will try to be brief to allow time for Mr. Lovatt to reply.  Doing what the Deputy has suggested would be very useful.  What the Government can do specifically is maybe not simply to express support for the database, which would be useful, but, most importantly, look for practical solutions with regard to ensuring the continued updating of the database.  That includes the issue of the budget for the UN to be able to do this.  It is about the Irish Government, along with other governments, reaching out to other member states and the UN secretariat in Geneva to jointly look for a solution in terms of how this globally important work can be continued.  I am sure practical solutions can be found as long as there is a little bit of political will.</p> <p>  Another issue worth considering is whether to focus only on the database or to also focus on the broader set of issues we are raising in this conversation and in our paper.  It may be the case that discussing with the Government how the differentiation policy can be advanced more broadly, looking at several specific issues, of which the database is one, could be even more interesting and productive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.88" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Lovatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#K00400"><p>I will add two quick points specifically on the database.   There is a question to be put to the Government and the relevant Ministries regarding how they reflect the findings of the database when it comes to their engagement with companies that are domiciled in Ireland.  Members may recall that the Irish Government has published business advisory for companies which warns of the reputational, financial and legal risks of doing business in the settlements.  The UN database is, in many ways, the embodiment of those warnings.  As a result, there is a question about whether the database should now be an opportunity for the Government to take a more proactive stance toward the companies, as has been discussed.</p> <p>  The blockage is mostly political and, in that context, Ireland has an important role to play in mainstreaming the understanding and acceptance of the database, both with other member states and at EU level, but also at the UN, using its seat on the UN Security Council.  Being able to embrace the database and state it is perfectly legitimate and acceptable and it is actually the minimum we should be doing would be a powerful message in itself.</p></speech>

That is true.  Ireland has shown leadership.  This is a question of leadership.  Rather than just rowing in with the consensus at EU level, it is about taking a stand and pushing on certain issues.</p> <p>  On differentiation, I have noticed many parliamentary questions have been tabled on the issue recently.  The question here really relates to the fact that we in Ireland indicate strongly that we do not trade with areas occupied in 1967.  How is that being done or implemented?  What processes and systems are in place to do that?  We have not managed to get any detail on systems that are in place.  As already stated, the trading system in the occupied territories is so complex that we need good systems and procedures to ensure the policy is implemented.</p></speech>

Let us try to end the meeting on a positive note, if we can, in terms of the specifics in that regard.  I am very taken by what Mr. &Oacute; hAinmhire just said.  We just do not know how Departments work in terms of procedures and systems to ensure the differentiation is applied properly.  We just do not have that information.  I am seeking a positive we can take from the meeting in terms of how to encourage the Government to really be proactive because I am not convinced the necessary conversations are currently happening from our side across Europe.  What steps do we need to take in terms of Ireland becoming a champion of the differentiation policy?  What are the concrete suggestions relating to those steps that we can take away from this meeting and bring to the Government?</p></speech>

That is probably what it would tell the members, as parliamentarians.  However, leadership is about more than just expressing support.  Leadership is when a member state takes the initiative and convenes a meeting with other member states on a certain issue or tables a written proposal for discussion with other member states or when a Government representative at the most senior level, such as a foreign minister, personally takes the issue forward and discusses it with fellow ministers, the European Commission or the UN High Representative.  I have not seen that level of leadership so far.  When there are discussions in the EU, member states need to take the lead in order for movement to occur.  Nothing moves in the EU without member states taking the lead and championing certain issues and moving them forward.  We have seen that if member states, even those smaller than Ireland, take a certain issue seriously, they can make a significant difference and advance a certain agenda.  Practically speaking, that is to what I refer in terms of leadership.</p> <p>  As regards concrete steps within the differentiation basket, we have listed several of them in our written submission but those are just examples.  There are more things that could be considered.  We do not want the discussion to be stuck on the details at this stage.</p><p>It is important to advance the discussion on all possible options to advance differentiation.  We would be happy to discuss some of the specific options now, if that would be useful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#L00200"><p>It would be useful.  I have one last point.  It is clear that the EU has taken strong steps on Russia's action against Crimea.  I am at a loss to understand why the EU cannot take those same steps with regard to the apartheid regime that Israel is implementing in the occupied territories.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.94" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Lovatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#L00300"><p>I will pick up on a few of Mr. Konen&yacute;'s points.  We can continue to expand and deepen the conversation on practicalities.  The idea of crafting a coalition of like-minded states is at the heart of any action.  This is not just about bringing together like-minded governments but also about bringing together like-minded ministries and exchanging best practices at a ministerial working level.  Other states have also encountered technical challenges with implementing differentiation and have come up with some solutions.  Likewise, Ireland has perhaps come up with some solutions which it can also share as best practice with other member states.  It is also a matter of building a coalition of the willing at the parliamentary and committee levels and trying to connect these various initiatives that are taking place, both in this House and elsewhere.  Labelling is an example of where that happened because a number of foreign ministers came together who actively pushed successive high representatives to come up with a solution and guidelines.  Why not replicate that elsewhere?</p> <p>  At a national level, there needs to be a more proactive Government policy to audit or review the full spectrum of national level relations with Ireland.  This is not all about EU-level agreements.  Ireland has some agreements with Israel, including a taxation agreement.  The Government's policies are good.  In large part, that is thanks to the efforts of the Irish Parliament, which has pressed the Government to clarify its positions.  The next stage, as Mr. Konen&yacute; said, now that the Government has made its positions clear and indicated that its remit does not apply to the settlements, is the question of how that policy is given effect and what mechanisms there are to ensure that.  Even coming up with those technical actions is important not just in an Irish context but also with regard to sharing best practice and solutions with other member states, which may also be looking at similar issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Konen&yacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#L00400"><p>There are already some good practices for Ireland to share with other member states.  As we mentioned, Ireland has explicitly made clear that bilateral agreements between Ireland and Israel only apply to Israel within its internationally recognised, pre-1967 borders, and that they do not apply to the settlements.  A few member states have stated that, but not many.  It is important to increase the number of member states which are explicit about this.  To give another specific example which is more at the EU level, there is no common advice for European businesses about whether to invest and have other economic links in settlements.  A number of member states, including Ireland, have such an advisory on government websites.  We counted 18 member states with such an advisory.  Those were jointly agreed several years ago.  The EU has not published such an advisory.  This is a tiny, simple step that could be taken at EU level, but all of this requires demand and requests from member states.  It is only then that things will happen.</p></speech>

An audit and review of exactly where we are with regard to goods would be invaluable.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

I am pleased to welcome Ms Suzanne Keatinge, CEO of D&oacute;chas, and Ms Caoimhe de Barra, CEO of Tr&oacute;caire.  A special welcome to Ms Gloria Soma, director of the Titi Foundation in South Sudan, who is joining us from Sudan.  I also welcome Mr. Dominic MacSorley, CEO of Concern Worldwide, who is no stranger to development matters.  They are very welcome to our meeting.  It is most timely because this is the last week of our parliamentary session.  When we come back in late August or early September, thoughts and minds will firmly turn towards budgetary matters.  I felt it was important that we had an opportunity to have this engagement prior to that.</p><p>The format of the meeting is that we will hear an opening statement from the witnesses which, we understand, will be delivered by Ms Keatinge, before going into a question-and-answer session with members of the committee.  As we are quite time limited due to Covid restrictions, I ask that witnesses be concise and conscious of the time constraints when initially addressing our committee.  I ask members to be concise in order to allow all members an opportunity to ask questions.</p><p>I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that we should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make any person readily identifiable or engage otherwise in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identified person or entity, you will be directed to discontinue your remarks.  It is imperative that any direction be complied with. </p><p>For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, you may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who might be physically present does.  Witnesses participating in the committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised to be mindful of the domestic law and how it may apply to evidence given. </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located either in the Leinster House complex here or the conference centre where the D&aacute;il and Seanad are meeting in plenary session today. </p><p>For anybody watching this meeting online, some Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely due to these unprecedented circumstances.  As a large number of people are attending the meeting remotely, I ask that everybody bear with us in the event that any technical difficulties may interrupt or in any way adversely affect our proceedings. </p><p>I am very pleased to call on Ms Keatinge to make the opening statement.  I acknowledge the timing of her letter in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, which made for very good early morning reading for me and, I am sure, members of our committee.  The timing is also significant, having regard to last night's vote in our neighbouring jurisdiction, the UK, on a cut to the international development assistance budget.  Without pre-empting anything that might be said in this meeting, I am sure committee members will join with me in warning our Government not to envisage a similar type of cut in our budget in the autumn.  I note the reason or excuse given was because of Covid.</p><p>I take the view that precisely because of Covid-19 and how it affects developing world, poor and disadvantaged areas, it would be a reason to ensure an increase in our budget rather than a cut, as we have seen in our neighbouring jurisdiction.  In any event we will have an opportunity over the next hour or more to detail some of the issues.  I am very pleased to call on Ms Keatinge to lead off with her opening statement.</p></speech>

As the Chairman has said himself, this is such an important moment and budget for us particularly because of Covid-19.  I am therefore very grateful on behalf of D&oacute;chas and are our members to have the opportunity to engage with the joint committee this morning on our pre-budget submission.</p> <p>  I am very conscious that it is almost the summer holidays so we appreciate the committee attending here this morning and I hope that it shows a real sense of urgency and the importance of budget 2022 from the perspective of Irish international agencies which make up the D&oacute;chas network.  Together, D&oacute;chas members - development, human rights and humanitarian organisations -  employ more than 5,000 people in Ireland and many more globally, supporting local communities in more than 100 countries across the world.  They and their local partners can be considered Ireland&rsquo;s global front-line workers as they work around the clock, often in very insecure environments, to contain the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  I hope the committee will see then from the detail in our pre-budget submission that this has been no ordinary year.</p> <p>  The pandemic has not only been a global public health crisis but has shown the widening gap between rich and poor and threatened for the first time in decades development gains such as the fight to eradicate poverty and hunger, and of equal importance, the progression of human rights commitments related, in particular, to gender equality, including equal access to education for girls and for people with disabilities.  The pandemic has also allowed some governments to roll back on their commitments on human rights, including protecting human rights defenders as well as protecting civilians in times of war and respecting international humanitarian law.</p> <p>  We come before the joint committee today because we believe the pandemic, climate change and conflict are shared burdens that can only be resolved through collective action by governments, by the joint committee members as politicians, by NGOs, by businesses and, perhaps most important of all, by local communities themselves.  Given the critical value of Ireland&rsquo;s international development co-operation, especially Irish Aid, and Ireland&rsquo;s very significant diplomatic efforts on the UN Security Council, I ask the joint committee to formally contact the Government in support of our pre-budget submission and, in particular, to contact the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Deputy Coveney and the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid and diaspora, Deputy Brophy.</p> <p>  Our key ask is that now more than ever, particularly in light of the devastating impact of Covid-19, the Government needs to increase its spending on official development assistance, ODA, if it is to deliver on its own Global Ireland: Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025 strategy and Irish Aid&rsquo;s international development policy, A Better World, which pledges that we will leave no one behind.  Specifically, the Government needs to increase ODA in real terms in budget 2022 and offer a clear pathway to achieving 0.5% of gross national income, GNI, by 2025 and onwards to the UN internationally-recognised target of 0.7% by 2030.</p> <p>  We would also ask that all political parties represented here today, as well as any non-party representatives, recommit in their own pre-budget submissions to reaching the target of spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA.</p> <p>  With the permission of the Chairman, I will now take the joint committee briefly through the other key points of our pre-budget submission before welcoming Caoimhe de Barre, CEO of Tr&oacute;caire, who will introduce one of its partners, Gloria Soma, director of the Titi Foundation speaking to the committee from South Sudan on what it has been like to live through this pandemic.  Dominic MacSorely, CEO of Concern, will also briefly provide opening words to give an insight from his organization on the importance and impact of ODA in the fight against hunger.</p> <p>  It is worth recalling that the Government in its Programme for Government: Our Shared Future recommitted itself to reaching Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing target of spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA by 2030.  We have also been encouraged by the continued support across the political spectrum to reaching this target.  However, it is important to remind the joint committee members today that from a high of 0.58% in 2008, our aid spending fell and has since stagnated.  When the sustainable development goals were signed by Ireland in New York in 2015 by this Government our spend had fallen to just 0.32% of GNI.  It fell further last year to 0.31% despite the welcome cash increase of &euro;30 million bringing the total amount to &euro;868 million.  The latest Government estimates on ODA suggest that it will increase to 0.32% this year.  This is below the average reached by many other EU member states in the OECD which is at 0.5%.</p> <p>  We therefore need to impress on this joint committee that the Government needs to increase the pace of spending on ODA so that we do not let another year slip by.  Time is no longer on our side.  In budget 2022 Ireland needs to make much more determined progress.</p> <p>  This committee is well aware that Ireland is recognized around the world for its principled and high quality aid programme.  We have previously mentioned that the OECD Development Assistance Committee, DAC, in its peer review last year said that Ireland&rsquo;s programme is &ldquo;strong with many areas of excellence&rdquo; and that Ireland &ldquo;walks the talk&rdquo; in prioritising the furthest behind.</p> <p>  However, that peer review also stressed that more needs to be done to match Ireland&rsquo;s political willingness to reach the internationally recognised target of aid spending.  In other words, what we do with our ODA is very strong and has real impact on the ground but we simply need to do more of it.</p> <p>  It is incredible to think that we have still been unable to physically meet with the joint committee for over 15 months now.  Who would have imagined it this time last year?  We regret also that for some of the members it has not been possible to experience for themselves the amazing work of Irish international NGOs on the ground.  Nor have they been able to experience what it feels like to visit a refugee camp, or experience the sights and sounds of being in a village devastated by locusts or flooding, or indeed to understand what social distancing feels like in an urban slum in one of the many mega-cities mushrooming around the world.</p> <p>  All of us here today, however, understand and appreciate the enormous impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had on our lives and on our communities.  We all know families who have suffered bereavement, whose livelihoods have been damaged, and whose lives and future opportunities have been significantly altered.  We appreciate too the massive long-term toll that the pandemic may have on our economy and society.</p> <p>  It is with this backdrop that I ask the joint committee members today to live up to our roles as global citizens and to appreciate the devastating impact of the pandemic on countries already suffering from hunger, conflict, drought and locusts.  Quite simply, it has become a matter of life and death with frail and fragile health systems breaking down and with people having nowhere else to turn.</p> <p>  D&oacute;chas's pre-budget submission provides some devastating statistics on the impact of the pandemic but equally important some positive examples on how Irish NGOs and their local partners are rising to the challenge.  We can get through this if we work together.</p> <p>  It is by keeping these vulnerable communities at the forefront of our conversation today, indeed at the heart of policy-making, that D&oacute;chas calls on the Government in advance of budget 2022 to do the following - increase Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance to ensure Ireland keeps pace with global needs now and in the post-Covid-19 environment; ensure additional and targeted financing for climate change mitigation and adaptation to support least-developed countries, LDCs, and small island developing states, SIDS; use Ireland&rsquo;s voice at the UN Security Council, at the EU and in other international forums to champion human rights defenders and the role being played by civil society; advocate to ensure that the global community produces enough vaccine doses for everyone, everywhere; and lastly to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s global leadership on sustainable development goal 2: zero hunger.</p><p>I thank the committee for its attention and its ongoing support to D&oacute;chas and its members.  I will hand over to Ms de Barra, CEO of Tr&oacute;caire.</p></speech>

We are witnessing the triple threat of coronavirus, climate change and conflict.  These are in danger of creating a long-term humanitarian catastrophe from which the world may not recover but that is not inevitable.  It is the people in the most vulnerable situations and most fragile countries who are suffering the worst health and socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic.  We, in organisations such as Tr&oacute;caire, Concern and others, together with our local partners have seen this unfolding directly through out work and have witnessed the devastating human impact of it.  At a broad scale, in the two decades to 2020, huge progress had been achieved in reducing poverty.  The number of people living in poverty globally fell by 1 billion over those two decades.  However, the World Bank estimates that as a result of Covid-19, an additional 120 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty.  In addition, over the course of the next ten years, as a result of climate change a further 130 million people are also at risk of extreme poverty.  My point is there is a compound impact of Covid, climate change and conflict.  It was great to hear the Cathaoirleach say he believed Covid and the Covid crisis are reasons to increase aid, not decrease it, and we fully agree and endorse that.</p> <p>  However, Covid is not the only crisis affecting people; it is compounding multiple crises.  For example, Ethiopia is experiencing its worst hunger crisis in 20 years.  Across the entirety of east Africa 30 million people are also facing extreme levels of food insecurity as a result of climate, drought, flooding, locust infestation and conflict.  In Syria, a country that has suffered ten years of conflict, we are seeing the highest ever need for humanitarian assistance.  Its humanitarian needs have increased by 20% over the last 12 months alone.  Covid-19 continues to spread at an alarming rate in that context while the healthcare infrastructure, decimated by years of conflict, remains woefully inadequate to respond.  However, we are having an impact through Irish Aid.  Our partnership, as Tr&oacute;caire alone, delivers life-saving and life-changing programmes in some of the poorest and most vulnerable communities in the world.  For example - and this is just one agency with Irish Aid funding - we managed to reach 426,000 individuals in the past year with support to mitigate the direct and secondary impacts of Covid-19.  The direct impacts are health impacts and the secondary impacts are almost more impactful and devastating, such as food insecurity, violence against women and violence against human rights defenders.</p> <p>  As Ms Keatinge said, increased overseas development assistance, ODA, is needed now more than ever.  Ensuring we do not lose the major development gains due to the pandemic will be difficult but it is achievable.  We believe we must step up and respond to the scale of the crisis with appropriate ambition and action.  I am delighted to hand over to Ms Gloria Soma, who will be able to give us a clear perspective from a country that has been ravaged by the three issues we have mentioned here, namely Covid, climate and conflict.</p></speech>

I have worked in South Sudan for the last eight years and have experienced first-hand the scale of the humanitarian need but also the positive impact of development assistance on the ground.  South Sudan marked its tenth anniversary last week.  It is the world&rsquo;s youngest nation and continues to face immense hunger, violence and now the challenges of Covid-19.  The humanitarian situation in South Sudan is getting worse due to the cumulative effects of years of conflict and violence, climate shocks, including recurring floods and droughts, and now the impact of Covid-19.  We estimate 8.3 million people to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021, which is nearly 70% of the population.  The expectation is 7.7 million people will face crisis-level food insecurity or worse.  This is an increase of 15% on 2020.  The added challenges of the health impacts of Covid-19, along with the related impacts of lockdowns, rising food prices, unemployment, falling incomes and school closures, all exacerbated by a lack of access to vaccines, have really set us back.  Economic pressure can often manifest in gendered ways, and approximately 1,500 teenage girls in the equatorial states have been married off or are pregnant.  The temporary closure of schools has disrupted children&rsquo;s education, limited access to services such as school feeding programmes and increased exposure to gender-based violence.  Many girls who have left will not return to school again.  As ever, it is the poorest who are being hit hardest.  Despite the roll-out of vaccines that we have seen in Ireland, vaccine access in South Sudan remains low.  South Sudan has received fewer than 900,000 vaccines via the COVAX system and communities have not been adequately engaged in the roll-out process, which means poor uptake across the population.  The weak health system of South Sudan is a further challenge to the roll-out.  The importance of access to vaccines, Ireland&rsquo;s support for the proposed waiver on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, and public health support for the people of South Sudan cannot be overstated.</p> <p>  I would like to finish with the good news though.  The impact of Irish Aid funding in South Sudan has been immense.  Tr&oacute;caire&rsquo;s office in South Sudan, in partnership with local organisations like mine, has received just under &euro;620,000 of Irish Aid funding in 2020 and into early 2021.  With this, we have reached over 18,495 people with a combination of support, including food assistance, access to safe water, agricultural support, psychosocial and gender-based violence support and menstrual hygiene kits, which help to keep young girls in school.  Lockdown came to South Sudan in April 2020 and between January and September 2020, my organisation saw over 6,000 reported incidents of gender-based violence against women and girls.  Through Irish Aid-funded projects, cases of gender based violence have been identified, which have been reported and referred onwards.  These cases would otherwise have been left unreported.  Tr&oacute;caire&rsquo;s programme on gender inequality has resulted in increased reporting of gender-based violence cases.  It has also allowed us to push for more prosecutions of sexual abuse against women and girls.  It has helped us increase economic opportunities for women to gain financial independence, to support women&rsquo;s participation in community peace-building initiatives and to build a flourishing women&rsquo;s leadership programme where women leaders support new and emerging leaders.  Real change can be delivered only by working in partnership with local communities affected by poverty and injustice.  They know what works, they know what needs to change and are working to make this happen.  They just need your solidarity to make this a reality.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and the clerk to the committee for facilitating this important discussion at such a critical time in the budget 2022 negotiations.  Our core message is Ireland&rsquo;s aid is not only a lifeline for millions of people but it is also an investment in a better, more peaceful, world.  Its impact cannot be underestimated and it is needed now more than ever.</p> <p>  The pandemic has been a brutal reminder of our collective vulnerability and interdependence.  Concern is an organisation that is hard-wired to respond to emergencies but we had never had to deal with a crisis that affected all of our country programme and home offices at the same time.  However, our commitment to stay and deliver during crises held strong and we had three key priorities, namely, to protect the health and safety of our 4,000 staff, to adapt our ongoing programmes to keep them operating to the fullest extent possible and to scale up Covid prevention messages across all the communities we work with.  For example, we installed 1,200 extra water and sanitation stations inside Syria.  We distributed soap and clean water to 600,000 displaced people in South Sudan, where Ms Soma is working.</p><p>We work closely with the ministry of education in Sierra Leone to ensure that children can continue their education remotely.  With our partners, we provided Covid prevention training and messaging to close to 20 million last year.  Closer to home, we were able to allow 9,300 Irish students to continue the school debates programme online.  All of these programmes were supported by Irish Aid.  Central to our ability to pivot and be flexible was the flexibility and adaptability of the Irish Aid team, whose members worked tirelessly and were phenomenally supportive of all agencies in enabling us to respond so effectively.</p><p> To say that the pandemic has been devastating for the poorest people is an understatement.  There is a crisis on every level - health, gender-based violence, education, livelihoods, peace and, most important, hunger and a deepening inequality, which are disproportionately affecting women and children.  Late last year, we were part of a global survey of 16,000 households across 25 countries that looked at the impact of Covid across multiple levels.  What was notable was the direct impact of lockdowns on women working in the informal sector, who repeatedly stated that, if they did not work that day, they would not eat that night.  Some 60% of women had cut meals, mothers were eating less and last, and violence against women and children was spiralling, in some cases by a factor of four.  A staggering 270 million people are estimated to be acutely food insecure or at high risk.  That is an 81% increase since the onset of Covid.  The figures are mind numbing and staggering.</p><p> As Ms de Barra stated, we cannot blame Covid for everything.  Climate change has played a key role.  The 43 countries most at risk were all experiencing conflict-induced hunger before the pandemic.  In most of the countries where we are working, conflict is a key driver of food insecurity.  In Somalia, 3 million people are in integrated food security phase classification, IPC, 3.  This means that food consumption gaps are widening, matched with increased levels of acute malnutrition.  This is due to a combination of failed rains, conflict and a population that is still dealing with the impact of locusts.</p><p> Haiti is in the news due to the assassination of its President.  Prior to that, 12% of its population were classified as being in emergency phase 4.  This means high levels of acute malnutrition and excess mortality.  People had already started desperately selling off whatever assets they had.  Haiti, which Ireland has consistently supported for many years, is a country that has been in decline, but there was also a poor harvest last year.  The lack of remittances as a result of Covid became a key contributor.  Haiti is a classic example of the UN humanitarian appeal, which is a modest $235 million but is only 5.4% funded.  That is shocking, given the level of need.  Sadly, we know that these figures will get worse.  September to December will be a tough time for people who are depending on harvests.  With the Covid crisis deepening, the number of new cases is doubling every 18 days, with less than 2% of the population fully vaccinated.</p><p> Some front-line staff working with agencies in Liberia have got their vaccines.  Others were told yesterday that they would not get their second doses until August because supplies had run out.  These are the people who are treating cases.</p><p> The level of need is increasing and the level of funding relative to those needs is down.  The global humanitarian appeal of $35 billion is just 25% funded, which is the lowest we have seen and we are only mid-year.  Fortunately, Irish Aid, the EU and USAID are three of the key donors that have stayed the course and increased funding in response to the large-scale humanitarian crisis.  Unfortunately, we are not seeing the same from others, notably the UK, whose recent cuts to aid already amounted to &pound;5 billion this year.  I know that Tr&oacute;caire and GOAL have been affected.  For us, we are looking at cuts of more than $8 million across Malawi, Sierra Leone and Bangladesh with little notice and dire consequences for the poorest communities.</p><p> We must ensure that this does not happen again.  We recognise that this is a difficult message to send home because there are significantly increased needs at home, but it is an even more important message now.  For this reason, we must not just highlight to the public, the voters and the media the urgency of the crisis we are facing, but also the positive impact that aid is having.  An important part of that message is the good news story of prevention and how timely and effective interventions can prevent the horrific images of starvation and suffering.</p><p> It was in July 2011 that the world saw the first famine of the 21st century.  Former President Mary Robinson travelled to Somalia with RT&Eacute;, Concern, GOAL and Tr&oacute;caire.  She sat and listened to the stories of affected families of leaving children and older people behind in order to save the rest of the family.  More than 260,000 people lost their lives tragically in what was a slow and underfunded response.  Five years later, humanitarian actors used improved early warning systems, built with the support of Irish Aid, to respond to and avert four large-scale famines in north-east Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.  This was a phenomenal achievement in terms of early warning and early action.  It is important that we remember Ireland's essential role in preventing crises and famines and fighting hunger.  It is not just a policy strategy.  It is in our DNA and has allowed us to have the foresight to provide solidarity to people caught up in crisis.</p><p> We must also remember that Ireland is one of the few donors that provide multi-annual funding in humanitarian crises, a decision that changes and saves lives.  I saw this first hand in the Central African Republic.  It is a country where 2 million people depend on humanitarian aid but there is a shortfall of approximately 60% in humanitarian funding.  Ireland is providing Concern and other Irish agencies in the Central African Republic with a five-year funding timeframe.  Do committee members know how that changes conversations when we go into communities, say that we will be there for the next five years, we have the backing of the Irish people and we do not have to worry about being gone in six months' time because we could not find additional funding, and we can sit down with the communities to discuss how to plan with them to change the situation positively?  It is transformative.  The ministry in the Central African Republic asked us not just to tell the Irish people "Thank you", but to tell the other donors that this mattered.  We are telling them.  We are rightly promoting Ireland's reputation globally.</p><p> Ireland is not the largest donor, but it is one of the most respected for being principled and meeting the highest standards of accountability and effectiveness.  The Irish Aid team's level of demand for accountable and quality programmes has made what each of our agencies is doing stronger.  Its partnership is deep and demanding, but it is focused on where need is greatest and is connected to and informed by the realities on the ground.  There is a uniquely Irish aspect to the relationship.  It means that Concern and other agencies have direct and open access to senior Irish diplomats and trusted and confidential briefings on highly sensitive situations.  I received a phone call out of the blue from H.E. Geraldine Byrne Nason, who was about to go into a sanctions committee.  She wanted to know what the impact of the sanctions would be on humanitarian operations in Somalia and North Korea.  She told me that she was going into the meeting in half an hour, that she wanted the data and that she wanted to say that she had spoken to the relevant people.  That is exactly the kind of relationship that has an impact.  It connects policy level to the ground, bringing authenticity and integrity to every conversation.  This represents real partnership in action.  I commend the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and its commitment to securing peace and addressing conflict as part of its tenure on the Security Council.  I also commend the team behind Irish Aid on the important role they play.</p><p> It is easy to get overwhelmed by the level of global need, but we have learned over the past year or two that human progress is not inevitable.  We have also learned that we are returning to a world we thought we had left behind.  Extreme poverty has increased for the first time in 20 years and famine, something that we believed had been consigned to history, is back.</p><p>However, history does not have to repeat itself.  Ensuring solidarity is essential in that effort.  Ireland's international aid programme is part of that solidarity and global leadership and a commitment to a better world.  I thank the committee for its time and its commitment to this issue.  I ask my colleagues here today to advocate for the necessary cross-Government support for Ireland's overseas aid programme.</p></speech>

I now turn to members of the committee.  I have received apologies for an inability to attend from Deputy Brady and Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  This 9.30 a.m. slot on Wednesday is not one to which we are accustomed but, as I said earlier, we were very keen to accommodate Ms Keatinge and the team during our last week's work of the term.  I know Deputy Stanton has had an interest in these matters for a long time.  I am pleased that he has joined us and I ask him to kick off proceedings.</p></speech>

It strikes me that, as we sit here today, our country is convulsed with a debate as to whether we should allow indoor dining and whether people should be allowed go into restaurants for slap-up feeds.  Now we hear about what is happening in other parts of the world.  The dichotomy between the First World and the Third World is enormous.  We hear about famine, war and conflict and, on top of all of that, climate change.  Climate change has almost taken a back seat as a result of Covid but we know that it is causing real hunger and devastation in many parts of the world.  It is not getting any better.  It is getting worse.</p> <p>  I understand the fundraising efforts of the different organisations in Ireland have been impacted by Covid and by the restrictions on fundraising.  How has that impacted on the organisations?  The need to bring what is happening across the world to the attention of Government, the Oireachtas, the people and the media was mentioned earlier.  It has been said more than once, especially with regard to Covid, that we should be in this together.  All those in underdeveloped countries should get the vaccine.  We need to roll out that vaccine because, if we do not, there is a risk that more and more variants will emerge and that these could eventually travel here and impact on us.  We are linked in that way.  </p> <p>  Having listened to the debate this morning, I detect a sense of hopelessness and devastation about the suffering going on across the world but I also detect a sense of hope that it can be better.  I certainly agree with the Chairman that we need to encourage Government to maintain funding, or to increase it if possible, and to use our position on the Security Council and in Europe to encourage other countries to do the same.  That is very important.  I know the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his team would agree with us in that regard.  We really need to write to Government and the Ministers and to do what we can to encourage our own Government and other governments to step up to the mark.  A small intervention can make a massive difference in some of these countries.  </p> <p>  We have heard the reports from the organisations.  The Chairman and I worked on the refugee crisis during the term of the last D&aacute;il when we were in the Department of Justice and Equality.  We met many people who had been through hell on earth.  We tried to have the greatest impact we could on what was going on and to help people and bring them here.  Unfortunately, we met resistance from some quarters in that regard.  There is a need for an education programme here in Ireland to help people to see what is going on in different parts of the world.  Our media have a very significant role to play in that because it is not reported enough.  What is happening in other parts of the world does, and will, have an impact on us here.  I again call on our media to highlight what is going on and to inform and educate people in Ireland so that they will again step up to the mark.  I understand there is approximately &euro;15 billion saved up in Ireland because people could not spend money.  That is a huge amount.  If a small proportion of this could be made available to the organisations that are here today, it would make a massive impact.</p> <p>  In all of my contribution I believe I only asked one question, which related to the impact Covid has had on the fundraising efforts of the organisations before us today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#E00400"><p>I thank our guests for coming in, for sharing their experiences and for updating us on their programmes across the world.  I absolutely agree with what Ms Keatinge said in her opening statement, which was that this has been no ordinary year.  It has not been an ordinary year for any of us but the support provided to local communities on the ground by groups such as Ms Keatinge's will be pivotal and really important for future generations not only in the immediate term or in five or ten years' time, but as far out as 25 or 30 years from now.  While the full impact of Covid is not yet known, we can see its visible impacts already.  I refer to extreme hunger, extreme poverty, issues of gender equality and access to education, and the impacts of conflict zones on civilians.  This is deeply concerning.  I will say in the strongest of terms that preventing any further loss of the gains that had been made in those areas must be seen as a priority.</p> <p>  I will disagree with my colleague, Deputy Stanton, in that I am of the opinion that, as Covid has drawn some areas more into focus, it has also brought climate change to greater prominence in people's minds because we were being advised to wash our hands while knowing that there are millions of people who do not have access to clean water.  The impact on those living in conflict zones and issues of food insecurity and extreme poverty have been brought much more to the fore.  I believe it was Mr. MacSorley who mentioned the triple threat.  Ireland has a key role to play and a real opportunity to build on the work that has been done to date in preventing crises before extreme hunger becomes famine and before we see images such as those I saw from Ethiopia on the screen when I was a toddler, images that have stayed with me ever since.  While I acknowledge that the Government has committed to achieving that UN target of 0.7% by 2030, a detailed roadmap as to how that is to be achieved will be key in the short term.  What is going to be done and when?  Targets need to be put in place as part of that year-on-year plan.  As a country, Ireland needs to bring those areas of expertise recognised by the OECD to other areas where there is emerging critical need, when that is possible, while also addressing the areas we already know of.</p> <p>  I will go back to the slippage of gains briefly.  It will take a generation to catch up on the slippage we have seen so far, particularly in the area of education.  It is not just a question of the reading, writing and literacy skills, but a question of everything else education represents, particularly in the context of gender equality, societal and economic changes and the opportunities these represent for the young girls who are now falling out of education.  It is time they will never get back.  In many cases, the potential opportunities are lost to them forever.  For others, it will take a significant period of time to rebuild what they have lost in their time out of education.  </p> <p>  I am most happy to hear vaccines mentioned.  This is going to be key, particularly in the poorest of countries.  We have seen variants arise quite regularly over the past year and a half.  We have also seen lockdowns come and go.  Until we get to a point at which a critical mass of people are vaccinated, that is not going to stop.  That puts us all at risk.  It has been said before, and I will say it again, that until we are all safe, none of us is safe.  We are a global community.</p><p>That is the world in 2021.  International travel is as easy as jumping onto a train or a bus would have been ten or 15 years ago.  The further impacts of those and the lack of vaccinations in developing and poorer countries will impact everybody.</p><p> Chairman, I agree with what you said about Covid-19 and the budget.  Cutting overseas aid at this time would be a retrograde step.  Things can get better, but things getting better does not happen by chance.  They happen through funding and planning, and through groups such as the groups here working with communities on the ground to empower them and give them the capability and resources to do for themselves as much as what we can do for them.  Notwithstanding the cuts that other countries may make, if funding from Ireland is not increased and remains the same, looking at it through the prism of Covid-19, what will be the impact on the work the organisations can do on the ground?  Will it be primarily focusing on the bedding down of programmes and regaining the gains lost through Covid-19?  Will there be any capability to extend the work they do?  What plans and programmes do the organisations have that cannot be implemented until the UN target of 0.7% is reached?  Outside of financial aid, what other areas of positive change could make a further impact on the relationships Mr. MacSorley discussed?  Are there other areas which could be improved that we should be looking at also as a priority?</p></speech>

They have set out a compelling and heart-rending case across all the areas, and I appreciate that.  I wish to comment rather than ask many questions.  It behoves all members of the committee to state publicly where we and the committee stand on all this.  I endorse your opening remarks, Chairman, which were supported by my two colleagues who contributed, on whether this year there should be a net increase in our contribution to overseas aid.  We should have a net increase this year.  Populist or wrong arguments could be made the other way in the context of the demands that Covid-19 places nationally, but there is an onus on us to do the opposite.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanton created a vivid picture when he said we are animatedly debating the reopening of restaurants at a time when so many in the world are starving, as was pointed out today.  The three contributing factors are the conflict, climate change and Covid-19.  The confluence and combination of those factors make it incumbent on us to support a net increase in the budget to support the organisations with us this morning, individually and under the umbrella of D&oacute;chas, in the work they are doing and to applaud that work.  It is important that the latter point made about transparency in the operations and accountability are all in place.  That is critical.  The witnesses make the case well around the world.  I do not have questions, just a supporting comment.  I will certainly be strongly supportive at any forum available to me of the committee's view stated by you, Chairman, that there should be a net increase in our budget this year.  It is the signal, but it is the way we will reach the 0.7%.  It is also very much the Irish signal that is required this year.  It is where we will show our calibre and quality.  The onus is on us to do it because of Covid-19 rather than in spite of it, as it were.</p></speech>

I will be very brief because I have a commitment outside Leinster House in a few minutes, so I will have to move quickly.  I thank our guests for attending.  They are always very welcome to appear before the committee.  I thank them for their submission which, as Senator Joe O'Reilly said, is compelling and heart-rending.  I echo Deputy Clarke's words that we must develop a roadmap to the 0.7% by 2030.  I will take this opportunity to state my party's position of support for that target for the multi-annual funding.  Irish people are very proud of the work these organisations do.  We probably are the best in the world at delivering meaningful aid to developing countries.  I believe supporting these organisations can be the most effective way of alleviating poverty, spending money and getting the best outcome for our investment.  Certainly, we and our party in the Government will do everything we can do to support the organisations and their requests and, indeed, to develop that roadmap through to 2030.</p> <p>  My apologies, but I must leave now.  Thank you, Chairman, for this opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#F00500"><p>I heard most of the presentations on the way in but, sadly, Mr. MacSorley filtered out shortly after he started.  I am sorry I did not hear all of his presentation.  The case the organisations make is very strong.  I will support it 100%, although I am a tiny cog in this very large wheel of Leinster House.  Particularly as we emerge from Covid-19, more aid must be put into the areas in which the organisations work.  It has always been a hobby-horse of mine that we can see the most deprived parts of the world where millions of dollars are spent on arms and ammunition, but we cannot feed the people in these areas.  It is an outright scandal.  Ireland should not step away from its commitments and, as most of my colleagues have said, it should increase its commitment to the areas in which the organisations work simply because ours is a wealthy country, regardless of whether we like it.  Over the next couple of years there will be a tightening of budgets as we emerge from the pandemic to try to get our economy back, but we must support those who cannot support themselves.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  I apologise to Mr. MacSorley, and I will read what he said.  However, I heard the contributions from Ms Keatinge and Ms de Barre and they make a compelling case.  I promise I will do anything I can within my office.  I am sorry I had to drop out for a short time, but I am back now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#F00600"><p>Thank you for your attendance, Senator.  I will refer to Ms Keatinge now.  There were a number of questions from members which I ask Ms Keatinge to distribute among our guests as appropriate.</p> <p>  I will briefly add to the questions that were asked by members.  Reference was made to Ireland's leadership role on the sustainable development goals.  Earlier this year, shortly after Christmas, we received a quite stark presentation on the manner in which the sustainable development goals and targets have, perhaps, run the risk of falling off the rails.  As it is July, six months later, Ms Keatinge might have an update on that.  I welcome Ms Soma from South Sudan and acknowledge the very bleak nature of her presentation.</p><p>I want to ask her about the movement of people and migration, which is a major challenge in South Sudan and in neighbouring areas.  What more can a country such as Ireland do in that regard?  It seems that the uninhibited movement of people from South Sudan and the neighbourhood, right up through north Africa to the coast, is continuing, while not at the scale that it was at over recent years.  How best might we assist the displaced people?</p><p> I will hand back to Ms Keatinge to answer the questions as appropriate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Keatinge" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#G00200"><p>I will ask my colleagues to help answer as many questions as possible and if there are more, we can come back to the committee.  Rest assured we are all here, including Mr. MacSorley, so we will be able to catch up on what we have said afterwards.</p> <p>  I will turn to Ms Soma in South Sudan first.  That is the most important testimony.  It will bring the lived experience for the committee and I will ask her to answer the question on what the likely impact on the ground is if aid is not increased.  I will then ask Mr. MacSorley to come in and after that I will ask Ms de Barra to talk about fundraising and vaccines.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gloria Soma" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#G00300"><p>I will talk about the issue of funding.  Donors love bringing it up because I am part of that testimony myself.  I know the impact of aid has been able to be bring me to be who I am today.  In the case of South Sudan, we all know that for a long time we have been aid dependent and the majority of people in my generation and those who have come after my generation are still dependent on issues related to aid.  It is what we know and what we have depended on for a long time.  Funding gives local communities, including both women and children, the hope to be able to continue to live sustainably and to live a dignified lifestyle in the country, given the fact that the leadership in the country cannot even provide basic services to their people.  It is critical at this moment and it has always been critical that, unfortunately, aid has been the backbone of survival for the majority of the population in the country.</p> <p>  On the issue of movement and migration that the Chairman raised, we have consistently seen that for a long time people's movements into different regions around east Africa have not been the will of the people but have happened because of the conflict that has been generated by the different warring parties in the country.  As such, people move to neighbouring countries for safety and to get a better lifestyle.  I mention, for example, Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia, where the majority of South Sudanese have been going.  When we come down to the realities, it is not that South Sudanese communities want to move into the different regions; it is because of the context we are in and the atrocities that are being committed against communities.  We saw in 2016 that in a village in Central Equatoria, in the greater Yei region, people were killed along tribal lines.  There was all this genocide coming through from 2016 to 2018.  Those are some of the challenges that local communities and South Sudanese in general have been facing.  A slight support from the international community would go a long way to ensuring that these communities can live and lead better lifestyles and hope for a brighter future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dominic MacSorley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#G00400"><p>I will take members back to the Central African Republic.  When I was there I asked the head of United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNOCHA, how it managed a 63% shortfall in its budget.  I appreciate that I am talking to people who manage budgets all the time.  He said to cut pretty much everything, which is costly, and in that case it brought down the food rations by half.  He said that they had become firefighters, they only went for the most acute cases and they had to leave the moderate cases today, which, in turn, become the most acute cases tomorrow.  That goes back to the message of prevention.</p> <p>  The second point is that traditionally, when different appeals are considered, what tends to be funded are food, shelter and water.  What does not get funded are protection, gender-based violence, GBV, and education.  This is where Ireland comes in.  I mention the example of kids in Syria getting the schooling they had missed out on for four or five years.  Ireland is supporting 6,000 such kids with a view that when they go back there will be a generation that has not completely lost out and that will have the capability to go back.  The Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office, FCDO, is a brutal reminder of how cuts should never happen.  The hardest conversations are when talking to partners in communities about cuts in funding, having built up a level of trust and confidence and having asked them to go on this journey together.  Nobody understands why.  That is the toughest thing about dealing with cuts.</p> <p>  We are not in that position.  We have learned a lot from the 2008 crisis, as agencies, around efficiencies.  We have learned about the importance of cash and how to spend money more astutely.  Ms de Barra will talk about fundraising but the relationship with the Irish public has been phenomenal.  Ballybofey is one example of a fundraising team that has been going for 20 years.  When they could not go out and do their Christmas bazaar, they did all the online activities that everyone has been doing such as jumping, skipping and God knows what.  The people of Ireland have stayed and they are a key part of this package.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caoimhe de Barra" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#G00500"><p>I will address the questions on fundraising, vaccines and priorities.  On fundraising, to follow on from what Mr. MacSorley said, what we have witnessed to our surprise, at least initially, has been an outpouring of support and solidarity from the Irish public.  Across the country, people have recognised that while the Covid pandemic is having a devastating impact on us in Ireland, personally and in our everyday lives, it is far more acute overseas.  As several members said, it is ultimately far more damaging in the long term for people living in communities in fragile states, particularly in conflict-affected states.  The generosity of the public at a time like this has been phenomenal.</p> <p>  Our fundraising has changed but it has remained strong.  This sends an important signal that the public are fully behind overseas development work.  They have demonstrated their solidarity in a practical way over the past year by donating directly to organisations such as Tr&oacute;caire, Concern and others.  We know from the research that D&oacute;chas has done that 77% of the public say that development assistance is important.  This is an example of a case where perhaps the public are ahead of the political decision-making.  The public are backing the kind of work we do and understand that Covid's impact and the impacts of climate change are far more significant overseas, even while we have to support those who are vulnerable at home.</p> <p>  That is important and I would underline what several members said, which is that there is a need for a roadmap that will get us to 0.7% of GDP by 2030.  Within the lifetime of this Government, we need to see a commitment to an interim target, which is solid and which will ensure that we are taking a stepwise approach year-on-year with meaningful incremental increases and that do not suddenly push the burden of increasing aid to later in the day when another Government might be in place.</p><p>In D&oacute;chas, we believe that there needs to be a commitment to 0.5% by 2025 and that every budget should have an incremental step that builds gradually and sustainably towards that point.</p><p> Everybody appreciates how shocking the vaccine inequity is.  It is palpable, tangible and deplorable.  It impacts on our staff and the communities that we are working with.  People are dying needlessly of Covid.  While here in Ireland, there is a successful and welcome roll-out of the vaccine, can any of us live with the fact that across the world, over 50% of the global population has received one vaccine but in low income countries, only 1% of the population has received a vaccine?  In Ireland, we are up to 70%, which is welcome, but 1% of the population of low-income countries are currently vaccinated.  I underscore the point that Ms Soma makes, which is it that it is not just about access to the vaccines right now, although that is critically important.  The TRIPS waiver is a priority.  If there is a temporary waiver through the World Trade Organization TRIPS mechanism, there is capacity to scale up the production of vaccines.  That is known and documented.  We believe that Ireland should take a strong position at the WTO, aligned with many other countries that see the need, the moral imperative and the logic, for our own sake, of scaling up vaccine production worldwide.</p><p> Health systems need to be strengthened, which is a long-term investment that speaks to the need for 0.7% and the multi-annual approach.  If Ireland is able to commit to a stepwise approach to funding over the next five or ten years and to working with partner countries and agencies such as us and the United Nations, we can build stronger health systems that will be more resilient to future health crises.  The reality is that crises will continue to happen.  Covid is the latest and the most visible.  In the countries that we and Ms Soma work in, health systems are under severe strain at the best of times.  They need a long-term investment which can only happen through a long-term commitment to aid.</p><p> On the question about other priorities beyond increasing overseas development assistance, climate is one.  Everybody's intervention today has referred to climate and the importance of addressing climate justice, climate inequality and the impacts of climate.  Ms Keatinge said that one of her requests is that there should be dedicated additional targeted funding for climate financing.  That is an important message to come from this committee if possible.  That would demonstrate that we are adherent in our approach as a country and that in going into the negotiations, Ireland is demonstrating its commitment through its aid budget and through the legislation which I hope will be passed and meet the high standards, with the latest amendments improving it, and that Ireland is prepared to face the reality that there will be significant changes in everything we do.  We will embrace those changes because we recognise our global responsibility regarding climate.</p><p> The global economy is another priority and what form its recovery takes.  The global economy is crucial to recovery and the livelihoods of millions of people who are part of supply chains in developing countries.  There is a significant risk now that those supply chains will become more dangerous places for people to work and for the communities affected by them over the coming years, because of the impact of Covid and because people and governments are more vulnerable.  Governments are less likely to be able to stand up to take a strong stance on the standards of implementation that need to be in place.  This Government needs to look at human rights in business and to welcome, embrace and even get ahead of the legislation movement coming from Europe about mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence.  That would demonstrate policy coherence for development across the board in Ireland.</p><p> We mentioned the UN Security Council and Ireland's seat on it a number of times in this meeting.  It is extremely important.  For the next 18 months, we continue to have an opportunity to be courageous, principled and effective at the UN Security Council.  Ireland has already stepped up to the mark in a number of difficult situations.  The importance of Ireland's success, together with Norway and others, with the Syria cross-border resolutions, cannot be overstated.  Ireland needs to continue, with the full support of the entire Government, to dedicate every resource possible to its work at the UN Security Council to prevent and resolve conflict for all the reasons that we heard earlier.  It needs to focus in particular on the protection of women, girls and other people who are vulnerable to gender-based violence in conflict.</p><p> Ireland can be a strong voice for climate security at the UN Security Council, potentially including during its presidency.  It is contingent on passing the strongest possible version of the climate legislation that is currently before the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Keatinge" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#H00200"><p>In response to Deputy Stanton's question about the media, I agree that we need to see more media coverage of what is happening outside Ireland.  I know that our members are concerned, especially since the end of last year.  The committee has heard from my colleagues that the Irish public want to hear more.  They support overseas development assistance, ODA.  Our survey said that 79% believe that ODA is effective in bringing about positive change.  It is a challenge for us all to get more stories and coverage in the media.  They should bring hope and positivity rather than always being too overwhelming.</p> <p>  The sustainable development goals, SDGs, are probably close to the Chair's heart, since he signed them in 2015.  I agree that there is a sense that they are falling off the rails.  When talking to our members, there is a sense that if ever something like the SDG framework was needed, it is now.  I will admit that we probably did not know the word "Covid" in 2015 but the beauty of the SDG framework is that it shows the links between things like climate, conflict and now Covid.  That relationship is important.  The SDGs demand partnership and collaboration to solve these complex problems.  Within our community and Coalition 2030, we will continue to challenge the Government to do more.  The year 2030 is not that far away.  This framework is needed now more than ever.  Remember that even when it was being signed in 2015, there was a concern about the funding gap.  That has not gone away.  That is why our conversation on ODA is so important and relevant to the roadmap.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair.  I hope we have answered most of the questions.  If there are any more, we would be happy to answer them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#H00300"><p>I thank Ms Keatinge and her colleagues.  We now move towards next steps.  I thank members for their proposals.  I acknowledge the proposal from Deputy Stanton that we would write to the Government.  I take it that it is agreed.  Ms Keatinge mentioned that we could write to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, who is not our line Minister, but I acknowledge what Ms Keatinge has said and his pivotal role in the Government.  I think that we should write to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  What should we say?  I acknowledge what Senator O'Reilly said about a net increase, especially in times of Covid.  I acknowledge what Deputy Clarke said about advising against any form of reduction or cut.  I acknowledge what Deputy Clarke said about having a more consistent, certain or definite roadmap or pathway towards the 0.7% GNI each year.  I acknowledge what the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said to us in that regard last year.  Nevertheless, I think that Deputy Clarke makes an important point, which should be included in our letter.  I acknowledge the proposal from Deputy Leddin about multi-annual funding.  We raised this with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and Minister of State, Deputy Brophy.  It is an important point in the context of the presentation and what Ms Keatinge and colleagues said.  We should revisit this issue and strongly state that our committee believes that this is an important way forward.</p><p>I advise members and guests that we will have an opportunity to engage with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, or the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, or both prior to the budget.  Again, all the commentary this morning, including the presentations in writing and otherwise, will certainly feed into that process.  It is likely the budget will be announced in mid-October but at the end of August and during the course of September we should have the opportunity to engage directly with the Ministers.  If that does not happen, we will engage indirectly and segue into the submissions that came in the context of our meetings.  I acknowledge the support of Senator Craughwell.  If members are happy to draft a letter along those lines, we will do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#J00200"><p>The Chairman refers to the multi-annual funding raised by Deputy Leddin.  We should look for a roadmap to bring us to the 0.7% that we are talking about, which could be reviewed on an annual basis to see how close we are getting to the desired figure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#J00300"><p>Yes.  That point has been made and we will take it on board.  If we are agreed on that I will move to Ms Keatinge's proposals that the Government might engage in prior to the budget.  I ask for an endorsement of these proposals from committee members.  The first is an increase in Ireland's official development aid assistance to ensure we keep pace with global needs now and in the post-Covid environment.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The next is that we ensure additional and targeted financing for climate change mitigation and adaptation to support least-developed countries and small island development states.  That is along the lines of what Deputy Leddin was saying.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Leddin is Cathaoirleach of the climate change committee in the Houses.</p> <p>  The third proposal is to use Ireland's voice at the UN Security Council and EU levels, as well as in other international fora, to champion human rights defenders on the role being played by civil society.  This is a matter we took up with the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, and it will certainly form part of further discussions with both the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy.  Is that proposal agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The fourth proposal is to advocate to ensure that the global community produces enough vaccine doses for everyone everywhere.  This is in line with our earlier report, which we forwarded to the Government following our work earlier in the year on COVAX and universal vaccination.  It is important that we again urge the Government to show leadership in this sphere.  The fifth proposal is to strengthen Ireland's global leadership on zero hunger.  This again feeds into our influential role in international bodies and the United Nations in particular.  Is there agreement that we will include these proposals in our letter to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and to be copied to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Brophy?  This is the proposed stance of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence prior to the budget.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I thank members for that.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Keatinge for a closing comment, having agreed that we will take this stance.  On behalf of committee members, I acknowledge the great work of all the agencies, including non-governmental organisations.  There are almost 60 full and associate members of the association of NGOs advancing the cause of what the Irish people support, as Ms de Barra has said.  It is important to emphasise, in speaking about budgets and priorities, that 77% of the Irish people are giving the Government a mandate to commit to international development assistance.  That is important, in the context of our priorities and going back to what Deputy Stanton quite rightly referred to as the national obsession with pubs and pubs opening.  I acknowledge Irish Aid and Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca's team of field officers and officials, which works closely with D&oacute;chas for and on behalf of the Irish people and its Government.  As Ms de Barra has said, the NGO community is working in the most challenging parts of the world in very difficult circumstances for its members, as well as for the people they serve.  I acknowledge the importance of this meeting and we will proceed to the next steps.</p></speech>

It means much to many of the people in the D&oacute;chas network working here in Ireland and, most important, overseas.  I am sure Ms Soma is listening today and can take home that message of hope to the people she supports in South Sudan.</p> <p>  This is not just about the tangible actions that the committee is willing to take but also about hearing that it sees the importance and value in long-term aid.  Mr. MacSorley spoke about prevention and Ms de Barra argued that aid is about transformation, which takes time.  That is where the multi-annual and long-term planning comes in.  We must make progress with incremental increases each year to reach that all-important target of 0.7% of GNI by 2030.</p> <p>  I also thank my colleagues here today who are members of D&oacute;chas.  They are Ms de Barra, Mr. MacSorley from Concern and Ms Soma.  I also note the many members of D&oacute;chas listening to this and who amplify our voices.  This is a collaborative effort and it is about working together.  It is only if we can do this that we can show global solidarity and bring the hope that is so desperately needed.</p> <p>  I again thank the committee and the Chairman for his leadership.  They should know that we are around if there are further questions.  We will certainly follow up with the committee after this meeting.  I hope members get to enjoy some of the summer holidays.</p></speech>

Unless members have any final commentary, I will bring matters to a close by thanking the guests for the presentation.  I will be forgiven for singling out Ms Soma for joining us from the front line in South Sudan, which is, as she mentions, the world's youngest country.  It faces enormous challenges and yet we know that Ms Soma had the sense to finish her stark and bleak presentation on a note of high optimism and good news on the matter of the impact of international funding.  That exemplifies the spirit in the face of extreme adversity.  We thank Ms Soma and acknowledge her work.  We wish her and her team in the Titi Foundation well in facing its challenges.  We acknowledge the leadership and management of Ms de Barra, Mr. MacSorley and Ms Keatinge in Ireland and across the world in these difficult times.</p> <p>  There is no doubt we will have the opportunity to re-engage in the autumn.  In the meantime, we assure the witnesses of our positive and constructive activity between now and budget day in mid-October.  We thank the witnesses for furnishing us with their very important pre-budget submission.</p></speech>

I am pleased to bring before the committee two draft Government agreements giving force of law in Ireland to a new double taxation agreement with Kosovo and separately, a new protocol to the existing double taxation agreement with Germany.</p> <p>  The new double taxation agreement with Kosovo was signed by ambassador O&rsquo;Neill on behalf of Ireland and the acting head of mission, Ms Arrita Gjakova, on behalf of Kosovo on 25 June 2021 in London.  The protocol to the double taxation agreement with Germany was signed on 19 January 2021 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the German ambassador to Ireland, Ms Deike Potzel.</p> <p>  As the committee will recall, arising from the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, Ireland ratified the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting in 2018.  The convention was discussed at this committee and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and was included in the Finance Act 2018.</p> <p>  The BEPS multilateral convention came into force for Ireland in 2019 and updates the majority of Ireland&rsquo;s existing double taxation agreements to make them BEPS compliant.  As was previously indicated to the committee, however, our existing double taxation agreement with Germany was not updated by the multilateral convention but will instead be updated bilaterally to reflect BEPS changes.  This is what the German agreement before the committee seeks to do.</p><p>It is another important step in the implementation of the BEPS process and one which Ireland takes seriously in both signing and ratifying the multilateral convention.</p><p> Ireland has written to those partner jurisdictions that have not yet signed the convention to discuss options for implementing the BEPS recommendations.  We are committed to ensuring that all our double taxation agreements meet the minimum standards agreed in the BEPS process.</p><p> A common feature of both the new agreement with Kosovo and the protocol with Germany is the incorporation of strong tools for tackling tax treaty abuse and anti-avoidance measures.  Both contain the minimum standards committed to during the BEPS project, as well as several measures which are recommended best practices under BEPS, as agreed bilaterally.</p><p> Ireland first signed a double taxation agreement with Germany in Dublin in November 1962.  That treaty was replaced in 2011 and there has been one protocol to the new treaty in place since 2014.  In May 2017, the German Federal Ministry of Finance asked the Office of the Revenue Commissioners if the 2011 agreement between Ireland and Germany could be updated by protocol, instead of using the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS.  Ireland agreed to the request and negotiations successfully concluded in February 2020.  That protocol was signed in January of this year and is before the committee today.</p><p> The new double taxation agreement with Kosovo is comprehensive in scope and while it generally follows the OECD model convention, it also includes some provisions that feature in the UN model convention.  The agreement contains provisions to deal with BEPS and to make the new double tax agreements fully compliant with the minimum standards under the BEPS project.  As well as the minimum standards, the double taxation agreement contains several measures which are recommended best practices under the BEPS project, as agreed between Ireland and Kosovo.</p><p> The treaty with Kosovo will enhance economic relations and co-operation in tax matters between both countries.  Following an approach from Kosovo in 2017, the negotiations were successfully completed.  The treaty is designed to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation.  The reduced rates of withholding tax on certain dividends, interest and royalties and the safeguards against discriminatory taxation in the agreement will support existing trade and facilitate further trade and investment between both states.</p><p> Our network of double taxation agreements is an important aspect of our competitiveness in attracting investment and facilitating Irish business in operating internationally.  In addition, double tax agreements are a cornerstone of Ireland's trade policy and are a key element in stimulating trade and investment flows between countries.  They provide greater certainty and fairness for taxpayers regarding their tax obligations in foreign jurisdictions and they are key to the prevention of double taxation.</p><p> The benefits of double taxation agreements are well known but concerns have been expressed that treaties may inadvertently facilitate aggressive tax planning.  This concern was central to the BEPS project and to the BEPS multilateral convention.  Updating our existing double taxation agreements, whether via the multilateral convention or bilaterally, helps to ensure they cannot be used for aggressive tax planning arrangements.</p><p> Ireland has been a strong supporter of the BEPS process since its inception and continues to engage positively at both EU and OECD level in addressing the tax challenges that arise from the digitalisation and globalisation of the economy.  Proactively updating our double taxation agreements is a key example of that support.</p><p> As indicated in the update to our corporation tax roadmap that I published in January, it is my intention to publish a treaty policy statement at the end of this year or early in 2022.  The proposals under discussion at the OECD have implications for the global network of tax treaties and it is important that any potential treaty outcomes agreed in that forum are reflected in the treaty policy statement.  The rationale for this statement is to take stock of our existing network and formalise our treaty policy.  As a small open economy, a robust treaty network is necessary to facilitate international trade.</p><p> We have come from a period of expansion of the network to the point where we have treaties with the vast majority of our international trading partners.  It is my intention that the policy statement will have a particular emphasis on tax treaties with developing countries, having regard to Ireland&rsquo;s development commitments.  We have an excellent reputation for our positive policies towards developing countries through Irish Aid and I want to ensure that our treaty policy is fully consistent with our development policy.  This is also in line with the Government commitment to domestic resource mobilisation policy the aim of which is to strengthen developing countries&rsquo; tax administrative capacity.</p><p> To inform the treaty policy statement, I launched a public consultation in April this year that ran until May and received 15 submissions, all of which are available on our website.  My officials have also held a series of stakeholder engagements to discuss the content of the submissions in detail and this will inform our future treaty policy.</p><p> If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the making of these orders by Government, I will include the orders in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by way of an amendment in the upcoming finance Bill.  This will enable Ireland to complete the necessary notifications to finalise the ratifications of both agreements.</p><p> I commend these draft orders to the committee.  I am happy to take questions on them.  I am also aware that the members of the committee have expressed a desire to discuss the ongoing work on the international tax framework at the OECD and I am also open to discussing that matter with the committee.</p></speech>

In the orders for the double taxation agreements before us, in some cases we are replacing existing tax agreements with new agreements such as with the Netherlands, whereas in the case of Germany we are adding a protocol to the existing agreement.  Why is that the case?  The Minister told us that in 2017 Germany requested that the 2011 agreement be updated by way of protocol.  Why was that request made?  Why is that the preference in this case?</p> <p>  The Minister also said the Government had written to some other jurisdictions that have not yet signed up to the BEPS multilateral convention to discuss options for implementing the BEPS recommendations.  Which jurisdictions are they?  </p> <p>  The Minister said the agreement and protocol before us today both contain minimum standards.  Does he not believe that we should not just advocate for a minimalist approach but for something that is more enhanced?  I ask him to elaborate on the other measures which he described as recommended best practices under BEPS.</p></speech>

While they are doing that, I will deal with the Deputy's first question as to why we are dealing with our colleagues in Germany through a protocol.  As he will be aware, most of our double tax agreements will be modified using a multilateral convention to implement tax treaty-related measures to prevent BEPS, which entered into force with respect to Ireland on 1 May 2019.  However, in some cases a treaty must be updated bilaterally by protocol.  This is generally where our treaty's partner's domestic law prevents it from implementing the BEPS changes through a multilateral instrument.  This is the case for Germany.  This is being done via a protocol as opposed to the broader multilateral instrument that we use elsewhere because of the compatibility of this issue with German domestic law.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if I believed we should be adopting standards that are ahead of what is recommended in the OECD BEPS process.  I would generally be cautious about that because my appreciation of these matters is that their force derives from the consistent implementation of the same standards elsewhere and in Ireland.  If we were to develop or implement standards that are not consistent with the BEPS process, it might lead to issues of inconsistency with other jurisdictions.</p><p>The countries with which we have not signed a multilateral instrument and which we have contacted are Belarus, Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Moldova, Montenegro, Thailand, the United States of America, Uzbekistan, Vietnam and Zambia.  We have written to all of these countries with regard to this process.  We have received an indication from some of them that they are willing to go ahead with a multilateral instrument.  For example, Thailand has given this commitment.  This is the status of the communication at present.</p></speech>

The agreement with Kosovo that is before us will reduce the tax rates on withholding tax on dividends, interest and royalties.  I have serious concerns about our tax architecture.  Will the Minister outline to the committee the changes that will take place in this regard on foot of the agreement?</p></speech>

The change we are making with regard to the taxation of dividends refers to the minimum holding period.  The change we are making is in line with the recommended best practice of the OECD in this area.  If the Deputy would like a bit more information on it, I can invite Revenue to fill out the answer a bit more.</p></speech>

None of these commitments have been relayed to us in the Parliament or in the finance committee.  Will the Minister now take the opportunity to explain what are the commitments he gave to the European Commission?</p></speech>

It refers to a number of areas.  These include applying enhanced control foreign company rules to the list of non-co-operative jurisdictions, with effect from 1 January 2021.  I am aiming to do this in the Finance Act 2020.  I also committed to publishing external independent economic research on the impact of recent legislative changes domestically and internationally on outbound payments for Ireland.  This has already been made available publicly.  This was done on 14 June.  I also committed to carrying out a public consultation on the introduction of measures to ensure outbound payments do not avail of a double non-taxation.  The public consultation on this and the responses received will all be made available on the website of the Department of Finance.  I also committed to introducing legislation to safeguard against the possibility of double non-taxation of outbound payments by the Finance Act 2023 at the latest.  These are all different areas of policy action that were part of the broad pathway of change I indicated in the second edition of our corporate tax roadmap.</p></speech>

The Minister has outlined to the committee, in response to questions I put to him, his determination to secure Ireland's interest and the 12.5% tax rate.  He committed to not having this rate increase in the foreseeable future.  Looking from this position, the Minister is spectacularly failing on these negotiations with regard to defending Ireland's interest.  A situation emerged on 9 July whereby 132 of the 139 member jurisdictions of the OECD signed up to the pillar 2 solution to address the tax challenge arising from the digitalisation of the economy.  Seven member states are holding out, including Kenya and Nigeria because, we understand, it does not go far enough.  Meanwhile, Sri Lanka, Barbados, Estonia, Hungary and we are in the situation of holding out because it has gone too far with a minimum effective tax rate of at least 15%.</p> <p>  I have outlined on the floor of the D&aacute;il where Sinn F&eacute;in stands on this matter.  We need to defend our national interest.  What is the roadmap ahead for the Minister for Finance in these negotiations given the level of support for pillar 2?  Does the Minister still believe our corporate tax rate for the applicable companies, which have a turnover of three quarters of a billion euro per annum, will not have to increase?  What is his strategy?  This is what we are trying to figure out.  What is the Minister's strategy as the international community is pushing ahead with pillar 2?  Yesterday, the US Secretary of the Treasury, Ms Yellen, commented that the hold-out countries are not needed, that the other counties can proceed without us and that the companies will pay the higher level of tax anyway.  Will the Minister outline his strategy to the committee and reassure us we are not spectacularly failing, as it appears the Minister is at this time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021071400002#C00900"><p>I am not sure how Deputy Doherty can derive the analysis of spectacularly failing in any way given that other finance ministers will make a decision regarding what is in the interests of their people and economies.  That has what has happened with more than 130 countries.  I can engage with them.  If we are going to recognise that I have a prerogative here I also have to recognise that other finance ministers do also.  I am making the case for our rate.  I am making the case for the ability and role of small and medium-sized economies to be able to use a low rate as part of their competitive tax model.  What I will do in the coming period is to continue to engage with the OECD.  I will engage with a group of countries, including obviously our friends and partners in the United States of America.  I will better understand what their own intent is as we approach October.  We will continue to indicate that Ireland wants to be in the negotiations and in the process.  For us to be part of a final agreement we have to have more certainty and more predictability about what that agreement will be than we do at present.  This is the objective I am pursuing.  I believed it was appropriate, with the level of certainty available to me approximately a week ago, that Ireland indicated we want to be part of this process and continue to be part of it but we could not for now be part of the consensus.</p></speech>

The reason I say it appears the Minister is failing is because this comes down to the level of countries and where they want to see it.  There are big influencers, as the Minister mentioned, such as the United States.  With 132 out of the 139 signing up to pillar 2, it appears the odds are very much against this country and against the Minister in succeeding to convince enough member states the 12.5% rate would be the appropriate effective tax rate that should be introduced in pillar 2.</p> <p>  We know the rate is one thing.  We also know there is potential for carve-outs under pillar 2.  The Minister has decided to maintain a hold-out position.  Is the Minister concerned at all about the reputational damage this has caused?  I made the point previously that the facilitation of some of the practices that went on in our tax code in the past and how our code interacted with others has reputationally damaged us.  I do think this is helpful in the context of these negotiations.  There is potential to provide for carve-outs.  Is this what the Minister will look at?  Does he envisage a situation in October whereby Ireland would still be outside the final agreement?  When the negotiations are finished, does he envisage a situation whereby we could be one of a small number of countries that would be outside the agreement?  As the US Secretary of the Treasury, Ms Yellen, said, the 15% corporate tax rate would apply.  The Minister for Finance, if he is still in position at the time, may not increase the rate but it would apply anyway because of what is contained in pillar 2.</p><p>It would just be the case that we would not benefit.  Does the Minister envisage a situation where we would still be holding out or does he believe that, having negotiated hard and put Ireland's interests forward, which he definitely should do, we will be part of this process in the end?</p></speech>

If the Deputy is still where he is now at that point, he will be able to form a view on it as well when we get to October.  Of course I am aware of the commentary about Ireland, as I have been for a number of years.  I have always made the case that we have made far more positive and proactive change to our corporate tax code than we have got credit or recognition for.  The final assessment of the reputational impact of the BEPS process will be on individual countries, not just who is in the agreement in October but, more particularly, who will be involved in actually implementing that agreement, what is the speed of that implementation and where countries stand with regard to it.</p> <p>  In terms of the different issues that are at play, I make the point respectfully to the committee that this is a negotiation we are involved in.  I want to accept the good faith of others who are involved in it and, because of the sensitivity of the issues that are involved, not speculate too much on what outcomes could be.  Having said that, I can still acknowledge that amidst the different issues that we need to have greater certainty on, such as what the base and the rate would be, the Deputy is right to say that there is a language in the current agreement in regard to the scope of carve-outs, but that language is, at the moment, still caveated.  These are really important issues for us to understand.</p> <p>  In terms of where we could be at the end of October, there is a range of possible scenarios, involving lots of different countries, regarding where this process could be.  Where I would like us to be at the end of October is in a positive place and position with regard to what the end point of this could be.  However, we are not there at the moment and I have a lot of work and engagement to do, which I am currently carrying out with a number of countries and with the OECD to see where we could be by October.  As the Deputy is aware, I am about to launch a public consultation in regard to the current BEPS text to draw attention to some of the details of that to stakeholders in our society and economy, including in the political system.  I aim to have that consultation complete by the start of September and to have a synopsis of the views across our country on this sensitive issue.</p></speech>

We expected this year's summer economic statement to be published yesterday.  Another committee of the Oireachtas is to discuss it with the Minister tomorrow morning.  We understand there are squabbles within Government, memorandums have been pulled from Cabinet and party leaders have to convene because they cannot agree on what they have called the priority of Government, namely, funding for housing.  When is the Government going to get its act together on this?  More importantly, when will we in the Opposition and the finance committee see the summer economic statement?  Will it be published today?</p></speech>

That is seen, for example, in the number of homes that are being built directly by local authorities, through the Government, throughout the country.  Given the importance of laying out our budgetary framework, there is a great deal of engagement going on at the moment in regard to it.  I expect that engagement to conclude and I hope to be in a position to publish the summer economic statement very soon.  I am aware of the commitment I have with regard to the budget oversight committee tomorrow and I hope to be in a position to provide clarity on where we stand.  I am working to publish the summer economic statement and I am hopeful it will happen.</p></speech>

Similarly, however, I have to ensure that the same right is afforded to members of Government.  That is an equal imperative for me.  I think the Deputy will understand that I have a duty to brief Government on an economic statement when it is concluded.  As soon as I have done that, the members of the committee will, of course, be briefed.  I will be in front of the committee on at least one more occasion before the budget process begins.  I am aware of the need for Deputies to be briefed and I am equally aware of the need for members of Government to have the same expectation delivered.  I am working to do both at the moment.</p></speech>

On double tax agreements, many people are of the view that if someone is working in two countries, he or she cannot be paying tax in both and that there is a need for an arrangement to be put in place as a result.  In practice down through the years, however, double tax arrangements, in essence, facilitated large corporations in reducing the amount of tax they paid to a particular state, opting to shift profits to the state where tax is paid at a lower rate and saving themselves considerable sums of money in so doing.  I recognise that arrangements have been put in place to try to cut across that, but they have not succeeded 100% or anything like it.  Will the Minister comment on the extent to which large corporations might be able to continue to shift profits and pay tax at the lower rate?  Does he consider this still to be a major problem and is he of the view that the steps that have been taken are in any way mitigating against it?  I ask him to reply to those questions before I move on to the other points.</p></speech>

The measures we have brought forward aim to make progress against some of the issues he raised.  In particular, on the issue of evasion or aggressive tax planning opportunities, there are two aims of the changes we are making that are relevant to his concern.  The first is that double taxation agreements provide for the exchange of information between countries and facilitate Revenue investigations.  That exchange of information is vital in dealing with concerns tax authorities may have in regard to tax evasion.  In this context, double taxation agreements try to create a legal environment in which further progress can be made on the issue to which the Deputy referred.  They also prevent what is deemed to be treaty abuse.  This involves putting in place measures, such as a principal purpose test, to deny treaty benefits where one of the main purposes of a transaction is to obtain those benefits.  I refer to transactions that are put in place with the main aim of trying to utilise some of the benefits that would be available through double taxation agreements.  Overall, there are positive developments that provide further tools for allowing tax authorities to deal with issues of aggressive tax planning and evasion.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned in his reply to Deputy Doherty that Ireland is not alone on this issue and is putting its case alongside other small and medium-sized economies.</p><p>The reports I read indicate eight states currently are strongly opposed to the 15% proposals.  Those states are Estonia, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru, Sri Lanka, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a tax haven, and Barbados, another tax haven.  Would the Minister care to comment on the other small and medium sized economies, including these tax havens, and does he not believe that puts the State in an embarrassing position?</p></speech>

He is right in that I said there were other countries that had a similar view to Ireland on this issue but I did not say there was also a very large group of countries which share that view.  I accept, and it is a matter of public record, that the majority of countries have indicated they will be part of the consensus.  As to what that means for us, as I said in a response to Deputy Doherty, it is important to realise and recognise we are still in a political process that is due to conclude in October.  The best time to evaluate where we stand, who our company might be and what could be the effect on our reputation would be well after that point if an agreement is reached and by the metric of who has implemented the agreement.  It is early in the process to conclude who will be there at the end of it and what countries will be in or out of it.</p></speech>

If, on the other hand, I had indicated last week we would go into this agreement, a whole range of issues and concerns would have been created by that, for which I would be held to account as well.  I must be aware of that in the context of decisions I make.  In assessing where we are currently, it is critical for me to emphasise we are still very much engaged in this process.  It still has some way to run.  We will do our part to try to get a balance between issues that are very much in our national interest while recognising the world is changing around us and changes that could happen in other jurisdictions inside the OECD could yet have a big impact on us.</p></speech>

A comprehensive Zucman study in 2018 stated Ireland was the world&rsquo;s number one tax haven with an effective tax rate of 4%.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s opinion as to what the effective corporation tax rate is in this State?  Zucman stated it is 4%, Deloitte, Matheson and Grant Thornton have all marketed themselves as companies that pay an effective 2.5% tax rate in this State.  We know in 2017 Apple, Google, Facebook and Oracle paid less than 1%.  The galleries would collapse in laughter if the State was to try to keep a straight face while arguing the effective tax rate is 12.5%.  We all know it is less than that.  What does the Minister estimate the effective tax rate currently to be?</p></speech>

I understand the last time they published this information they indicated our effective tax rate is just below the nominal tax rate of 12.5%.  Publications from the Revenue Commissioners have indicated the effective tax rate is somewhere between 10% and 11%.  That is information I base my views on.  The Revenue Commissioners publish this information impartially and fairly.  It is the organisation that should guide our view on what our effective tax rate is.</p></speech>

Many observers would raise an eyebrow at it being claimed our effective tax is between 10% and 11% but in any case I will park that one.</p> <p>  On the issue of the summer economic statement, we are given to understand from press reports this morning that the issue at stake at Cabinet is the question of the public spend on housing.  People are currently experiencing the sharpest housing crisis in the history of the State.  To deal with that we need to start from the base of what are the needs of the people and what is needed to effectively tackle and end the crisis.  I doubt whether Fianna Fail in government would go that far but yet there seems to be a real tension between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il on this issue.  I would like the Minister to comment not on the detail but on the broad issue of the public funding needed to tackle the housing crisis.</p></speech>

There is debate and discussion but there is complete agreement on the need to make a higher level of funding available to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to deal with the many grave difficulties and challenges we have in housing.  That is what I am doing.  I am confident we will agree a summer economic statement, which in turn will lead to a credible and ambitious Housing for All plan.</p></speech>

The requirement is not 35,000 or 38,000 houses but in the region of 70,000 to 75,000 houses in the first year and the second year and then we would need to review the situation.</p><p>This will become more acute as the country recovers from the pandemic, something we all expect and hope for.  The demand will be greater and the need for housing provision will be far more than it has been in the past.</p><p> I am not asking the Minister to give a commitment today but I am asking that it be borne in mind.  My experience and my humble knowledge of the housing situation and the manner in which I have had to deal with it over many years have long since led me to the conclusion that we should not do things over a five-year period or a ten-year period.  If we go that route, the children who are being born now will be adults before we reach a situation where we can say a person will have a house within a reasonable time.  It is all about affordability, availability and supply.  The only way that can be done is by a dramatic upsurge in the delivery of houses by whatever means possible.  Even if we have to appeal to building firms from abroad to do the construction work, we need to do it soon.</p><p> Another point relates to the national summer report and the plan.  In the United Kingdom there are indications of inflation above what was anticipated by the UK Government.  How are we heading in that direction?  How do we see it developing given that we have had to give, correctly, considerable incentives to employers and employees to maintain some semblance of support for the economy?  Some economists have said in the past that where such incentives are given there may be a necessity to control prices as well.  I can see where that is coming from.  How do we deal with that?  Do we ignore it?  Do we introduce any measures to discourage inflation given inflation on housing will be an even greater catastrophe than we have seen before?  They are my two questions.  Do I let the Minister reply or will I go on to the other questions?</p></speech>

Of course we are going to do all we can to try to deliver a significant increase in the building of homes as quickly as we can.  I do not need to tell Deputy Durkan about the step back we have taken in home construction due to the impact of Covid-19.  This is why trying to open construction in Ireland safely is so important and that is what we are trying to do.  In the funding decisions we will make for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage we will try to ensure we have the level of funding in place to allow those involved to build as many homes as quickly as they can and in the greatest number.</p> <p>  That leads on to a point the Deputy made with me.  As much as we want to do this quickly, we have constraints in terms of the size of the construction sector as it rebuilds itself after Covid and in terms of the need to ensure we have sufficient planning permission available to be activated for building.  These are all issues Deputy Durkan is well aware of.  I would respond to the key point he is making by saying we are trying to put in place the funding and commitment to build as much as we can as quickly as we can.</p> <p>  The second issue raised related to inflation and price controls.  Deputy Durkan will be aware of the real legal obstacles in place when it comes to the installation of price controls.  He will know better than I do we operate within the Single Market and within the European Union.  Price controls are legally difficult to do.  Moreover, I am not sure they are always in the best interests of the consumer.</p> <p>  That being said, inflation is undoubtedly an issue we need to monitor closely in Ireland.  The inflation outlook for the Irish economy is moderate, at between 0.7% and 1% for the economy overall.  However, the inflation figures published in America yesterday were in excess of 5%.  This demonstrates to us the pressures under way elsewhere in the global economy.  What can we do to try to mitigate their effect in Ireland?  It is about supply and taking measures to drive efficiency in the economy.  Then it will be about safely opening in a sustainable way so that as higher demand for certain things materialises, fuelled by higher levels of savings within the economy, we have an economy that is operating as normally as possible to provide the goods and services to meet those demands.  These are the avenues through which we will be better able to deliver rather than by imposing price controls within our economy, for the reasons I have touched on.</p></speech>

Mind you, we do not always get the same benefits in terms of various issues as some of our colleagues across the European Union.  That is why I raised the issue in the first place.</p><p>In the 1980s the construction sector had what was called a certificate of reasonable value.  That was dreaded by those in the construction industry on the basis that it was a big hold-up in the construction of houses.  It was not actually as the houses were constructed but it prevented interventions.  For instance, investment funds could not intervene unreasonably and impose an extra cost on the houses being built for consumers and the people.  I would like that to be borne in mind.  No one wanted it but it had an effect.  The fact is it has not been introduced since.  There was no need for it to be introduced as we were able to produce houses to meet the needs of people.</p><p>There is a double taxation agreement affecting Germany and other countries.  Does it affect Ireland's competitive position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>countries within the European Union and outside?</p></speech>

Kosovo has double tax agreements with other countries.  By virtue of our moving into an agreement with Kosovo, we get consistency versus what is happening with other countries that have double tax agreements with Kosovo.  The overall competitiveness benefits are negligible, if any.  We are doing this for other reasons.  Anyway, these double taxation agreements will not diminish our competitiveness in any way and certainly will not diminish the competitiveness of exporters to these economies.</p></speech>

In the context of all issues discussed, can the Minister deduce from what happened that the relative position of Ireland is as near as possible to what it was heretofore given that any disadvantage arising therefrom would have serious consequences for Ireland?  Is it generally acknowledged that Ireland is geographically on the periphery of Europe, even more so following Brexit?  This is a distinct disadvantage as we now know.  Notwithstanding the strong support we received from European colleagues, which we greatly appreciated, we should not allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security or into the belief that we are through that.  We are now going to be judged on a different level and this could have serious consequences for us because we still have to transport goods and services throughout or around the neighbouring state and into the European Union before we come into the area where we are at the centre of activity.  Our hearts might be in Europe but our geographic location places us somewhat at a disadvantage.  The Minister might respond to those two points.</p></speech>

I assure Deputy Durkan that I regularly and forcefully make this particular argument.  However, in the spirit of candour it is also important to acknowledge on the tax architecture across the world and in Europe, there is a lot of momentum behind the agreement the OECD is drafting.  That is evident in the number of countries which have opted in to the consensus.  I strongly make the points about the challenges we face because of size and our location on the geographical edge of Europe in the discussions on this topic.</p></speech>

What has been done on the evaluation of the benefit for us?  Like the Minister, we are all anxious that Ireland is not disadvantaged in any way.  I know one of the people who spearheaded this, Mr. Guigold, an old adversary of mine.  It was not intended to be an advantage to us.  As time goes on, if we protect ourselves properly, which is the Minister's intention, it might be fine but if we cannot do that we may have a disadvantage.  My two questions are on collection methodology and need to ensure universal application.  </p></speech>

It will be an important issue later in the year.  A key issue for all in the OECD process is if an agreement is reached, how will it be enforced and when will it be implemented?  That is deeply important.  If countries will move, they will do so in an expectation that others are doing so at roughly the same time.  All I can do now is acknowledge that the Deputy's question does cut to the heart of where the process is now and is one which requires much further clarification as we approach October.</p> <p>  On the means of collection, I think the Deputy was referring to the importance of tax measures that recognise innovation and research.  That is why an important feature of our tax code is the research and development tax credit.  An important issue in the OECD engagement is the status of those different allowances.  That would affect the Deputy's first question, in that were agreement reached, that would influence how that tax was collected. </p></speech>

The OECD's multilateral instrument, MLI,  was obviously an attempt to provide common minimum standards for all existing and future double tax agreements.  The minimum standards set out in the MLI have been designed to close tax avoidance loopholes.  Article 12 of the MLI relates to defining when a multinational corporation has a taxable presences or a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction.  When Ireland signed the MLI in June 2017, I understand that article 12 was not adopted, thereby missing the opportunity to close this loophole.  Has this been closed since?</p></speech>

The UN, the World Bank, IMF and OECD all recommend the double tax treaties with developing countries should include anti-abuse provisions.  This is to stop aggressive tax avoidance by multinationals through the use of double tax treaty provisions.  What progress has Ireland made on this?  Is such an anti-abuse provision included in the treaty with Kosovo, which the World Bank considers a developing or emerging economy?</p> <p>  I was also going to ask about the summer economic statement.  As I had to pop out of the meeting to participate in Questions on Promised Legislation in the D&aacute;il, I am not sure if that question has already been asked.  The Minister will be before the joint committee to discuss that tomorrow morning.  We will need time to digest all the information to ask the appropriate questions.  Will we get that information soon?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we are engaged in a process of public consultation on this issue.  We have engaged with stakeholders and NGOs, some of which have advanced strong views on this.  We are considering different submissions and I hope we will be in a position to be able to draw conclusions on the consultation and publish them by the start of next year.  In the consultation, we specifically sought the views of the World Bank.  We actively sought its views on this in order that we could understand it a bit more and feed it in to our thinking.  I have a differing view on our standing on this issue but I am not blind to the debate which has developed and I know it is important that we have a policy statement in place that allows us to give a clear narrative and perspective on our position.</p> <p>  Article 12 of the multilateral instrument introduced a new test for when an agent can constitute a permanent establishment.  As it is not a minimum standard under the multilateral instrument, signatories are free to opt out of the recommendation.  We did not adopt this provision but we have committed to keeping the decision under review.  It is open to us to lift our reservation in respect of Article 12 at a later date.  We did not adopt Article 12 as there is significant uncertainty as to how the test would be applied in practice and this is still the case.  Similar to Ireland, many signatories to the multilateral instrument are choosing not to adopt Article 12 due to this uncertainty.  Some of our major trading partners such as the UK did not adopt Article 12 either as adopted by the final position deposited within the OECD.  While we are not in it at present, once there is sufficient clarity as to how the test might be applied, we are open to including it in our tax treaties.</p><p>This could potentially be done bilaterally case by case.</p><p> The summer economic statement was mentioned by earlier speakers.  We are in the final phase of working on it at the moment.  I need to brief Government first and, when that is done, I hope to be in a position to be able to present it and update the Oireachtas committee on it.</p></speech>

These things always takes time to examine properly.  Obviously, we would like to see that as soon as possible.  If the Minister wants to bring it to us first before he brings it to Government, that is no problem either.</p></speech>

I am chairman of the Ireland-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Society.  I am also associated with and vice chairman of the European group in support of Taiwan and our engagement in terms of trade, culture and so forth.</p> <p>  Under Michael Noonan when he was Minister, efforts were made to put in place a taxation agreement.  It was suggested at that time, to get over the politics of it, that the model adopted by the UK would, with some changes, facilitate the arrangement.  Has that made any progress?  Is there any hope that taxation agreement will be put in place sooner rather than later?</p></speech>

We have changed the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by amending sections 8 to 6 of that Act.  This is to allow for agreements to be made with countries with non-governmental entities.  This has paved the way legally for engagements with a view to seeing whether an engagement or a conclusion is possible with Taiwan.  Those discussions are ongoing at the moment.  Engagement is now possible because of the changes to the Taxes Consolidation Act.  That engagement is now happening.  They are, by their nature, confidential.  I am not, therefore, able to tell the Chairman what the outcome of them will be or whether it will be successful.  I can confirm to the Chairman that the engagement is now under way, however.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to discuss what we all agree is a critical and nationally important project for women&rsquo;s healthcare.  It is fair to say that every member of the committee shares the same goal, that is, delivery of the best possible healthcare for women and for babies.  The Government has set out its position in that regard by committing to improving women&rsquo;s healthcare right across the board.  As I have said previously, we need a revolution in women&rsquo;s healthcare.</p><p>This year we are providing a very significant investment in services, and pushing a renewed focus on maternity care with a real focus on the national maternity strategy.  The funding allocated in the budget for this year includes more than &euro;7 million, specifically for the implementation of the national maternity hospital.  It is the single biggest investment in the strategy since its publication in 2016.  To put it into context, the investment allocated for this year is five times greater than previous annual investment.  We are taking this very seriously and we are looking for real progress.</p><p>Improving women&rsquo;s healthcare is a priority for me, for Government and I am sure for the committee as well.  The additional funding allows us to hire more staff.  It facilitates further development of community midwifery and specialist services, which are so important.  Some of the positive initiatives happening across the system right now include: an expansion of the endometriosis centre at Tallaght University Hospital; the expansion of existing and the setting up of new &quot;see and treat&quot; gynaecology clinics; the setting up of two new regional fertility hubs; funding to hire 24 additional lactation consultants; and funding for a GP clinical lead for women&rsquo;s health.</p><p>It is, unfortunately, an inescapable fact that many of our maternity hospitals are housed in antiquated buildings that are no longer fit for purpose.  This is unfair on women, babies and on our phenomenal and very hardworking staff.  I worry sometimes that these facts can get lost in the debate around the new national maternity hospital.</p><p>In a letter that was published in <i>The Irish Times </i>recently, a group of 42 senior clinicians expressed concern that misinformation and misunderstanding could delay what they described as a vital project to create a world-class maternity hospital for women and babies in Ireland.Professor Mary Higgins, a well-known consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician who works at the National Maternity Hospital and campaigned in favour of the repeal of the eighth amendment, wrote recently about just how badly we need this hospital.  She said that, &ldquo;We say on a near daily basis what a difference this will make to the people we care for.&rdquo;  She added that it is a &ldquo;fantastic project.&rdquo;  It is important for all of us, as we endeavour to get the best possible result, that we do not lose sight of just how important it is for women and for babies that we get this hospital built, and what a difference it is going to make.</p><p>That said, as I have stated publicly, my preference is for the State to own the land on which the new national maternity hospital will be built.  The State&rsquo;s fundamental objectives are first to provide a world-class facility and to ensure all clinically appropriate services that are legally permissible are provided for the women who need them.  We must also protect the State&rsquo;s investment.</p><p>The proposed corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the national maternity hospital at Elm Park were set out, as the committee will be very aware, in the Mulvey agreement.  This was finalised following a very extensive mediation process between the National Maternity Hospital and the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, and it was brought to Government in 2017.  Following on from the Mulvey agreement, a draft legal framework has been developed which aims to copper-fasten these arrangements and work is ongoing in relation to this.  I have been very clear that I will not be bringing any proposal to Government unless it provides assurances around all legally permissible services being provided in the new national maternity hospital, as well as affirming that the State&rsquo;s investment is safeguarded.</p><p>There has been further engagement with stakeholders in the national maternity hospital project, as we move toward finalising the various arrangements, including the legal arrangements that will underpin it all.  I want to reiterate that this Government remains fully committed to the development of maternity and women&rsquo;s health services in Ireland.  The relocation of the National Maternity Hospital is a very significant part of this work.  We remain committed to providing the highest quality infrastructure and environment to facilitate the delivery of modern, safe, quality maternity services for women and infants for many years to come.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions.  Is the Minister satisfied that the Mulvey agreement encompasses and resolves all the concerns that were raised in relation to the independence of the new national maternity hospital?  I have huge respect for Mr. Mulvey's conclusions.  Normally he is not a man to leave something undone, or something hanging to be dealt with at a later stage.</p></speech>

My understanding is that a huge amount of work was done over a significant period of time in that mediation, which was chaired by Mr. Mulvey.  The agreement that was reached worked for the National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.  The question we are all asking is whether it works for the State.  At this point it is fair to say that I have not brought any formal proposal to Cabinet.  Indeed, the HSE's board is reviewing in great detail the legal agreements underpinning the Mulvey agreement.  My Department is doing exactly the same.  There is ongoing engagement with the various stakeholders and, as I said previously, I would like to see movement on the site and on the public interest side of this in terms of safeguarding the State's investment and on the governance side.

Did he not deal with those issues in great detail and to his satisfaction and that of the State?  What has changed in the interim?</p></speech>

The Mulvey agreement was put in place.  It is being reviewed by the Department, the board of the HSE and this Government.  It is an ongoing process.  The broad outline, and much of the detail in the Mulvey agreement, is fit for purpose and will serve very well, but it is an ongoing process as to the final-----</p></speech>

This process has to come to an end at some stage.  We have to address all the issues and determine when, and if, it is possible to proceed.  There is not much sense having the Mulvey agreement, in having gone through a procedure and in having done so in great detail and after long and arduous debates and examination.  There is not much sense having that if we are going to say we are going to review that now and somebody else will review the review.  This could go on forever.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and the urgent need for a modern national maternity service in Ireland, capable of standing up internationally, was brought home to us in a very forceful manner.  Can we come to a decision whereby the project can proceed to the satisfaction of all concerned?  In other words, the State has to be assured, which I understand the Mulvey agreement provided for, that the hospital will be fully independent, that any State investment going into it will be  fully independent and that procedures carried out in it will be at the behest of the State and nobody else.  However, since then, the "what if" has started.</p><p>I am concerned that we may find that in two or three years down the road, we will have a different location.  Medical politics will take over and we will then have a third or fourth location.  I will cut to the chase by asking do we abandon this site or proceed with it?  That is the issue.</p></speech>

The Mulvey agreement set out the principles but it did not include, for example, the legal documentation.  After the Mulvey agreement set out the principles, there were years of detailed work to enshrine it in legal work.  It is not that we are going back to pull apart the Mulvey agreement.  The cornerstone of what we all want to achieve is to build as quickly as possible a wonderful new maternity hospital with full clinical and operational independence.  That is enshrined in the Mulvey agreement.  We are now ensuring that the details in the final agreements on governance and so forth fully reflect that and give us all the guarantees we want.</p> <p>  I share the Deputy's concerns about considering moving to another site.  It is not that anyone is expressly taking any options off the table but moving to another site would add several years to the project.  The only question would be how many years it would add.  It would potentially also add significant cost to the project, money that should be spent on providing maternity services.  I would be concerned about such a move and would agree with the Deputy in that regard.</p></speech>

That is important.</p></speech>

The Mulvey agreement was a framework agreement.  A vast amount of work has been done since then to find a legal agreement that works.  Very reasonable questions have been posed recently.  People want to be assured of the clinical and operational independence of the new hospital.  We need to listen carefully to those concerns and address them.  We must listen to the board of the HSE and the Department's analysis of where matters stand.  If there are additional things we need to do to be fully satisfied, we will pursue them.  We are looking at those options now.  We are not looking to unpick the framework agreement that was set out and potentially delay the project.  We owe it to the women, babies and healthcare staff to move them out of Holles Street as quickly as possible and into a new and modern maternity hospital.</p></speech>

There is an urgent need to proceed because the project is going to take some time anyway.  We must get out of the way but we need to know the extent to which the independence of the hospital is going to be guaranteed.

The board is chaired by HSE estates and includes representatives from the national maternity hospital, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, the HSE and the relevant national clinical programme in the Department of Health.  The first phase of the capital aspect of the project includes the construction of a replacement pharmacy and an extension to the multistorey car park at St. Vincent's University Hospital.

There has been broad agreement for some time that this would be the location.  The State has been criticised in the past for being too slow in its major capital projects.  It was a decision for the previous Government.  My understanding is that the decision made, which seemed sensible, was that where we could do things in parallel to speed up how quickly we could open this hospital, those things would be done.</p></speech>

The Minister is saying that the &euro;51 million was for enabling works.  There was agreement within this Government and that which preceded it that this is the best site and we should go ahead with the build.  We then spend the money because that is where the hospital is going to be built.  How is it then the case that when Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and I put questions to the T&aacute;naiste a number of weeks ago, his response was that he agreed with our concerns and, in fact, said there were real concerns over the ownership of the site.  He talked about alternative options, including the State purchasing the land.  If the Government was of the view that all of this was settled and that we were going to continue with the project and spend this money, how is it then that the T&aacute;naiste made those statements?  Since then, the Taoiseach and former Ministers, including a former Minister for Health, have raised serious concerns over this project and its location.</p></speech>

I have never heard anything to that effect, although I am open to correction if the Deputy has references to things they have said.</p><p>Certainly, in my discussions at Cabinet, there have not been any questions as to whether co-location at St. Vincent's is the right choice.  I have always seen broad public and Government support and support in the Oireachtas for that.  The concerns I heard the T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach raise related to the details of the project at Elm Park, including governance and site ownership or leasing details.</p></speech>

The Minister is right in saying that they raised concerns about details, but they were talking about the ownership of the site.  How is it the case that the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group issued a statement a couple of days after those interventions by the T&aacute;naiste to say that, from its perspective, that it had what it felt there was an agreement with the Department that the lease option was the way forward.  It also indicated that there was no discussion between the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and the Department with regard to the purchasing of the site and yet we had the T&aacute;naiste in the D&aacute;il saying that should be one of the options.  What is going on?  People are asking the question and I am putting it to the Minister.  Were there discussions on the ownership of the site with the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group prior to the T&aacute;naiste saying in the D&aacute;il that should be one of the options?</p></speech>

The then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in a meeting with St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, raised the point that the State wanted ownership of the site.  My understanding is that the then Secretary General, either at the same meeting or subsequently, raised the same issue.  That is in the minutes of the meeting. We can-----</p></speech>

It was a response to the pressure that was coming on the Government with regard to dealing with this issue, which is part of the problem.  We are now dealing with it at the eleventh hour.  I want to get to the remarks made by the previous Minister, Deputy Harris.  Dr. Peter Boylan said on RT&Eacute;:</p> <blockquote> 	I think the Government are considering a plan B, and let me tell you why ... Last Saturday, I was out returning from the shops when I bumped into Simon Harris.  We discussed the issue of the hospital.  He suggested that possibly Tallaght might be an option.  That makes me think the Government is considering a plan B. </blockquote> <p>If the previous Minister for Health was having a discussion with an individual, even though it was private, about the possibility of an alternative site, was that ever given serious consideration by the Government?  Is it a serious consideration for the Government?</p></speech>

We are not actively looking at other sites.  I do not believe that the Minister, Deputy Harris, told Dr. Boylan that we were, based on the conversations I have had with him.  That is a conversation between them and it is what it is.  It was a private conversation.</p></speech>

It has stated that it is not going to do that, which leaves only one option, namely, a CPO, and that would take time.  We are not really getting any clarity.  It seems we will go ahead with some sort of lease arrangement, notwithstanding the concerns that people have.  That is what concerns me.  That is the crunch here.  Either we will proceed with a lease arrangement under which the State will not own the land and it will be transferred to a private charitable company or the State will own the land.  It is one or the other.  It strikes me that where the Department and the Minister are - I will leave the Minister speak for himself - is that is the way it will go.  I am looking for absolute clarity regarding the Minister's position on that.</p></speech>

No options have been taken off the table.  Let me state that clearly.  If, however, we were to pursue a CPO option, there would be significant risks.  First, you may not get the CPO.  Second, you are adding significant time to the project regardless.  Third, this is meant to be a partnership.  As such, it needs to be entered into in good faith.  Starting off what could be a 50- or 100-year partnership in the courts would not bode well.  However, no option has been taken off the table.  Similarly, choosing a different site, moving to one of the other locations that we could have has not been taken off the table.  Deputy Cullinane referenced one and there are others.  In consideration of that, we would all have to accept that we would be adding many years to the project, delaying essential care for many years and adding significant cost.</p></speech>

To be fair, what the Minister is saying is that it is not off the table.  However, the caveats he puts on it by saying that it will delay the project by years suggest it really is off the table in practical terms.  That is what people will read from what he said.  That is my opinion and the Minister has given his.</p> <p>  With regard to the restrictions, it was disconcerting to hear a Minister and a Minister of State yesterday have different opinions on the issuing of certificates for those who are recovering from Covid-19.  There is still uncertainty.  Can the Minister clarify that?  Were there any discussions at all or were there consultations with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, on any of this?  Where will people get those certificates?  The HSE was saying it was not for it.  The GPs are saying it is not them.  There is still confusion.  Can the Minister take the opportunity to offer clarity?  It is really frustrating for people.  Aside from what I feel is an unfairness in what is being proposed and in rushing the legislation, this is problematic.  Can I give the Minister the opportunity to clarify that?</p></speech>

It will be based on their testing and tracing history.  It can then be issued.  I heard the commentary yesterday.  I appreciate that people want absolute clarity but I remind the Deputy and colleagues that what the Government said was it would have a plan ready by 19 July.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, and others were being asked for details that are still being worked through.  Normally, if were not dealing with a pandemic or react quickly to the Delta variant, these kinds of things would take many months.

He has my support during a tricky time in terms of the new regulations.  If you can tease out the different details, there is broad acceptance among the public of the need for them, especially when on considers the international context relating to the variant.  A number of weeks ago, the Taoiseach, in the context of delaying the relaxations, mentioned that the Delta variant was working its way through Scotland and that we would be informed by what happened there to see if there was a correlation between case increases and increases hospitalisations, which there does not seem to have been.  Scotland is now beginning to relax.  I do not have a question.  We are a few weeks behind Scotland in terms of that, and I hope we can look forward to positive news on this.</p> <p>  With regard to the national maternity hospital, as I said at the briefing we had with him, the Minister inherited this.  I do not envy him.  He may be able to clarify the position with regard to November 2019, when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, told the D&aacute;il that the new national maternity hospital would involve State-owned buildings on State land and that he anticipated the details of the legal transfer would be sorted out in the weeks that followed.  What went wrong?  Briefly.</p></speech>

I refer to it being important that this new hospital would be State-owned and on State land.  I have another question regarding the board of the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group and its stated values being the stated values of the Religious Sisters of Charity.  We have gone backwards and forwards on this issue.  In regard to one detail in this respect, though, who appoints senior consultants now and who will appoint senior consultants to the new national maternity hospital?</p></speech>

Would the Minister have any concerns if the board of the St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group had a say in the appointments to senior consultant posts?</p></speech>

The Deputy might be referring to a potential situation where senior clinicians, mainly obstetricians, appointed might refuse to carry out operations or influence operations in the hospital in such a way that would result in not all clinical procedures being available.  That would certainly be a situation which would warrant an intervention from the Government.  However, it is absolutely not something that we see happening.  Again, the reserved powers of the National Maternity Hospital fully protect its clinical and operational independence.</p></speech>

Things may change in the future.  This is the point I have been making regarding the long-term lease and structure of the board of management.  In other words, what the Minister has said applies today but I refer to what might happen in future.  Several clinicians around the country have refused to carry out the procedures concerned since the repeal of the eighth amendment.  This is an area of anxiety.</p> <p>  My next question concerns the fact that representatives of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will constitute the bulk of the board of the new national maternity hospital, or the new national maternity hospital will to some degree be subject to it.

I looked into this, because this point was raised at a previous committee meeting.  I asked if all services were being provided in the National Maternity Hospital and in St. Vincent's Hospital.  I was told that they were.  I also took a look at the charter for St. Vincent's Holdings CLG, because there were suggestions that it and the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group referred to a religious ethos, but that is not the case.</p> <p>  Deputy Lahart also said that St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will have a majority of the members of the board of the National Maternity Hospital.  That is not the case.  The Mulvey agreement sets up a board composed of four members appointed by St. Vincent's, four members appointed by the National Maternity Hospital and one member appointed by the Minister for Health.

He is a very good colleague of mine.  It is a bigger question, I suppose, in respect of his position as Minister.  What goes to the heart of any concerns I have is that the State, in essence, runs this hospital.  It has done so since the numbers of religious have diminished over the years.  The State invests a colossal amount of money in this hospital and will do so for the next 100 years.  It will be &euro;300 million indexed annually as the years go on.  I refer to the cost of that to the taxpayers.  To build a proper republic, there must be a turning point in what the State does at some stage and in the way it treats the whole issue of health.  That is the whole point that I am making but it is one that is very dear to me.</p> <p>  I have probably run out of time.  We look forward to receiving those detailed notes.  The Minister has given us a great deal of information and I appreciate it.  I wish him well in his onerous task which is often not appreciated by his colleagues.  He has enough on his plate between Covid-19, the new national maternity hospital and the cyberattack.  I ask him to pass on our best wishes to the HSE as well in respect of its ongoing work.

The information I, as Minister for Health, get as to the number of terminations does not specify the locations, but I can confirm that.</p> <p>  Buying out a campus at God's knows how much money would not be that useful in terms of the serious things we need to be able to do to address waiting lists, promote women's healthcare and much more.  That is where we would spend the money.</p> <p>  However, the Deputy raises an important point around the State involvement on the boards of the voluntary hospitals, because we fully fund them.  At present, we have a peculiar situation where the State has very little oversight and involvement.  Where we have had good progress recently is with the children's hospital, where three voluntary hospitals have come together.  In fairness to all three and the great work by the Department, there are now a significant number of public interest directors on the board of CHI.  That is a model for the future.</p></speech>

I will start off on the question of ownership.  It is more than two and a half years since the Mulvey agreement was signed off on and every time the Minister or his predecessor has been asked a question since then about what was happening the reply has been that finalisation of the legal agreement is imminent.  That has been the reply for the past two and a half years and yet it has not happened.  What is the difficulty in finalising that agreement?</p> <p>  Related to that, the Minister said in his opening statement that it is "my preference ... to own the land ...".  Why is it the Minister's preference to own the land?  What difference does he think that would make?</p></speech>

Significant process has been made this year.  I wanted to see significant progress last year but we were, obviously, very focused on Covid and many other issues.  This year, much progress has been made and I would be confident that we are close to a final agreement.  I take Deputy Shortall's point that my predecessor said the same, and no doubt he believed it at that point.  The indications I have are that we are close to an agreement.</p> <p>  With regard to site ownership, for me, it is mainly symbolic.  The governance issues can be dealt with largely through the legal agreement, the reserve powers, the public interest directors, etc.  I do not believe who owns the site has an impact on the clinical and operational independence of the hospital.  That is an issue that we have to take extremely seriously, and we are.  As I stated previously, I will only bring a recommendation to Government when I am convinced that it is absolutely watertight in terms of the operational and legal independence.</p> <p>  The ownership of the site versus what is on the table now, for example, a 150 year lease, does not make a difference in operational terms or in terms of independence, but it is clearly the case that many people in Ireland would like it.  As people said, if you were building your house, you would prefer to build it on land that you owned rather than on land that you were leasing.</p></speech>

I fully accept the Deputy is saying it in good faith and she is genuinely deeply concerned about it.  She said it to me on several occasions, so I checked and double-checked.  The charters of the hospitals do not contain any reference to religious ethos.</p></speech>

They have said at some point in the future they will transfer their shareholding into their own holding company.  As of now, they still fully own the entire operation.  Will the Minister be negotiating with that body?  The Minister is saying that he hopes to reach agreement shortly.  Whom will that agreement be with?  That is the first question.</p> <p>  The new holding company has the same ethical code as the Religious Sisters of Charity.  The ethical code is based on the founder of the order.  The plan may be that it will be a lay organisation but it will be a lay Catholic organisation.  Is the Minister aware of any hospital in the world that is built on land that is owned or was previously owned by a religious organisation that has got approval from the Vatican to transfer ownership of that site to a hospital that will provide the full range of women's healthcare services, including abortions which are outlawed by the Catholic Church?</p></speech>

One of the issues we talked about today was wanting to start this partnership on the right foot but the most important partnership is the one between the State and the women of Ireland.

We are talking about a 99-year or 150-year lease.  A lease commencing from the commissioning stage could be a ten-year process, while one commencing from the preparatory works stage will probably be a five-year process if everything goes to plan, which we know does not always happen in Ireland, and will actually be a 140-year or, perhaps, an 89-year lease.  We have to include the construction work in consideration of the lease.  Has the State done any work in terms of the end of that lease, which in the context of the lifetime of a hospital is quite short, and recovering the asset that, I presume, will be worth billions of euro at that stage?</p></speech>

I cannot remember exactly how old Holles Street is but it is less than 149 years.  Certainly, the economic value of something built today would be pretty small in 150 years.</p></speech>

Estimating a hospital's lifespan, even the building itself, at 40 years or 50 years is not a starter.  Certainly, architects and project managers on the project would not be doing their job and would definitely be failing in their role if they expected to significantly replace that building within 50 years of its construction.  Most hospitals last for centuries, not decades, even with the maintenance required.  Is it fair to say that there has been no review of how that might work at the end of the process and after 99 years?</p></speech>

If you want to take off the years for building, then let us say 145 years.  At the end of 145 years, we would still own the building.  The agreement is we would own the building.  There are so many variables at play for what options might be chosen to exercise or agree, say a decade ahead of time, or in 130 years' time, that I do not know if you could accurately plan for what would be done with the building in 150 years' time.  We would own the building and there could be any number of outcomes.  It would depend, given the timeframes involved, on many different factors at that time.</p></speech>

I am saying it is very difficult, in fairness, to know what we will want to do with a building in 150 years' time, especially in the world of healthcare where things move, and medical science is advancing, so quickly.</p></speech>

A number of matters arise from the conversation and are not necessarily the original questions I was going to ask.  This is not a criticism of the Minister but is an effort to find out what exactly he knows, does not know, and is being told about this because he was asked earlier how Deputy Varadkar was able to say to the public in 2019 that the hospital would be fully owned by the State.  The Minister was not able to answer that question; he did not know.  He was also asked if he could confirm if any terminations had taken place in the hospital and he was not able to answer that question.</p><p>I want to differ with the Minister on where he is getting his facts because the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland recently conducted a survey on the delivery of abortion services post repeal in the hope that very soon we would be having a review of the legislation, which is meant to happen before the end of this year.  One of the things the survey was able to show quite clearly was that approximately half of the maternity hospitals in the country do not deliver abortion services at all since the legislation was passed.  If the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland can find that piece of information, it seems extraordinary the Minister cannot establish whether terminations, which are just one service of women's reproductive health which women are legally entitled to, as indeed men are to vasectomies, can be performed currently in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital.  I find it extraordinary that the information the Minister is giving the joint committee is not adequate.</p><p>I will return to the key question, which is the one of ownership.  The Minister in his statement conveniently goes back to the letter published in <i>The Irish Times </i>where 42 senior clinicians expressed concern that misinformation and misunderstanding could delay what they describe as a vital project.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides that we all have to have this, and sooner rather than later.  Is it not a fact, and it was more or less admitted by a civil servant in the previous meeting we had, that for the past eight years this project has been held up because of, as the Minister has quoted, the many legal entities that have been involved in discussing it?  Is the core issue not the ownership of the land?  If the State had owned the land, would this legal and tortuous process and this complex method of how companies and charities deal with this issue have been an obstacle?</p><p>The Minister has said to us and in the D&aacute;il that his preference is for the State to own the land.  Will he now publicly call on the Religious Sisters of Charity to hand or gift over that land to the State?  The Minister has the high moral ground here.  We have been pumping &euro;300 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money a year into St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.  Why, therefore, does he not publicly call on the religious order to hand over the land to the people?</p></speech>

On the issue of termination, the situation is, as we will all appreciate, that terminations, by and large, will happen in the maternity units themselves.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point and that she was raising it by way of background, that there is a very uneven spread of terminations throughout the country.  This is one of the things we will be looking very closely at in the review of the Act which we will be getting under way very shortly.  This will be for another day.</p> <p>  The point I was trying to make, and my apologies if I was making it badly earlier, is that all procedures are permitted at St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and the hospital has confirmed that.  In the case of a termination, a woman may have one performed at St. Vincent&rsquo;s if, for example, she were severely ill.  In the normal course of events these procedures are provided at maternity hospitals.  What I was saying that the information provided under the legislation does not specify the locations but I will endeavour to provide for the joint committee the information that has been requested.</p> <p>  On the question that the Deputy has asked on the ownership of the land, it is my stated preference that the State would own the land and I have raised this directly with the stakeholders.  It is important to say, however, that regardless of whether the State owns the land, what we have to focus on to ensure clinical and operational independence, which I believe we all want, is not who owns the land but the governance structures and independence through the hospital itself.  The ownership of the land matters to people.  I said it is my preference and indeed that of the Government that the people would own the land, but it is not the solution to clinical and operational independence which is around governance, board members, reserved powers and things like that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021071400002#H00800"><p>Surely, if the State owns the land and the hospital in its entirety then, as the T&aacute;naiste stated, the State would have more influence on the governance and on the board of directors because the hospital would be entirely in the ownership the State.  It is the question of the ownership of the land that has held up the reality of this hospital for years, so this is a very significant issue.</p> <p>  Returning to why it is such a very significant issue, this is because we do not trust the church.  This is a fair enough statement to make given the legacy we have had in this country and given statements made by the head of the Religious Sisters of Charity herself, Sister Patricia Lenihan, who said last year that the hospital will maintain the ethos of Mother Mary Aikenhead.  The Minister has to square that circle for the women of Ireland because it is a very important issue given the legacy of this State in its treatment of women and it cannot just be parked because everybody is just paranoid.  Another way of describing paranoia is a heightened sense of awareness and that there is a collective heightened sense of awareness here among the women of this country that we do not want the church having any say whatsoever in our maternity care.  There is a principle that flies in the face of Sl&aacute;intecare, which Deputy Shortall and others worked very hard on, which is that we need to move to a fully State-owned and controlled healthcare service.  If we are spending millions of euro on this, why do we not pursue the ownership of this hospital?  That is why I am asking the Minister publicly to call on the sisters to hand over ownership of the land.  I understand legal niceties but these have gone on for too long.</p></speech>

I agree with a great deal of what she has just said.  Let me be very clear: no one is dismissing the concerns being raised around clinical and operational independence.  I, the Deputy and all of the members of the joint committee understand that and we are taking it very seriously.</p> <p>  On the second point raised by the Deputy around a Catholic or religious organisation having an involvement, these issues have been raised at the joint committee and in the media, and on the back of those I took another look, and asked the Department to do likewise, to be absolutely sure there would be no influence, be it Catholic or otherwise, other than a secular influence through the laws of the land and being governed by good clinical practice.  I will not be bringing any recommendation to the Oireachtas or to the Government unless that is absolutely guaranteed.</p> <p>  We went back, for example, and looked at the charter for St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group because it had been alleged the group was carrying on through its charter and mission a specific reference to Catholic ethos.  I am glad to inform the Deputy that is not the case.  The ethos and core values referred to by the group, and there are a few, are human dignity, compassion, justice, quality and advocacy.  It talks about its mission being to advance medical education, promote medical research and patient care in all areas of medicine and to be known for the highest standards of patient care, clinical excellence, medical research, staff education, and so forth.  These are things I believe we would all say sound very reasonable.  I assure the Deputy that all such concerns are taken very seriously and everything is being done to ensure it is watertight, is free from religious influence and is secular.</p></speech>

If the Minster believes all that, is reassured by what he is being told or what the sisters have written down, namely, that all services will be available and there will be no influence of any religious ethos on the delivery of services in this hospital, then why do the sisters not give up the land?  There must be an answer to that question.  I believe the answer to that question is corporate interest.  The Catholic Church is the biggest owner of land in this country and very seldom yields it to State interests.  I believe that is the reason.  Why does the Minister think the church will not relinquish the land to the State?</p></speech>

It is the position they took a long time ago.  It is the framework agreed under the Mulvey agreement and all the subsequent work that has been done.  It is not for me to speculate as to why transfers are made.  What I can say is they stepped back from St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, I think in 2017.  They are fully transferring all ownership to the healthcare group.  That healthcare group does not contain any reference to the Catholic Church, to the Vatican or to anything like that.  As another safeguard, it is important we go back to the National Maternity Hospital, NMH, at Holles Street.  It does a very good job.  We all know it provides the full range of services.  I do not think any of us have ever suggested the clinical leads in the NMH would allow themselves be constrained by, let us say, a religious ethos.  Let us remember the NMH itself has looked at the governance arrangements and said this gives it the clinical independence it needs.  We as the Oireachtas are adding in an extra element to that, namely, the public interest.  I do not mean to speak for the Deputy or anyone else on the committee but I think we all have a very high regard for the NMH at Holles Street.  There is no way it would be signing up to an agreement whereby its clinical leads were being told what they could and could not do based on any religious ethos.  What we all need to do is ensure that is enshrined in the legal protections and powers of the maternity hospital when it moves to Elm Park.</p></speech>

It is incumbent on the Minister to establish the number of terminations that have taken place in St. Vincent's.  He needs to get that information and St. Vincent's must provide it to him.  If the hospital does not do so, then we have a problem.  It is one thing to say the service is available but another to state whether it has been provided and whether it has happened.  I would just moot that.</p></speech>

Then the lawyers have to turn that into the final contracts.  I caveat that by saying the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, made similar statements when he held this portfolio and I have no doubt he fully believed them.  This has been a long and complex process but I very much hope we are close to completion of this deal because, ultimately, we must start getting this hospital built.</p></speech>

The Minister has also said this morning that he and his Department are not actively looking at alternatives.  I suspect one of the alternatives is Tallaght hospital.  We accept he is not actively looking at this but does he have officials in his Department putting contingency plans in place in case this does not work out?

That is the plan and needs to remain our focus.  This project has gone on far too long for us to be looking to do something fundamentally different right now.  However, all options remain on the table.  I want the Department focused on what is needed now to get this hospital built as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Two and a half years ago everyone would have been of the view this needed to be dealt with in a matter of months, not years.  We are now two and a half years down that line.

If I may have a quick word on vaccinations, is the Minister satisfied the supply line of vaccines coming into the country now is acceptable?  Are there going to be any difficulties?  Does the Minister foresee any challenges over the next few weeks?  Clearly, the more people who are vaccinated, the fewer difficulties there will be with indoor dining.</p></speech>

By the end of this week we aim to have administered more than 5 million vaccine doses.  We have very high uptake rates among the populations to whom it is available.  We are now using the full range of vaccines across all age groups.  That has helped because it means we can use all the vaccines coming in.  We have good line of sight on many of the deliveries we are expecting in the coming weeks.  There have been and there remain challenges with some of the volumes that were contracted and did not arrive.  There is no question about that.  Not everything that was contracted arrived.  There are ongoing conversations between me, the Department, the task force, the HSE and the pharmaceutical companies to that end, but I can say there is a lot of very positive progress.  This week, for example, the portal opens for the alternative pathway for the cohort of people for whom mRNA vaccines are preferred by NIAC but who, if they want to be vaccinated earlier, can now opt for AstraZeneca through a vaccination centre.</p><p>We have very strong demand through the pharmacies for Janssen and more Janssen will be distributed soon.  Some 40,000 doses were distributed and another 85,000 or so are to go out soon.  Things are moving apace.</p></speech>

I feel it is a good bit further on and that we are on plan D or E.  The Minister said he wants to ensure clinical and operational independence for the national maternity hospital but does he still envision a situation where the hospital will remain within the ownership of the St. Vincent's group and that he may not be able to negotiate the full handover of the site?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021071400002#K00600"><p>I am confident the State will own the hospital we build.  I am also confident we will agree final governance structures that give watertight guarantees in terms of the clinical and operational independence of the hospital.  Further, I am confident we will have a long lease and that options can be put into a legal contract as to what happens at the end of the lease, for example.  As to the ownership of the land, my understanding is that St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has stated repeatedly for many years that it will not sell the land.  I do not believe its position has changed.  The position of the Government and of the committee is that our preference is for ownership of the land, but the most important thing is clinical and operational independence.</p></speech>

Currently, nearly half of maternity hospitals still do not provide abortion services and they are supposed to be under State ownership.  I am sure the Minister can understand why there is so much deep concern that, despite the best will in the world, we are still going to continue to have a situation whereby, if the land remains in the ownership of the group, there will somehow be a way to curtail or prevent certain procedures from happening on what will be an extraordinarily expensive but very worthwhile investment.  I am sure the Minister can understand how concerned people are, given that half the maternity hospitals currently do not provide services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.394" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021071400002#K00800"><p>Yes, I do.  We must make sure we address all of these concerns comprehensively.  We will have multiple safeguards in place.  One safeguard will be the final agreements on the governance structure for the national maternity hospital, including the reserved powers.  What the reserved powers essentially do is prohibit the board, if you like, from acting against the clinical and operational independence.  They are very strong.  We are taking a look at the public interest representatives on the board as well.  That is one of the safeguards.  I will only bring a recommendation to the committee, the Government and the Oireachtas if we have watertight guarantees around that.</p> <p>  Another safeguard is the National Maternity Hospital, NMH.  We sometimes forget that we are not setting this hospital up from scratch.  This hospital exists in Holles Street.  It is highly regarded and it provides the full range of services.  The people who work in Holles Street will move down the road and work in Elm Park.  It will be the same people treating the same patients with clinical and operational independence.</p> <p>  I campaigned for repeal shoulder to shoulder with some of the people who work in the National Maternity Hospital.  They would not tolerate a situation where simply moving from one building to another, albeit from an old building to a new building, would somehow stop them providing the services they provide today.  They would never do it.  We sometimes forget that.  They raised their voice a few weeks ago when quite a large number of very senior clinicians wrote and said some of this debate perhaps misunderstands their clinical governance and that some of it is "misinforming the debate".  Those are their words, not mine.  Senator Hoey can be absolutely sure they would not sign up to an agreement that stopped them doing what they do today.  She can also be sure the Government will not sign off on an agreement that would in any way stop that.  It is full clinical and operational independence.</p></speech>

Is the Minister very happy therefore, as the current Minister for Health and as someone who has worked on this, to stand over the expenditure of &euro;800 million of the State's money on something where, ultimately, the land will not be owned by the State?  I know we are getting into technicalities, but if the Minister was outside of this remit, would he say this is a good idea?</p> <p>  Will the Minister comment on the current situation whereby some women and pregnant people are not able to avail of their partners being with them in a number of hospitals?  Only yesterday, we heard of one more person whose partner was refused permission to accompany them.  Will the Minister comment on why that is still going on?</p></speech>

I asked for an update for the committee today in case any member wanted to raise it.  The situation right now is that there is very clear guidance on daily visits for a minimum of 30 minutes, for the anomaly scan, neonatal intensive care and birth right from the start, including when induced, and right through.  It has not always been possible to facilitate visits in the multi-occupancy antenatal wards before labour.  This is for infection prevention and control reasons.  Often, pre-Covid it would have been the case that visiting arrangements on antenatal wards would have had to be mindful of the women there.</p> <p>  In addition, building on the guidelines for planned attendances, the HSE has advised that updated guidance was issued on 24 June relating to unplanned attendances or emergency presentations because that has been a real issue.  It is arguably the most important time, so work was done on that.  The HSE has advised me that the acute operations office and the national women and infants programme have engaged across the six hospital groups to confirm compliance across the 19 maternity services.  The responses we have received this week are as follows: 18 of the 19 units are fully compliant, with partners being allowed in the early assessment units; 12 of the 19 are fully compliant with high-risk pregnancy visits; and 15 of the 19 are fully compliant with emergency presentation visits.  I am engaging with the HSE to get that up to full compliance across all 19 units.  Compliance is a lot higher than it was.  We pushed for compliance on the four original criteria and then we moved on to early attendance and emergency.  That is moving at pace but there is not full compliance yet.  Like Senator Hoey, I am aware of very difficult individual cases requiring emergency presentations where there is still not access for the partner.  That is causing huge grief and huge problems for the women and their partners as well.  We have to keep working with the HSE to get full compliance across all 19 units.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for being present, for his opening statement and for all the work he, his Department and front-line staff are doing.</p> <p>  I wish to make a few points.</p><p>The Minister stated, "my preference is for the State to own the land on which the new national maternity hospital will be built".  The trustees of the Religious Sisters of Charity claim that they are under a legal obligation to enforce the values of Mother Mary Aikenhead, who passed away 163 years ago this month.  I am not quite sure what she would have made of the angling taking place this morning or of the overall debate on this matter.  Mother Mary Aikenhead has been described as "one of nursing's greatest leaders".  With the greatest respect, I do not imagine that she wants to enforce any of her values in respect of this matter from the grave.  She would very much want to see a hospital built as quickly as possible.  The Minister has stated many times this morning that there will be clinical and operational independence.  However, despite how good Mother Mary Aikenhead may have been in the context of leading charity and nursing, I do not believe that she should still dictate from her grave what happens with health policy in 2021.</p><p> A CPO process must still form part of the discourse.  It has been estimated that it could cost in the region of &euro;50 million.  I do not imagine that the Minister will be able to answer my next question, but it would be brilliant if he could.  Much of what happens with this issue will come down to pounds, shillings and pence.  If a CPO process were to cost the State &euro;50 million, we must then juxtapose that amount with the reality of the cost of leasing this land for 150 years.  Therefore, a leasehold fee greater than &euro;330,000 annually would, on a simple calculation, make it sensible to just go out and buy this land.  CPO processes are complicated, but if we consider the relative bang per buck for the State and the taxpayers, then paying an annual leasehold greater than &euro;330,000 would, I think, necessitate buying the land outright for the State.  That would also secure independence and everything else in this regard.  I ask the Minister to comment on that aspect.  Does he know the cost of the annual leasehold fee, or is that sensitive information and off the cards here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.399" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021071400002#L00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  Regarding his original comment about Mary Aikenhead, I confirm that in the charter of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group there is no reference to Mary Aikenhead, that I am aware of, or to a religious ethos.  The core values in the charter are "human dignity, compassion, justice, quality and advocacy".  The charter also then refers to clinical excellence, excellence in patient care and so forth.  Turning to the subject of clinical and operational independence, it is important that we are clear that the ownership of the site and clinical and operational independence are separate issues.  In other words, clinical and operational independence can and must be achieved through legal agreements and governance structures.</p> <p>  For example, we could ask Jimmy Sheehan, who builds hospitals around the country very well, to go out and build us a new maternity hospital.  The chances are that he would do it much faster than the State.  We could then tell Mr. Sheehan that he fully owned the building and the land but that the State would be the occupier and would rent the building back off him lock, stock and barrel for the next 150 to 200 years.  In that hypothetical case, the legal contract signed would state that Mr. Sheehan would have absolutely no say, obviously, in what happens inside the building.  I do not think that anyone would ever suggest that Mr. Sheehan could influence what services would be provided to women in the hospital in such a scenario.  What would guard clinical and operational independence would be how such a hospital would be set up, the board of directors, the articles of association and the legal powers and protections.  To me, the most important issue is full clinical and operational independence.</p> <p>  A second issue relates to circumstances in which people have said, very reasonably, that they would prefer to own the land.  We want to own the land.  We will own the hospital and people want to own the land.  I fully understand that desire, and that is our preference.  That view has been conveyed to all stakeholders by me directly and by the Department.  The Government's public position on this issue is well known.  Now, the position of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is also well known, namely, that the land is not for sale.  As a result, a conversation is ongoing between the various stakeholders in that regard.  However, I think we must keep the focus on clinical and operational independence.</p></speech>

I was a primary school teacher 16 months ago and I taught in a school with a Catholic ethos.  I had no problem with that.  That was my job and I did it gladly every day.  In one of the lessons we used to teach what the word "church" meant.  It means people.  When, therefore, the Religious Sisters of Charity, or any other church group, refers to church ownership, it is actually people ownership.  I am sorry to digress slightly, but I love my history.  Some of the most beautiful cathedrals and convents in Ireland were built when the Famine was at its height and when people did not have a crust to put on the table.  They were still able, because of a deep religious faith, to cough up some money to build these beautiful buildings.  The very sites these buildings are sitting on were developed, owned and built by people over many generations.  That point needs to be reflected on as well.  The best thing that the order could do would be to gift this land to the State or charge a very small transaction fee for it.  That would be following the true spirit of Mother Mary Aikenhead.</p> <p>  In my last----- </p></speech>

I will conclude with this remark.  It is welcome to hear that vaccination is being considered for younger age cohorts, such as those from 16 to 18 years of age.

We are waiting on some detailed advice from NIAC.  In the meantime, however, ahead of receiving that information, I have asked the HSE to prepare and ensure that we can reach out to the parents and guardians of these children and get them vaccinated.</p> <p>  Returning to the Deputy's earlier question, I have a note here which states that there is a notional annual fee in respect of the lease.  We could certainly do an awful lot with money that might be used for a CPO process.  I have no idea what the cost of such a process would be or whether we would win in the end.  To contextualise the situation, &euro;12 million has been enough to fully fund the national maternity strategy for the first time this year and it is already making a big difference.</p></speech>

She is very welcome to the meeting.  I apologise for the cutback on time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021071400002#L01700"><p>I thank the Chair.  I am happy to substitute for Senator Black, who would have liked to be here.</p> <p>  The Minister talked about the antiquated building in Holles Street.  The concern is that we are continuing with an antiquated approach to healthcare in that a private voluntary body would be delivering healthcare to women rather than there being national delivery of such healthcare.  That is the wider frame of concern as to why it would be a private voluntary body rather than a national hospital delivering State public healthcare.</p> <p>  We turn then to the nature of the body concerned and the nature of the holding company.  It is important to state that this is not a continuation of the national maternity hospital.  The latter had 100 independent governors and it was not owned by one holding company in the same way.  The Minister indicated that this new building will be owned by the State, but a new governance structure is also being put in place.  In that context, there are real concerns, as people have said.  We must move past the detail concerning whether services will be available.</p> <p>  I am going to ask two sets of questions.  One set will be on those services and the other will focus on the land.  Regarding the services, it is not just a question of whether services will be available.</p><p>Abortion was available in Ireland prior to the repeal of the eighth amendment but you had to be dying.  How will those services be delivered?  In what circumstances will they be delivered?  Will it be in the rarest of circumstances?  Will it be on demand?  We have not had answers to these questions.  No hospital in the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is listed as an abortion provider by the HSE.  That is on the record.  It is a fact.  In the past, hospitals in the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group were given guidance to only make sterilisation available to patients if the procedure were not to limit fertility, but as a by-product of another health issue.  These are the nuances and details.  Those concerns are extremely valid because in 2017 it said it would not gift or sell the land because it wanted to have integrated services and common protocols.  Just a few weeks ago, yet again, it said the reason it will not sell the land is that it wants integrated patient care.</p><p> If this hospital operates under the same laws and delivers the same services set out by the State, what, then, are the differences in patient care that requires them to have control and input in the governance of the hospital?  Is it around the protocols of when services are provided?  Is it around how they are provided?  Why is it telling us that it would not be able to work with the public maternity hospital?  If it says it will not be able to work with the public maternity hospital, then why not?  That is a core question on the delivery of services that needs to be answered.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts on that.  I also have a follow-up question on ownership.</p></speech>

Her first question was on a private voluntary hospital versus a State hospital.  The alternative would be to disband the National Maternity Hospital.  I do not think that anyone has suggested that.  The National Maternity Hospital is a private voluntary hospital.  I am not sure if the Senator is proposing to disband the National Maternity Hospital and set up a HSE-----</p></speech>

Why is there a difference in the way these services would be provided by St. Vincent's Healthcare Group?  Why, from its perspective, is there a difference between how it can work with this hospital and how it could work with a publicly owned hospital?  What are the differences in how the services are provided, because that is the reason it has given  for not selling?</p></speech>

What is the difference from its perspective?  It is not just about whether the services will be available.  How will they be available?  The Minister mentioned that a person can potentially get an emergency abortion, for example.  However, it is not listed on the HSE list of providers for voluntary terminations, for example.</p></speech>

In 2018, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group was valued at &euro;661 million.  The Minister told us that we pay &euro;300 million to St. Vincent's Healthcare Group every year.  Surely, we could have a compulsory purchase order, CPO, for this site.  That issue of the CPO and why we are not doing it is crucial.  I mention alienating the land and alienating the land being a long process.  Is the reason we cannot have a CPO that there is a mortgage on the grounds?  If so, that problem becomes worse in that St. Vincent's Holdings CLG can, under its constitution, issue new mortgages on that site.  That problem deepens if we allow a body to create mortgages on that site - further future mortgages.  Can the Minister clarify if the reason we cannot compulsorily purchase the site that there is a mortgage on this site from Bank of Ireland or is it that we are worried St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will fight us in the courts?  Can we estimate the comparable costs of those two actions?  Is it because we would have to buy the full St. Vincent's Healthcare Group which, as I said, was valued in 2018 at &euro;661 million.  This is just twice what we pay it every year.</p></speech>

Concerns have been raised that the Department and the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will have a say and will be able to overrule the people who are working on the front line.

Can we not draw a clear line, which can be done in company law, ensuring the board's independence and that it is not answerable to any body other than the HSE and the Department of Health?

It is very reasonable.  I asked the exact same question when I was shown the corporate structure.  That is the agreement that was in place in 2016 and 2017.  It provided safeguards for the national maternity hospital ensuring that it would have full clinical and operational independence.  This is contained with the reserved powers of the board.  Behind the Deputy's question are the questions of whether this guarantees full clinical and operational independence and whether the board has a direct relationship with the HSE.  The answer to both is "Yes".  It should be remembered that the final agreement has not been reached.  We will be making sure that any and all safeguards, directorships, reserved powers and so forth that need to be in place will be in place.</p></speech>

These have been referred to the committee by order of the Seanad, dated 12 July, and by order of the D&aacute;il, dated 14 July.  The briefing from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has been circulated to members.  The format of the meeting will be that I will first ask the Minister of State for his opening statement and then members will be invited to address their questions to the Minister of State.</p> <p>  I will read the note on privilege.  Members attending remotely from within Leinster House are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say during the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative members comply with this direction.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present in the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p> <p>  The opening statement submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p></speech>

The regulations consist of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Section 254 &ndash; Overground Telecommunication Cables) Regulations 2021.  Section 254 licences are required for the laying of overground electronic communications infrastructure and any associated physical infrastructure along public roads in accordance with section 254(1) of the Act.  These regulations specifically address the section 254 licence application fee payable to local authorities for overground cable which is part of the electronic communications network.  The planning regulations I am presenting today are a practical measure within my remit.  The Covid-19 pandemic has absolutely highlighted the need to accelerate the roll-out of key communications infrastructure and certainly the costs involved in facilitating this roll-out are key in that regard.</p> <p>  My Department has worked with officials in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the local government managers association representing the local authorities sector to agree the proposed fee with a view to providing necessary certainty to the communications sector on the cost of rolling out overground telecommunications cables on a national and a local level.  The draft regulations I have laid before the Oireachtas are entitled the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Section 254 &ndash; Overground Telecommunication Cables) Regulations 2021.  These draft regulations propose to prescribe the section 254 licence fee for overground cable which is part of an electronic telecommunications network.  The draft regulations amend Part 1 of Schedule 12 of the principal planning regulations to exclude an overground cable for the carrying of telecommunications signals from paragraph (e), regarding cables, wires and pipelines.  This will mean that the present licence fee of &euro;25 per 100 m payable in respect of the laying of cables, wires and pipelines as specified in Part 1 of Schedule 12, will not be payable in respect of laying of broadband telecommunication cables.  The regulations further amend Part 2 of Schedule 12 to the principal planning regulations by inserting a new paragraph (f) which prescribes a new fixed fee of &euro;125 per section 254 licence application for an overground cable for the carrying of telecommunication signals.  The exclusion of the cable-related text from Part 1 of Schedule 12 ensures that double-charging for section 254 licences will not take place.</p> <p>  While these new flat-fee arrangements will represent a reduction in revenue for local authorities in processing and determining section 254 licences as against the current fee arrangements for the laying of cable, the local government sector is supportive of these new fee arrangements, given the social and economic benefits to citizens and local communities attached to the roll-out broadband programme throughout Ireland.  The level of fee is being kept reasonably low to promote and support the roll-out of high-speed rural broadband.  This is a policy commitment in the programme for Government.  In addition, it recognises the work for a quick roll-out of broadband to meet increased home usage for both work and leisure, arising from the impact of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, and to facilitate the provision of high-speed broadband to rural areas into the future.</p> <p>  One of the drivers for this draft regulation is the rolling out of the national broadband plan.  The continued roll-out of the national broadband plan is expected to require the laying of an additional 140,000 km of cable.  This one project will lead to approximately 900 section 254 licence applications to local authorities for network build, and a further 900 licence applications for customer connections over the course of the project.  This represents the processing and determining of a minimum of 1,800 section 254 licences by local authorities in the roll-out of this one project.</p><p>As I outlined, the fee proposed provides certainty on costs for both the roll-out of the broadband network and for individual connections.</p><p> I commend this draft set of regulations to the committee.  Having regard to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the regulations will support the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in the further roll-out of much needed communications infrastructure, which will support both individuals and businesses accessing high-speed broadband in the future.</p><p> Further to today's presentation to the committee, these draft regulations are subsequently approved by a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, as required under section 262(4) of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  They will come into force as soon as they are signed by me.  If approved by the Oireachtas, it is my intention to sign the regulations into law at the earliest opportunity.  I thank the committee for the speedy consideration of these regulations and for its time this afternoon.</p></speech>

Having spoken in the D&aacute;il last night at length about the potential threat of loss of revenue to Longford County Council, both in terms of the local property tax, LPT, and from rates following the closure of the power station in Lanesborough, I am not one to agree with a reduction in revenue for a local authority.  However, it is imperative we press ahead with the regulations.  The national broadband plan is probably one of the most important projects for rural Ireland and that came to the fore throughout Covid.</p> <p>  The regulations proposed by the Minister of State are very practical.  It is fair to say we have seen a ropey start to the national broadband plan.  As a Government we need to do everything possible to remove any potential impediments that can delay the roll-out of the plan.  Rural Ireland and many large provincial towns and parts of cities are very dependent on the rapid roll-out of broadband.  We have pressed for this since coming to Government to ensure a rapid escalation in the roll-out of broadband.  I am concerned the plan is likely to be well short of the 115,000 connection targets for this year.  That is regrettable, but measures such as those outlined by the Minister of State are a step in the right direction.  We must take action where we can to ensure the plan works.  I am happy to support the regulations.</p></speech>

He is correct in his concerns about the funding structure for local authorities.  We are working very strongly with Longford County Council and other key local authorities that were affected by the just transition.  We are trying to ensure there is a solid income stream to replace the key revenues they have lost.  The Department is dealing with Longford County Council and other counties in that regard.  In the previous budgetary cycle, we were not found wanting in supporting them with key funding streams.  We need something concrete for the future and we are working to deliver that.  As Deputy Flaherty correctly points out, this initiative will speed up and assist in the delivery of high-quality broadband to all citizens.</p></speech>

In the first instance, will he give us a little bit of background to it so we understand where it is coming from?</p> <p>  With respect to the loss of revenue for local authorities, has there been an assessment of what the likely loss of revenue will be, either globally across all the local authorities or if there is a breakdown within local authorities?  If that is not available to hand, could it be presented to the committee?</p> <p>  While I know the answer to the question, it is important to have it on the record.  Will the Minister of State confirm there is no impact from these regulations on any planning requirement that may be required for any of the associated works, that they just relate to the fee structure, but where planning permission would be required, this does not in any way change that and the planning approval requirements would still be in place?</p></speech>

All the safeguards in terms of safety and basic metrics for road-opening licences will still apply.  One of the concerns that had been raised by the County and City Management Association is that there is a duplicate process here in terms of double charging.  Second, the intention is to speed up the plan.  While it is not guaranteed revenue that local authorities specifically have, if we go on the basic metric in terms of the 18,000 km, we could be talking about approximately &euro;35 million in the coming years.  They will take in &euro;225,000 from the basic licence opening fees.  We are keen to ensure we support local authorities in the future and we are committed to doing that.  It is incumbent on us all to try to speed up the process for the national broadband plan to ensure it gets to as many citizens as quickly as possible.  We should do anything we can to support the plan.  I thank the Deputy for his questions.</p></speech>

Senator Dolan is here as well in substitution for Senator Seery Kearney.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State for going through the details with us.  It is an interesting proposal that boils down to the national broadband plan, which has the potential to transform day-to-day life for people throughout the country.  The T&aacute;naiste recently published the working from home strategy.  The rural development policy for the next five years was also recently published.  These two plans together can change how we do business and rebalance the work-life pressures so many families face.  Connection to high-speed broadband is key to unlocking the potential of remote working, which I believe is the way forward.</p> <p>  Today, Apple employs more people in Ireland remotely than in offices.  Right now, the majority of employees in large and multinational corporations are working from home.  With the new right to be able to seek to work from home, it is vital we are able to provide people with the infrastructure to do so.</p> <p>  As the Minister of State indicated, the new funding structure will provide certainty for all stakeholders.  Certainty is vital to any kind of business.  It is significant the local authorities are in favour of that change.  They are the ones at the forefront of these key projects.  I congratulate the Minister of State and all in his team on their work on this important project.</p></speech>

The blended approach we are trying to achieve will give citizens a better quality of life in future.  We must take opportunities out of every crisis, try to put them to best use, and underwrite citizens going forward to give them a better quality of life and more time with their families in a more blended approach in the future.  The need for high-speed broadband has been highlighted in this crisis.  To be fair, the Oireachtas is pretty united on that currently, and we will do anything we can to assist the delivery.  The key metrics still remain in terms of road safety, protected structures and environmental issues.  All of those must still stand on their merit in terms of each application.</p></speech>

I would like a few clarifications.  The application system and the assessment of something to be placed under a section 254 licence remains the same.  I understand that if the same 100 m criteria were applied to 140,000 km of cable, there would be a substantial cost.  The Minister of State said it would be something like &euro;30 million, which is not viable, so I fully understand and support the fee change.  The licence would be applied for a network of cable.  Would there still be the same level of assessment if the network consisted of ten, 15 or 20 poles of a spur to serve a country road?  Is the same level of assessment required by local authority planners on the issuing of the licence?</p></speech>

It is linked back to the municipal district.  All the municipal districts throughout the country have an adjudication process for issuing a section 254 licence and, as I said, we still have to go through the same adjudication process for road safety, protected structures and environmental issues.  All those robust practices would still remain in place.</p></speech>

Is there any concern that because of this new way of assessing it, the applicant might just go all overhead as it is easier to do it that way?  Has that been looked at or is there any concern there?</p></speech>

It should be noted that the local authorities have very positively engaged in establishing a guidance document for operators to adhere to in the application process.  That was launched in recent weeks.  In that document, any concerns relating to how the information is presented have been ironed out by the local authorities.</p></speech>

They are not going to let overhead cables go all through our towns.  They will be managing that process and they have the right to refuse the licence if it does not meet good practice.</p></speech>

In general, the fees that are charged for planning applications rarely, if ever, cover the workload that is involved for local authority planners.  That is something that is going to have to be looked at and we should consider it in the future given we are talking about a reduction in fees.  Am I correct in saying this will apply to everything, not just projects related to the national broadband plan?  I am referring to overhead cabling.</p></speech>

I welcome these regulations.  They are very positive.  Previous speakers, including the Minister of State, have noted the importance of rolling out our rapid broadband infrastructure.  We all know the importance of that and we do not need a lecture or lesson on it.</p> <p>  I have only one important issue I wish to raise with the Minister of State.  It relates to protected structures.  The Minister of State will know that protected structures are designated through a set of principles and processes for buildings that are of historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical importance.  They are designated as protected structures and are on the record of protected structures, RPS, of each county development plan.  There is no dispute about that.  In the event of activity, works or planning, they are not exempt developments.  In the general context of planning, there are prescribed bodies, such as An Taisce and many others, that receive notification of every planning application for interaction or development to a protected structure or a development within an architectural conservation area.  That is set down in statute and law.  I have personal experience in my county of issues where the local authority has gone after people for planning enforcement in this regard.</p> <p>  The Department's briefing note says that, in accordance with section 57(1) of the Act, carrying out works on protected structures or a proposed protected structure shall be an exempt development only if those works do not materially affect the character of the structure.  We know what the character is because they have been designated protected structures but who decides it is "only" and who arbitrates whether it is exempt?  There might be a concern there.  While I do not want to hold anything up, we need greater clarity on this matter.  Perhaps a circular or a memorandum could be sent to the local authorities because we do not want cabling and all sorts of infrastructure related to broadband tacked on to these types of structures or buildings.  Some local authorities are good on this, such as Kilkenny County Council.  I do not know if the Minister of State responsible for heritage has made any additional comments on this.  I had intended to write to him today.  He is a colleague of Deputy Burke's and he is in his Department.  We need absolute clarity and I suggest a circular be published hand-in-hand with these regulations, because we do not want a whole set of litigation and we do not want An Taisce or any other organisation saying this infrastructure is in some way debasing a protected structure.</p> <p>  We know the importance of it.  There are church spires in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown where the local authority took action to have the stuff removed even though it could not be seen from the road.  As a matter of fact, those were ideal places to place this infrastructure because it could not be seen, but some local authorities are very hot on it and others are not.  We need some sort of uniformity, clarity and guidance.  I would be interested to hear what the officials have to say in that regard.  I wish the witnesses well and they have my support.</p></speech>

The Senator is a very strong advocate of trusting local authorities and he quite rightly pointed out they will be adjudicating on the record of protected structures.  We do not want any protected structure to be compromised in any shape or form.  We will absolutely take the Senator's comments on board and I would be happy to include that as an expansion in the circular.</p></speech>

I am very supportive of everything that can be done to support the roll-out of broadband.  I want to focus on a few of the points that have been brought up.  There have been issues over the years with road-opening licences or ducting for cables that are overground where they should not be.</p><p> We have seen mistakes made by different local authorities.  In terms of road opening, there is a public cost.  Licences are issued but there are no proper inspections or reinstatement by utilities.  The public bears the cost in terms of the damage that is done and, ultimately, the council stepping in and fixing the damage later on.  Are there any additional safeguards or measures in the regulations to ensure that there will not be a public cost in terms of the road opening licences?  Have lessons been learned from past mistakes with other utilities?</p><p> The Chairman raised the issue of ducting.  Is anything in particular being done to ensure that, in a few years' time when something has been done, there will be no unnecessary visual damage that will prove very difficult or costly to address?</p></speech>

Each licence is adjudicated on by the municipal district or local authority.  Essentially, they have the right to put conditions in the particular site in question for each licence to safeguard the public interest and good in terms of the taxpayer.  We are not changing that process, so to speak.</p> <p>  As I said to the Senator Boyhan, we will include additional guidance in the circular on some of the sensitive sites referred to in the briefing document.  No one wants there to be any unintended consequences.  We want to speed up the delivery of high-speed broadband to all of our citizens as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I am aware that up until recent years mistakes have been made and that, ultimately, the public has borne the cost.  This is a matter for local authorities in terms of the operation and granting of licences.  At this level, can additional guidance be provided to try to reinforce those points?</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State.  I am happy to support the regulations, particularly if they are a way to accelerate the roll-out of broadband.</p> <p>  I live in a rural area.  More than half of the premises in County Roscommon are in the intervention area.  That is absolutely incredible.  It is the same in east Galway.  I very much welcome any measures to accelerate the provision of broadband.  There are more than 19,000 premises in Roscommon.   The Minister of State mentioned section 254 and municipal districts.  I have a significant concern about that.  I acknowledge the work the Department has done to try to find a way to accelerate matters and streamline the administrative process.  The Minister of State mentioned more than 900 licence applications alone and a further 900 applications for customer connections.  Delays mean additional time that we do not have.  For the past year, due to the Covid pandemic and lockdown, everything has had to be done online.  Lack of broadband access reduces equality in regional areas in terms of attracting investment.  We can even farm in such areas.  When everything was online, there was a major impact.  I want to acknowledge what the Department is doing.</p> <p>  In the context of the National Broadband Ireland, NBI, plan, who will be the liaison with each municipal district?  This has probably already been decided and I am sure that a person has been person.  Will there be a dedicated person to streamline this process and ensure we are supporting our municipal districts as much as possible and that NBI is also supporting them?</p></speech>

She quite rightly pointed out that we are covering 96% of the State.  One can see in terms of a public infrastructure project the scale of what we are trying to do, and do it as quickly as possible for the benefit of everyone.</p> <p>  As the Senator quite rightly pointed out, there are four municipal districts, on average, in every local authority area.  There is huge scale.  That also provides extra assurance because each municipal district knows the geographical area under its jurisdiction well.  That provides assurance, as referenced by other members, in terms of protected structures and any safeguards to the public good.  We need to ensure that nothing is compromised through this process.  We also want to be aware of unintended consequences in that regard.  Each of the 31 local authorities has a broadband officer, as the Senator is aware.  Each application will be subject to all of the data from NBI in terms of mapping procedures, and that will be available to local authorities.</p> <p>  On questions from citizens, local authorities are the closest arm of Government to our citizens and provide more than 600 services.  The broadband officer is there to assist in any specific applications from the customer's perspective or the interaction with the mapping tool on the website, which is very advanced.  One of the common frustrations I hear from people is the length of time they are waiting in terms of being on the map.  This is one of the tools in our suite of armoury to try to get that process to the front door as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

There has been action.  We can see vans in our areas.  That gives such hope.  We are getting very used to looking at the map and hitting refresh.  We hope to see it change to show where we are able to access broadband.  I acknowledge that action is happening.  It is great to see that the process has been accelerated and the administrative process has been streamlined.  I thank the Minister of State and the Chair.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.522" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021071400002#D01300"><p>I appreciate that Deputy Gould shared time.  I apologise if anyone can hear any sound in the background.  I am in a committee room in the convention centre and someone thought it would be a good idea to put the volume on full.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State and his officials.  We obviously welcome the amendments on section 254.  I want to ask a couple of questions on section 254.  It is very welcome that this is a means across all local authorities to ensure there is a single mode for NBI to deal with every local authority.  The process will be the exact same.  We all know that from time to time things can depend on whether one is dealing with a really good planning officer in a particular local authority.  We could not leave that to chance for major strategical infrastructural projects such as this.</p> <p>  That part of the process is welcome.  It went into operation some time in May.  I remember speaking to NBI about it three weeks later.  It said it was too early to tell, but it was somewhat supportive of it.  I understand that it engineered a solution.</p><p>It had a problem in relation to road-opening licences.  It is straightforward.  If 20 poles are needed and one needs to be moved on-site, a new road-opening licence is needed which creates a hold-up of between two and 12 weeks.  They got around this by, where they might have needed ten, putting in planning for 20 and building in redundancy.  Some of that is making up for the fact there is a problem in local authorities.  I have heard from Vodafone and others that planning in local authorities is not set up for major infrastructural projects.  It needs to be looked at across the board.  The perfect solution for them was a permitting system whereby they would be able to put in a plan and, if there were alterations, they could be done on the fly.  Everything would still have to be signed off at the end, which would cover some of what Deputy Cian O'Callaghan was talking about.  Has the Minister of State considered or made plans in relation to doing this?  These section 254s are welcome but it is not the end result we need to facilitate the roll-out of major infrastructural projects in local authorities.</p></speech>

We have &euro;116 billion in Project Ireland 2040 through our national development plan to underwrite many key public infrastructural investments that we need.  Our planning code is under review in terms of how to best deliver this public infrastructure through our local authorities.  There have been difficulties in the past but we want to make sure those with a valid issue, such as NGOs, have the opportunity and facility to raise it.  It is about striking a balance.  The programme for Government commits to a review of the system and having our environmental planning court, which is currently in gestation in the Department of Justice and will link in to a review of our judicial review system.  All those points will assist in delivering key public infrastructure.  The last thing we want is to have infrastructure held up in the planning system.  We are keen to progress that as part of the programme for Government.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State think that within that a solution to this planning permission system could be looked at?  The national broadband plan is not only dealing with local authorities, but also with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  Has the Government had any interaction in relation to that or dealt with any problems?  If there is a need for a change of plan, we do not want a major project like this held up for two or three days and certainly not for a number of weeks.</p></speech>

I was referring to other large-scale public infrastructure, not the national broadband plan, just in case anyone was starting to get worried.  Guidelines were issued through the local authorities last May.  We see this as an operation to speed up, not to have double charging in place and to provide certainty to National Broadband Ireland as it goes about interacting with the 31 local authorities.  Do Mr. Neary or Mr. Loughlin want to add anything?</p></speech>

The Deputy is raising wider issues regarding the road-opening licence regime.  Our Department and that of the Minister of State is consistently looking at feedback from industry on that.  The local authorities through the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, review the guidance they give on how the road-opening licence regime is implemented.</p> <p>  We continually look to see how it could be optimised.  It is on the agenda that, where improvements can be made, we will consider them.  With the NBI roll-out happening in rural Ireland, we are getting a lot of feedback on how it is working.  Other operators come forward with feedback on things that could be improved.  We have recently, through the mobile phone and broadband task force, implemented a revision of the guidance provided to local authorities on the road-opening licence regime.  That process will continue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.528" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021071400002#E00600"><p>I appreciate that.  Only by doing this will the feedback loop be created that provides the information to improve it.  That is brilliant.  I do not want to get into the mobile phone and broadband task force.  That is meant to be retasked and re-engineered and it is probably sitting in the wrong Department.  That needs to be sorted.  That would allow it to be a clearing house for NBI and others to deal with issues that we sometimes deal with in this House.  There is probably a more streamlined fashion than messages over and back across the convention centre.</p> <p>  It seems NBI welcomes this and I accept the next question I will ask does not necessarily fall into the Minister of State's bailiwick but the discussion on NBI has two parts.  There was the delay in relation to Covid.  There were meant to be 115,000 connections at the end of this year but, at the beginning of January, people recognised a difficulty and the number is, conservatively, between 50,000 and 70,000.  NBI reckons it can deliver that but the Government does not want to make a promise that is not followed through on.  My understanding is that in the first six months of next year, that will be caught up on.  Beyond that, the big question is the acceleration plan.  That plan is about what is meant to come in year six and seven falling into years four and five, which means Eir has to have the capacity alongside NBI and whoever else.  I know contracts are being drawn up but has the Minister of State information on that?  We all await this plan.  </p> <p>  Another part which falls in the Government bailiwick is that the mobile phone and broadband task force and other elements of Government need to look at interim solutions for areas that will be waiting for three, four and five years in a best-case scenario.  At the transport and communications committee we had the likes of Digiweb and Novatel and we had much discussion on the likes of Starling.  Some of these may provide alternatives for these-----</p></speech>

It is good to get an insight into the workings of it as well.  I welcome the assurance from the Minister of State that he is working on potential funding for Longford County Council, both in respect of the LPT and rates.  The Minister of State put significant work into getting &euro;1.2 million for the local authority in Longford this year to offset that rates shortfall but, as he is well aware, it will be a major issue right up until 2026 as the power station was not originally scheduled to close until 2027.  In terms of moving forward, the local authority is anxious to see certainty of funding to take it up to 2026.</p><p> Although it is not his area, the Minister of State, who comes from the other rural half of our constituency, will be well aware of the concerns about the roll-out of broadband.  That is why this is so important.  We can have no excuse for the national broadband plan and it needs to be rolled out.  The Minister of State will also be aware that we have an issue in Edgeworthstown where we are trying to get Eir to connect the new public hub that is going to be opened there right across the road from the new public library.  Edgeworthstown is the second largest town in County Longford.  These are the two biggest capital projects in Edgeworthstown in recent times and it is regrettable that Eir has not met the project promoters halfway and taken the strides necessary to put in place the fibre connection that they need for this.  The Minister of State is working quietly on this issue in the background.  I have also raised it with the Minister with direct responsibility in the area.  It seems somewhat remiss if we go ahead with opening a hub for remote working and we are not able to assure the users that they will have fibre broadband in the second largest town in County Longford.  Any assistance the Minister of State and his officials can give us in addressing that would be greatly appreciated.</p></speech>

As the Deputy says, Edgeworthstown is such a key town in Longford and has grown so much over the past number of years that we need to see certainty there.  I would absolutely commit to working with the Deputy in that regard.  This highlights the issue in terms of the just transition of certainty.  The just transition commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, is on the record as stating when he formulated the plan that local authorities need to be given certainty.  When you look around the country, in Longford, Offaly and Clare, these local authorities that were so much dependent on a key income stream from their rates budget from these old production facilities and Bord na M&oacute;na, there is such a transition.  We need to be so careful that we do not compromise the ability of our local authorities to discharge all those services to citizens.  Certainty is absolutely required.  I am working hard with the Deputy and the team in Longford County Council in trying to deliver that certainty to them.  I want to get away from a situation where it is a negotiation every single year trying to deliver this and that we have certainty into the future which gives them the opportunity to plan their finances in a more sustainable way.  I am happy to commit to continue working with the Deputy in the future in that regard.</p></speech>

This is for new poles or the laying of new cable on existing poles.</p></speech>

It is to allow for vehicle sweep or vehicle overhang.  Previously, that standard was not there or was not enforced.  Many poles will have to be replaced as part of the broadband scheme.  You could end up in a situation, especially on rural roads or rural footpaths, which tend to be quite narrow historically, that the contractor is obliged to comply with the standard to recess it back from the kerbside.  I have a situation up on the Enniskerry Road where the pole was placed back to the standard from the kerbside but it was right in the middle of the footpath.  It made the footpath impassible for somebody in a wheelchair or with a buggy.  I wonder is that something where we need to have a little crossover.  That may come under roads or design.  I do not know who it would come under.  There should be consideration of that where poles must be replace as part of the broadband upgrade to maintain that accessibility.  We see the same with utility boxes are placed as well.  If there are customer connections, I presume there are some sort of footpath-mounted cabinets as well.  That same consideration also applies there.</p> <p>  This is the second time we will have amended section 254 because we had to give the leeway for the footpath furniture and the outdoor dinning.  In all that we consider, we need to maintain that full accessibility and to ensure that what we are doing to benefit one project or sector does not end up impacting on another sector in terms of access through and along the footpaths.  It is merely a comment.  I hope the Minister of State would take that on board.  Dublin City Council issued guidance recently on the section 254 licensing of tables and chairs to ensure that the 2 m gap is left.  That is something, as we go through the summer, local authorities need to monitor and, where necessary, step in and take action on.</p></speech>

I also met with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, this morning in respect of the disability sector regarding unintended consequences in relation to outdoor furniture.  We will be reminding local authorities of their responsibilities in that regard, not to inhibit business but to be respectful of citizens who are more vulnerable in society, that disabled parking bays are not being taken up or replaced with outdoor furniture.  We need to be careful in how we go about our business in that regard.  My antenna is always up in the context of unintended consequences.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom thar ceann CONCOS bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge as an gcuireadh a thug s&eacute; d&uacute;inn labhairt leis faoi thodhcha&iacute; na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh agus an taca&iacute;ocht at&aacute; &aacute; hiarraidh ina leith.

Ina theannta sin, &eacute;asca&iacute;onn siad pr&oacute;iseas feidhme na sc&eacute;ime don Roinn roimh agus le linn na gc&uacute;rsa&iacute;. </p><p> D&eacute;anann CONCOS ionada&iacute;ocht do na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge agus oibr&iacute;onn muid i ndl&uacute;thph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht le Roinn na Gaeltachta maidir le cur chun cinn chuile ghn&eacute; d&rsquo;obair na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge, tr&iacute; chruinnithe rialta den choiste deonach de dheichni&uacute;r a thoghtar go bliant&uacute;il &oacute; na ceantair &eacute;ags&uacute;la Ghaeltachta.

Sa ch&eacute;ad &aacute;it, b&iacute;onn tionchar thar a bheith dearfach ag na c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeltachta ar na scol&aacute;ir&iacute;.

Cuireann siad eolas ar theanga agus ar chult&uacute;r beo na Gaeilge i sp&aacute;s s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilte do dh&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute;.  Mar bharr air sin, d&eacute;anann na scol&aacute;ir&iacute; forbairt phearsanta agus cuireann siad aithne ar a bhf&eacute;ini&uacute;lacht f&eacute;in agus ar chult&uacute;r beo na Gaeilge, gn&eacute; d&rsquo;obair na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; a chuireann tuismitheoir&iacute; na scol&aacute;ir&iacute; f&iacute;or-fh&aacute;ilte roimhe. </p><p> Maidir le foireann na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute;, idir m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus c&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute;, n&oacute; ard-chinnir&iacute;, na gc&uacute;rsa&iacute;, coinn&iacute;onn na c&uacute;rsa&iacute; iad i dteagmh&aacute;il leis an teanga bheo agus d&eacute;anann siad athnuachan ar a dtiomantas d&aacute; ngairm m&uacute;inteoireachta.</p><p> L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn an taighde maidir le haiseolas lean&uacute;nach &oacute; bhliain go ch&eacute;ile leibh&eacute;al an-ard s&aacute;stachta i measc tuismitheoir&iacute; na scol&aacute;ir&iacute;.

N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in go gcuireann na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge fosta&iacute;ocht agus oili&uacute;int ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh ach is l&eacute;ir freisin go spreagann an obair seo iad le ceannaireacht a thabhairt maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; teanga ina bpobail f&eacute;in. </p><p> T&aacute; r&oacute;l t&aacute;bhachtach na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge aitheanta freisin sa ch&oacute;ras plean&aacute;la teanga at&aacute; ar bun i bpobail Ghaeltachta ina bhfuil col&aacute;ist&iacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; faoi l&aacute;thair.  Ina theannta sin, cuireann obair na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; go m&oacute;r le polasaithe agus strait&eacute;is&iacute; an Rialtais sa Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030. </p><p> Chomh maith leis an tionchar teanga seo, t&aacute; tionchar an-l&aacute;idir eacnama&iacute;och ag na col&aacute;ist&iacute; ar an nGaeltacht.  Is fi&uacute; idir &euro;50 milli&uacute;n agus &euro;60 milli&uacute;n sa bhliain na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge do na ceantair &eacute;ags&uacute;la Ghaeltachta agus t&eacute;ann bun&aacute;ite an ioncaim d&iacute;reach chuig pobal labhartha na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, mar at&aacute;, an lucht l&oacute;ist&iacute;n a choinn&iacute;onn scol&aacute;ir&iacute; ina dtithe f&eacute;in.  Chomh maith leis sin, cuireann an earn&aacute;il fosta&iacute;ocht fhorleathan ar f&aacute;il sna ceantair ina bhfeidhm&iacute;onn siad.</p><p> T&aacute; bagairt&iacute; agus d&uacute;shl&aacute;in &eacute;ags&uacute;la ann do na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge agus muid ag tabhairt aghaidhe ar an todhcha&iacute;, cuid acu ag &eacute;ir&iacute; as paind&eacute;im Covid-19, agus tuilleadh f&oacute;s ag dul siar i bhfad roimh an phaind&eacute;im.  Ceann de na m&oacute;rfhadhbanna a ghoill ar na col&aacute;ist&iacute; le blianta anuas n&aacute; cinneadh an Roinn Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta ar an 14 Deireadh F&oacute;mhair 2008 an deontas caipit&iacute;ochta &euro;52 in aghaidh an scol&aacute;ire a bhaint de na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge.  Chuidigh an deontas seo le gn&eacute;ithe an teagaisc agus an oideachais d&rsquo;obair na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; agus thug s&eacute; r&oacute;l l&aacute;rnach don Roinn Oideachais in imeachta&iacute; na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute;, r&oacute;l nach bhfuil ann i gceart n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&oacute; at&aacute; an-doil&eacute;ir faoi l&aacute;thair.  Iarraimid go dtabharfar ar ais an deontas seo l&aacute;ithreach.  Creidimid gur mar st&oacute;l tr&iacute;chosach ba ch&oacute;ir don earn&aacute;il bheith ag feidhmi&uacute; agus go mba cheart go mbeadh comhphl&eacute; go rialta idir Roinn na Gaeltachta, An Roinn Oideachais agus lucht sti&uacute;rtha na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge maidir le riaradh na hearn&aacute;la.</p><p> D&uacute;shl&aacute;n eile don earn&aacute;il n&aacute; deontas laeth&uacute;il na dteaghlach Gaeltachta faoi sc&eacute;im na bhfoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge.  Ag t&uacute;s an ch&uacute;l&uacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta, laghda&iacute;odh an deontas seo &oacute; &euro;10.50 san o&iacute;che go dt&iacute; &euro;9.50, agus arda&iacute;odh ina dhiaidh sin &eacute; go dt&iacute; &euro;10.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&aacute;gtha ag &euro;10 le deich mbliana anuas, gan aon aird ar ard&uacute; ar chostais ch&oacute;ir&iacute;ochta agus cothabh&aacute;la an lucht l&oacute;ist&iacute;n.  T&aacute; CONCOS ag iarraidh ard&uacute; ar an deontas laeth&uacute;il seo ar aon ch&eacute;im ar a laghad le boilsci&uacute; agus le hard&uacute; praghsanna le deich mbliana anuas.  T&aacute; deontas laeth&uacute;il na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; c&oacute;naithe, n&oacute; na br&uacute;nna, laghdaithe sa tr&eacute;imhse ch&eacute;anna &oacute; &euro;10 go dt&iacute; &euro;5 agus t&aacute; CONCOS ag iarraidh an deontas seo a thabhairt ar ais go dt&iacute; &euro;10.</p><p> F&aacute;ilt&iacute;onn CONCOS roimh an bpl&eacute; at&aacute; ar bun faoi l&aacute;thair idir an CNCM, an Roinn Oideachais agus pobal na Gaeilge maidir le siollabas Gaeilge na hardteistim&eacute;ireachta.  Creidimid go bhfuil s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh siollabas cu&iacute; ann do scol&aacute;ir&iacute; na Gaeltachta agus do lucht an Ghaeloideachais.  Ag an am c&eacute;anna, &uacute;dar m&oacute;r imn&iacute; do lucht sti&uacute;rtha na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge an measc&aacute;n meara&iacute; at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair maidir leis an siollabas.  &Eacute;il&iacute;onn lucht sti&uacute;rtha na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge go smaoineofa&iacute; ar na scol&aacute;ir&iacute; sin ar fud na t&iacute;re nach mb&iacute;onn sna scoileanna Gaeltachta n&aacute; ag freastal ar Ghaelscoileanna.  Seo an chuid is m&oacute; de na scol&aacute;ir&iacute; a fhreastala&iacute;onn ar na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge.  Cuireann a gcuid tuismitheoir&iacute; iad chun an Ghaeltacht le Gaeilge a fhoghlaim agus baineann cuid mh&oacute;r acu l&iacute;ofacht shuntasach amach.  Go deimhin, is minic gur iad seo ceannr&oacute;daithe na Gaeilge sa t&iacute;r ag teacht d&oacute;ibh f&eacute;in.  Is ceart bun&uacute;sach bunreacht&uacute;il &eacute; go mbeadh teacht ag na scol&aacute;ir&iacute; seo agus ag chuile scol&aacute;ire sa t&iacute;r ar an nGaeilge ag an leibh&eacute;al is airde sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais.</p><p>Ba cheart go mbeadh s&eacute; de dhualgas ar an Roinn Oideachais a chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh an deis sin ar f&aacute;il i chuile scoil sa t&iacute;r agus go mbeidh rang Gaeilge ag an leibh&eacute;al is airde ar f&aacute;il do scol&aacute;ir&iacute; ar mian leo an c&uacute;rsa sin a lean&uacute;int.  Ina theannta sin, creidimid gur cheart go mbeadh point&iacute; b&oacute;nais ar f&aacute;il do ch&uacute;rsa T1 san ardteist agus n&aacute;r cheart go n-&iacute;sleofa&iacute; an marc don scr&uacute;d&uacute; labhartha Gaeilge, mar at&aacute; molta sa dr&eacute;achtshonra&iacute;ocht curaclaim maidir leis an nGaeilge san ardteistim&eacute;ireacht.</p><p> Ceann de na bagairt&iacute; is m&oacute; do na col&aacute;ist&iacute; faoi l&aacute;thair n&aacute; na deacrachta&iacute; at&aacute; ag teaghlaigh Ghaeltachta a choinn&iacute;onn scol&aacute;ir&iacute; le cead plean&aacute;la a fh&aacute;il chun teach a th&oacute;g&aacute;il sa nGaeltacht.  Gan l&aacute;n&uacute;ineacha &oacute;ga ag socr&uacute; s&iacute;os ina gceantar f&eacute;in agus ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il clainne le Gaeilge, tiocfaidh deireadh ar fad leis an nGaeltacht mar phobal beo teanga.  M&aacute; tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; seo, tiocfaidh deireadh le tionscal na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge mar n&iacute; bheidh d&oacute;thain l&oacute;ist&iacute;n ar f&aacute;il.  Mar sin, is den mh&oacute;rth&aacute;bhacht go mbeadh cead plean&aacute;la le f&aacute;il ag cainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.</p><p> Gn&eacute; eile d&rsquo;obair na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; a bhfuil aghaidh le tabhairt ar sa todhcha&iacute; n&aacute; na c&uacute;rsa&iacute; &aacute;bhar oid&iacute;.

Maidir leis an Roinn ag &iacute;oc anois as na t&aacute;ill&iacute;, creideann CONCOS gur cheart scaipeadh cothrom a dh&eacute;anamh ar na mic l&eacute;inn idir na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge ar fad at&aacute; faofa tr&iacute;d an gc&oacute;ras e-thairisceana.

Creideann muid go bhfuil s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go deo go mbeadh deiseanna &uacute;s&aacute;ide Gaeilge ag dalta&iacute; taobh amuigh den seomra ranga.  T&aacute; r&eacute;imse leathan sc&eacute;imeanna ag Gael Linn le tac&uacute; le hobair na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; mar an sc&eacute;im Gaelbhratach, d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute;, agus com&oacute;rtais tallainne mar Siansa, Scl&eacute;ip agus Coirm.  N&iacute;l amhras ar bith ann, ach go bhfuil tr&eacute;imhse sa Ghaeltacht ar cheann de na deiseanna is fearr is f&eacute;idir a thabhairt do dhalta.  T&aacute; m&oacute;r&aacute;n taith&iacute; ag Gael Linn ag eagr&uacute; col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge do dh&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; agus c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeltachta do dhaoine f&aacute;sta, agus is ball de CONCOS sinn.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, t&aacute;imid ag taca&iacute;ocht go hioml&aacute;n leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag M&aacute;ire Denvir d&iacute;reach romham.</p> <p>  Eagra&iacute;onn Gael Linn c&uacute;rsa&iacute; do dhalta&iacute; i Machaire Rabhartaigh agus i mBun an Inbhir, agus t&aacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; do dhaoine f&aacute;sta againn i nGaoth Dobhair.  T&aacute; cuid de na c&uacute;rsa&iacute; sin ar bun le n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; 50 bliain.  Is f&eacute;idir a r&aacute; go bhfoghlaim&iacute;onn dalta Gaeilge ar scoil ach go dtiteann siad i ngr&aacute; leis an teanga sa Ghaeltacht.  Is n&oacute;s fadbhunaithe &eacute; maidir le foghlaim teangacha go gcaitheann an foghlaimeoir tr&eacute;imhse i gceantar ina labhra&iacute;tear an sprioctheanga.  In &Eacute;irinn, aithn&iacute;tear na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge mar bhunt&aacute;iste don Ghaeltacht agus don teanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta ar aon.  Maidir le sc&eacute;im na bhfoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge, t&eacute;ann l&iacute;on m&oacute;r dhalta&iacute; iarbhunscoile agus &aacute;bhair oid&iacute; chun na Gaeltachta gach samhradh.  Creideann Gael Linn gur f&eacute;idir n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine &oacute;ga agus daoine f&aacute;sta a mhealladh le freastal ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la Gaeltachta ach an taca&iacute;ocht chu&iacute; a bheith ar f&aacute;il.</p> <p>  Mar a luaigh M&aacute;ire Denvir, l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn tortha&iacute; taighde an tionchar dearfach a bh&iacute;onn ag col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge ar dhalta&iacute; agus a thac&uacute;il is a bh&iacute; na tuismitheoir&iacute; ina leith.  Anuas air sin, dearbha&iacute;onn na col&aacute;ist&iacute; don phobal Ghaeltachta gur &aacute;is luachmhar at&aacute; sa teanga ar fi&uacute; &iacute; a neart&uacute;, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in ar ch&uacute;iseanna m&oacute;rtas cine ach ar ch&uacute;iseanna eacnama&iacute;ochta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite go gcaitheann an St&aacute;t suas le &euro;5 milli&uacute;n ar sc&eacute;im na bhfoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge, ach meastar go ngineann na col&aacute;ist&iacute; idir &euro;50 milli&uacute;n agus &euro;60 milli&uacute;n do gheilleagar na Gaeltachta &ndash; sin m&eacute;ad&uacute; faoi dheich, agus n&iacute;os m&oacute;.  Gineann na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge fosta&iacute;ocht th&aacute;bhachtach a mb&iacute;onn baint dh&iacute;reach aici leis na col&aacute;ist&iacute; - mn&aacute; agus fir t&iacute;, m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus ceannair&iacute; - agus go hind&iacute;reach le siopa&iacute;, bialanna, comhlachta&iacute; iompair agus mar sin de.  Ar an mbonn eacnama&iacute;ochta amh&aacute;in, b&rsquo;fhi&uacute; don Rialtas breis infheistithe a dh&eacute;anamh san earn&aacute;il th&aacute;bhachtach seo.</p> <p>  Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; r&oacute;l l&aacute;rnach ag an nGaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais.  Ma&iacute;odh i r&aacute;iteas an Rialtais in 2006 i leith na Gaeilge go nd&eacute;anfar &ldquo;infheist&iacute;ocht fheabhsaithe ... i dtaca&iacute;ocht do mhodhanna nu&aacute;lacha teagaisc agus foghlama&rdquo;.  Sa strait&eacute;is 20 bliain tugadh gealltanais maidir le col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge, i measc ruda&iacute; eile, nach bhfuil &aacute; gcomhl&iacute;onadh.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r don St&aacute;t oibri&uacute; i gcomhph&aacute;irt le leis na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge maidir le deiseanna &uacute;s&aacute;ide Gaeilge a thabhairt do dhaoine &oacute;ga at&aacute; &aacute; foghlaim sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais fhoirmi&uacute;il.  Taca&iacute;m le h&eacute;ileamh CONCOS go dtabharfa&iacute; ar ais an deontas caipit&iacute;ochta.  Ba scannal &eacute; an deontas a chur ar ceal mar a rinneadh in 2008.  Bh&iacute; drochthionchar ag an chinneadh seo ar an earn&aacute;il a leanann go f&oacute;ill agus col&aacute;ist&iacute; beaga, ach go h&aacute;irithe, buailte.  Is mithid an ciorr&uacute; a aisiomp&uacute; agus deontas caipit&iacute;ochta in aghaidh gach dalta a thabhairt ar ais.</p> <p>  Is fi&uacute; a r&aacute; go bhfuil tionchar na Roinne Oideachais le feice&aacute;il thar an earn&aacute;il ar fad &ndash; m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; c&aacute;ilithe, c&uacute;rsa&iacute; faofa &ndash; ach n&iacute;l an Roinn ag maoini&uacute; col&aacute;ist&iacute; leis na freagrachta&iacute; a chomhl&iacute;onadh, mar a rinneadh roimhe.  I bhfianaise a th&aacute;bhachta&iacute; is at&aacute; na col&aacute;ist&iacute; d&rsquo;fhoghlaim na Gaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais, is n&aacute;ireach an rud &eacute; nach bhfuil an Roinn Oideachais d&aacute; maoini&uacute;.  T&aacute; Gael Linn ag tac&uacute; leis an moladh a rinneadh go mbonn&oacute;fa&iacute; coiste sti&uacute;rtha n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, task force, ar dt&uacute;s ar a mbeadh CONCOS, an Roinn Oideachais, Roinn na Gaeltachta, an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, COGG, agus Gael Linn, a bhfuil an c&uacute;ram orainn mar cheanneagra&iacute;ocht deiseanna a chruth&uacute; do dhalta&iacute;.  An phr&iacute;omhaidhm a bheadh ag coiste mar seo n&aacute; monat&oacute;ireacht a dh&eacute;anamh ar chaighde&aacute;in oideachas&uacute;la agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir lip&eacute;ad feabhais a bhun&uacute; do gach c&uacute;rsa.</p> <p>  Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; todhcha&iacute; na hearn&aacute;la ag brath ar an bpolasa&iacute; Gaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras scola&iacute;ochta, na siollabais, na curaclaim, agus na scr&uacute;duithe san &aacute;ireamh.  Faoi l&aacute;thair, t&aacute; 40% de na marcanna ag dul don bh&eacute;altriail.  N&iacute;or ch&oacute;ir aon laghd&uacute; a theacht air seo mar go n-aithn&iacute;tear go bhfuil na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeltachta ar cheann de na h&aacute;iseanna is fearr d&aacute; bhfuil ann do dhalta le marcanna n&iacute;os airde a fh&aacute;il sa scr&uacute;d&uacute; sin. </p> <p>  Creideann Gael Linn gur ch&oacute;ir cur le l&iacute;on na scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il chun an deis a bheith ag dalta&iacute; &oacute; ch&uacute;lra faoi mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste freastal ar chol&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge.  Dh&aacute; bhliain &oacute; shin, buna&iacute;odh sc&eacute;im scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; le haghaidh scoileanna DEIS.  Bh&iacute; 50 dalta sa t&iacute;r ar fad inch&aacute;ilithe le scol&aacute;ireacht &euro;850 an duine a fh&aacute;il.  Is suarach &eacute; l&iacute;on 50 dalta sa scol&aacute;ireacht nuair a th&eacute;ann suas le 27,000 dalta chun na Gaeltachta.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh, ar a laghad, 500 scol&aacute;ireacht don saghas seo le freastal fi&uacute;ntach a dh&eacute;anamh ar an &eacute;ileamh.  Nuair a bh&iacute;onn muid ag caint faoi chol&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh agus col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge, go hiond&uacute;il, is ar dh&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; a bh&iacute;onn muid ag caint.  Ach baineann foghlaim na Gaeilge le hoideachas fadsaoil, le daoine f&aacute;sta chomh maith.  N&iacute;l ach f&iacute;orbheag&aacute;n taca&iacute;ochta ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d i l&aacute;thair na huaire.  Mar sin, is c&oacute;ir cur le l&iacute;on na scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine f&aacute;sta le freastal ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeltachta.</p> <p>  Ba mhaith liom focail a r&aacute; faoi dhalta&iacute; &oacute; Thuaisceart &Eacute;ireann.  Is maith mar a mheascann siad le dalta&iacute; &oacute;n Deisceart ar na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge, i dT&iacute;r Chonaill go h&aacute;irithe.  Bh&iacute;odh sc&eacute;im an-mhaith scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; ag Roinn na Gaeltachta i gcomhar le feiseanna &oacute; Thuaidh le dalta&iacute; a mhealladh go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht.  Ceathr&uacute; scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; a bh&iacute;odh i gceist, ach cuireadh deireadh leis an sc&eacute;im sin in 2009.  Ba ch&oacute;ir don Rialtas tac&uacute; le d&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; &oacute; Thuaisceart &Eacute;ireann le hiad a mhealladh chun na Gaeltachta ar&iacute;s agus an sc&eacute;im sin a thabhairt ar ais.</p> <p>  Mar a d&uacute;irt M&aacute;ire Denvir, t&aacute; na col&aacute;ist&iacute; ar an bhf&oacute;d le breis agus 120 bliain.  T&aacute; an modh oibre athraithe ach t&aacute; s&eacute; a bheag n&oacute; a mh&oacute;r mar an gc&eacute;anna.  T&aacute; an-bh&eacute;im in &aacute;iteanna ar n&oacute;s ceol n&oacute; sp&oacute;irt uisce.  T&aacute; an bhunsamhail go maith ach t&aacute; socha&iacute; na t&iacute;re ag athr&uacute;.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r do pholasaithe an St&aacute;it i leith na bhfoghlaimeoir&iacute; a bheith n&iacute;os sol&uacute;btha agus oscailte do chur chuige nua, mar shampla, aitheantas a thabhairt do ghearrch&uacute;rsa&iacute; c&uacute;ig l&aacute; le linn na scoilbhliana.  &Oacute;n&aacute;r dtaith&iacute; i nGael Linn, is f&eacute;idir le gearrch&uacute;rsa Gaeltachta blaiseadh a thabhairt do dhalta le c&uacute;rsa n&iacute;os faide a dh&eacute;anamh ar ball.</p> <p>  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn tortha&iacute; taighde an fonn a bheadh ar dhaoine freastal ar chol&aacute;iste Gaeilge, rud a l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn &eacute;ileamh nach bhfuiltear &aacute; fhreastal air faoi l&aacute;thair.  Sa chomhth&eacute;acs seo, ba ch&oacute;ir athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an sc&eacute;im scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; faoi mar a mhol an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain &ldquo;le s&uacute;il cur lena h&eacute;ifeachtacht mar mheicn&iacute;ocht taca&iacute;ochta don Ghaeilge&rdquo;.

Is rud bun&uacute;sach &eacute; sin.  Breathn&oacute;imid air sin agus muid ag r&eacute;iteach &aacute;r dtuarasc&aacute;il.

Seachtain i ndiaidh seachtaine, b&iacute;mid ag caint faoin ng&eacute;arch&eacute;im at&aacute; i gceist &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; easpa seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge ann.  T&aacute; formh&oacute;r na daoine &oacute;ga ag caint tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla, faraor.  Chuala m&eacute; sc&eacute;al inn&eacute; - n&iacute;lim chun &eacute; a athr&aacute; ach chuir s&eacute; imn&iacute; orm - faoin m&eacute;id daoine &oacute;ga as na Gaeltachta&iacute; at&aacute; ag caint faoin nGaeilge.  Tuigim gur ciorcal at&aacute; i gceist ansin ach t&aacute; neart fadhbanna ann.  T&aacute; r&eacute;itigh ann do na fadhbanna seo.  Cad at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l?  T&aacute; s&eacute; luaite go bhfuil CONCOS ag iarraidh comhaont&uacute; tr&iacute;-bliana a bheith acu.  N&iacute; thuigim &eacute; sin.  Cad at&aacute; i gceist maidir leis sin?  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th a bhfuil deacrachta&iacute; faoi sin?  </p> <p>  Maidir le Gael Linn, ba mhaith liom tuilleadh a chloiste&aacute;il, taobh amuigh de na laghduithe agus na ciorruithe c&eacute; n&aacute;r ceart go bhfuil siad f&oacute;s i bhfeidhm.  Ba mhaith liom a chloiste&aacute;il faoi na socruithe n&oacute; r&eacute;itigh at&aacute; ann maidir leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn agus na cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; sa strait&eacute;is 20 bliana a bhaint amach.  C&eacute;n chusp&oacute;ir a bh&iacute; ann?  An rabhthas ag iarraidh 40,000 duine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a bheith ag labhairt na Gaeilge?  Cad iad na smaointe at&aacute; ag Gael Linn faoi sin?  An bhfuil aon rud &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn n&oacute; ag an gc&oacute;ras chun na cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; sin a bhaint amach?  Ceapaim n&aacute;r thuig aon rialtas c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach is at&aacute; an dea-thoil ar an talamh.  Caithfear t&oacute;g&aacute;il air sin agus neart c&uacute;rsa&iacute;, ranganna agus tr&eacute;imhs&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht a chur ar f&aacute;il.  Is fi&uacute; an infheist&iacute;ocht sin m&aacute; t&aacute;imid i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin ng&eacute;arch&eacute;im at&aacute; ann.  N&iacute; saineola&iacute; m&eacute;.  I nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, is duine nua don Ghaeilge m&eacute;.  T&aacute; s&iacute; agam le c&uacute;pla bliain anois.  B&iacute;onn frustrachas orm i gc&oacute;na&iacute; mar t&aacute; na r&eacute;itigh ansin.  &Oacute; thaobh Ghael Linn, c&aacute; bhfuil an fhadhb?  C&aacute; bhfuil na constaic&iacute;?

T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; sin a r&aacute; ach, mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, n&iacute; raibh m&eacute; s&aacute;sta leis an gcaoi ina raibh s&iacute; ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an gcobhs&uacute; i mbliana.  Anuraidh, shuigh muid s&iacute;os le ch&eacute;ile agus chuir muid c&aacute;ip&eacute;is roimh an Roinn.  Bh&iacute; an ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is sin bunaithe ar chobhs&uacute; do na col&aacute;ist&iacute; agus do na mn&aacute; t&iacute;.  D'ardaigh CONCOS ceist na mban t&iacute; leis an Roinn anuraidh.  Bh&iacute; muidne ag troid ar son na mban t&iacute; anuraidh, mar a bh&iacute;onn i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  &Oacute; thaobh na bhfigi&uacute;ir&iacute; de, fuair na col&aacute;ist&iacute; &euro;3.1 milli&uacute;n anuraidh agus fuair na mn&aacute; t&iacute; &euro;1.6 milli&uacute;n.  An fhadhb is m&oacute; leis sin n&aacute; gur dh&iacute;righ na me&aacute;in ar na figi&uacute;ir&iacute;.  Bh&iacute; daoine den bhar&uacute;il go bhfuair na col&aacute;ist&iacute; dh&aacute; oiread airgid is a fuair na mn&aacute; t&iacute; anuraidh.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; sin f&iacute;or.  Is &eacute; an rud a tharla anuraidh n&aacute; go bhfuair na col&aacute;ist&iacute; &euro;150, figi&uacute;r a bh&iacute; bunaithe ar 15% den t&aacute;ille.  Fuair na mn&aacute; t&iacute; &euro;4 in aghaidh an lae, &eacute; sin bunaithe ar 15% den teacht isteach a bh&iacute; acusan.  Fuair an d&aacute; thaobh an c&eacute;atad&aacute;n c&eacute;anna anuraidh.  De bharr sin, bh&iacute;omar beo le tosach i mbliana.  Ar an drochuair, th&aacute;inig an cinneadh mall ar&iacute;s.  Shuigh muid s&iacute;os leis an Roinn.  B'fh&eacute;idir gur sin an &aacute;it a raibh an mh&iacute;thuiscint aici.  Bh&iacute; c&uacute;pla cruinni&uacute; againn faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; a re&aacute;cht&aacute;il i mbliana seachas faoi chobhs&uacute;.  Bh&iacute;omar ag iarraidh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; a re&aacute;cht&aacute;il mar is &eacute; sin an gn&oacute; at&aacute; againn.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach.</p> <p>  Mar fhocal scoir air seo, ba mhaith liom picti&uacute;r beag a tharraingt.  T&eacute;ann daoine go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht don ch&eacute;ad uair sa ch&eacute;ad bhliain ar an m&eacute;anscoil don chuid is m&oacute;.  Chaill na daoine a th&aacute;inig isteach sna col&aacute;ist&iacute; in 2019 agus a bh&iacute; sa ch&eacute;ad bhliain 2020 agus t&aacute; 2021 caillte acu.  N&iacute; bheidh siad in ann freastal ar&iacute;s go dt&iacute; 2022.  N&iacute; bheidh an chuid is m&oacute; de scol&aacute;ir&iacute; na me&aacute;nscoileanna in ann freastal ar an nGaeltacht go dt&iacute; go bhfuil an teastas s&oacute;isearach d&eacute;anta acu.  Beidh siad san idirbhliain.  Beidh s&eacute; f&iacute;ordhoiligh.  T&aacute;imid druidte.  Bh&iacute;omar druidte anuraidh agus t&aacute;imid druidte i mbliana.  Beidh s&eacute; f&iacute;ordhoiligh ar na col&aacute;ist&iacute; athoscailt.  Mar a d&uacute;irt M&aacute;ire Denvir, is &eacute; sin an rud faoina bhfuilimid ag caint.  T&aacute;imid druidte agus caithfimid a chinnti&uacute; go mbeimid in ann oscailt i gceann c&uacute;pla seachtain le hearn&aacute;il 2022 a thos&uacute;.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh an tac&uacute; n&oacute; an cobhs&uacute; seo a fh&aacute;il chomh luath is a thig linn.  Mar a d&uacute;radh sa Chamber anseo tr&iacute; na blianta, t&aacute; s&eacute; iontach furasta rud a dhruid ach i bhfad n&iacute;os deacra &eacute; a athoscailt.  Is &eacute; sin an jab is m&oacute; at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh againn.  Beidh cuid mhaith de na mn&aacute; t&iacute; caillte againn an bhliain seo chugainn.  T&aacute; cobhs&uacute; faighte acu i mbliana ach an mbeidh siad linn an bhliain seo chugainn?  Caithfimid daoine nua a mhealladh isteach.

As he is probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statement on the website following the meeting.</p> <p>  Before I invite the witness to deliver his opening statement, which will be limited to five minutes, I wish to advise him about parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.</p> <p>  As the witness today is attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, please note there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, he may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make her or him identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they should be physically present in the confines of Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin in order to participate in the public meeting.  I cannot permit a member to attend who is not adhering to that constitutional requirement.  I ask members to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the Debates Office staff who are preparing the Official Report.  I remind those participating in the meeting to mute their mobile telephones or, better still, switch them off.</p> <p>  I now call on Assistant Garda Commissioner O'Driscoll to address the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.608" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Driscoll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021071400002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chair.<br/><br/>The primary objective of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in undertaking the many tasks that fall within its remit is to keep people safe.  Throughout its almost 100 years in existence, keeping people safe has involved the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na devising strategies to prevent people from being harmed while travelling on road networks as pedestrians, on bicycles, or within vehicles, and through violence that may be inflicted on them in their homes and on the streets by way of assault, burglary and other such crime that we are all familiar with.<br/><br/>However, as we approach the beginning of our second century in existence, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is required to be equipped also to keep people safe in the online world where they are connected to others through computer telecommunication systems, such as the Internet.  Words and phrases now in common usage within law enforcement such as &quot;malicious domain&quot;, &quot;ransomware&quot;, &quot;data harvesting malware&quot;, &quot;botnet&quot;, &quot;cryptojacking&quot; and &quot;the darknet&quot; were until recently not well known.  However, cybercrime is progressing at what Interpol describe as &quot;an incredibly fast pace&quot;, with new trends constantly emerging.  Interpol warns that cybercriminals are becoming more agile, exploiting new technologies with lightning speed, tailoring their attacks using new methods, and co-operating with each other in ways we have not seen before.  The crimes concerned know no borders, either physical or virtual, cause serious harm and pose very real threats to victims worldwide.<br/><br/>It is essential, therefore, that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other law enforcement entities keep apace with new technologies to understand the possibilities they create for criminals and how they can be used as tools for fighting cybercrime.  In its 2018 report, the Commission of the Future of Policing in Ireland referred to the fact that extortion, fraud, ransomware, child pornography, sexploitation and other cybercrime and Internet-enabled crimes are proliferating fast.  In this regard, the commission observed that Ireland is not alone in struggling to deal with the threat.<br/><br/>While we are all vulnerable to being a victim of online-related criminal activity, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recognises that some are more vulnerable than others, including children and old people.  This is reflected in the strategies and initiatives it has undertaken to tackle cyber-related crime.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na endeavours to ensure that all personnel throughout the organisation are aware of and are appropriately trained and equipped to participate in an appropriate manner in tackling online related crime.  However, responsibility for ensuring a co-ordinated approach to tacking the criminality involved is assigned to particular sections and units.<br/><br/>In this regard, I mention first the Garda National Protective Services Bureau, GNPSB, which provides advice, guidance and assistance to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigating sexual crime, online child exploitation, domestic abuse, human trafficking and organised prostitution and plays a particular role in supporting victims of crime.  The bureau leads the investigation in more complex cases.  The GNPSB liaises with relevant Departments, State bodies and voluntary groups, embracing the essential multi-agency approach to tackling relevant crimes and their causes.  The bureau has provided a wide range of advice for use by adults and children for the purpose of protecting children from those who target them online, and with a view to making relevant contact details available to those who fall victim to such crime.<br/><br/>The Garda National Protective Services Bureau keeps peer-to-peer activity relating to file-sharing of illegal material over private networks under constant review.  This includes the use of particular software tools.  In this regard, it has recently undertaken particular investigations targeting relevant criminality under Operation Ketch.  Divisional protective service units have been rolled out nationwide by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and roll-out of these units meets a key commitment in A Policing Service for the Future, the four-year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future Policing.<br/><br/>The local protective services units participate in protecting people who engage in online activity and investigating associated criminality.  Ireland's national service for the reporting of suspected online illegal content is <i>hotline.ie</i>.</p><p>On receipt of reports, <i>hotline.ie</i>content analysts examine the content and if the material is considered illegal will issue notice and take down request orders to the appropriate service provider and notify the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the relevant information.  Where that content pertains to children the Garda National Protective Services Bureau has a particular role.<br/><br/>The Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau, GNCCB, was established as a unit in 1991 and re-established more recently in 2017.  Last year it was assigned a detective chief superintendent as its head.  It is a national unit tasked with the forensic examination of computer media seized during the course of any criminal invest<i>i</i>gation.  These include murders, cybercrime, online harassment, computer intrusions, child exploitation offences and any criminal investigation in which computers are seized or may contain evidential data.  The unit also conducts investigations into cyber-dependent crimes that are significant or complex in nature, network intrusions, data interference and attacks on websites belonging to Departments, institutions and corporate entities.<br/><br/>The GNCCB is responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of cybercrime incidents in the State.  Cybercrime generally involves incidents where the Internet, information and communication technology, ICT, systems or digital devices play a significant role in the commission of a criminal offence.  The GNCCB works collectively with local and national Garda units along with national and international stakeholders to reduce the threat and impact of cybercrime on individuals and organisations.<br/><br/>The GNCCB is staffed by civilian personnel and Garda members of various ranks up to detective chief superintendent.  Personnel assigned to the bureau undergo intensive training in the area of forensic computing and cybercrime investigations, and give expert evidence and testimony in all types of investigations and prosecutions in court.  In addition to its forensic and investigative role, the GNCCB acts as a liaison with various partner agencies and law enforcement bodies.<br/><br/>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has recently increased its dedicated resources in the cyber area and is continuing to grow its capabilities in this regard.  In recent months, the GNCCB has established regional hubs throughout Ireland, in places including, Cork, Wexford, Galway and Mullingar.<br/><br/>The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, GNECB, is a specialist unit that investigates fraud-related crime involving complex issues of criminal law or procedure.  The bureau investigates serious and complex cases of commercial fraud, cheque and payment card fraud, counterfeit currency, money laundering and breaches of the Companies Acts.  The GNECB has been to the forefront in tackling an increase in online-related crime experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic, including: investment fraud; phishing/vishing<i>/</i>smishing frauds; online shopping fraud; invoice redirect/business email compromise fraud; and fraud involving people allowing others to use their bank accounts, who are referred to as money mules.<br/><br/>Along with launching criminal invest<i>i</i>gations relating to the many frauds discovered and reported, the GNECB has engaged in an extensive media campaign designed to alert people to the existence of the frauds in question in the hope that they will not engage, online or otherwise, with the criminals involved.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na interacts with the National Cyber Security Centre and contributes to ensuring implementation of a number of commitments with regard to cybersecurity that are included in the programme for Government.<br/><br/>In tackling the wide range of online-associated criminality, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enforces provisions within all relevant legislation including: the Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Act 2017; the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020; the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, as amended by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017; the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Act 2021; the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989; and organised crime related legislation within the Criminal Justice Act 2006. <br/><br/>On international co-operation, Europol set up the European Cybercrime Centre, EC3, in 2013 to strengthen the law enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU and thus help to protect European citizens, businesses and governments from online crime.  Since its establishment, EC3 has made a significant contribution to the fight against cybercrime.  Each year, EC3 publishes the Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment , IOCTA, its flagship strategic report on key findings and emerging threats and developments in cybercrime.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with the EC3 unit at Europol in targeting cybercrime impacting on Ireland that has a European dimension.  We have seconded a staff member to EC3 in Europol in recent months. <br/><br/>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also utilises the services of the Interpol cybercrime directorate in tackling online related crime.  This directorate is working with its almost 200 member countries, private sector partners and cybersecurity communities across the globe in attempting to ensure a robust law enforcement response to cybercrime.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.614" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Driscoll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021071400002#B00600"><p>This morning I met with the chief superintendents in each of the bureaus I have mentioned to discuss relevant issues.  We have ongoing investigations and we discuss the legislation we have on the Statute Book.  As I have referred to, we use a wide range of legislation.  The criminals are continuously changing tack so each jurisdiction needs to make sure its legislation is sufficient to tackle the issue involved.  In this regard, the Minister for Justice has announced new legislation that is planned, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (powers) Bill.  This will be important legislation from our perspective insofar as we are constantly seizing media equipment that we require to search but we do not necessarily have the sufficient powers to access what is on those media devices.  The proposed legislation will allow us to use a single power of arrest in particular in relation to particular offences.  It will allow us to search and to demand access to the content of media equipment.  Where people fail to provide passwords, etc., there will be significant offences involved.  This legislation is necessary because there is no point in us seizing the media equipment that is so important to the relevant investigation if we cannot access what is on it.  If we are prevented from accessing the content then there must be a penalty involved.  In Operation Ketch, for example, on four occasions we searched numerous premises where we know that child abuse imagery is being utilised and we seized equipment.  The equipment is getting more sophisticated and has greater capacity, and we need the capability to access that data.  The Deputy asked about what we need to do our job into the future.  We need better equipment.  We are in the process of acquiring that in recent months.</p><p>Decryption equipment has been provided which will help us.  This morning, I talked to my team about other equipment which we believe would be useful to us.  We are preparing a business plan so that our capacity will match that of the criminal networks involved to be able to tackle them.  Constant review of the relevant legislation by the Legislature will probably be necessary.  In some regards, much of what we are dealing with here is what one person described as "unknown unknowns".  We do not know what is ahead of.  There are crimes that we would not have envisaged just a short few years ago which we are now required to tackle.  Some of the recent legislation has been especially useful.  Continuous monitoring and strengthening of that legislation will be necessary.</p><p> One aspect of legislation that we frequently use relates to organised crime.  Besides the legislation that we will use to penalise what is taking place online, the groups involved in this are involved in organised crime.  The legislation relating to organised crime from the Criminal Justice Act 2006 and Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 is especially useful.  There are now more frequent charges for those we identify as suspects that relate to organised crime as distinct from the other specific crime that I mentioned earlier.  Some crime is newer, such as that relating to what is referred to as Coco's Law.  That legislation is especially useful in tackling offences related to cyberbullying.  It was enacted in February.  Investigations that are currently taking place will probably not yet have reached prosecution stage.  That is useful legislation that we are preparing to use and about which training is being delivered to make sure that we implement the offences contained within it where relevant.</p></speech>

Does he think there is enough information available to people?  Young people often get caught up in this.  They see a few quid extra coming in.  They do not realise where it is coming from.  It is a matter of going down to the bank and putting the money in their account.  They do not realise the implications of what they are doing.  Is there enough information for young people to avoid that sort of crime?</p></speech>

It has spent much time recently engaging in media campaigns to highlight the importance of not getting involved in criminality of this nature, especially to students.  Third level students have been targeted specifically to open accounts to launder money.  If one is approached and it appears that a quick buck can be made, there must immediately be significant suspicion that criminality is involved.  We are trying to get that message across to students.  We recently had a fraud awareness week where we engaged in extensive media campaigns to advise people of the criminality involved.  Personnel attached to the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau have gone on "Crimecall" and used other such mechanisms to highlight the criminality involved.  There have been a number of recent prosecutions, which are another means by which people will quickly learn the implications of engaging in criminality of this nature.  We particularly warn students about facilitating people to launder money.  It can destroy a person's potential to gain employment or to travel abroad.  It is clearly ill-advised to engage in the activity although there is a prospect of making money that so many young people of that age desperately need.</p></speech>

Has the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na supports in place for its own staff to deal with issues such as online crime?  Is it sufficiently resourced and does Mr. O'Driscoll feel that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs additional resources in future for new regulations that may come in?  I noted in correspondence the issue arising relating to GDPR in interactions between garda&iacute; and the media commissioner when that position is put in place.  What is Mr. O'Driscoll's view on that?  Does he think it needs to be addressed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.619" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Driscoll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021071400002#C00500"><p>It is always dangerous to ask law enforcement officers if they want more resources.  Our demands will be never-ending.  That reflects the extent of crime of the nature that we are talking about.  Having said that, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's approach to this has included forming bureaus that did not exist a short few years ago, which are now well-resourced, including the Garda national cybercrime bureau.  It was recently provided with more staff.  It needs additional staff.  We are in the process of employing civilian experts in this area.  We are in competition with the private marketplace.  The public service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in particular are not always in a position to remunerate people to the extent that private industry can.  We have a difficulty in acquiring the people we want and then in retaining them.  That is a fact of life which we have to deal with.  Part of the resolution to that may be bringing people in on a short-term basis, which would not be a typical form of employment in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or in police services in general but it is the picture we are dealing with.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, the equipment being used by criminals is growing in sophistication so we need to match it.  That is expensive.  We have drawn on the resources of the International Security Fund recently to fund some of the decryption equipment that has been provided to the Garda national cybercrime bureau.  We hope that such funding will be available in future to ensure that we can be equipped in the manner that we need to be equipped.</p> <p>  Demanding work is undertaken by staff, especially those dealing with child abuse imagery.  A new policy was recently put in place for staff who are engaged in this sort of activity and investigation to make sure that their welfare is catered for.</p><p>To be watching that sort of imagery as part of one's job over a protracted period of time is obviously not a task we would wish upon anyone.  Thus we are developing our policies in that regard.  We obviously cannot acquire all the resources we need to tackle all these issues but by plugging into other agencies and by engaging in the international community we can draw upon the resources of others.  This is so critical not just in the cybercrime area but right across the board, be that with drugs and organised crime, economic crime or any other type of crime.  We very much engage at an international level with our counterparts in other jurisdictions and, as I referenced, with Europol, Interpol, Eurojust and all those other agencies where resources are available on a European level and a more global basis.  We certainly will need more resourcing and will continuously update our requirements in that regard.  We hope that with the demands which are right across the board within policing, some of those requirements can be met.  The bill for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year is just slightly short of &euro;2 billion so there is a huge amount of money involved.  It is an ever-demanding requirement but on the other side of the coin we are seizing more money from the criminal networks so hopefully that will help to balance the books to some extent.</p></speech>

The assistant commissioner has had experience previously with the main online platforms and dealing with them with regard to abuse.  It is something we, as politicians in the national limelight, are unfortunately targeted with on a regular basis.  What has the assistant commissioner's experience been of dealing with the various platforms and getting stuff taken down, or getting the use of certain material for evidence in a case, if need be?  Is it positive or negative?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.622" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Driscoll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021071400002#D00300"><p>Again, this is an area where international co-operation is important also.  I have sat at meetings at an EU level where these issues have been discussed.  There is an approach across the EU to our engagement with private industry but at a local and national level we also engage with relevant stakeholders.  As time moves on those relationships are improving.  We have memorandums of understanding, MOUs, signed with particular private entities in relation to tackling particular forms of crime, particularly the child imagery issues.  This is the way forward.  We must engage with our stakeholders in a meaningful way.  As I said, while we will do that to the extent we can at a national level it does need the international law enforcement community and the institutions of the EU, among others, to ensure all those stakeholders play their part in tackling the criminality involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.623" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1581" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021071400002#D00400"><p>I thank the assistant commissioner for giving up his time this afternoon and for all the work he and his colleagues do.  I take this opportunity to congratulate them on the huge cocaine seizure announced today as well.  It is positive news from a law enforcement perspective but also reinforces the huge problem that is there, the huge market that is here as well and the amount of people who continue to use such substances despite knowing everything that goes with that.</p> <p>  I welcome the remarks about the welfare of the assistant commissioner's team which is tasked with the most difficult job of having to go through some of this really atrocious online content, which is a priority.  These team members really are some of the unsung heroes of law enforcement.  They work behind the scenes but they deserve all the support they can possibly get because exposure to that level of depravity on such a regular basis can, I am sure, have a really profound impact on a person.</p> <p>  Touching on a point raised by Senator Carrigy, have the tech companies been co-operative with the Garda in relation to prosecutions and its investigations?  I ask because I want to delve further into that and see whether there are impediments there from the tech companies that require remedying to ensure easier prosecution.</p> <p>  The other area I want to ask about as well is the issue of minors who are perpetrating online crime and abuse and how we deal with that.  It is an area of difficulty for law enforcement in general, be that with street crime or anti-social behaviour.  As such, the assistant commissioner might speak to the approach to online crime as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.624" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Driscoll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021071400002#D00500"><p>Taking the last matter the Deputy mentioned, that is, minors who are perpetrators of crime, the Garda national protective services bureau, GNPSB, works closely with the Department of Education.  That Department has educational campaigns in place on trying to keep people safe online.  These are delivered within schools to the various age groups.  Influencing parents is an important part of the process and we work closely with the Department in that regard and have been jointly involved in initiatives that attempt to keep people safe and to improve behaviours online.  That is essential and will continue.  We have divisional protective services units throughout the country now.  Our Garda national crime prevention office is also engaged in the distribution of material dealing with personal safety online, particularly targeted at parents and referring to cyberbullying.  I am looking at one document that talks specifically about cyberbullying and gives key advice for parents, such as blocking senders, not replying and reporting problems.  All these issues are dealt with in information bulletins issued by the Garda Crime Prevention National Centre of Excellence which is next door to me in Harcourt Square.  Minors are particularly vulnerable in this area.  Additional policing methods of protecting young people when young people were on the streets was easier than protecting them online but we all must adapt to this online world and try to police as best we can.</p> <p>  The Deputy will have to remind me of the first issue he mentioned.</p></speech>

Other than that it was just comments on the welfare of Garda investigators and on today's seizures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.626" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Driscoll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021071400002#D00700"><p>Again, I referenced the tech companies and our engagement with them to some extent.  The relationships are developed and much improved.  Aside from engaging with them to the extent that we want to get their assistance we also have a formal engagement with them where they are required to provide evidence when we deem that information in their possession might be useful as evidence.</p><p>For that purpose, we will use the relevant legislation, search warrants and other such devices, in order to acquire the evidence so that it is available in a manner that is suitable for prosecution of a crime.  While institutions, companies or whatever may be willing to provide evidence, we have to use that formal route in any event and it gives better legal coverage to all concerned when we go about business through the use of the relevant legislation in that manner.  We get the assistance of those companies in many of those investigations, where that formal route is used in order to acquire the evidence involved.</p><p> On the welfare issue, as I said, we have a new policy document issued by our chief medical officer.  It was some time in the making to ensure it was robust and appropriate for this type of crime.  It is the sort of service that needs to be available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a whole range of areas, where they engage in traumatic events.  In this case, the welfare issues of those specifically involved in dealing with issues online is addressed.</p><p> Also, approximately two years ago, we issued details to all of our members of a 24-hour phone number where welfare issues arise in particular investigations.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engage in all sorts of activities where trauma can be involved.  This can be fatal traffic accidents which, regrettably, we have had too many of in recent weeks.  It can be a situation similar to that I attended many years ago following the tsunami.  In such a scenario one has to deal with many dead people.  It can also be dealing with people, such as those who were found dead in a container in Wexford a number of years ago.  There are fires, traffic accidents and many different types of events where trauma is involved, which can have an impact on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We endeavour through our chief medical officer and welfare services to provide the sort of backup to personnel that is required.  Again, this is something that needs to be monitored on a continuous basis to ensure those services are working and are protecting personnel to the extent that is appropriate.</p></speech>

I have heard some negative stories from people who report online harassment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I note from the assistant commissioner&rsquo;s statement that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na endeavours to ensure personnel throughout the organisation are aware of, and are appropriately trained and equipped to deal in an appropriate manner with tackling, online-related crime.  Is there a knowledge gap in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when it comes to online safety?</p> <p>  My second question is to ask the assistant commissioner to outline the process adopted when a person is subjected to a torrent of online abuse from numerous possibly anonymous accounts where one abusive comment may be made but collectively there are hundreds of other accounts.  What steps does An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take to try to help a person in that case?</p> <p>  I am interested in hearing if the assistant commissioner has anything to say about the prevalence of cyberstalking or harassment online.  Restraining orders only go as far as to restrain a person from the family home and most of these cases would come under harassment under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  Anecdotally, I hear that most young people would be of the belief that cyberstalking or cyberharassment is still rampant.  Has the assistant commission anything to say on that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.630" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Driscoll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021071400002#E00400"><p>The extent of cyberstalking is difficult to estimate.  Like many forms of crime, we only know of those reported to us.  Part of what we are doing is trying to encourage more people to come forward and report crimes of that nature so we can get a full understanding of the extent that it is taking place.  There have been successful investigations of such activity where, on their conclusion, there has been a prosecution and, in some cases, a conviction.<br/><br/>Clearly, much of the investigation involved in criminality of the nature described by the Senator is new to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Ensuring that our members are equipped and have full knowledge of all of the legislation available to them and, indeed, the existence of offences is a challenge for us.  Delivering training has been a particular challenge for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the Garda College in Templemore during the Covid-19 pandemic when the college closed.  We are delivering training to our members throughout the country.  The Garda National Protective Services Bureau is particularly involved in developing training in the area of some of the criminality involved here and some of the training is being adapted to be delivered online to members rather than in a classroom scenario.<br/><br/>We have started to recruit again recently and I am aware there was one class of recruits who joined us in May and who spent the first number of weeks being trained online before travelling to Templemore to receive some training in a classroom scenario.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, it will take some time for all of our members to become fully <i>au fait</i>with the full plethora of new legislation in this area but through the creation of the bureaus in recent years, namely, the Garda National Protective Services Bureau and the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau, in particular, we now have centres of excellence where, when members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the divisions and the country come across criminality, the investigation aspect of which they are ensure, they can link into the national bureaus which will assist them in undertaking the investigations.  Indeed, in the case of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau, we have more recently established units of this bureau in each division.  These units are trained by personnel from within this bureau in the investigation of criminality, some of which falls under the headings that we mentioned.  There is a unit of that nature in each division and training is being delivered in that area.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that these are complex investigations and can take some time to bring to a successful conclusion.  Through the interaction with victims and with their assistance, we have the capacity to achieve convictions.</p><p>That is occurring on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

Deputy Griffin referred to one of them, namely, the fact that in recent times we have seen journalists being abused online and, as politicians, we are trolled and abused.  There is the issue of false accounts.  The online platforms have many procedures in place, but they are not dealing with the large number of false accounts.  As I said, they are trolling many of us involved in political life and, recently, journalists have been abused and have received threats online.  What is Mr. O'Driscoll's view on what these media companies should do to address this?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Driscoll mentioned working with the Department of Education.  This is something we discussed at a previous meeting.  We asked representatives of Facebook, Twitter and so forth to fund a campaign with the Department of Education.  As Mr. O'Driscoll said, some work is done there, but it is not rolled out across all schools.  Individual schools have to ask for that programme and the number of schools that have asked for it is significantly low.  As I have stated previously, a safety programme should be rolled out across all schools in the country to show children the abuses and so forth that exist.  It would be good to hear Mr. O'Driscoll's views on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.634" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Driscoll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021071400002#F00400"><p>Certainly, every child should have the opportunity of receiving information and help in tackling the criminality involved.  Whatever way that has to be delivered, we must ensure we leave nobody behind.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, being in every district and division in the country, will do its part to engage with the Department of Education, with schools at local level and with young people in whatever manner it can to ensure it delivers its message and the guidance it can offer.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the example of the targeting of journalists.  I am aware of a number of successful investigations that have resulted in prosecutions in that area.  In any case where criminality of that nature is discovered we certainly will engage with the relevant companies and will do all we can to ensure that they play their part in preventing the crime, in the first instance, and the continuation of it where it has commenced, while at the same time focusing to a large extent on the investigation and attempting to gather the evidence that will be sufficient to institute a prosecution.  A lot of the criminality involved recently is new to all concerned.  It is a fact that everybody is now online whereas a few years ago fewer people would have been online.  Each year that the number grows, the potential for all of us to become victims is growing and obviously the extent of the criminality of this nature occurring is growing.  Into the future, it is going to take the resources of all of us, including the resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, relevant Departments and other State agencies, to bring about a situation where it is safer to be online.</p></speech>

Many witnesses, organisations and groups have appeared before the committee over the last couple of months for our pre-legislative scrutiny on this topic, including the element of reporting, the steps taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and how tangible these tech giants are in terms of accountability.  We heard repeatedly from Facebook, TikTok and the social media giants about their community standards in terms of what is acceptable online behaviour or harmful content and what is not.  To my mind, and I would say for many of my colleagues, there is no benchmark for what should and should not be acceptable.</p> <p>  We also heard accounts of families who had seen their children receive online abuse, taken a screenshot of that abuse and reported it to the companies.  Of course, that was a futile exercise, with some recounting that it was days before that content might be removed.  You have touched on this already.  In a scenario where a child is in primary school and the parent sees harmful content, the parent gathers as much information as he or she can and goes to the local Garda station and reports it, do you find that this can be expedited quickly through the tech giants to get to the source of the information or are there challenges put in your way in terms of sourcing the identity or shutting down that account to get rid of the harmful content?  I am thinking specifically of children.  In a practical sense, when a parent goes to local garda&iacute; with as much evidence as he or she can gather on harmful content, what are the steps or how long does it take for the tech giants to respond in a meaningful way?</p></speech>

They vary greatly.  Some may result in success in bringing about an end to the activity much quicker than others, but the expertise of the national units is available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a local level and the intervention with the private companies involved can be facilitated through the expertise at national level.  However, we can only bring about a scenario that is permitted by law.  We can only force companies to do that which we are lawfully entitled to demand of them.  This is an area where the legislation needs to be monitored on an ongoing basis to make sure it is robust enough to achieve the aims we all desire in preventing the activity involved.</p></speech>

What I am asking is not a reflection on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am trying to elicit the agreeableness and the forthcomingness of the tech giants when the Garda has an issue and approaches them.  I have been told that one will never get contact with Facebook, TikTok or Twitter immediately on the telephone to address something like that, that one almost has to get clearance from their operations in the United States and that it can take a number of weeks before it comes back again.  In other words, it becomes a very elongated process which is exasperating, particularly for the victims involved.  It is no reflection on the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but more a reflection on the challenges and obstacles that are put in its way in terms of these tech giants being forthcoming with the information and being as helpful as possible to address this when it happens.</p></speech>

In some investigations, that will take longer than others.  We endeavour to commence the process as expeditiously as possible so that we do not contribute to any delay.

That does not apply only to dealing with Internet-related material.  In circumstances with which I would be more familiar, going back a number of years, we would, for example, look for information from the banks on money laundering related to drug trafficking.  The banks wanted us to come in with orders under section 63 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and would then immediately hand over the material.  If we went knocking on the door and suggesting the banks had material that could prove money laundering or information about it, the banks could not give it.  They needed to get the court order but would then immediately provide the information to us.  That, of course, can only be achieved if the appropriate legislation is in place.  The less complex the legislation which makes it crystal clear that companies are to provide the information, the fewer difficulties there will be in acquiring it.  We have to go through those legal processes, make the legal demands of companies to provide us with the information and-----</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Ciaran Moore, helpline manager with Samaritans Ireland, and his colleague, Ms Louise Hamra, policy manager for Samaritans Ireland.  Both witnesses will be joining the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  The format of the meeting is such that I will invite our witnesses to make their opening statement which will then be followed by questions from members of the committee.  I remind members that they should raise a hand if they wish to speak.  We will not be using a speaking rota.  As our guests are probably aware, the committee will publish their opening statement on its website following the meeting.</p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statement, which is limited to three minutes, I will advise them of the following with regard to parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make her, him or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  As the witnesses are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, I ask them to note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  </p> <p>  With all of that housekeeping out of the way, I welcome our guests.  This is the way we do things now, that is to say, virtually.  We used to have people in the committee rooms.  Having said that, we make the most of it.  I thank the representatives for joining us today.  Their submission in respect of our pre-legislative scrutiny is very welcome.  Without further ado, I ask Mr. Moore to take the floor to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

As the Chair has mentioned, I am joined today by Ms Louise Hamra, our policy officer.  Samaritans is the only all-island, 24-hour emotional support helpline.  We have more than 2,000 volunteers in 21 branches, responding to approximately 1,500 calls for help every day.</p><p>We believe that every life lost to suicide is a tragedy and we work tirelessly to reach more people and make suicide prevention a priority.  As part of our vision that fewer people die by suicide, Samaritans Ireland has undertaken extensive research around best practices online and developed clear guidance on staying safe in the online environment.  These guidelines were co-designed by young people with lived experiences of self-harm and suicidal feelings and those with experience of supporting others at risk.</p><p> The Internet can be an invaluable resource for individuals experiencing self-harm and suicidal feelings.  However, it can also provide access to content that can be distressing and triggering.  In our written submission to the committee, we specifically examined the context in which suicide and self-harm exist within an online environment and the best ways to minimise these online harms without silencing or stigmatising those with lived experiences.  We would like to recommend that the following matters are considered and incorporated within the proposed legislation.</p><p> First, suicide and self-harm are complex and multifaceted, as are the recovery journeys, and what can be a trigger for one user could be helpful to another.  Understanding the potential risks and benefits to users is critical when determining what content should be removed.  We recommend the development of guidelines and policies to encourage safe posting and to also ensure that regulations around the removal of content are drafted in ways which will not further stigmatise those with self-harm or suicidal thoughts and experiences, or both.</p><p> Second, the prevalence and placement of harmful online content should be explicitly identified as a key risk of harm.  Measures should be included in the Bill requiring service providers to identify instances of inappropriate display or inappropriate prevalence of content with a risk of harm.  The introduction of ethical algorithms would allow for the minimisation of prolific consumption of difficult content.  The adoption of such policies could reduce so called doom scrolling and encourage help seeking without inhibiting individuals' rights to view public content.</p><p> Third, platforms should also consider how they can provide support and signposting to people who have already viewed distressing content online, and how to communicate sensitively with users whose content needs to be removed or edited.  Companies must take measures to protect and promote the well-being of all persons who moderate self-harm and suicide content and should be held accountable, both for their moderation policies and  for the support procedures in place for moderators.</p><p> Samaritans Ireland welcomes legislation for online safety and would encourage amending the Bill to specifically provide for the establishment of an adequately resourced online safety commissioner as part of the new media commission.  This measure would ensure the complexities around delineating harmful and helpful content relating to suicide and self-harm are appropriately managed with codes of practice being developed in consultation with experts.  I thank members for their time.  We are open to any questions.</p></speech>

For a number of decades, we had been providing guidance to broadcasters, journalists and editors in newspapers on how they would treat a story that would break.  We pointed out what types of things were helpful to say in a story and what types of things should be avoided.  Also, in dramas we would consult with the likes of "Eastenders", "Coronation Street" or "Fair City" if they covered these type of issues in a story.</p> <p>  The main difference between traditional media and broadcasting online is who one is talking to.  We can talk to the journalists and broadcasters and that decides what is broadcast whereas anybody can publish something online.  One of the things we are concerned about is that many of the people who publish things do not intend to cause harm.  They could be vulnerable themselves or talking about their experiences and it could be part of their therapeutic process.  Yet, other people receive this content and it can cause harm.  The scale of the material is different, who is publishing it and who one has to talk to in order to try to manage the environment is different and the dangers are different.  Harm could be caused to some of the people who are talking by stigmatising them and removing their content.  We put quite a lot of work into adapting our media guidelines and we are concerned that there has to be adaption in the way the regulation works from one sphere into the other.</p></speech>

I would like to pick up the conversation about ethical algorithms.  There is a quote from "The Social Dilemma" to the effect that the algorithm is convincing someone somewhere that the earth is flat.  I am guessing the witnesses agree that we need more transparency around the algorithms.  Can they talk about why the algorithms concern them in terms of suicide and suicide prevention?</p> <p>  Mr. Moore made a brief reference to the well-being of staff who moderate platforms and whether platforms should be accountable for the well-being of their staff and the supports they get.  Could the witnesses expand on that?</p></speech>

The Digital Services Act and some of the European legislation also contemplated this area.  One of the areas we are particularly concerned about is that a lot of the algorithms present content to increase engagement and younger people may not have the same awareness that they are going down a rabbit hole of particular types of material.  We know that in the UK there have been a number of cases of younger people who have died by suicide, and on examining their social media use, it has been heavily dominated by this type of material.  We have also undertaken research with the University of Bristol, which has looked at how people who have had suicidal ideation use the Internet.  We see that they initially use it in quite a targeted way to seek support or to look for something but in the period of distress they see a huge amount of content.  Much of that content tells them that if they watch this, they can also see something else.  It is important to interrupt these patterns.  A great deal of our research around ways to engage with people who are suicidal is about interrupting these circles of thought they have.  The online environment is dangerous because we are still looking for the most engaging content to be presented to people.</p> <p>  The issue of content moderators is related.  The people who will identify patterns of complaints will be the content moderators.  If parents are complaining that their child is seeing an awful lot of something, it is the content moderators who should be empowered to escalate that.  Samaritans Ireland has approximately 60 years of experience in looking after our volunteers.  We care for them and we have formal debrief procedures, informal peer support procedures and rotations so that they are not doing the same patterns all of the time.  That is partly for the mental health of our volunteers but it is also because they are better able to support others if they are not burned out and if they are in a better place.</p> <p>  In the past, we have brought some of this experience to bear.  We have been funded by the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, to work with other front-line staff with some of these techniques.  It is important that this is part of the experience of content moderators and that the regulation of this industry recognises that there is a specific health and safety risk around the mental health issue for the content moderators.  It should be regulated in that manner.  In the same way one would regulate an industry with toxic chemicals or health safety passes, this regulation should include this particular risk and it should be legislated for.  We have guidance on that issue, which Ms Hamra might talk about, as well as talking about the algorithms.</p></speech>

They essentially outline the ten best principles that should be adopted to make the Internet a safer place.</p><p>Regarding the moderators, our tenth principle is specifically concerned with looking after the well-being of people who come into contact, especially over an extended time, with this difficult content that involves aspects such as self-harm and suicide.  We are very aware of the profound impact that experience can have on these people and on their ability to appropriately moderate content.  It could mean that, in turn, things could fall through the net and content might become available on the Internet which would have been moderated if the moderators themselves had been in a better head space and able to limit the prevalence of such content.  </p><p> The algorithms are also referred to in our principles.  Mr. Moore mentioned that it even comes down to search terms.  We are lucky in the sense that some of the platforms have instigated measures whereby typing in certain keywords, such as "suicide" or any other problematic and potentially dangerous terms, will cause our or another helpline to immediately pop up.  Anyone searching that content, therefore, will know immediately that help is available to them.  Therefore, this is not only about minimising the amount of harmful content, but also about maximising knowledge regarding the supports which are available to people in this context and making those supports readily accessible at those times when people may be experiencing periods of difficult mental health.</p></speech>

I have experienced it, but I was never trained in this regard, unfortunately.  It is a serious situation and I thank the witnesses and their organisation for the work being done.  It saves lives every day of the week and it is really important.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  How important is it that individual complaint mechanisms should be included in this Bill?  I ask this because I attended a webinar yesterday in which Mr. Peter Tyndall, the Ombudsman, Dr. Karen McAuley, the head of policy-making for the Ombudsman for Children, and Ms Noeleen Blackwell, the chief executive officer of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, all participated.  It was chaired by Ms Jillian van Turnhout.  All those people insisted on the importance of an individual complaints mechanism, but it is not currently included in the Bill.  The point made was that making individual complaints possible might allow systematic occurrences in this regard to be observed.  The data could be extracted in that context and it would be very valuable to the bodies working in this area.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that aspect.</p> <p>  The witnesses also outlined how important signposting is for people who have viewed harmful content online.  Can more detail be given regarding how that process should work and what such a mechanism would look like?  In addition, what mental health and well-being supports do the witnesses think should be in place for the workers who must respond to reports of online abuse?  Often, the people on these platforms are just normal people like ourselves, but then they must deal with these difficult situations as well.</p></speech>

I will deal with the first and third of those questions, and then I will hand the query regarding signposting over to Ms Hamra.  She is our policy officer and will be aware of our stance on this matter.</p> <p>  We have had discussions with some of the other people who have looked at the independent complaints mechanism.  One key point is that the various kinds of content are very different.  For example, if we are talking about child abuse and-or image-based sexual abuse, those are illegal contents and the problem is that such content is not being taken down quickly enough.  The content that we deal with, however, is not illegal content that presents harm to specific users.  However, one of the things that concerns us regarding a potential complaints mechanism is how such complaints would be acted on and how content would be taken down.  I state that because often people posting material about self-harm, for example, or survivors talking about their own suicide attempts, are themselves very vulnerable.  We support the proposal, therefore, that there should be a mechanism to manage content online and we think there are different types of such content.  However, we also think that any such complaints mechanism must take account of the impact of how it will work and who will take down the material.  </p> <p>  The other aspect, and we have talked to several groups about this issue, concerns the scope of such a mechanism and who would be covered by it.  It is one thing to say that we can engage with getting material down off Facebook, but some of the content we see tends to be driven into very specific forums.  Therefore, it tends to be less visible and perhaps present in less regulated spaces.  In that regard, we would be a little concerned about whether it would be possible to get everywhere on the Internet to undertake this type of endeavour and also about the resulting impact.  We are supportive of the broad thrust of the arguments being made by the Children's Rights Alliance and other groups, but a great deal of detail is involved when we get to the level of considering differences between legal and illegal content and different websites.  </p> <p>  Turning to mental health supports, we believe some basic good practices that we have in place with our volunteers are important.  At the core of those is the ability to debrief.  I refer to a formal debrief at the end of a duty period.  If someone is particularly concerned about something, he or she can then say that and someone will be on hand to talk that through with the person concerned.  It is an element of peer support.  We understand that a great deal of this work is highly confidential, but we deliver a fully anonymous and confidential helpline.  To be able to do that, it is necessary to provide somewhere to allow people to talk about what they have experienced within that confidential sphere.  It would not be right for people in that situation to go home and tell others about what had happened to them, but those experiences will sit with the people concerned until they have been able to deal with them.  </p> <p>  Some aspects of this type of situation concern the work structure.  Training aspects are definitely involved and we give training to a whole range of people who take calls.  For example, we talk to the people who take calls for the Dublin Fire Brigade.  During the recent lockdown, we also engaged with several other groups that found it difficult and with staff who found it difficult to work from home while receiving these difficult calls.  I refer to groups that in the past might have provided more general supports, but that are now interacting with suicidal callers.  Much of the training in this regard involves learning how to deal with specific content, learning what the role itself involves and what it is okay to say in that regard.  That is where the issue of transferring on something arises.  </p> <p>  People are often looking at content of this nature and are shocked by it.  It is important that the environment in which those people work is supportive and that they are empowered to take space for themselves for the good of their own mental health and to escalate issues they have identified.  I state that because it is often these people who see the problems and we are asking them to clean up the Internet for us.  If they are working in an environment where they do not feel that they can report a problem, then that problem will remain and sit with those people.  I will hand over to Ms Hamra to address the issue of signposting.</p></speech>

The moderators in a team are likely to take the brunt of viewing this difficult content.  However, anyone else who might come into contact with that content should also receive the same type of well-being supports.  It should be ensured that there are check-ins and specialist training in this regard, for example.  The number of people who must see and moderate this type of problematic content in a work setting should be kept as small as possible.</p> <p>  Regarding signposting, I mentioned that some platforms have already adopted a mechanism whereby searching for certain keywords will automatically bring up our 116 123 helpline number for immediate support.  It is important that websites should also be signposting contact details for other emergency services and other supports, and especially more targeted supports which may be available 24-7.  Users should also be encouraged to contact trusted family members and friends.  The key point is that people are encouraged to reach out to someone, even if they do not feel the situation has reached the extent where the emergency services may be required.  People in these types of situations should be supported and encouraged to say something to someone.  </p></speech>

I thank Mr. Moore and Ms Hamra for being with us today, making their presentations and comprehensively answering our questions.</p><p>I wish to ask them a little about their explicit call for the measure to include or address the inappropriate display or prevalence of content with a risk of harm.

We felt this was the wrong approach.  For a start, these are not illegal harms, so the question of intent should not really arise because that is an idea in criminal law.  More significantly, however, the content quite often could be posted with good intentions.  It is a question of how it is used and how the harm is created.  We have a lot of experience of this and of testimonials and signage in specific places.  We engage with communities on putting up appropriate signage and so on.  We know that people quite often want to engage with content relating to suicide and want to put up helpful content, but they might say the wrong thing or put it in the wrong way.  What we have is a set of guidelines on how to assess the harm and identify the impact on people.  Quite often that impact is a question of how frequently people see the content.  We believe it is not necessarily the case that one piece of content or one post in itself is always wrong but rather that there should be restrictions on how it is spread around in order that potentially harmful posts or content can be identified.  That way, it stays within a friend circle and cannot be passed on further and a testimonial to a dead teenager or dead child can be there and be valued by that local community.  We know there are pages which collect these testimonials.  We would say, "Look at how impactful you would be if you were to consider this."  We think that that secondary use of some of the content is important to avoid.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Dillon and his wife on the birth of their new baby.  It is nice to hear some good news in Leinster House.  The meeting has been convened to consider Revised Estimates for Public Service 2021: Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media - Vote 33 - programme areas A, B, D and E, which were referred to the select committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I welcome the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Minister of State and their officials and thank them for their briefing document provided to us prior to the meeting.  The opening statements and any other documents submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p> <p>  As the Minister and Minister of State are present, officials should not speak in public session.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House or the convention centre to attend today's public meeting.  I cannot permit a member to attend when he or she does not adhere to that constitutional requirement.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask members to identify themselves when contributing to the debate for Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report so I ask members to mute their microphone when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.  I also ask members to use their raise their hand button when they wish to contribute and remind all those present to ensure their mobile phones are in silent mode or better again, switched off.  </p> <p>  To commence our discussion, I invite the Minister to make her presentation.

Employing many hundreds of thousands right across the country, these are the sectors that thrive when people congregate to enjoy time together and when local communities and businesses flourish.  All of them, however, have been dreadfully impacted by the restrictions imposed on our society during the pandemic.</p> <p>  Large parts of these sectors will be among the last to return to full operations as the country reopens.  Our cultural institutions and theatres, tourism destinations, hospitality businesses, sporting occasions, Gaeltacht communities and local media have endured great challenges since March of last year, yet these are the very sectors that have brought us light through the dark times and it has been demonstrated that without question, they are essential for our physical, social and mental well-being.</p> <p>  I am deeply conscious of the effects that measures taken in the interests of public health have had on businesses, in particular the hundreds of thousands of workers whose ability to make a living has been excruciatingly curtailed and for so long.  We should also recognise that these tough decisions have enabled all of us through collective action to protect the most vulnerable in our society and with the ongoing roll-out of the vaccination programme, we now find ourselves positioned where we can start to move on from the pandemic and focus our efforts on economic and social recovery.  Over the coming months, as the restrictions continue to ease and the vaccine programme continues its roll-out, we will see the safe and successful reopening of our society and with it, our tourism sector, arts and culture venues and events and the eventual welcoming back of fans to our sports grounds.</p> <p>  The 2021 Further Revised Estimates for my Department have been informed by ongoing engagement with sectoral representatives.  The additional funding is providing for a strong suite of significant measures as a robust and targeted response to this crisis.  It it will support resilience and recovery and ensure that Ireland can prosper once more on the global stage in the fields of tourism, culture, sport and linguistic heritage.  These sectors, individually and cumulatively, are an integral part of the fabric of our society, most particularly in rural and regional areas where they support economic activity and physical and societal well-being.  Well-being is a core principle underpinning the living with Covid plan and it will be fundamental to public confidence and resilience as we emerge from and manage the crisis over the longer term.</p> <p>  Total 2021 funding for the sectors supported by my Department is as follows.  There will be &euro;220.9 million for tourism services, including a &euro;55 million support fund for strategic tourism businesses and &euro;5 million for training and digitalisation support in the sector.  These measures are complementary to the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Covid restrictions support schemes and the restart scheme.  Thus far, three phases of the tourism business continuity schemes have been launched aimed at improving the competitiveness and viability of businesses in the sector.  I also launched a &euro;17 million outdoor dining enhancement scheme being delivered in partnership between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and local authorities across the country.  This scheme is providing funding for tourism and hospitality business to develop and increase their own outdoor seating capacity and is providing funding to local authorities to develop permanent outdoor public dining spaces in towns and urban centres similar to those that exist in various European cities.  In addition, the tourism sector has been able to avail of cross-Government supports, including the reduction in the VAT rate, which was recently extended to September 2022; the Covid restrictions support scheme and the rates waiver extension, representing a significant cross-Government response to the existential impact of Covid-19.</p><p> Total funding for the arts and culture sector in 2021 is &euro;341 million, an increase of 74% compared with the initial allocation in budget 2020.  The additional funding provides for a 2021 allocation of &euro;130 million for the Arts Council, an increase of 24% on 2020.  This additional investment empowers the Arts Council to help artists, arts workers and arts organisations come through this crisis and play their part in the national recovery.  Significant support is also being provided for live entertainment in the amount of &euro;50 million.  This funding has allowed for &euro;25 million to fund a new live performance support scheme, &euro;14 million for a new support scheme for live entertainment businesses, &euro;5 million to support local authorities for outdoor live performances, &euro;5 million capital supports for the live entertainment sector and &euro;1 million to fund the St. Patrick's Festival.</p><p> There is provision for &euro;8 million to facilitate the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall.  This will be a significant step towards the objective of enabling the orchestra to be established as a world-class orchestra that will, with the National Concert Hall, provide a creative and imaginative programme strategy that will greatly enhance the offering of the combined organisation to the public.</p><p> The audiovisual industry was been one of the success stories of 2020, with on-screen success in the form of "Normal People" but also its track record in maintaining output in the face of Covid-19.  I am, therefore, very pleased to be able to increase Screen Ireland&rsquo;s funding by &euro;6 million to &euro;30.1 million in 2021.  Funding of &euro;280.5 million will be provided for media and broadcasting in 2021 in recognition of the critical communication role of this sector during the current crisis.  An additional &euro;3.5 million is being provided to TG4 and the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall outlined earlier will also have reciprocal benefits for RT&Eacute; and is evidence of the synergies that can be brought to bear with the culture and broadcasting and media sectors now part of the same brief.</p><p> I am satisfied the increased allocation for my Department in 2021 of &euro;1.092 billion allows for the continuation and enhancement of its very diverse but critical work programmes.  As Minister, I intend to do everything possible to ensure that as we emerge from the shadow of Covid-19, we will have a world-renowned tourism industry, a vibrant arts and culture sector, a dynamic sports and media sector and a landscape in which our language and our engagement with it can continue to grow.  I thank the committee and I will now hand over to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, to speak about the Further Revised Estimate for 2021 as it relates to sport.</p></speech>

Within this, the 2021 provision allows for a new round of the sports capital programme.  In addition, resources have been provided in 2021 to progress the first projects allocated funding under the new large-scale sport infrastructure fund.  Current funding support for Sport Ireland programmes totals &euro;91.91 million, enabling Sport Ireland to ensure our athletes are supported to achieve their potential at the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, to ensure core grant funding for our sporting bodies to sustain them through the challenging months to come and to fund Sport Ireland participation programmes.</p> <p>  This is a very considerable investment in sport.  The funding will allow grant funding for our sporting bodies to sustain them through this challenging period and I know clubs across the country have welcomed the sports capital programme, while the increase in dormant accounts funding will promote and sustain participation in sport and physical activity, particularly in hard to reach communities.

However, he rightly pointed out the importance of marketing the establishment of connectivity to make it very clear that Ireland has reopened.  We are very much moving into that space from next week.  Tourism Ireland launched a new &euro;3.5 million promotional campaign on 7 June.  Phase 1 of that involves a major digital video campaign, which went live from 7 June with the slogan, "Let's get back to Ireland".  That is definitely the message we want.  We hope that online video will build anticipation for holidays in Ireland this summer.</p> <p>  From my engagement with Tourism Ireland, it is quite clear that there is pent-up demand to come here and we are tapping into that.  Tourism Ireland also hopes to launch the next phase of the campaign in the coming weeks in line with Government plans for the reopening of international travel.  This will deliver a very clear "book now" message to prospective international visitors and will single-mindedly drive visitor numbers back to Ireland.  It is clearly stated in the national economic recovery plan that supports will remain in place for sectors as they need them.  We are acutely aware that more supports will be needed after the summer period.</p></speech>

Unprecedented funding, for the first time, of &euro;50 million for the events and commercial music sectors brought total funding of the Arts Council to &euro;130 million.

I presume we will get it.  The scheme has been very well received.  One positive out of all this is that the reopening of outdoor dining and activity is reimagining our cities and many areas in rural Ireland, including those the Chair represents in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency.  It is breathing life into our towns and villages, which is a positive.  The only feedback I have received has been through personal interaction, where the scheme has been very well received.</p></speech>

I compliment the Minister on the significant investment in, and advancement of, the Arts Council, which was needed prior to the pandemic.  Funding increased to a historic &euro;130 million and that has been very useful and helpful to the Arts Council in supporting artists who have seen 15 or 18 months of their work schedule wiped out.  For the future, I encourage the Minister to ensure that supports not only remain but are enhanced in any way possible for organisations like the Arts Council because the artists it is supporting have no other forms of income.  It is their umbrella organisation, their peace and security, their stability and their future.  It is critical that the Arts Council is supported by the highest possible financial means into the future.  That is more a comment than a statement.  I wanted to compliment the Minister on that.</p></speech>

I am very conscious of that as we move into budget 2022 negotiations.  I thank the Deputy and Chair for their kind words.  I am very aware of the difference the funding has made as I go into these negotiations.</p> <p>  As I have said, the film industry that has managed to do very well under awful circumstances.  In budget 2021, Screen Ireland was allocated an additional &euro;9 million over and above its 2020 allocation.  This increased funding has helped to address significant levels of feature film production delay and will assist with costs relating to the implementation of health and safety protocols.  Much of the groundwork for the success of the audiovisual sector in Ireland was laid in recent years, for example through the launch of the audiovisual action plan in 2018.  The budget 2021 announcements addressed two key elements of that action plan: the regional film development uplift, which will see the enhanced tax credit of 5% in place for an additional year, and the announcement that work will now commence on the development of a tax credit for the digital gaming sector.  Again, I am acutely aware, but it is no harm saying it on this platform, that this funding has made a difference.  I am aware of that as I go into the budget negotiations.  I place a high value on both sectors.</p></speech>

The live performance support scheme was recently announced.  I spoke to the Minister about the live entertainment business scheme.  All of that is very welcome and very much needed.  We have had numerous eyewitness accounts from organisations that have come before us to talk about the devastation for them and the uncertainty as to when they will get back to work.  The scheme is welcome.</p> <p>  Has the Department carried out any analysis on the spread of that nationally in terms of areas that were and were not successful?  I am mindful of the fact that in more urban areas, there could be a tendency to have more applications.  Has there been any analysis of an even geographical spread or any feedback on that?</p></speech>

A total of 237 applicants received funding under the &euro;25 million scheme.  That funding ranged from small to large venues, encompassed producers and promoters and supported live events in every county, including festivals, concerts, theatre productions, comedy and outdoor events.  While there appears to have been talk of disappointment from certain counties, we would have to consider how many applications we actually received from them.  Every county got a grant and we will keep that under review.</p> <p>  Similar to tourism, I am aware of the impact that social distancing has had on this industry and its viability.  In the national economic recovery plan, it is stated that the industry will remain supported.  If the Chair has any specific queries, I ask her to bring them to my attention offline and I will be happy to talk to her about them.</p></speech>

I want to compliment the Minister and the work she has done on having those events that have taken place outdoors.  It has been great to see them.  I did not get to attend anything yet but there have been concert events in the Phoenix Park and Kilmainham.  I have listened to a lot of commentators and observations since that.  Huge kudos to the Minister for getting trial events up and running.</p> <p>  The question will be whether it is sustainable financially in terms of the cost of running events like that and the extra layers of costs due to social distancing and health and other guidelines that have to be adhered to.  Has the Department carried out any analysis of the sustainability and extra cost output that it will create for live events across the country if they are to proceed in that manner?</p></speech>

For example, the event in Iveagh Gardens was the first ever event after a period of complete closure.  Even that was about the logistics of entry and exit, managing social distancing and how we are living with Covid.  Things started at that basic level.  As the Chair can see, things are moving further and further.  It is essential that we have these events.</p> <p>  A range of indoor and outdoor events are taking place across the country.  Consideration is being given to further pilot events but the key factor in determining these events will be the need to generate data and the operational guidance to support the resumption of financially viable live performances.  It is likely that live performance support scheme, LPSS, supported events may be considered for future pilot events in the coming weeks, as well as further events supported by the Arts Council. </p> <p>  Like the Chair and every member of the committee, we all want a return to an economically viable live performance as soon as possible.  There are many reasons to be optimistic.  The roll-out of the vaccination programme is the most important factor underpinning our hopes of what may be possible.  This week at Cabinet, I notified my colleagues that I want further detailed advice on how we can get a return to live music at outdoor licensed premises and indoor licensed premises.  I want that return to happen as soon as possible and notified my Cabinet colleagues of that.  I am writing to seek that advice. </p> <p>  In terms of what it will take to reopen things safely, I want to know that and plan for and do it as soon as possible.  Lead-in times are required.  It is not as simple as pressing an on or off button and suddenly opening doors, as the Chair will know from her involvement in this sector.  We are working on it. </p></speech>

I want to congratulate him on the progress he has made to date on a number of important issues, in particular the issue of ladies Gaelic players, as well as a number of other issues.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the new local round of sports capital funding.  I am not sure how familiar the Minister of State is with the New Testament but the loaves and fishes come to mind when one considers the &euro;200 million ask and the &euro;40 million budget available.  Given the level of funding and demand there is bound to be disappointment unless additional funding is secured for the programme.  Is the Minister of State working on trying to secure additional funding?  How is that looking?  Is funding for the new round of sports capital allocations likely to be increased?</p></speech>

As he said, we have had a record number of applications.  Over 3,000 applications have sought over &euro;200 million.  As he said, the allocation currently apportioned is about &euro;40 million.  There are two parts to this process, as the Deputy knows from his previous role.  There is the equipment-only part first, which we hope to process pretty quickly.  We hope to announce equipment-only grants in the next couple of weeks.  They are currently being finalised.</p> <p>  The sports capital or mixed applications we hope to have ready in mid to late autumn.  Between now and then we will seek to increase funding to ensure delivery to many communities and have appropriate allocations that go above the &euro;40 million figure.  We will engage with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The national development plan process is ongoing and is due to conclude in quarter 3.  Between our direct discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the national development plan, we will look to increase that beyond the &euro;40 million allocation.</p></speech>

Following on from Deputy Griffin's analysis of the situation, we all know that capital grants are very important.  Very often they involve all-weather pitches, which are invaluable in our climate.  An increase in funding is needed.  As the Minister of State is aware, these are very good projects.  In my area, a new hockey pitch is being developed.  There are some great hockey players in the area, who have played in all-Ireland competitions, have won medals and so forth.  What is the possibility of there being an increase in funding?</p></speech>

Obviously to what extent that will happen is still to be determined, as the Deputy knows.  The dual process involves the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the national development plan.</p><p>Deputy Griffin was Minister of State previously.  It obviously increased from the baseline closer to when the allocations were made.  As Deputy Mythen said, there are many good projects across communities that need State backing.  With a demand of &euro;200 million and a current allocation of &euro;40 million, we will be looking to increase that.  We will be able to give certainty on that in the autumn, closer to when the allocations and announcements will be made.  That will be mid to late autumn, so there is some time yet to work through that with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, the broader position of this Government on capital, as part of the recovery, is focused on regional employment, getting people back to work and promoting recovery.  The capital is very important.  Sports capital hits every community in every corner of the country and has positive regional employment benefits as well as long-term benefits around participation in sport.  That has to be underpinned with backing, and we will be seeking to increase it beyond the &euro;40 million baseline so more projects will be captured in the coming years.</p></speech>

I was going to ask if this was predominantly taken up with the sports allocation grants, but the Minister of State said there is &euro;40 million for that.  He also acknowledged that there is a record number of applications.  As Deputy Griffin knows, there is a record number of applications year on year and many do not qualify.  I am curious.  The Minister of State said he intends to do it, but I would imagine he would have put a little more focus on it at this stage and be able to give us the figure, given that he already knows there is a record number of applications and the number of clubs and sporting organisations the length and breadth of the State that are waiting on this funding and, more importantly, depending on it.</p></speech>

The applications only closed in March, and we extended it to facilitate as many clubs as possible to apply.  What we are doing currently is working through the equipment-only part of the application process.  I am confident when that is announced the Deputy will see a very generous allocation on the equipment side.  A massive amount of clubs across the country will benefit from that.  That is one side of the scheme, and that will be positively responded to by both me and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.</p> <p>  On the sports capital side, we have had engagement and direct conversations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his Department on the sports capital allocation generally.  As there are more than 3,000 applications, we are working through that assessment process.  We have a broader national development plan review as well, which will set the trajectory of capital over the coming years.  However, we are all on the one page as regards trying to back as many good projects across our communities as possible, and I am confident there will be a significant increase on the current baseline.  That is obviously subject to finalisation through the NDP and ongoing discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but these applications still have to be assessed.  It will be mid to late autumn before we will be announcing anything anyway, so there is a little space.  I am not going to mislead the committee and give a projected figure until that is finalised and decided.  I will just say I am confident it will increase beyond the current baseline.</p></speech>

Since 2017, the arts and culture budget was increased by &euro;124.5 million while the Gaeltacht budget was only increased by &euro;16.5 million in the same period.  As a result, bodies such as Foras na Gaeilge and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta are being further disadvantaged compared to their English-language counterparts in culture promotion and regional development.  Will the Minister attempt to address this inequality in future budgets?</p></speech>

The Estimates for the Gaeltacht are now taken by a separate committee chaired by the Deputy's colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  We dealt with the Estimates for the Gaeltacht.  We have a new strategy for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and there were significant increases in funding for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta over the last 24 months, particularly in respect of the impact of Brexit and Covid-19.  The new strategy for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is about trying to give the prospect of regional employment for young people and backing enterprises across Gaeltacht areas.  We can send the committee details on that.  However, if one looks at the comparative breakdown, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has received significant support.  I outlined that in the Estimates process for that committee when I appeared before it in the last week or so.</p></speech>

We are now dealing with the political side with the Minister of State responsible for the area, Deputy Ossian Smyth.  On behalf of the committee I welcome the Minister of State and Mr. Barry Lowry, Government chief information officer at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  All witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity and they are directed to discontinue their remarks, it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceeding as witnesses physically present do.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should also be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit a member to participate if he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member participating via Teams, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, to confirm he or she in on the grounds of the Leinster House campus or the convention centre campus.</p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting online or Oireachtas Members or witnesses accessing this meeting remotely online, only I, as Chair, and the necessary staff essential to the running of the committee are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances, a large of number of people are attending the meeting remotely.  I ask for everyone's forbearance should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  I now call the Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Barry Lowry, the Government chief information officer.  He also attended the meeting yesterday.</p> <p>  As the committee knows, I am a Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my various responsibilities include eGovernment.  It is on this basis that I recently agreed to take on responsibility for the issue of the EU digital Covid certificate.  I am aware the committee had a long and detailed session yesterday with various senior officials and is now developing a good understanding of the extent and scale of the technical and logistical challenge we faced in this programme.  Therefore, I will try to use my opening remarks to develop, where possible, what Ms Liz Canavan said yesterday.</p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the EU digital Covid certificate regulation entered into application on 1 July 2021.  It was developed to facilitate the safe free movement of citizens in the EU during the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is proof, in digital or paper format, that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, received a negative test result recently before travel or recovered from Covid-19.  The recovery certificate is valid for 180 days from the time a person tested positive for Covid.  Providing a certificate for each of these episodes has required a slightly different process, which I will explain later.</p><p>While the digital Covid certificate is not a travel document or a passport, it will help people to travel safely within the EU and EEA during the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is not a prerequisite to travel.  You do not have to have a digital Covid certificate to travel within the EU.  The EU digital Covid certificate, DCC, programme in Ireland has been developed by a senior cross-departmental group chaired by the Taoiseach's Department.  I congratulate that group and its staff on the success achieved to date.  My Department, through the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, is responsible for the technical component of EU DCC production.<br/><br/>The European Commission has built a gateway through which all certificate signatures can be verified across the EU.  Each member state is responsible for, first, maintaining connectivity to the gateway and, second, ensuring the gateway holds the correct QR code key for each country, which means it has been signed with what is called a private key that each country owns.  This is required to enable one country to verify the digital Covid certificates produced by other member states.  Third, each member state is responsible for ensuring it updates its trust lists frequently.  This is an important part of the process.  A trust list allows one country to verify the QR code of another and to verify that code in the context of the admittance rules for the country of destination.  For example, someone travelling from Ireland on a certificate based on an antigen test would fail if the country of destination did not accept antigen tests as being sufficient.  Ireland currently only accepts PCR tests for admission with regard to quarantine rules.  The EU recommendation is to download the trust list every six hours, which Ireland does.  We then ensure the verifier app, which the committee heard about yesterday, refreshes every time it is opened.  This creates the capability to verify another member state&rsquo;s certificates.  In Ireland, we do this through our verifier app, which is already in operation.<br/><br/>This all means we have one of the most robust implementations of the digital Covid certificate across Europe.  On 30 June, Ireland connected to the EU digital Covid certificates gateway.  This was a milestone, as I have explained, in helping ensure that, first, the digital Covid certificates issued in Ireland are recognised by authorities in other EU member states and, second, that Ireland can verify digital Covid certificates for travellers arriving from other EU member states and apply the public health rules associated with those digital Covid certificates.<br/><br/>The session yesterday gave a sense of the wider programme.  I will focus on the technical solution.  This involves several bodies working together, and I thank them all for their commitment and hard work to date.  First, I will talk about vaccination certificates.  The HSE produces a batch of files of data for processing.  In line with GDPR, each file contains only the data required for certificate production.  A batch file can be either for email or print and post.  This is done by examining the email field in the record.  If that field is set to null, we know the certificate is to be posted.  The second step is that each record in the batch is converted into a certificate by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and its partner organisation.  A series of validation processes are completed and, once everything is checked, the batch is sent either to Revenue for print and post or to the OGCIO cloud email server.  The final step is the certificate is issued by Revenue for next day post or the cloud email server for imminent delivery.<br/><br/>For recovery certificates, the first step of the process is different.  It is a pull instead of push process.  It is done on request rather than by a pre-emptive sending of the recovery certificates.  The reason for this is that when the HSE was informed of a positive Covid case, it collected information for the purpose of track and trace, not for production of a future recovery certificate.  Consequently, where an individual has been tested as positive by the HSE within 180 days and is reliant on recovery rather than vaccination for the digital Covid certificate, he or she can contact the helpline, which will verify the caller&rsquo;s ID and collect the remaining required information, including valid email address.  From then on, the steps for issuing recovery certificates are the same as for vaccination certificates.<br/><br/>If you are not vaccinated and have not recovered from Covid, the last option is to get tested shortly before the journey and show you are negative, unlike the recovery certificate, which says the holder is positive.  This process is different as we use, and will continue to use, private testing for the purpose of safe travel.  In other words, the Government is not the data controller.  What is different now is the State&rsquo;s obligation under the regulation to produce a certificate for a negative test.  Technically speaking, we use a similar approach to that with the HSE.  We use an application programming interface, API, to receive the data from the private tester and then return a certificate for each test to the tester for issuance to the customer.  It is essential the tester accepts responsibility for ID verification, correct testing, accurate data input and the security and data management of its end of the process.<br/><br/>Consequently, approved access to the EU digital Covid test certificate service is contingent on test providers being compliant with the relevant national and EU regulations in respect to SARS-CoV-2 testing, associated public health measures, and the standards and obligations detailed in the standard operating procedure.  The detailed instructions for how this will work were posted on <i>gov.ie</i>last Friday.  Prior to receiving access to the EU digital Covid test certificate service for test certificate generation, providers are required to review and digitally sign the standard operating procedure and return it by email to an address given on <i>gov.ie</i>, <i>digitalcovidcerts.business@per.gov.ie</i>.  The first engagements with responders are already beginning to happen.<br/><br/>As was mentioned yesterday, it is hoped an upgraded version of the Covid tracker app will be available next week.  This will not be necessary to use the digital Covid certificate; it is simply to allow people to upload their certificate, whether paper or PDF, to a wallet on their phone if that is their preference rather than carrying it around on a sheet of paper.  The Covid tracker app serves as a pandemic response tool and provides a number of functions, including exposure notification, information platform and the check-in function.  These are independent of each other.  I repeat what was said yesterday: it will be possible for people to disable these features and use the tracker solely as a digital wallet to store their digital Covid certificate on their phone, should they wish to do so.<br/><br/>Data governance has been the subject of ongoing engagement with the Data Protection Commission to ensure the process is fully compliant with GDPR regulations.  The HSE and the Department of Health are the joint data controllers, the OGCIO is a data processor, and Revenue is a subprocessor.  The requisite data controller and data processing agreements are in place for any data transfers in respect of the generation of vaccination-related certificates.  All other requisite processor and subprocessor agreements will be in place prior to any transfer of data.<br/><br/>I hope this statement helps to build upon the information provided by Liz Canavan and the senior officials&rsquo; group yesterday.  I reiterate that the primary focus throughout the planning and delivery of this programme has been to fulfil our EU obligations in a robust and effective way, including operability by 1 July in the context of EU compliance and delivery of certificates to eligible members of the public in line with Government&rsquo;s proposed lifting of restrictions on non-essential travel on 19 July.  In doing so, we have had to be mindful of developing the certificate in a way which provides the greatest assurance, in line with data protection, as regards sensitive personal information.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for being here.  Credit is due to him and his team because recent weeks have been dogged by almost daily speculation that this would not happen.  Today, 1 million digital Covid certificates are on their way out to people by post or email.  Well done.</p> <p>  I will put a number of questions.  The first is on the batching of files.  Whether you have been to the local GP, pharmacy or mass vaccination centre, will the Minister of State clarify how batching works?  Is it at the end of each day the files are referred on or a couple of days later?  People are now looking at that kind of detail as they prepare to book holidays or fly.  They want to know they have gone out in a batch.</p><p>What turnaround time would apply to each batch upon arrival at the Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.755" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021071400002#C00200"><p>The question is whether the batching of files, particularly from pharmacies and GPs, happens at the end of each day.  Initially, we are sending out all of the files for all the people who are vaccinated.  In other words, we are sending out everything from the history of everybody who has been vaccinated since the start of the year - the entire programme.  From the middle of this week onwards, we will be collecting the new people who have been vaccinated from the day before and we will be sending that out as a daily job.  In terms of how long it is going to take, I will double-check with Mr. Lowry, the chief information officer.  We have two processes.  Under one process we take a huge section of all the people who have ever been vaccinated, divide that into slices in order that we can take the data a chunk at a time and send it out.  We are coming to the end of that process.  We then move towards a daily update whereby each day we take a batch of data.  I will ask  Mr. Lowry to confirm how long it actually takes after that.  For example, if a person is vaccinated next Monday, how long would he say it is going to take before we can send him or her an email or letter?</p></speech>

We are reliant, first of all, on the GP or the pharmacist because he or she must upload the data.  Both have electronic provisions in place with the HSE so they can upload the data.  Once it is uploaded, the HSE transfers it from the existing COVAX system over to what it call the data lake.  The HSE carries out a data quality check on it and it is from there it creates the batch.  We have not gone through the end-to-end business-as-usual process, as we call it, because we have totally focused on the backlog but we are hoping in the same the day the HSE can collate that data and produce a batch file.  If that batch file is produced overnight then, depending on whether it is email or post, it will be out within either one to two working days or three to four working days.</p></speech>

Those payments are made after they have submitted the data so there is an incentive for the health professional to send in their data as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.758" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021071400002#C00500"><p>I have a few other questions.  When this was first being designed there was just the international travel dimension to it but now it very much looks like it will also have a purpose here on the domestic front.  Specifically with regard to restaurants, bars, etc., the Minister of State's referred to the verifier app and that each gateway will hold a correct QR code key for each country.  Not every European country will have a digital certificate operating on a dual-capacity basis.  People who work in airports typically handle very sensitive data from passports to immigration control documents.  What level of training will be supplied to people in a local bar or restaurant, beyond holding a verifier app and beeping a QR code?  I note data will not be retained but will the Minister of State give any assurances that sensitive data that typically will be present in the realm of an airport will not necessarily appear on screen down in your local pub when you are ordering your pint and starter?  What level of training will there be?  What assurances can the Minister of State give the public that what we will have in a local pub or restaurant is quite a separate thing from what we would typically have in an airport?  I would like the Minister of State to deal with that, if he does not mind.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.759" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021071400002#C00600"><p>I will start by describing the information that is on the certificate.  Many members will have received theirs already and will see it just contains one's first and last name, one's date of birth and the dose of vaccine one has received and the dates on which they were received.  There is not any information beyond that; that is the extent of the information.</p> <p>  My role in this, technically, was to be responsible for ensuring the certificates got issued, that is, that they got printed or electronically generated with barcodes.  The intention was that they would be used for international travel.  A new decision came out of Cabinet on Monday that we would use them for another purpose, namely, entry for indoor dining in restaurants and pubs.  How that is going to work in practice is being worked out this week between the hospitality sector, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Ministers involved, which, I guess, are those with responsibility for tourism and enterprise.  I do not think they have asked us for assistance with that.  They are planning to use the certificates because they have been sent out, whether they are in electronic form on a phone or in paper form.  At this stage, I do not know what they are going to do because I am not involved in that project.  I guess it is a tourism and hospitality question and something the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, or the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, might be better placed to answer questions about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.760" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021071400002#C00700"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  I appreciate that he does not have the answer to that today, but it is essential because beyond serving up a pint and packets of peanuts and getting dinners on tables, people who run pubs and restaurants need to know this is pretty much bombproof and simple to practice.  They need an awful lot there.  They are now gearing up for reopening which everyone really welcomes but this just a layer of anxiety they should not have in the coming days.</p> <p>  How much has all this cost?  I ask because this is something that has been scrambled and put together very quickly, though very successfully.  The Minister of State mentioned partner organisations in his presentation so I am wondering how much has this cost to date.  I am sure there will be ongoing operational costs.  On a final point, I raise the wait time in airports.  We have seen in the UK there have been considerable delays in the London airports in particular.  Yesterday we had departmental officials before us, including Mr. Lowry.  I was concerned because, if I understood them correctly, a person will be asked to present his or her Covid certificate at the departure gate.  By then, a person will have gone through baggage drop-off, check-in, passport or border control, duty free and probably had a cup of coffee.  The person has gone all the way through the concourse of the airport but he or she is only showing this all-important certificate literally before he or she goes through the doorway to get aboard the plane.  I am wondering about wait times.  Has the Minister of State factored them in?  Is the point of departure the best place to read it or should it nearly be kerbside?  Kerbside check-in was introduced in the US years ago.  It is very efficient.  Just before you enter the concourse, you prove you are safe to fly in one of the three ways, namely, by being vaccinated, recovered or tested.  It would be better to do it early on in that process.  The Minister of State might clarify that and also go through the costings to date and the projected ongoing costing for the implementations of this.</p></speech>

The project is split between different Departments.  The Department of Justice is in charge of the immigration desks in the airports, the Department of Transport runs the ports and the airports, the Department of Health is producing the vaccination data and the Department of Foreign Affairs has an interest in any kind of foreign travel.  Then there is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, at which I am based, which is actually generating and issuing the certificates.  Between them, the Departments I have listed would have costs.  It is all co-ordinated by the Department of An Taoiseach, under the officials who appeared before the committee yesterday.  I do not have costs from all those Departments.  I think it is a very good question-----</p></speech>

Obviously, the process has not been completed, but we think the cost will ultimately run to approximately &euro;500,000 for the Department.  The EU has promised it has promised it will make a donation to countries for national costs.  The biggest cost will run to the Revenue because it has had a team on since last Friday and it was also involved in the preparation.  Revenue staff are working extra hours because they have a huge workload regardless of this need.  They will be sending out something approaching 1 million letters and that is before we get into a steady state.  That is 1 million letters for next-day delivery and the labour cost of that to the State will be substantial.</p><p>This is an EU regulation so as the Minister of State said in his opening remarks, we have no choice but to apply it as efficiently as we can.  Where we did not have email addresses for people, we simply had to post the certificates to them.</p></speech>

Is he, as Deputy Cathal Crowe inquired, looking at alternatives to get people through quicker, such as doing it at the kerbside?</p></speech>

Ideally, it would be at the point where a person gets the electronic passenger locator form or at online check-in.  The worst case would be where everybody is being checked at the destination country and lines are building up at immigration.  The intention is that everybody will be checked pre-departure but there will only be spot checks at the immigration desk at the destination airport.  Those are the two lines of checks.  In the same way that the carriers check passports or visas because passengers leave, since they do not want to bring passengers to a destination where they are not accepted, they will also check Covid status.  With that in mind, the agency has been working with the carriers and ferry companies and has been on site with them in the past weeks to work out a practical way for this to work.  The Chairman has invited me to give a written description of this and I am happy to submit that.</p></speech>

What he said is logical and sensible.  However, it is at odds with what we were told yesterday, that this would be at departure gates.  What the Minister of State has just said and the Commission has recommended makes sense.  To think that you could spend an hour and a half weaving your way through an airport without being asked to present this digital certificate until you are at the departure gate is-----</p></speech>

We had a productive meeting yesterday with good engagement.  We got a lot of information.  I compliment the Minister of State for the role that he has played in this and for coming before our committee today.  Yesterday, officials explained that they expected maybe 1% of the emails would bounce back.  A significant volume has been produced at this stage.  Have any particular difficulties been encountered up to now?  Were there any glitches?  Is it on track?  Does the Minister of State think targets will be reached this week?</p></speech>

I just got the latest information before the committee meeting.  We have sent 984,000 emails so far.  Of those, 7,500 have bounced, which is a rate of 0.76%.  When there is a database of emails and more than 99% are delivering, that is an incredibly high-quality set of data.  That is probably because most people who put in an email did it through the portal where they had to confirm their email and click on the link.  When you write down an email on a form, it is not quite as good.  We have good quality email data and I am happy with that bounce rate.  It means that 7,500 people will presumably contact the call centre looking for this to be reissued.  We will facilitate them.  Did Deputy Carey have another question that I missed?</p></speech>

We have sent 984,000 emails out of a total of about 1 million.  So far, we have posted out 350,000 letters.  We had approximately 900,000 of those to send.  I will defer to Mr. Lowry in case he has any more up-to-date information than I have.  We are ahead of schedule on the emails and are sending them faster than we expected.  How about the letters?  Does Mr. Lowry expect that we will have them all out by the end of the week?</p></speech>

We are into the fifth day of processing.  It reckons that by the end of today, there will be 350,000.  It will try to maintain the current progress and to ramp it up over the weekend so that we can get at least 90% of the certificates posted and most of them received in households by next Monday.  As Liz Canavan said yesterday, there might be a backlog that goes into Tuesday and Wednesday, but everything will be done to try to minimise that as much as possible.  There is always a risk, with this degree of processing, of machine failure.  There was a power cut on Sunday.  These things do happen.  That is why we are being slightly cautious with the figures that we announce because all of this is dependent on a fair wind and what we know the machines and teams are capable of all being achievable, with no other incidents that affect it.</p></speech>

For people who would not be digitally minded, can it be made easier for the public to use it and upload from the certificate that people get in the post?  Will the Minister of State describe how someone would upload that?  Will it be made easier?  What would the Minister of State advise?  Will a video be posted online to show people what to do?</p></speech>

We were not planning to put up a video but if the Deputy thinks it would help, we can definitely look into it.  There will be a simple email with a PDF file attached.  You can print that out or if you have a smartphone, you can click on it and the barcode will come up which can be used in the airport.  If you receive a letter instead of an email because we do not have your email address, then you will receive a sheet of paper which can be scanned in an airport in the same way as a boarding pass is scanned.  If you need to go to the airport with your boarding pass, you can either bring it on your phone or on a piece of paper.  I would always bring the paper as well, in my bag, in case my phone ran out of battery, was not working or went blank at the desk.  It makes sense to keep it.  I stated earlier that the Covid tracker application is being updated next week to give it the capability of storing one of these digital Covid certificates on your phone.  I think that more than 1 million people have downloaded the application.  They will be able to put this into the application and always have it handy even if they do not have the sheet of paper.  If it is being used for other domestic purposes, that could make sense as well.</p> <p>  We will watch what comes into the call centre.  The common problems that come into the call centre will feed back into the next roll-out to make sure that those problems do not arise.</p><p>If people are confused by something, or if they need more information, we will put that into the next version.</p></speech>

This has been helpful.  I have a couple of questions about private testing facilities that conduct polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing and antigen testing.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that there is sufficient engagement with those facilities?  Does he think that all of the private testing providers will engage with and adopt this system?  Has the uptake been slow or fast?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.786" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021071400002#E00500"><p>To go over this again, I will answer Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s question directly.  A number of labs have engaged with us.  So far, 25 different testing services have contacted us to seek permission to issue digital Covid certificates.  Three of those have been accepted in full so far.  Seven are partially accepted.  That is the progress so far with those labs and testing services.  A person will go to his or her testing service for a PCR or antigen test.  The service will verify the person&rsquo;s identity, which is an important part of its job.  The service has to carry out the test with a trained professional.  It has to comply with the standard operating procedure, SOP, that was written by the Department of Health to satisfy the Government that it meets the technical and medical standards required.  As well as this, it have to satisfy the Government that it will not, for example, issue certificates with the wrong name on them, and so on.  At that point, it will be empowered to connect to our servers.  It can issue a generated QR code for each person, as he or she receives his or her negative test.  It can then issue the digital Covid certificate to the recipient.  The rules of the digital Covid certificate scheme say the PCR test must be carried out within 72 hours of arrival at the destination.  The testing services will, therefore, only be useful three days before 19 July 2021.  For an antigen test, the test must be 48 hours before arrival.  It will, therefore, only be this weekend that the testing services will issue the first digital Covid certificates.  Over the previous months, we have tested a number of pilot testing services to make sure that they can generate these digital Covid certificates, and that all is working.  I am, therefore, confident that there will be no problem.</p></speech>

I would raise a few points on that.  We should get as close to the 25 testing centres, which is as close as we can to 100% capacity.  People should be aware that if they avail of a private testing facility that does not engage with the DCC scheme, that may have implications.  People do not necessarily have to have a DCC certificate to travel; they can still travel with the paper form, or with a form that indicates that they have had a negative appropriate test.  That would be important for people to know, given the tight timeframes and turnarounds.</p> <p>  A huge amount of work has been done on the call centre.  I commend everyone involved.  However, issues will arise nonetheless.  Many people who do not intend to travel will get digital Covid certificates.  Some others who intend to travel will not get their digital Covid certificates.  It is the nature of these things.  </p> <p>  The call centre will be live on Monday.  What sort of contact does the Minister of State expect?  What sort of modelling has he been doing on contacting?  Is it adequately resourced?  How many people will be manning the phones? </p></speech>

To answer the question about the call centre, this week we have been running an emergency call centre.  The contact number is on the cover letter or email that a person gets upon receipt of their digital Covid certificate.  That is for emergency problems, rather than asking to be pushed up the list, or for general questions.  The call centre is being run by Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  I am told that they have been getting 4,000 calls a day.  They have 25 to 30 agents manning the phones.  Next Monday, the number of agents will increase significantly.  Next Monday, the call centre will deal with regular issues, such as reissuing of lost certificates, or other similar problems.  That will be a larger service.  Mr. Barry Lowry might say something about this.  The call centre service is being provided by the Department of Health.  It was decided that the Department of Health would run the service because it is closest to the vaccination data and understands it best.  That is why the Department of Health is the Department that is running it.  Does Mr. Lowry know anything beyond what will happen on Monday?  I understand that it will be upgraded and that there will be more staff to carry out more functions by Monday.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It is difficult to guesstimate the volume of traffic for any call centre.  As the Minister of State said, we have been using data from the first day.  On the first day, we got 4,000 calls.  Interestingly enough, a large proportion of those stopped after they listened through the interactive voice response, IVR.  It is our hope that is because the IVR gave them the information they wanted, rather than that they got fed up waiting.  The service has ramped up again today.  We plan that next week the call centre will operate in the region of 60 to 80 staff.  We have built a scale up procedure if we need it.</p> <p>  Many of these things grow in intelligence as they go along.  To date, a spreadsheet has been sent round to everybody who plays a part in this.  It contains as many questions as people could think of.  They have been answered and scripted.  Obviously, there will be questions that nobody has thought of.  In those cases, they will be dealt with and then scripted.  We are looking at how we can create extra processes.  For example, if a person changed his or her email address, but it is clear from the data it is he or she who has called the centre, we can automatically issue that digital Covid certificate.  In other cases, there will be substantial changes.  In these cases, it has to go through the proper resolver team to quality check the data.  This will make sure that we are giving the certificate the person who actually had the vaccination.</p></speech>

If it gets to the departure gate, that will lead to mayhem.  I ask that this would be given huge consideration.</p> <p>  What is the plan to engage with the people whose emails have bounced back?

I will bear that in mind.  That point was made by Deputy Cathal Crowe.</p> <p>  The next question was on what we will do about the fewer than 1% of people whose emails have bounced.  Our next alternative would be to write to them.  If we treat those people as if they had a null email, sending them a letter is probably the right approach and that would require a new batch.  Is that what Mr. Lowry would think as well?  The alternative is that we just let them call and issue the certificates as requested.  Has Mr. Lowry decided a tactical approach to that yet or is he waiting for me to tell him what to do?</p></speech>

There are two groups that we need to trap.  One is those whose emails did not get through and the other is those who did not receive letters as they possibly had a wrong address.  We have a process to capture both groups.  The emails are easy and we know straight away what those are but Revenue is collating the letters that were sent back and they will be returned to the Department of Health.  They will possibly be scanned and returned as well as being physically returned.  Depending on what those final numbers are, we are trying to work out the most efficient process for dealing with the people concerned.  That might well be that the service desk phones them back but we have not initially designed that system to do outward calls.  It is more to deal with inward calls.  As the Minister of State said, it might be that if we have robust addresses for the ones that were emailed, we will write to them.  We will review every case.  A team is being set up to do the review and it will make sure that people are not left without a EU DCC.</p></speech>

We have had a number of issues this morning with people coming to us around this matter.  Can Mr. Lowry give clarity and certainty to people around the spelling of their names, including the s&eacute;imhi&uacute;, apostrophe or s&iacute;neadh fada, that they will not be discommoded in any way?</p></speech>

I am happy that it is working.  However, the data we are supplied with comes from a variety of sources, including from different medical professionals, hospitals, GPs and pharmacies.  Sometimes those systems mangle the words so if we are sent data from a system that has changed an "&iacute;" into a Greek character, that is what we receive and it is hard for us to correct it after the fact.  I am satisfied that our system is not doing that but it is possible that an upstream system is.  Does that help to explain?  I am sorry to anyone who received a certificate with a damaged name in it.</p></speech>

The Minister of State said in his statement that the EU DCC will hopefully be available on the Covid tracker app next week.  Is there an outcome from that which is not desirable?  For example, if it is not available next week, what is the import of it not being available?  I have a sense from talking to people that in some cases they have a fear of the Covid tracker app.  I know that is completely irrational but some people have that fear.  I ask that the Minister of State to make it as easy as possible for people to be able to store the EU DCC.  I thank the Minister of State again for his work and I commend Mr. Lowry as well for all that is being done.</p> <p>  I know the Minister of State says that indoor dining is not his bailiwick, Department or area of responsibility but it is important that we develop a pathway for citizens to make it user friendly and not to continue to have a quagmire of bureaucracy.  Let us make it simple for people.  A one-stop-shop approach is the way we should go to make the indoor dining and travel experiences as pleasurable as possible with the minimum of fuss.  I thank the Minister of State for all his work.</p></speech>

That is the final goal.  A lot of people were delighted when they received their EU DCCs.  It is a milestone.  They got this thing that states that they are fully vaccinated and that gave them a feeling that they were moving on to the next stage.</p> <p>  On the Covid tracker app, we never wanted to force people or make people download it.  A lot of people downloaded it but one does not have to use it for the EU DCC.  It is just that so many people have it, we thought it would be a handy place to store it.  We are not thinking of new users but of the existing user base.  If one does not have it, one can still keep the EU DCC on one's phone or on paper.</p> <p>  On making indoor dining as simple and user friendly as possible, we have not been asked to assist with it but if we are then I am happy to help.  Maybe Mr. Lowry has been asked about it so we will come to him in a second.</p> <p>  Lastly, I will go back to the Senator's original question about using the EU DCC with a carrier or ferry company at the earliest point.  I have been passed a note by a colleague who tells me that he checked in with Aer Lingus and that he was chosen to test a system where Aer Lingus verifies one's EU DCC as part of a digital check-in.  Aer Lingus seems to be close to having that system working.  That is a positive step as well.</p></speech>

I am known as Timmy but my passport has my name given at birth as Timothy.

We have talked through all the different problems that might occur and one of them is where a person's name is different on his or her passport from the name that he or she usually goes on and whether the person can change his or her name.  Any type of name change in a system is a security risk because a person may telephone to change a name from a person who is vaccinated to the caller's own name because he or she is not vaccinated.  It is a security risk.  I would ask Mr. Lowry.  It is confusing to have Deputy Lowry and Mr. Lowry on the same meeting.  I will ask Mr. Lowry whether it is envisaged that we will allow name changes over the phone or whether there will be any way to change your name over the phone if you have been vaccinated in a different name from the name on your passport.</p></speech>

There are two different types of call that can come in regarding a change to a certificate.  The first is that there is something relatively minor or, indeed, an error.  It could well be that the name was recorded incorrectly, for example, at point of vaccination.  That can be fixed by the call centre.  For example, if you have changed your email since it was sent out, that can be relatively easily fixed.  If it is something that is more pertaining to your health record and you want a change to your health record so that it matches your passport record, there will be a HSE resolver team and it will take those and will work its way through them.  Once they have work their way through them, they will simply put them in the overnight batch with the new vaccinations.</p></speech>

The answer to that is, for the moment, maybe.  On the next one, there is quite a number of Irish citizens who either work or reside in the UK, or temporarily worked or resided in the UK, and would have been vaccinated there.  Obviously, the UK is outside the European Union now.  I do not know what their role is in terms of providing information around the digital Covid certificate.  Do we have any capacity to take information from citizens who were vaccinated in the UK and upload them into our system and provide them, as EU citizens, with a digital Covid certificate?</p></speech>

Within the regulations from the EU, it states that a country can issue vaccination certificates to a resident who was vaccinated in another country if we recognise that country's vaccination system.  In the initial roll-out of these vaccination certificates, we are merely sending them to everybody who got vaccinated by the HSE in Ireland.  However, we are looking at doing this for people who were vaccinated outside of Ireland.  We are looking at that for the next version.  I would say as well that if you were vaccinated in the UK, including Northern Ireland, you can travel to Ireland on that vaccination certificate.  If you have your NHS proof of vaccination which looks like the card that you get in Ireland that is filled in with pen, you can use that as your proof of vaccination when you travel to Ireland.  I suppose the significant aspect is that you do not have to isolate on coming to Ireland anymore.  It really was not possible for family reunions with children who were living in Britain to come to Ireland easily whereas now it is.  That is the answer.  You can travel on your NHS documents at present.  We are not issuing digital Covid certificates yet for UK or Irish citizens living in Britain but we will look to do it in the future.</p></speech>

On the management or maintenance of the certificate, there is a number of apps out there currently which allow you to scan the code, either from your screen or from your printout, and it will upload it into the wallet app on your iPhone.  I have put the link to that app up on Facebook and on Twitter.</p></speech>

I note Ryanair has a function.  The Minister of State mentioned that Aer Lingus was looking at doing something.  I note that Ryanair currently has a function which allows you to upload the image of your clear PCR test, as it is up until now, that allows you to travel.  Anything the Minister of State can do with airlines to encourage them to do that would be helpful.  That is it.  I thank the Minister of State and Mr. Lowry.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has allowed Deputy Lowry to come in ahead of him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.831" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1609" speakername="Michael Lowry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021071400002#G01000"><p>I will be brief.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.</p> <p>  Yesterday we had a positive meeting and today is similar.  I compliment the Minister of State for his assured and competent handling of this issue and also all of the departmental staff who have been involved in it.</p> <p>  Most of the questions have been asked and we have got clarity on all of the issues that spring to mind.  The only question I have relates to the private testing facilities.  The Minister of State mentioned that there are 25 services which have made an application to be considered, that three are accepted in full and four are partially accepted.  As previous speakers said, it is important that we have to the greatest extent possible service providers available to give the public choice and also to ensure that we do not incur delays.  Has the Minister of State an estimate of the breakdown of those 25 between PCR and antigen testing providers, and what is the Minister of State's view on antigen testing?  We as a committee have for months been struggling to get clarity on antigen testing and to get acceptance from National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, to get a clear statement.  What is the Minister of State's position on antigen testing and is antigen testing part of this service and effort at present?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.832" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021071400002#G01100"><p>I thank Deputy Lowry for his question.  To clarify, we have three that have been accepted in full and a further seven that are partially accepted so far.  The Deputy asked how many of those are issuing antigen tests.  I would presume all of them, but I will check that with Mr. Lowry in case he knows.  It is a process that is being managed by the Department of Health because it is a clinical process.  It is a process of evaluating whether the State is satisfied that this testing service is competent to carry out the tests and is trustworthy.  That is a clinical question.  It is an organisational question for the Department of Health rather than my assessment.</p> <p>  In terms of antigen tests, most countries in Europe will accept an antigen test for entry.  If you want to travel on an antigen test, you can get a digital Covid certificate that states in the 48 hours before you arrive you have passed your antigen test.  The way to tell which countries accept which tests is to go to the Reopen EU website, that is the European Commission's official website for checking what are the rules in place today for each destination country.  In sourcing your destination, you say are coming from Ireland and you are going to, for example, Germany, and it will give you all the details about, for example, what tests are accepted and what age the children can be who do not have to be tested, etc.  There are slight differences in the rules in each country.  It is a burden to have to check that but it is something that has to be done.  It states on the digital Covid certificate to check that website before you go.</p> <p>  I do not have an opinion about antigen tests.  I would defer to Professor Mary Horgan, who is in charge of the antigen group and who worked on the Ferguson report, and what she has said in public.  Professor Horgan says that antigen tests are a useful tool in addition to PCR tests.  I suppose every test has its place and has its clinical suitability.  I do not really have an opinion on that.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Lowry know whether all of these testing services are for antigen tests as well as PCR tests?</p></speech>

I can find that out later.  What I know is that we tested the system, as the Minister of State said, with five different laboratories and all of them did antigen and PCR.</p><p>We are very interested in doing both.  I strongly suspect that the three or five labs are probably the three to five that did the testing and that they probably all offer antigen tests.  We could confirm that if the Deputy wishes.</p></speech>

I remember during first year at college getting exam results to "Ruairm S. Murchz".  I would have much preferred if they had got the address wrong.  Once those issues could be clarified for the likes of us who have names of a certain type, it would obviously make life somewhat simpler.</p> <p>  I add my voice to what has been said about kerbside check-in in the context of aviation.  It would make life so much easier.</p> <p>  I have a question on the call centre.  We get that it is up and running at the minute but it is for emergency purposes for people who are flying imminently.  There was confusion on this yesterday.  Will the Minister of State clarify the point for those looking for a digital Covid certificate on the basis of having recovered from Covid?  Do they telephone the number and be dealt with from that point on or do they have to wait until next Monday?  Obviously, there is a difficulty there for anyone who has already prepared for flights and so on.  Perhaps the Minister of State could answer that first.</p></speech>

The answer is that you need to contact the call centre.  The call centre this week is not capable of issuing the recovery certificates and will not be able to do that until Monday.  Even then it will take it up to five days to deliver the certificate.  That is the answer at the moment.</p></speech>

Forgetting the rights and wrongs of the system the Government is talking about, operationally it is difficult to see how the system can actually operate unless the verifier app is given to people who are operating in the hospitality scenario.  Otherwise, there is no proper verification process.  I do not think I am wrong on this, or am I?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.839" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021071400002#H00600"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is are asking about the verifier app on a phone that can scan a QR code and then come up with the information.  The information that shows on screen is the same as the printed information on the sheet of paper.  There are no extra data there.  They are all encoded in the QR code.  The Department of Justice developed this app for its immigration staff, and I believe it is the same app that is used by the carriers where they choose to use it.  It is an Android app.  It is not available in an app store and it must be directly loaded on to a phone, or side loaded for use.  In that sense it would have to be put into an app store if it was to be used generally for everybody in hospitality and the hospitality sector, which makes it a bit different.  It works on the Android operating system and not on the iPhone system, so you would probably want something that worked on both.  Many other countries have produced their own scanning apps with different levels of success.  Not all of them are 100% compliant with the rules.  I noticed, for example, that the Luxembourg Government app, <i>covidcheck.lu</i>, has an app that can scan a person's code.  If he or she wants to put the app on a phone and scan a QR code, they can.  That is an option also.</p></speech>

I understand there are problems using the verifier app.  The first is that it only works on the Android operating system, the second is that it is not available in an app store and needs to be side loaded, and the third is that it may not be compliant.  It may store data such as sensitive passport data, because it is developed by the Department of Justice, that are not suitable for distributing to the public or to people in hospitality.  There are three hurdles that would have to be overcome.</p></speech>

We would need a simplified version.  But even producing a simplified version and getting it approved in an app store takes a bit of time.  I will defer now to Mr. Lowry in case he has any more information on that.</p></speech>

Obviously, the one we are using currently for flying is very much designed that way and to recognise QR codes from various countries.  There is a very strict process of update because a lot of those countries can change their private keys, and making sure people can get updates is very important.</p> <p>  I have not been involved in the discussion with the hospitality sector.  It will have views about what works logistically for it.  We take the views of the stakeholders to try to develop the path that works best for all concerned.</p></speech>

I believe a lot of the work was done in-house by the HSE and by our own Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, but we did get assistance from NearForm.</p></speech>

NearForm has a worldwide reputation for its skills in developing phone apps.  It was involved in developing the verifier app.  It also made the changes to allow us to add the certificate to the Covid tracker app.  It helped us with some of the capability of putting forward the certificates for email or print to post.</p></speech>

On the private testing facilities, my understanding of the way it works is that they have access to the application programming interface.  They do their piece of work and they can access the system.  Who actually issues it?  Earlier it was said the company would issue the digital Covid certificate.  Is it the case that it does not come centrally from the Department but comes directly from that private testing company, which gives the Department the QR codes that the Department can then upload?</p></speech>

It is different from the issue of recovery certificates and vaccination certificates, which are centrally done by my Department.  Instead, we are allowing the testing service to print or email out a certificate on our behalf, but it needs to connect into our server to generate the QR code.  We must check its security infrastructure, clinical capability and staffing level, and we must carry out a number of other checks before the testing service is authorised to do that.  This is covered in regulations that were issued by the Minister for Health.</p></speech>

There are people who may have been vaccinated in the North or in Britain but who want an Irish digital Covid certificate.

It is something we need to sort as soon as possible.  I was reasonably happy when I knew there was a plan to do it and a fortnight is doable in terms of the timeline.</p> <p>  I beg forgiveness for raising this next matter because there is an element of cheek to it.  I have spoken to the Minister of State about the National Cyber Security Centre review that has been carried out.  The Government has upped the numbers for the National Cyber Security Centre, which tells us that the audit found it was not fit for purpose and needed to be strengthened.  I ask the Minister of State to give us a quick rundown on that.  I accept there are certain aspects he will not be able to go into.  Would it be possible for us to have a private briefing on it?</p></speech>

A capacity review was carried out, completed and returned to me.  The result of that was that I brought a memorandum to Cabinet to increase the budget and staffing for the National Cyber Security Centre over the coming five years, including the hiring of 20 additional staff within the next 18 months and creating a new position of director of the National Cyber Security Centre at a grade of deputy secretary.  I am very happy to give the committee a private briefing on what was included in that capacity review.  It did not find that the National Cyber Security Centre was not fit for purpose.  It found that we should be hiring more people in the coming years and it compared us with other cybersecurity centres around the world, which was interesting to see, but it was really looking at what are we going to need in the future to keep pace with the increasing threats.  I would be delighted to come back and give a full rundown to the committee, or talk to the Deputy or any other member who wants to ask me about this directly.  It would probably make more sense for me to come back to the committee in private session.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister of State.  He and I were on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council together a few years ago and we know each other well.  He is excellent and is the right fit for this brief, being so up to speed with IT and so on.  I got my digital certificate yesterday morning in the middle of our previous meeting, which was great because I could at least keep people in the loop and let them know that they are being sent out.  The Chairman has his printed off and everything ready to go.  It is fantastic that within a week of it being talked about, it has happened.</p> <p>  There was some talk yesterday because the Republic of Ireland is printed on the certificate as opposed to Ireland.  I already asked the Minister of State about this and that was apparently just a mistake.  Is there a way to fix that?  I am not asking for a million letters to be posted at a cost of &euro;1 million but perhaps if people want a new certificate they could ask for one or maybe the emails could be reissued with Ireland on them.  Would that be too difficult to do logistically?  I hope we can do it.</p> <p>  I hope the airlines will be proactive because they usually are when it comes to IT.  It is good to hear that they are looking for the information at the time of booking or check-in online in order to speed everything up.  I am quite happy to use technology and to have it in a wallet on my phone, but batteries die, screens crack and things go wrong.  I suggest that everybody print their certificate off and have it in their back pocket or wherever, safely with their passport, as well as using the digital version.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on the issue of the name of the State being the Republic of Ireland on the certificates rather than Ireland.</p></speech>

This is a mistake that got through proofreading.  I had seen it before so I must take my share of the blame as well.  We are going to change it for the next version.  We are not planning to reissue Covid certificates to people and are certainly not going to reprint 1 million Covid certificates with Ireland on them rather than the Republic of Ireland.  However, I take the Senator's point.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke publicly about this yesterday as well.  It is an important thing that we need to get right.  Did the Senator have another question?</p></speech>

Has the Minister of State been talking to them?  We have heard that Aer Lingus is involved.  Can the State or the Government, through the Dublin Airport Authority, the Shannon Group or other airports, be proactive?  We should front-load this process and bring it back to the earliest possible point so that people are not being told at the airport that whatever they have is not sufficient.  As much data should be captured in advance and as early as possible to speed it up because airports get congested at the best of times, so they are going to be more congested coming out of a pandemic.  I hope we will be proactive when dealing with all the airlines we use for international flights into and out of Dublin, Shannon, Cork and Knock.</p></speech>

When I say "we", I mean that staff from the HSE have been out at the airports over the past weeks working with the carriers and discussing this with them.  Every country has implemented this process in a slightly different way but the earlier the certificate is checked, the better.  Aer Lingus is already running a test pilot scheme wherein a subset of its passengers can upload the digital Covid certificate online.  Ryanair allows PCR tests to be uploaded at the online check-in stage as well.  I would hope the major carriers will all move towards allowing things to be uploaded at the earliest stage they can be.  The whole point of the scheme is to reopen travel safely and efficiently because at the moment the airport has a very low number of passengers that is a fraction of what it normally has.  The fear was that if we started up transport again, there would be so many queues where everybody took out a different format of document to prove that they were vaccinated or tested and it would take a long time to validate them.  The idea of the QR code is that it can be quickly scanned and it goes red or green.   There will only be spot-checks at immigration.  We do not want unsafe crowds developing in the airports so that is part of the reason as well.  It is all focused on efficiency.  The Senator is right that the only way to do this is by engaging directly with the carriers, the ferry companies and the people running the ports and airports.  That has been happening.</p></speech>

Thankfully, it was the same as my passport name.  If somebody does have a different name, but the date of birth on the digital certificate and the passport are the same, the surname is the same and the first name is very similar, I hope the airlines will not try to charge a name-change fee.  They should be understanding if the person's surname and date of birth match and the first name is quite similar, such as Timmy versus Timothy, Gerry versus Gerald or Joe versus Joseph.  I hope those certificates will all be processed and not rejected at any stage.</p></speech>

There are a number of matters I want to clarify.  We had a meeting with Liz Canavan and her colleagues yesterday, at which Mr. Lowry was also present.  The common travel area came up at that meeting.  We have a lot of interconnection with the UK.  Our understanding is that from 19 July, people from the UK who are fully vaccinated can fly here without any quarantine and children under the age of six are exempt.  However, those between the ages of seven and 18, either from here or the UK, would not be vaccinated.</p><p>What will the position be with regard to them?  It is a policy decision for the Government.  Will the Minister of State provide clarification in that regard?  He will understand the issues from a human dimension.  If parents who are fully vaccinated are coming in from the UK with teenage children, those children will not be able to dine indoors and so on.  Will the Minister of State provide some clarification?</p></speech>

As the Chair stated, the current position is that those under seven years of age do not need to be vaccinated or tested to come in but that people above that age have to quarantine for a period of time after coming in from the UK.  This period is so long that it makes matters difficult for those making short journeys.  There is a big change coming with regard to travel between Great Britain and Ireland on Monday.  Vaccinated people and those who are unvaccinated but who have been tested will not have to isolate.</p></speech>

These rules have not been decided, unlike the digital Covid certificate system, which, along with all of the associated rules, has been 100% decided.  As I understand it, there are still negotiations ongoing.  There were negotiations between the hospitality sector and Government yesterday.  The legislation is to go before the D&aacute;il today and before the Seanad on Friday and is, therefore, still subject to amendment.  I do not know what the rules will be.  I understand that the intention is for those coming from another country to be treated in the same way as Irish people, in other words, for people who have proof of vaccination or recovery to be allowed enter restaurants.  I understand that is the intention.  I do not believe people will be treated differently if they have come from the UK, the United States or anywhere else.</p></speech>

We got a sense that things were not finalised from the official, Ms Canavan, yesterday.  She said that the issue of the cohort aged between 7 and 17 had to be decided upon by Government.  The Minister of State is now stating that anyone flying from the UK or other non-designated countries outside of the EU from 19 July can come into Ireland without any form of quarantine as long as they are vaccinated or have a negative PCR test.  We then need the next leg, that of indoor dining.  On that point, people who were vaccinated in other countries may have received the Chinese vaccine or the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V.  What view will the Irish authorities take of, for example, people flying from a non-designated country who have received the Sputnik V vaccine, which does not come under the EU digital green certificate?  What view will Ireland take on that and on other vaccines, such as the Chinese vaccine?</p></speech>

We have absolute clarity.  People within the EU now know that they can travel freely within the EU with a digital Covid certificate issued to those who are vaccinated, who have recovered in the previous 180 days, six months, or who have a negative PCR test.  We know that people outside of this area, including in our common travel area with the UK, who are located in non-designated countries will be able to come to Ireland freely without having to quarantine if they have been vaccinated - and the Minister of State has said that we will accept all vaccines approved by the EMA - or if they are unvaccinated but hold a negative result from a PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival in Ireland.  That is absolute.  We now need that to flow to indoor dining.  Is it the Minister of State's understanding that the digital Covid certificate will form a central part of the Covid pass for indoor dining?</p></speech>

We decided to build a call centre from next Monday, 19 July.  It became clear that because we are moving faster with the certificate issue there would be queries.  We built a temporary call centre so that we could provide support for people who had areas of concern.  This was broadly aimed at providing reassurance and advice on when certificates would be issued and so on.  It was not set up to deal with very specific inquiries because the call centre will not have access to the data to enable the staff to do that.</p></speech>

It is very difficult because there are various ways in which one can estimate the number of calls one is expecting.  One way of doing that might be calls per certificates issued.  Another might be calls per expected number of travellers and so on.  We have tried to factor all of those things into the estimation.  We came up with a low number of, I believe, 60 and a high number of 70.  I can clarify that if I have given the Chair the wrong figures.  The contract allows a scale up beyond that if the demand requires it.</p></speech>

There were 4,000 calls in one day, 1,200 of which were answered.  That means that only one in three of those who called spoke to an operator.  We do not know the full circumstances behind that.  It seems a relatively low level of throughput, given the level of callers who stayed on the line.  That was with 25 to 35 staff.

There will be a lot of calls initially.  It is something we as a committee will take up with the Department of Health.  The way the digital Covid certificate has been rolled out has been very efficient, but the call centre will be a huge element of the end service.

We accept the Minister of State's bona fides.  We can come back on that matter but it was important that we discussed it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.945" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021071400002#M00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the breadth of his answers.  I want to raise a couple of questions about the practicalities of the digital Covid certificate and the verifier app.  Let us say a person lands up at Dublin Airport who has not been vaccinated but has got a negative PCR or antigen test, a digital Covid certificate and a QR code.  The QR code is read by the verifier app and the app confirms that it is an antigen or PCR test and the name and details of the person.  Does it connect with the place the person is intending to travel to see if he or she is compliant with requirements there?  Is it only the QR code a person needs?  Is all the information embedded in that?</p></speech>

All the information needed is in the QR code.  Most people who show their phone will have the QR code and no other information visible.  The Deputy asked if the person validating it pre-departure will be able to check whether, for example, an antigen test is valid in the destination country and whether that business rule is being applied.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.948" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021071400002#M00900"><p>I have an opinion on that but I will ask Mr. Lowry to say what he thinks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.949" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Lowry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021071400002#M01000"><p>The process for the verifier app has two functions.  One is to prove that what is in the QR code is the same as what is in the certificate so that if somebody tried to forge it, it would be impossible.  The other is to try to provide a level of assurance that the proof the person is travelling on is appropriate for the country he or she is heading for.  If it all works correctly - and the signs are it will - if I was travelling to Belgium, for example, and using an antigen test and Belgium did not accept that test, they will know at the airport and be able to tell me that I may well have to quarantine when I go to Belgium.  That is the way the EU hopes it will work.  It has what they call business rules and identity rules.  Countries might change their rules at any time, which is why the Minister of State said in his opening statement that every six hours we will download new information from the EU server.  That will be updated to the apps on phones and we will know what the current rules are.</p></speech>

In practical terms, the message is that people need to check, go to the reopen EU website and see what the destination rules are, how old a child can be to travel there without a PCR test and is an antigen test acceptable.  People need to do that, rather than arrive at the airport and have their certificate refused in advance.   Does that make sense?</p></speech>

If there is a suggestion that we use the DCC for indoor dining or hospitality here, there is a potential issue with operating on the QR code.  The code could say a person is antigen-test negative from three weeks ago.  It would not be a forgery.  It would be legitimate, but without the appropriate tool to read the QR code it may be something else.  I flag it as an issue if the Government intends to go down that road.  The level of sophistication in the DCC in aviation would need to be considered in the roll-out to indoor dining and hospitality.</p></speech>

The printed version will say if the holder is vaccinated or unvaccinated.  Along with the QR code, it will say if he or she is tested for antigen or PCR.  Will it?  I refer to the email that goes out or whatever.</p></speech>

There are many types of antigen test, for example.</p></speech>

With regard to hospitality, the only way this will be operational and avoid forgery is if there is fit-for-purpose verifier app, even with whatever changes need to be made to remove other information provided to airlines.  That piece of work will need to be done or it is another point where the plan is ready to fail.</p> <p>  Go raibh maith agaibh.  I appreciate the witnesses' contributions.

We just want to contribute to the improvement of what is already a good system in respect of the digital Covid certificate, which is clearly being considered for use as a Covid pass.  How do we ensure due diligence in that respect and that its use with regard to indoor dining will be foolproof?  These are aspects to be considered.  We look forward to further engagement with the Minister of State on this particular matter but also in respect of the National Cyber Security Centre.  We thank the Minister of State and Mr. Lowry for their attendance.</p></speech>

I wish to be clear that the current rules with regard to travel from the UK and the US are such that, while vaccinated people do not have to isolate, those with a negative PCR test do.  Until any change to that rule is officially published on <i>gov.ie</i>, it is still the rule.  I just want to be really clear on that.</p></speech>

We were looking at linking it in with the changes to come on 19 July, following up on issues that arose yesterday in our meeting with Ms Canavan and seeking clarity.  We welcome the Minister of State's clarity.  We hope that there will be a formal announcement soon so that there will be certainty in respect of travel between Ireland and the UK and elsewhere.</p></speech>
