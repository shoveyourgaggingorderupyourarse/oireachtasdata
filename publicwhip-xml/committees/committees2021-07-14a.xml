I remind them that apart from me and members of the committee secretariat, all other members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and from within the Leinster House complex only.</p> <p>  The purpose of the meeting is to discuss trade between Ireland and the Palestinian territories.  Some time ago, following correspondence, we agreed to a request from the group, Sadaka, to address the issue.  I remind everyone that today's meeting is about trade between Ireland and the Palestinian territories and I request that other issues are not discussed.  From Sadaka, the Ireland Palestine Alliance, I am pleased to welcome Mr. Bertie &Oacute; hAinmhire, board member, who is accompanied by two guest speakers, Mr. Hugh Lovatt, from the Middle East and North Africa programme of the European Council on Foreign Relations and Mr. Martin Konen&yacute; of the European Middle East Project in Brussels.</p> <p>  Before we start I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, I will direct them to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I now invite Mr. &Oacute; hAinmhire to make an opening statement on behalf of Sadaka.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Lovatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us to speak.  I am a senior policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, ECFR, based in London.  I will deliver some brief remarks which build on our written submission to the committee.  The submission was co-authored with my colleague, Mr. Konen&yacute;, the director of the European Middle East Project in Brussels.  We are talking today about trade between Ireland and Palestine.  Above all this, however, is a story about trade with Israel and its settlements.  Israel continues to pursue a decades-long policy of deepening its control over the occupied territories, expanding its settlement activities in contravention of international law and systematically violating the human rights and self-determination of the Palestinian people.  This creates challenges for the EU and Ireland when it comes to trade not just with Palestinians but also with Israel.<br/><br/>These challenges have been compounded by Israel's <i>de jure</i>annexation of East Jerusalem in 1980 and its <i>de facto </i>annexation of the West Bank, which the D&aacute;il has recognised.  There is ample evidence that Israeli settlements are directly benefiting from financial relations with the EU and Ireland via the trading and business relationship with Israel.  Left unchecked, this situation risks undermining Irish and EU efforts to place international law and respect for human rights at the centre of their foreign and trading relations and foreign policy.  This risks pushing further away the prospect of an independent and viable Palestinian state, hurting the long-term prospects of reaching a sustainable peace between Israelis and Palestinians.  It also compromises bilateral trade in respect of Israelis and Palestinians.<br/><br/>Against that backdrop, then, Ireland has an obligation to correctly align its external practices with its international law-based duties.  We are of course aware of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 that is currently on hold.  Working with its European partners, however, Ireland could be doing much more in this regard in the meantime.  We argue that Ireland should become the champion of what has been called the EU&rsquo;s &quot;differentiation policy&quot;.  This policy aims to fully and effectively exclude the occupied Palestinian territories, including the Israeli settlements illegally located in them, from the context of bilateral relations with Israel.  Doing so can help to ensure that trade and business ties with Israel fully and effectively respect international law and United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which was passed in December 2016.  This differentiation policy builds on well established legal principles that it is worth touching on briefly.  The first is the duty of non-recognition of forcible acquisition of foreign territory.  In the case of Israel, this includes the non-recognition of the domestic administrative regime which it has unlawfully extended to the settlements.  In effect, Israel is treating those settlements as an integral part of sovereign Israel and seeking to reflect this in its bilateral trade policy.  This duty of non-recognition has been embedded in the international legal order for nearly a century.  It is, therefore, a well established principle and has played an important role in disincentivising wars and territorial conquest.<br/><br/>The second duty I touch upon is the duty of third states to ensure that they do not assist or provide material support in the maintenance of an internationally unlawful situation.  In the case of Israel, this of course includes the expansion of illegal settlements, its annexation of Palestinian territory, whether <i>de jure </i>or <i>de facto</i>, the forcible dispossession and displacement of the Palestinian population in the occupied territories and the development by Israel since the beginning of this occupation in 1967 of a dual legal system that discriminates against Palestinians in the occupied territories to the benefit of their settler neighbours.<br/><br/>The third responsibility in this regard is to respect the internationally recognised right of self-determination of the Palestinian people within their territorial unit.  This is, as will be recalled, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.  Differentiation is also based on the proper application of EU law and existing regulations and domestic public policy decisions.  It is worth underlining that the goal of EU differentiation policy is first and foremost to protect the integrity of the EU&rsquo;s domestic legal order from Israel&rsquo;s internationally unlawful acts.  In effect, this is concerned with erecting an EU legal firewall between Israel and the settlements.  EU differentiation should not, therefore, be considered as a politically coercive action in the same way as sanctions or punitive measures.  Differentiation recognises Israel within its internationally recognised borders based on the 1967 lines.  By ensuring the correct implementation of international law and existing domestic requirements, however, it is true that EU trade can challenge Israel&rsquo;s annexation of Palestinian territory.  That annexation aims to erase any political or economic distinction between Israel and its settlements and treat them as an integral part of Israel.  It is also important to note that these differentiation measures fall far short of what the EU has done in respect of Russia's occupation and annexation of Ukrainian territory.<br/><br/>By ensuring that bilateral relations with Israel neither recognise its illegal settlement activities nor allows it to benefit from them, Ireland and the EU can help defend the territorial basis for a future two-state solution and counter the current slide towards a one-state reality of unequal rights based on the permanent subjugation of Palestinians under Israeli military control.  Undertaking this course of action would also support Palestinian economic prospects and statehood aspirations, which continue to be undermined by Israeli settlement activity.  All this aligns with the recommendations made in the report recently published by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.<br/><br/>As outlined in our written submission, differentiation has been applied in six main areas.  I will not refer to them all now, but the details can be found in our written submission.  They obviously focus a great deal on trade and business issues, while also extending into areas such as taxation, social security and research and development.  While there has been some notable progress, many deficiencies remain.  The EU's differentiation policy has not been applied coherently or enforced sufficiently by the EU as a whole or by its member states.  Ireland has an opportunity to help rally like-minded states to ensure the full and effective implementation of differentiation measures across the spectrum of bilateral relations with Israel at both EU and national level.</p><p>I will finish by noting that Ireland has made substantial and positive progress in applying the EU's differentiation policy.  We particularly welcome its public confirmation in January that its bilateral agreements with Israel do not apply to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967.  This public confirmation is very important and good to have.  However, there is far more to be done and there is no shortage of ideas.  We have outlined some in our-----</p></speech>

I also thank them for the work they continue to do.  It is important work which the committee very much appreciates, as do I.  I have a few questions.  Time is tight.  We have received and read the submissions made by the witnesses.  The Chair has to be strict on time but we received the submissions in good time.  I will ask a couple of questions.</p> <p>  We hear from the Taoiseach and from the Minister for Foreign Affairs about European aid to Palestine.  They talk a lot about this aid, the form it comes in, its cost and the mechanisms involved in delivering it.  However, we rarely hear comprehensive detail as to why exactly that aid is so badly needed.  For the record, information and benefit of the committee, will the witnesses please provide information about the impact on the Palestinian economy of the Israeli Government's actions, including sanctions and war?  Will they put on the record the impact these have had on businesses and the economy and why this impact results in the need for aid?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Lovatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#C00400"><p>I will give a brief answer and then turn over to my colleague, Mr. Konen&yacute;.  I will underscore that the EU and its member states are the largest provider of aid to the Palestinians.  This aid does much important work but we need to recall that Palestine does not need to be dependent on aid.  The reason it is dependent on aid is the ongoing restrictions on its access to natural resources and on its ability to export.  All of these restrictions are to be seen against the backdrop of the occupation.  If we want to move towards a more viable policy, we need to tackle the root causes rather than providing a technical, aid-focused bandage.  I will turn to Mr. Konen&yacute; for a fuller answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Konen&yacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#C00500"><p>Few societies in the world have been subjected to such comprehensive and debilitating economic restrictions as Palestine.  This is a well-known fact.  There have been many studies into the issue.  One study, which has been cited by the World Bank, estimates that the cost of all the Israeli restrictions on the Palestinian economy amounts to 85% of the Palestinian Authority's, PA's, annual GDP.  That is just one of the estimates.  The restrictions are all-encompassing.  It starts with access to land and water.  As the committee will know, 60% of the West Bank comprises area C, which is under direct Israeli control.  This area contains most of the agricultural and grazing land, water and natural resources.  Palestinian access to these resources is greatly limited by the occupation's restrictions.</p> <p>  Another aspect relates to trade in goods and products between Palestine and the EU.  There is an extensive interim association agreement on free trade between the EU and the PA, which offers very preferential terms to Palestinian exporters but this agreement is neutralised or nullified in practice by the Israeli restrictions that are in place.  Whenever someone wants to export something from Palestine, it needs to go via the Israeli checkpoints and needs to be offloaded, loaded again and controlled.  It is the same case in Israeli ports.  Trade, therefore, faces a lot of disadvantages and delays.  There is no level playing field between the Palestinian exporters who face all of these restrictions and the Israeli settlement exporters and businesses who export to the world and the EU and who enjoy extensive government subsidies and support.  This is something to bear in mind when thinking about this issue.  It is reflected in something we mentioned in our submission, which is the estimate that the volume of imports to the EU from settlements is approximately 15 times greater than the volume of imports from Palestinians in the occupied territories, even though there are many more Palestinians than settlers.  I have not even mentioned Gaza, which is under an even more stringent set of restrictions.  I will pause there.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the Dunnes Stores strikers.  Although I was very young, I was on the picket line with those workers.  That provided us with an opportunity to show real leadership.  We were ahead of our time.  Trade unionists, such as myself, and broader society should be proud of the leadership we showed.  We have been told repeatedly that Ireland punches well above its weight at EU level.  Do the witnesses have any views on the options or opportunities that are available to us within the EU to bring about an outright ban on trade with illegal settlements?  That is what is needed.  Is it a realistic prospect?  We should bear in mind that, when Mary Manning refused to handle those oranges, she was not told that it would start something big and change the world, despite it being very doable.  In fact, she was told there was no point, that a political decision cannot be overturned, that it would never work and that she was just one woman and that this was just a small country hanging off the edge of Europe.  Despite that, look at what we did.  I take great heart from that campaign and that strike.  Do the witnesses see such opportunities for us within the EU given that we have a deserved reputation for punching well above our weight?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Lovatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#C00700"><p>On the Deputy's last question, we all know the political conversation regarding banning certain products is difficult at both national and EU level.  However, I believe that Ireland has an important role to play in building a coalition of member states that can be supportive of such action.  It is important to note that, at present, there has been no conversation on policy at the level of the member states about the banning of settlement products.  Merely starting that conversation is important.  Ireland can do that.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  Second, there are different ways to approach this.  The Irish Parliament has suggested one way, which might be undertaken at national or EU level, but we must remember that the EU is a community of laws, Bills and regulations.  The EU regulates a number of other areas, including that of products tainted by child labour, and the import of seal products and other products.  Why not also regulate products that are derived from actions that violate the core tenets of international law?  Advancing a more regulatory approach is another possibility at either the top level, between member states, or at the level of national parliaments and the European Parliament.</p></speech>

I commend him for his words on that.</p> <p>  I want to refer briefly to the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018, which has been approved by the Seanad.  It has also been approved by the D&aacute;il.  It has not been enacted off the back of advice given by the Attorney General that it is contrary to EU law, but I will put on the record as well the fact that there is strong independent legal opinion which disputes that.  In particular, it is felt that the passing of this legislation could be defeated in the courts and that this would render it not worthwhile.  I would welcome the views of the experts on the legislation, the likelihood of a defeat in the courts but also the likelihood of success were it to be challenged in the courts if we want to take a positive view of it.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, there have been different legal opinions on the issue in Ireland, from the Attorney General and from independent legal experts.  I would add that when it comes to the possibility of adopting such a ban at the EU level, it would be politically difficult because of the divisions among member states.  It would, for example, be unlike the case of the occupied Crimea annexed by Russia where the EU was able to quickly reach a consensus on a ban.</p> <p>  There is a group of lawyers and citizens who have come up with a different idea and who have asked for a ban which would be based on the Commission's legal obligations to respect international law.  This is in order that it would not be formulated as a sanction.  They have come up with the idea of a so-called European citizens' initiative, which would take the form of a petition supported by many citizens in favour of this idea.  It was rejected by the Commission and went to the European Court of Justice.  Now, it is back with the Commission.  When it comes to this possibility at the EU level, it is a pending case to watch closely.</p> <p>  I would follow up on what Mr. Lovatt mentioned previously that the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 in Ireland has sparked discussions on possible similar legislation in several other parliaments around the EU.  That, on its own, is an important effect of the ban starting the discussion, as Mr. Lovatt has mentioned.</p></speech>

The Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018, if it was enacted, could result in a complete ban on imports of goods and services produced in illegal settlements, as the Deputy said.  It was passed by the Oireachtas, but blocked by the Government with a money message.  However, there are a number of independent experts, including the late Professor James Crawford, a professor of international law, who argued that it is lawful for individual member states to ban trade with settlements.  While it is accepted that the EU trade rules are generally uniform across member states, exceptions are granted on grounds of public morality, public policy, public security, the protection of health, etc.  There is a suggestion why not enact the legislation as per the will of the people and the will of the Oireachtas and, if necessary, let the courts decide afterwards if this is legitimate or not.</p></speech>

It is an interesting perspective that there are varying views right across the board.  There are many experts who would say that this Bill is entirely workable.  Indeed, the Members of the Oireachtas agree because we have backed it.</p> <p>  I am struck by the idea that conversations are starting in other EU countries,  I wonder how far advanced they are.  Obviously, other countries are not as far advanced as ourselves in terms of nearly passing the legislation.  I wonder are other countries at an advanced stage of what they are doing or are they still at the exploratory stages.  Can we expect to hear from other EU countries on this issue in the near future?</p></speech>

There is widespread discontent with the policies being pursued in the settlements in the occupied territories.  The issue is what way should Ireland go about addressing this.  I would like whether the witnesses support what the Irish Government is trying to achieve in making progress on this ongoing and difficult situation, which is causing so much hardship.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Lovatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#D00900"><p>When it comes to the Irish Government's approach, there are obviously two conversations, one of which is more relevant to our current exchange.  The first one is, obviously, what is the political and foreign policy approach and the second is the trade.  My understanding is that the Irish Government has tended to say moving forward with perhaps more robust measures against the settlements could undermine reaching a sustainable peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians and could undermine Ireland's potential to play a mediating role.  That was the position of the previous Government as well.</p> <p>  My view is clearly we need to acknowledge at the political side of things that there is a complete deadlock in negotiations but at the same time that the situation on the ground is continuing to deteriorate because of Israel's ongoing settlement policy in wanting to expunge the Palestinian leadership of its responsibilities.  My belief is that before entering into a process of negotiations, and for them to be meaningful, we need to be able to create the foundations for sustainable negotiations and a core part of this is, in my view, to challenge Israel's trajectory of annexation and settlement policy.  This is where the sort of policy of the requirement to trade with Israel and the Palestinians in conformity with international law has a normative and positive impact on the conflict.  I see this differentiation policy and also the idea of banning settlement services and goods as something that is not only aligned with international law but can be supportive of prospects for long-term peace.  Even if it provokes some backlash from the Israeli Government over the short term, it has important benefits over the longer term.</p></speech>

That is not helpful to developing policy in this arena.  While there can be clearly different views about what the best approach should be, it is not right that when an Irish civil servant presents the Irish Government case that should be the reaction.  I do not know whether Mr. Lovatt has comments on that situation.</p></speech>

Are there elements of the case Mr. &Oacute; hAinmhire wants to advance that are accepted as being in line with the legal advice of the Attorney General or is this down to differences of legal opinion?  We are not qualified to adjudicate on such matters.  I certainly am not.

The advice Sadaka had received at the time was fairly strong in that this was something that could have been done.  While it is accepted, as I said earlier, that EU rules are generally uniform across member states and that the EU Commission has competence in the trade area under Article 113, on grounds of public morality and policy, the occupied territories Bill could have been passed.  Even at this stage because this Bill is on the table, we would be suggesting-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.35" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>What we would suggest at this stage is why not enact the legislation which is the will of the Oireachtas and the people of Ireland after a long campaign and, if necessary, subsequently let the courts decide on its legitimacy?  If the courts decide it is not legitimate and not in keeping with EU law, we have to accept it.  After all the work that went into it and the conflicting advices, we feel it is worth letting it go now and letting the experts decide.</p></speech>

Ireland doing this at a national level, perhaps followed by parliaments in a few other member states, could add further incentive for the Commission to take more meaningful progress.</p></speech>

I have been a strong supporter of Palestine for many years.  I have done fundraising and attended many protests in Clare, etc.  With regard to the occupied territories Bill, the labelling is the big one for me in terms of trying to think of something we can handle.  Much of the stuff being asked for is at EU level.  I am not sure, as a Senator on an enterprise, trade and employment committee, what I can do to help.  I do not know if the witnesses were talking to the European affairs people.  I would love if the West Bank, as opposed to the Israeli goods labelling, was enforced from that 2015 Act in which they were going to bring in labelling, but that has never happened.  I know that is at an EU level but I wonder if there is something we could do at an Irish level with regard to saying unless it is labelled, how do we know?  Many of us want to boycott goods coming in from the West Bank but because of lack of labelling, we cannot.  I could take it up with our MEPs but I am not sure what we can do help.  That is the first thing.</p><p>The second thing is with regard to the occupied territories Bill.  Is that not being implemented because of EU law or fear of breaking EU law?  What can we do around that if the Oireachtas and everybody is supporting it?  I am not clear on that either.  I will not pretend to be <i>au fait </i>with that.  I know that labelling is a huge issue in terms of giving ordinary people a choice to show their support in that way by boycotting or purchasing.</p></speech>

We believe the Parliament can play a role in encouraging the Government to be more proactive in this because there is space for Ireland to do more on this.  When it comes to the national level and specifically labelling, the first step would be to ask the Government to assess and evaluate what kinds of imports from settlements there are to Ireland.  In my understanding, in Ireland it is more limited than in some other member states.  We did research specifically into settlement wines being imported into the EU a year and a half ago and we found many of these products in countries such as Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium and France, but not in Ireland.  Maybe the potential of labelling in Ireland is more limited than elsewhere.  First, one would need to look at the scope of the settlement products.  However, our main recommendation today is for Ireland to play a stronger role in promoting differentiation in the EU.  This is something that can be done while the occupied territories Bill is on hold.  In the meantime, there is a whole set of things that can be progressed in the EU.</p></speech>

Due to the nature of Israel's settlement enterprise which, as the D&aacute;il has recognised, has resulted in <i>de facto</i>annexation of the settlements as part of the Israeli state, it has made it increasingly difficult to disassociate business activity within the Israeli state from that which takes place in the illegal settlements.  We need clear procedures and systems to make that differentiation.</p></speech>

We have seen that some other countries have prioritised this issue and as a result, the proportion of correctly labelled products from Israel and settlements has increased.  That would be possible and may be a worthwhile issue to pick up in Ireland as well.</p></speech>

That is what Mr. Konen&yacute; is suggesting in that they should be able to do that.  I was not clear as to how it would be able to do that.

We are very grateful to Sadaka and to Mr. Lovatt and Mr. Konen&yacute; for all their work in this area.  There is a large amount of frustration with the failure to enact the occupied territories Bill.  I have a question about the enforceability or the practical implications of the Bill or the arrangement the witnesses are proposing.  With regard to the UN database of companies involved in settlements, is that something the witnesses are proposing specifically for the Israeli settlements or is it for all occupied territories across the world?  Perhaps they could give us more detail on that.</p></speech>

The UN database already exists.  It is a database of companies involved in the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory.  It was put together and made public at the beginning of last year.  It is not the only such list.  The UN has previously published lists of companies involved in human rights violations in Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  A number of civil society organisations have suggested that it would be good to apply such measures to further conflict zones and occupied territories around the world.</p> <p>  Our main point, and we mention it in our submission, is that the Irish Government has been ambivalent about the database, while countries such as Belgium and Sweden openly welcomed it.  We see a contradiction there between the usual very strong Irish position on the illegality of the settlements and the ambivalent stance on the database.  The database is supposed to be updated annually, but there is a question now as to whether this will happen.  That is why support from European governments for the continuation of this project at the UN is very important, not least from the point of view of the companies that have been listed.  If a company ceases its activities which contribute to the settlements, it has a right to be delisted.  Conversely, companies that get involved in activities supporting settlements should be added to the database.  That is why it is so important to continue the updating process.</p></speech>

Can the witnesses talk about some of the best practice in other countries with regard to that type of legislation and what lessons we might take from other countries for this country?</p></speech>

Much of this legislation builds on the UN guiding principles, which I am sure the Senator is aware of, but seeks to take that to the next level.  The effort to pass legislation requiring enhanced human rights due diligence, especially due diligence reporting, is still a new area that is being legislated and is developing.  When we look at initiatives in some Scandinavian countries, Finland has been talking about it.  Germany, Denmark and Norway have looked at it.  There are some criticisms of it.  In my view, some of the legislation does not go far enough.  Some of the technical criticism is that it only applies to medium or larger businesses and so exempts a stratum of smaller businesses.  I presume that is because of the burden of the reporting requirements.  The second technical criticism is that these reporting requirements are still mostly voluntary.  I would add my personal assessment, which is that there is a question of follow through.  It is one thing to say the company has to do its human rights due diligence reporting, but what is the standard of that reporting and how does the business actually reflect its due diligence in its practices?  That is a more difficult area.  It is not just about writing a report, but ensuring it is correctly applied on trading relations in businesses.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about best practices.  There are examples of legislation that have been discussed, but my view is that these are still very much imperfect.  When it comes to specific situations of occupation and annexation, including Israel's annexation and occupation of Palestinian territory, these Bills can do more to specifically target those instances of unlawful practices.  It is not just about doing.  Most of the legislation is about also looking at whether the chains involved in producing material conform to human rights standards.  This is also a question of whether it conforms to international law and international humanitarian law, IHL, standards.</p> <p>  The final point is that when it comes to settlements, if one is doing effective due diligence, the only outcome or conclusion of due diligence for a foreign business is that it has to withdraw from those settlements.  I do not believe there is any way to mitigate a foreign company's business relations with the settlements in a way that can avoid Israel's internationally unlawful practices.  In other words, if a business wants to respect international law and human rights, the only way to do that in the case of the settlements is to withdraw one's business practices.</p></speech>

The EU approach to the Israeli settlements is a microcosm of its general approach to Israel, which is one that is based on gross hypocrisy.  In the global context, it is happy to cry crocodile tears whenever the latest atrocity takes place, but it facilitates and gives substantial economic benefits to the Israeli state not just in terms of settlements but on a range of fronts, including trade and research funding.  That is epitomised in the question of the settlements.  The EU says they are illegal, which is fine and the correct word, but it continues to do massive trade with them.  It is an important issue to pursue.  It is a wedge issue.  What is the witnesses' perception of what the impact would be if the Irish Government were to respect the will of the D&aacute;il and Seanad and pass and implement the occupied territories Bill?  What would be its impact across Europe and internationally?  Sometimes the argument is made that Ireland is too small and that given the amount of trade it has it would not make a difference.</p></speech>

As we mentioned, it has inspired similar attempts in several other countries.  If it was adopted in Ireland, the impact we have seen already would be several times stronger because there would be a real example of legislation that has been put in place.  I do not believe it would convince all 27 member states to adopt similar legislation because of the well-known differences between them, but it would convince several other parliaments to adopt this.  Perhaps we will see this in any case, as I mentioned earlier.</p><p>If Ireland showed leadership with this Bill, it would definitely spark several other countries to follow.  There is no question about that.</p><p> We know the legislation is kind of on hold in Ireland but it is not that we must wait and do nothing in the meantime.  We know the Government in Ireland has not been in favour of this legislation but it can be a champion of the differentiation policy at EU level and with other member states.  It is something on which it can do much more than it has been doing.</p></speech>

That is very helpful.  I am a supporter of Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, BDS, in general and it has broad support in Irish society.  Many people would like to boycott products or companies that have activity in the settlements.  Will the witnesses speak a little about the activity of companies that have significant Irish operations and what they are doing in the illegal settlements?  For example, I know Veolia has an interest, although I do not know exactly what it does in the settlements.  There is also G4S and other companies where the witnesses could describe the activities they engage in within those settlements.</p></speech>

These are mainly Israeli companies but there are several international companies, including those mentioned by the Deputy.  Some French companies, such as Alstom and Egis, have been involved with projects like light rail in Jerusalem.  There are some British and Dutch companies as well.  None of the companies is headquartered in Ireland but, as the Deputy mentioned, there may be links and some of those companies may be active in Ireland.  There are some cases of European companies known to be actively involved with the occupation and contributing to the viability of the settlements and they are not listed in the database for various reasons.  That is partly because the criteria are relatively narrowly defined and this is the first version of the database and it is yet to be updated.  For example, HeidelbergCement is a German company involved in the extraction of natural resources though a daughter company.  There is also the significant case of a Spanish company, CAF, which is involved with Jerusalem light rail.</p></speech>

Beyond the individual responsibility of companies the core question is how third states transpose international rules-based requirements when it comes to the practices of their domiciled businesses.  Domiciled businesses must first and foremost respect the law of the country in which they are domiciled.  The question, therefore, is how the Irish Government and authorities would regulate the practices and behaviour of businesses.  This is a bigger point.</p> <p>  There are different ways to do this and enhanced due diligence and reporting requirements could be one way.  We could also look at supply chains.  Another possibility, which we have seen the Dutch Government pursuing, is a more proactive engagement with its companies.  Short of banning business relations with settlements, a government could at the very least actively provide advice or even seek to dissuade domiciled companies from engaging in business practices that are at risk of entangling them in internationally unlawful activities.  It is something the Irish Government could be more proactive in doing.</p></speech>

The challenge now for Ireland is to ensure the database is used as an active document that should be fully financed and regularly updated.  It is one of Sadaka's strong advocacy policies with representatives of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  The database enables us to make active choices about who to give our business to.  All the companies on the list are actively profiting from the denial of human rights to the Palestinian people and Sadaka is strongly of the view that Ireland should do everything possible to defend and protect this database and develop it further.</p></speech>

I am not somebody who would be completely <i>au fait</i>with what has been going on in Israel for the past while.  Like many, I have been detached, to a degree, in looking at it and feeling we are not empowered to do much about it.  I am shocked by the GDP figures supplied by Sadaka, particularly the idea of 100 times the value being evident in settlements than from the Palestinians.  As has been mentioned, Ireland has shown leadership in the past and from communities before any action was taken by the Government.</p><p>What will the housing and settlement policy be under Mr. Naftali Bennett?  Do the witnesses foresee a change in it?  What about the influence of the US if the EU is slow to try to adopt new initiatives there?</p><p>As I have said, I am not fully aware of what the witnesses have been doing but the database they have mentioned should be publicised.  Irish people are perceptive and receptive to such matters.  There are many people involved with supply chain and component manufacturing and it is hard to see their participation in the end product.  It is something that must be thought about.  With regard to the Palestinian GDP trajectory, the witnesses have indicated that the EU is the largest supporter in innovation.  Outside the EU, who is supporting budgets to advance innovation in Palestinian GDP?</p><p>My final point refers to the occupied territories Bill.  To what extent is our multinational and foreign direct investment sector a component in the Government's resistance to advancing the legislation?</p></speech>

On the Israeli Government's settlement policy, we are in the early days in the life of the Israeli Government, which has such a heterogenous political composition.  My view is that because of the difficulties in the Israeli Government, which needs a balance between centre left and right-wing ideology, there will be a continuation of the settlement policy under Mr. Netanyahu.  Over the past few weeks we have seen that continuation.</p> <p>  Settlement policy is not just about the building of these settlements, which is continuing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but it is also about the forcible dispossession of Palestinians.  That continues in the likes of Silwan, Sheikh Jarrah or Humsa in the Jordan Valley or elsewhere.  Some of the mood music may change in the future if, hypothetically, there is US pressure.  Perhaps they will try to row back some of the more egregious examples of Israeli settlement building and eviction of Palestinians.</p><p>While there could be some tweaks to that on the margins, the full thrust of Israel's settlement policy will remain unchanged.  It has remained unchanged since 1967, irrespective of who has been Prime Minister.</p><p> On US influence, my advice to European governments would be that at a moment in which the prospects for meaningful negotiations are not just deadlocked but have frankly evaporated and at a moment in which the US has limited bandwidth and is not seeking to prioritise this conflict beyond some minimum conflict management measures, there is clearly an opening for the EU and its member states to take a more forward leaning and proactive role.  The preference is to focus on the bigger picture political issues and the need to revive negotiations.  My advice is to focus on the fundamentals.  When it comes to Israel, the fundamental issue is the need to check its settlement activities and the effect this can produce on the domestic conversation within Israel.  My plea to European governments is to invest some effort and political capital in that.  Perhaps the US Government will, at least privately, be receptive to seeing Europe taking a more forward leaning role and investing political capital to take real action in support of the future revival of negotiations.</p></speech>

How can they also become away of the importance of looking at labelling and requesting labelling that shows exactly who is involved in the supply chain and if products are coming from the occupied territories?</p></speech>

A more popular version has been published by an organisation called Visualizing Palestine.  In that version one can easily see the different companies and their activities.  The tools and information are available on the Internet and it is about bringing that closer to the public and the broad citizenry.  That is where civil society is already playing a role and parliamentarians can also do so with their constituencies.</p></speech>

Perhaps someone Irish would be better placed than me so Mr. &Oacute; hAinmhire might comment.  On foreign support, this mostly goes to budgetary support for the Palestinian Authority and then there is also support for the humanitarian sector.  The EU and its member states lead on this.  We need to recognise that funding support has decreased across the board, especially among Arab donors.  Money from the US is mostly suspended for domestic legislative reasons.  It is a worrying backdrop that this financial support is declining.</p></speech>

The then Government had indicated that it was going to use a money message, which may not have been entirely relevant but that was the means it was going to use to not advance the Bill.</p> <p>  On the UN database, I understand that it was developed in Geneva at the UN Human Rights Council and there is a feeling that there may be some pressure not to proceed, not to fund it further and not to develop it.  It needs to be updated on a regular basis.  This is one area in which Ireland could be involved at EU level and at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to ensure the database is defended, developed and updated.</p></speech>

It has been a useful debate.  We have heard some good facts, which were horrific at the same time, on the volume of goods from the occupied territories that are making their way across the EU.  I visited Palestine five years ago and saw for myself that Israel is implementing apartheid there.  Israel is an apartheid state and it is important to put that on the record.  Like so many others, I am hugely frustrated about the occupied territories Bill in particular because we know there is good legal advice stating that it is in line with EU law.  There is no consensus on the Attorney General's opinion.</p> <p>  I have to be frank and call out Fine Gael because we know that party opposed the occupied territories Bill. The T&aacute;naiste is on record as saying that he opposed the Bill on political and legal grounds.  How is it acceptable in this day and age for the Fine Gael party to stand against a Bill that has the full support of the Irish people and which would do something concrete and would help us lead the way in tackling apartheid?  I am old enough to remember the Dunnes Stores strikers, I stood with them as a teenager and I remember the stance they took against apartheid.  I remember that there were political parties and participants that were reluctant to come on board back then too.  It is shocking that we are still in that state of play today.</p> <p>  I am intrigued by the issue of the UN database because, as many other speakers have indicated, this is important and it is a powerful means of information to help share facts relating to companies that are investing in illegal settlements.  What are the witnesses' views on why the Irish Government has not expressed support for this to date?  Surely this is the least we can do.</p></speech>

It is clear that the Israeli Government has exerted considerable political effort, in partnership with some Israeli right-wing civil society organisations, to delegitimise the database by depicting it as a blacklist, which it is not, or by depicting it as BDS, which it is not and by levelling accusations at it and at the proponents of it as variously supporting anti-Semitic and anti-Israel actions and so on.  That has created a political climate in which many governments are reluctant to wade too deeply into this for fear of exposing themselves to what has become a politically divisive conversation, which it is not.  It should be clear why this is so.  Nevertheless, that is the result of Israeli efforts to make this a divisive issue.</p> <p>  To go back to the point I made earlier, there is also a fear that we have seen echoed on other actions, whether it is recognising Palestine or banning settlement products, that this is harmful to the prospect of peace negotiations and that somehow this undercuts the prospects of peace.  We need to take a step back and appreciate the political context in which there is no prospect of meaningful negotiations at the moment.  Those are two issues but I will reserve judgment on the Irish Government's motivations for someone else.</p></speech>

I will again ask the panel about the stance of the EU because gross hypocrisy is going on.  The EU and Israel have signed an energy infrastructure agreement, which will effectively lock in the occupied territories in terms of future trade.  I appreciate what Mr. Lovatt said about the powerful lobbying the Israeli Government, or apartheid regime, has undertaken.  However, if the EU is not going to deliver is there not a greater onus on the Irish Government to act at a national level, specifically, by supporting Senator Black's occupied territories Bill?</p></speech>

There should be few illusions about how far the EU can go in its policy over the next number of years.  In the longer term, possibly, the political dynamics between member states will change but we still see distinct space in the EU both at EU and member state level - not all states but perhaps half of them - to progress the policy of differentiation.  This is where the focus should be in terms of a practical effort to move some matters forward.  It is not a silver bullet that will help end the occupation on its own but starting from where EU politics are at this point, there is space to do something meaningful which will add weight to all the proclamations and statements the EU and national governments are making about the illegality and unhelpfulness of the Israeli settlements.  We recommend that is what is focused on.</p></speech>

The EU Members of the HRC therefore abstained on the vote on the Resolution.  Despite these reservations, Ireland fully cooperated with requests for assistance [from] the Office of the High Commissioner...in the task [that] they had been assigned. </blockquote></speech>

The way the UN office handled the database has alleviated concerns that it would be too broad.  That is why countries like Belgium and Sweden, even before the publication of the database and it was clear where it was heading, expressed support for it.  We still have not heard such a position from the Irish Government which, again, is strange given its otherwise very outspoken and clear position on the settlement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#J00800"><p>I will follow up on a couple of matters.  In one sense, I imagine it must be frustrating for the witnesses contributing today if they are trying to see some advancement.  It is important to try to take something away from these actions that can be progressed.  It is very important to state that perception is reality to people.  Communication is very important.  If people are not informed or communication is not available to them, one cannot move public opinion.  I often think that politicians follow people, not the other way around.  Some politics lead but a lot of politicians follow.  Dunnes Stores was a case in point.</p> <p>  I will go back to the database issue.  Senator Garvey offered some access to two Green Party MEPs.  It is very important to progress that today in respect of labelling issues, in particular, and to try to bring it up within the EU.  Is there ring-fenced funding to keep the present database updated and supported?  The occupied territories Bill is obviously part of this policy of differentiation.  Perhaps the Bill is too far for the Government to go at this point in time but there is no reason we could not enact something to support a policy of differentiation.  Again, this will require communication and I do not know who can lead or fund that.  </p> <p>  Certainly, the Irish people are very well aware of discrimination and inequity.  They do not like it no matter where they see it, whether it is racism or anything else.  We are one of the most inclusive societies.  People would be publicly appalled if the disparity in GDP and the throttling down of the Palestinian economy by the Israelis was widely known.  Is there some way the witnesses can look at trying to get large-scale public advancement and communication, and marketing and advertising, out there to try to inform public opinion?  That is probably the best way of getting politicians to follow.</p></speech>

We will continue to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#J01000"><p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; hAinmhire but the problem I am pointing to, and I class myself as somebody who is reasonably well informed, is that I am not necessarily going to land on the Sadaka website.  I am talking about some kind of larger scale or very targeted communications to try to put these inequities out there and highlight them to people, even by getting simple messages about the ratios of Palestinian versus settler GDP into the consumer space, forcing people to think about what they buy, how they act, how they can influence what is going on and trying to inform them.  We need more than a political discussion.  We need a really public campaign on that.</p></speech>

There is far more support for measures targeting Israeli settlements than perhaps some governments would seem to indicate.  That also applies to the US, which is another conversation.  There is a support base so the question is, if the public is there, is it time for governments to build on that and to lead?</p></speech>

I am just trying to highlight it.  Mr. Lovatt is correct that the public is far ahead of the politics on this but it is a question of trying to create the pressure that will force politicians to follow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#J01300"><p>I apologise but I will have to leave the meeting after my contribution.  I am conscious of the need to put information into the public domain.  I do not want to overuse the Dunnes Stores strike example but it is my genuine belief that in that case people switched from just looking for the best value oranges or products to actually looking at where those products came from.  It was a very important moment in our history.  Deputy Shanahan made a good point on what role we might have in putting that sort of information into the public domain.  I share what I think is his belief in that once people know, are informed and have the information, they will come down on the side of the Palestinian people.  I cannot see how they would not.</p> <p>  The EU position on the databases dates from 2016.</p><p>Obviously, a lot has happened since then.  Is it possible to revisit that position?  Would there by any value in doing so?  Belgium and other countries have come out in support of the database.  Is there anything the committee could advise the Government to do in this regard?  That is a decision for the committee to make at a later date.   This might be a case where the people are, in the main, ahead of most politicians.  The committee may be able to use its position to advise the Government to follow the lead of Belgium.  From that would come a really necessary mainstream conversation.  I have been to many pro-Palestinian meetings, protests and so on during my time working for a union and up to now.  We have to stop speaking to ourselves and begin speaking to the public on this issue.  It is a message to which many people would be very receptive.  The strike evidenced that.  I refer to the fact that people in local shops are checking from where the products they purchase come.  That is certainly the case in my local shop.  It is important to make as much of that information as possible available.  Is there value in the committee deciding at a later stage to engage with the Government and request that it follow the lead of Belgium and other countries, given that there does not seem to be a significant amount of hostility from the Government towards doing so?</p><p> I am mindful of the comments of Senator Gavan.  We know from where the blockages are coming.  It would be silly not to acknowledge that we know it comes specifically from one party, but with support from the other two parties in government.  I will not give a free pass to those two parties.  Is there value in Ireland doing what Belgium has done?  Would that be a worthwhile endeavour?  I wish to take from this meeting actions that the committee can consider.</p></speech>

There are some comments I wish to make.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Konen&yacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#K00300"><p>I will try to be brief to allow time for Mr. Lovatt to reply.  Doing what the Deputy has suggested would be very useful.  What the Government can do specifically is maybe not simply to express support for the database, which would be useful, but, most importantly, look for practical solutions with regard to ensuring the continued updating of the database.  That includes the issue of the budget for the UN to be able to do this.  It is about the Irish Government, along with other governments, reaching out to other member states and the UN secretariat in Geneva to jointly look for a solution in terms of how this globally important work can be continued.  I am sure practical solutions can be found as long as there is a little bit of political will.</p> <p>  Another issue worth considering is whether to focus only on the database or to also focus on the broader set of issues we are raising in this conversation and in our paper.  It may be the case that discussing with the Government how the differentiation policy can be advanced more broadly, looking at several specific issues, of which the database is one, could be even more interesting and productive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.88" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Lovatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#K00400"><p>I will add two quick points specifically on the database.   There is a question to be put to the Government and the relevant Ministries regarding how they reflect the findings of the database when it comes to their engagement with companies that are domiciled in Ireland.  Members may recall that the Irish Government has published business advisory for companies which warns of the reputational, financial and legal risks of doing business in the settlements.  The UN database is, in many ways, the embodiment of those warnings.  As a result, there is a question about whether the database should now be an opportunity for the Government to take a more proactive stance toward the companies, as has been discussed.</p> <p>  The blockage is mostly political and, in that context, Ireland has an important role to play in mainstreaming the understanding and acceptance of the database, both with other member states and at EU level, but also at the UN, using its seat on the UN Security Council.  Being able to embrace the database and state it is perfectly legitimate and acceptable and it is actually the minimum we should be doing would be a powerful message in itself.</p></speech>

That is true.  Ireland has shown leadership.  This is a question of leadership.  Rather than just rowing in with the consensus at EU level, it is about taking a stand and pushing on certain issues.</p> <p>  On differentiation, I have noticed many parliamentary questions have been tabled on the issue recently.  The question here really relates to the fact that we in Ireland indicate strongly that we do not trade with areas occupied in 1967.  How is that being done or implemented?  What processes and systems are in place to do that?  We have not managed to get any detail on systems that are in place.  As already stated, the trading system in the occupied territories is so complex that we need good systems and procedures to ensure the policy is implemented.</p></speech>

Let us try to end the meeting on a positive note, if we can, in terms of the specifics in that regard.  I am very taken by what Mr. &Oacute; hAinmhire just said.  We just do not know how Departments work in terms of procedures and systems to ensure the differentiation is applied properly.  We just do not have that information.  I am seeking a positive we can take from the meeting in terms of how to encourage the Government to really be proactive because I am not convinced the necessary conversations are currently happening from our side across Europe.  What steps do we need to take in terms of Ireland becoming a champion of the differentiation policy?  What are the concrete suggestions relating to those steps that we can take away from this meeting and bring to the Government?</p></speech>

That is probably what it would tell the members, as parliamentarians.  However, leadership is about more than just expressing support.  Leadership is when a member state takes the initiative and convenes a meeting with other member states on a certain issue or tables a written proposal for discussion with other member states or when a Government representative at the most senior level, such as a foreign minister, personally takes the issue forward and discusses it with fellow ministers, the European Commission or the UN High Representative.  I have not seen that level of leadership so far.  When there are discussions in the EU, member states need to take the lead in order for movement to occur.  Nothing moves in the EU without member states taking the lead and championing certain issues and moving them forward.  We have seen that if member states, even those smaller than Ireland, take a certain issue seriously, they can make a significant difference and advance a certain agenda.  Practically speaking, that is to what I refer in terms of leadership.</p> <p>  As regards concrete steps within the differentiation basket, we have listed several of them in our written submission but those are just examples.  There are more things that could be considered.  We do not want the discussion to be stuck on the details at this stage.</p><p>It is important to advance the discussion on all possible options to advance differentiation.  We would be happy to discuss some of the specific options now, if that would be useful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#L00200"><p>It would be useful.  I have one last point.  It is clear that the EU has taken strong steps on Russia's action against Crimea.  I am at a loss to understand why the EU cannot take those same steps with regard to the apartheid regime that Israel is implementing in the occupied territories.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.94" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Lovatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#L00300"><p>I will pick up on a few of Mr. Konen&yacute;'s points.  We can continue to expand and deepen the conversation on practicalities.  The idea of crafting a coalition of like-minded states is at the heart of any action.  This is not just about bringing together like-minded governments but also about bringing together like-minded ministries and exchanging best practices at a ministerial working level.  Other states have also encountered technical challenges with implementing differentiation and have come up with some solutions.  Likewise, Ireland has perhaps come up with some solutions which it can also share as best practice with other member states.  It is also a matter of building a coalition of the willing at the parliamentary and committee levels and trying to connect these various initiatives that are taking place, both in this House and elsewhere.  Labelling is an example of where that happened because a number of foreign ministers came together who actively pushed successive high representatives to come up with a solution and guidelines.  Why not replicate that elsewhere?</p> <p>  At a national level, there needs to be a more proactive Government policy to audit or review the full spectrum of national level relations with Ireland.  This is not all about EU-level agreements.  Ireland has some agreements with Israel, including a taxation agreement.  The Government's policies are good.  In large part, that is thanks to the efforts of the Irish Parliament, which has pressed the Government to clarify its positions.  The next stage, as Mr. Konen&yacute; said, now that the Government has made its positions clear and indicated that its remit does not apply to the settlements, is the question of how that policy is given effect and what mechanisms there are to ensure that.  Even coming up with those technical actions is important not just in an Irish context but also with regard to sharing best practice and solutions with other member states, which may also be looking at similar issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Konen&yacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021071400002#L00400"><p>There are already some good practices for Ireland to share with other member states.  As we mentioned, Ireland has explicitly made clear that bilateral agreements between Ireland and Israel only apply to Israel within its internationally recognised, pre-1967 borders, and that they do not apply to the settlements.  A few member states have stated that, but not many.  It is important to increase the number of member states which are explicit about this.  To give another specific example which is more at the EU level, there is no common advice for European businesses about whether to invest and have other economic links in settlements.  A number of member states, including Ireland, have such an advisory on government websites.  We counted 18 member states with such an advisory.  Those were jointly agreed several years ago.  The EU has not published such an advisory.  This is a tiny, simple step that could be taken at EU level, but all of this requires demand and requests from member states.  It is only then that things will happen.</p></speech>

An audit and review of exactly where we are with regard to goods would be invaluable.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

I am pleased to welcome Ms Suzanne Keatinge, CEO of D&oacute;chas, and Ms Caoimhe de Barra, CEO of Tr&oacute;caire.  A special welcome to Ms Gloria Soma, director of the Titi Foundation in South Sudan, who is joining us from Sudan.  I also welcome Mr. Dominic MacSorley, CEO of Concern Worldwide, who is no stranger to development matters.  They are very welcome to our meeting.  It is most timely because this is the last week of our parliamentary session.  When we come back in late August or early September, thoughts and minds will firmly turn towards budgetary matters.  I felt it was important that we had an opportunity to have this engagement prior to that.</p><p>The format of the meeting is that we will hear an opening statement from the witnesses which, we understand, will be delivered by Ms Keatinge, before going into a question-and-answer session with members of the committee.  As we are quite time limited due to Covid restrictions, I ask that witnesses be concise and conscious of the time constraints when initially addressing our committee.  I ask members to be concise in order to allow all members an opportunity to ask questions.</p><p>I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that we should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make any person readily identifiable or engage otherwise in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identified person or entity, you will be directed to discontinue your remarks.  It is imperative that any direction be complied with. </p><p>For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, you may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who might be physically present does.  Witnesses participating in the committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised to be mindful of the domestic law and how it may apply to evidence given. </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located either in the Leinster House complex here or the conference centre where the D&aacute;il and Seanad are meeting in plenary session today. </p><p>For anybody watching this meeting online, some Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely due to these unprecedented circumstances.  As a large number of people are attending the meeting remotely, I ask that everybody bear with us in the event that any technical difficulties may interrupt or in any way adversely affect our proceedings. </p><p>I am very pleased to call on Ms Keatinge to make the opening statement.  I acknowledge the timing of her letter in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, which made for very good early morning reading for me and, I am sure, members of our committee.  The timing is also significant, having regard to last night's vote in our neighbouring jurisdiction, the UK, on a cut to the international development assistance budget.  Without pre-empting anything that might be said in this meeting, I am sure committee members will join with me in warning our Government not to envisage a similar type of cut in our budget in the autumn.  I note the reason or excuse given was because of Covid.</p><p>I take the view that precisely because of Covid-19 and how it affects developing world, poor and disadvantaged areas, it would be a reason to ensure an increase in our budget rather than a cut, as we have seen in our neighbouring jurisdiction.  In any event we will have an opportunity over the next hour or more to detail some of the issues.  I am very pleased to call on Ms Keatinge to lead off with her opening statement.</p></speech>

As the Chairman has said himself, this is such an important moment and budget for us particularly because of Covid-19.  I am therefore very grateful on behalf of D&oacute;chas and are our members to have the opportunity to engage with the joint committee this morning on our pre-budget submission.</p> <p>  I am very conscious that it is almost the summer holidays so we appreciate the committee attending here this morning and I hope that it shows a real sense of urgency and the importance of budget 2022 from the perspective of Irish international agencies which make up the D&oacute;chas network.  Together, D&oacute;chas members - development, human rights and humanitarian organisations -  employ more than 5,000 people in Ireland and many more globally, supporting local communities in more than 100 countries across the world.  They and their local partners can be considered Ireland&rsquo;s global front-line workers as they work around the clock, often in very insecure environments, to contain the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  I hope the committee will see then from the detail in our pre-budget submission that this has been no ordinary year.</p> <p>  The pandemic has not only been a global public health crisis but has shown the widening gap between rich and poor and threatened for the first time in decades development gains such as the fight to eradicate poverty and hunger, and of equal importance, the progression of human rights commitments related, in particular, to gender equality, including equal access to education for girls and for people with disabilities.  The pandemic has also allowed some governments to roll back on their commitments on human rights, including protecting human rights defenders as well as protecting civilians in times of war and respecting international humanitarian law.</p> <p>  We come before the joint committee today because we believe the pandemic, climate change and conflict are shared burdens that can only be resolved through collective action by governments, by the joint committee members as politicians, by NGOs, by businesses and, perhaps most important of all, by local communities themselves.  Given the critical value of Ireland&rsquo;s international development co-operation, especially Irish Aid, and Ireland&rsquo;s very significant diplomatic efforts on the UN Security Council, I ask the joint committee to formally contact the Government in support of our pre-budget submission and, in particular, to contact the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Deputy Coveney and the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid and diaspora, Deputy Brophy.</p> <p>  Our key ask is that now more than ever, particularly in light of the devastating impact of Covid-19, the Government needs to increase its spending on official development assistance, ODA, if it is to deliver on its own Global Ireland: Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025 strategy and Irish Aid&rsquo;s international development policy, A Better World, which pledges that we will leave no one behind.  Specifically, the Government needs to increase ODA in real terms in budget 2022 and offer a clear pathway to achieving 0.5% of gross national income, GNI, by 2025 and onwards to the UN internationally-recognised target of 0.7% by 2030.</p> <p>  We would also ask that all political parties represented here today, as well as any non-party representatives, recommit in their own pre-budget submissions to reaching the target of spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA.</p> <p>  With the permission of the Chairman, I will now take the joint committee briefly through the other key points of our pre-budget submission before welcoming Caoimhe de Barre, CEO of Tr&oacute;caire, who will introduce one of its partners, Gloria Soma, director of the Titi Foundation speaking to the committee from South Sudan on what it has been like to live through this pandemic.  Dominic MacSorely, CEO of Concern, will also briefly provide opening words to give an insight from his organization on the importance and impact of ODA in the fight against hunger.</p> <p>  It is worth recalling that the Government in its Programme for Government: Our Shared Future recommitted itself to reaching Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing target of spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA by 2030.  We have also been encouraged by the continued support across the political spectrum to reaching this target.  However, it is important to remind the joint committee members today that from a high of 0.58% in 2008, our aid spending fell and has since stagnated.  When the sustainable development goals were signed by Ireland in New York in 2015 by this Government our spend had fallen to just 0.32% of GNI.  It fell further last year to 0.31% despite the welcome cash increase of &euro;30 million bringing the total amount to &euro;868 million.  The latest Government estimates on ODA suggest that it will increase to 0.32% this year.  This is below the average reached by many other EU member states in the OECD which is at 0.5%.</p> <p>  We therefore need to impress on this joint committee that the Government needs to increase the pace of spending on ODA so that we do not let another year slip by.  Time is no longer on our side.  In budget 2022 Ireland needs to make much more determined progress.</p> <p>  This committee is well aware that Ireland is recognized around the world for its principled and high quality aid programme.  We have previously mentioned that the OECD Development Assistance Committee, DAC, in its peer review last year said that Ireland&rsquo;s programme is &ldquo;strong with many areas of excellence&rdquo; and that Ireland &ldquo;walks the talk&rdquo; in prioritising the furthest behind.</p> <p>  However, that peer review also stressed that more needs to be done to match Ireland&rsquo;s political willingness to reach the internationally recognised target of aid spending.  In other words, what we do with our ODA is very strong and has real impact on the ground but we simply need to do more of it.</p> <p>  It is incredible to think that we have still been unable to physically meet with the joint committee for over 15 months now.  Who would have imagined it this time last year?  We regret also that for some of the members it has not been possible to experience for themselves the amazing work of Irish international NGOs on the ground.  Nor have they been able to experience what it feels like to visit a refugee camp, or experience the sights and sounds of being in a village devastated by locusts or flooding, or indeed to understand what social distancing feels like in an urban slum in one of the many mega-cities mushrooming around the world.</p> <p>  All of us here today, however, understand and appreciate the enormous impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had on our lives and on our communities.  We all know families who have suffered bereavement, whose livelihoods have been damaged, and whose lives and future opportunities have been significantly altered.  We appreciate too the massive long-term toll that the pandemic may have on our economy and society.</p> <p>  It is with this backdrop that I ask the joint committee members today to live up to our roles as global citizens and to appreciate the devastating impact of the pandemic on countries already suffering from hunger, conflict, drought and locusts.  Quite simply, it has become a matter of life and death with frail and fragile health systems breaking down and with people having nowhere else to turn.</p> <p>  D&oacute;chas's pre-budget submission provides some devastating statistics on the impact of the pandemic but equally important some positive examples on how Irish NGOs and their local partners are rising to the challenge.  We can get through this if we work together.</p> <p>  It is by keeping these vulnerable communities at the forefront of our conversation today, indeed at the heart of policy-making, that D&oacute;chas calls on the Government in advance of budget 2022 to do the following - increase Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance to ensure Ireland keeps pace with global needs now and in the post-Covid-19 environment; ensure additional and targeted financing for climate change mitigation and adaptation to support least-developed countries, LDCs, and small island developing states, SIDS; use Ireland&rsquo;s voice at the UN Security Council, at the EU and in other international forums to champion human rights defenders and the role being played by civil society; advocate to ensure that the global community produces enough vaccine doses for everyone, everywhere; and lastly to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s global leadership on sustainable development goal 2: zero hunger.</p><p>I thank the committee for its attention and its ongoing support to D&oacute;chas and its members.  I will hand over to Ms de Barra, CEO of Tr&oacute;caire.</p></speech>

We are witnessing the triple threat of coronavirus, climate change and conflict.  These are in danger of creating a long-term humanitarian catastrophe from which the world may not recover but that is not inevitable.  It is the people in the most vulnerable situations and most fragile countries who are suffering the worst health and socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic.  We, in organisations such as Tr&oacute;caire, Concern and others, together with our local partners have seen this unfolding directly through out work and have witnessed the devastating human impact of it.  At a broad scale, in the two decades to 2020, huge progress had been achieved in reducing poverty.  The number of people living in poverty globally fell by 1 billion over those two decades.  However, the World Bank estimates that as a result of Covid-19, an additional 120 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty.  In addition, over the course of the next ten years, as a result of climate change a further 130 million people are also at risk of extreme poverty.  My point is there is a compound impact of Covid, climate change and conflict.  It was great to hear the Cathaoirleach say he believed Covid and the Covid crisis are reasons to increase aid, not decrease it, and we fully agree and endorse that.</p> <p>  However, Covid is not the only crisis affecting people; it is compounding multiple crises.  For example, Ethiopia is experiencing its worst hunger crisis in 20 years.  Across the entirety of east Africa 30 million people are also facing extreme levels of food insecurity as a result of climate, drought, flooding, locust infestation and conflict.  In Syria, a country that has suffered ten years of conflict, we are seeing the highest ever need for humanitarian assistance.  Its humanitarian needs have increased by 20% over the last 12 months alone.  Covid-19 continues to spread at an alarming rate in that context while the healthcare infrastructure, decimated by years of conflict, remains woefully inadequate to respond.  However, we are having an impact through Irish Aid.  Our partnership, as Tr&oacute;caire alone, delivers life-saving and life-changing programmes in some of the poorest and most vulnerable communities in the world.  For example - and this is just one agency with Irish Aid funding - we managed to reach 426,000 individuals in the past year with support to mitigate the direct and secondary impacts of Covid-19.  The direct impacts are health impacts and the secondary impacts are almost more impactful and devastating, such as food insecurity, violence against women and violence against human rights defenders.</p> <p>  As Ms Keatinge said, increased overseas development assistance, ODA, is needed now more than ever.  Ensuring we do not lose the major development gains due to the pandemic will be difficult but it is achievable.  We believe we must step up and respond to the scale of the crisis with appropriate ambition and action.  I am delighted to hand over to Ms Gloria Soma, who will be able to give us a clear perspective from a country that has been ravaged by the three issues we have mentioned here, namely Covid, climate and conflict.</p></speech>

I have worked in South Sudan for the last eight years and have experienced first-hand the scale of the humanitarian need but also the positive impact of development assistance on the ground.  South Sudan marked its tenth anniversary last week.  It is the world&rsquo;s youngest nation and continues to face immense hunger, violence and now the challenges of Covid-19.  The humanitarian situation in South Sudan is getting worse due to the cumulative effects of years of conflict and violence, climate shocks, including recurring floods and droughts, and now the impact of Covid-19.  We estimate 8.3 million people to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021, which is nearly 70% of the population.  The expectation is 7.7 million people will face crisis-level food insecurity or worse.  This is an increase of 15% on 2020.  The added challenges of the health impacts of Covid-19, along with the related impacts of lockdowns, rising food prices, unemployment, falling incomes and school closures, all exacerbated by a lack of access to vaccines, have really set us back.  Economic pressure can often manifest in gendered ways, and approximately 1,500 teenage girls in the equatorial states have been married off or are pregnant.  The temporary closure of schools has disrupted children&rsquo;s education, limited access to services such as school feeding programmes and increased exposure to gender-based violence.  Many girls who have left will not return to school again.  As ever, it is the poorest who are being hit hardest.  Despite the roll-out of vaccines that we have seen in Ireland, vaccine access in South Sudan remains low.  South Sudan has received fewer than 900,000 vaccines via the COVAX system and communities have not been adequately engaged in the roll-out process, which means poor uptake across the population.  The weak health system of South Sudan is a further challenge to the roll-out.  The importance of access to vaccines, Ireland&rsquo;s support for the proposed waiver on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, and public health support for the people of South Sudan cannot be overstated.</p> <p>  I would like to finish with the good news though.  The impact of Irish Aid funding in South Sudan has been immense.  Tr&oacute;caire&rsquo;s office in South Sudan, in partnership with local organisations like mine, has received just under &euro;620,000 of Irish Aid funding in 2020 and into early 2021.  With this, we have reached over 18,495 people with a combination of support, including food assistance, access to safe water, agricultural support, psychosocial and gender-based violence support and menstrual hygiene kits, which help to keep young girls in school.  Lockdown came to South Sudan in April 2020 and between January and September 2020, my organisation saw over 6,000 reported incidents of gender-based violence against women and girls.  Through Irish Aid-funded projects, cases of gender based violence have been identified, which have been reported and referred onwards.  These cases would otherwise have been left unreported.  Tr&oacute;caire&rsquo;s programme on gender inequality has resulted in increased reporting of gender-based violence cases.  It has also allowed us to push for more prosecutions of sexual abuse against women and girls.  It has helped us increase economic opportunities for women to gain financial independence, to support women&rsquo;s participation in community peace-building initiatives and to build a flourishing women&rsquo;s leadership programme where women leaders support new and emerging leaders.  Real change can be delivered only by working in partnership with local communities affected by poverty and injustice.  They know what works, they know what needs to change and are working to make this happen.  They just need your solidarity to make this a reality.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and the clerk to the committee for facilitating this important discussion at such a critical time in the budget 2022 negotiations.  Our core message is Ireland&rsquo;s aid is not only a lifeline for millions of people but it is also an investment in a better, more peaceful, world.  Its impact cannot be underestimated and it is needed now more than ever.</p> <p>  The pandemic has been a brutal reminder of our collective vulnerability and interdependence.  Concern is an organisation that is hard-wired to respond to emergencies but we had never had to deal with a crisis that affected all of our country programme and home offices at the same time.  However, our commitment to stay and deliver during crises held strong and we had three key priorities, namely, to protect the health and safety of our 4,000 staff, to adapt our ongoing programmes to keep them operating to the fullest extent possible and to scale up Covid prevention messages across all the communities we work with.  For example, we installed 1,200 extra water and sanitation stations inside Syria.  We distributed soap and clean water to 600,000 displaced people in South Sudan, where Ms Soma is working.</p><p>We work closely with the ministry of education in Sierra Leone to ensure that children can continue their education remotely.  With our partners, we provided Covid prevention training and messaging to close to 20 million last year.  Closer to home, we were able to allow 9,300 Irish students to continue the school debates programme online.  All of these programmes were supported by Irish Aid.  Central to our ability to pivot and be flexible was the flexibility and adaptability of the Irish Aid team, whose members worked tirelessly and were phenomenally supportive of all agencies in enabling us to respond so effectively.</p><p> To say that the pandemic has been devastating for the poorest people is an understatement.  There is a crisis on every level - health, gender-based violence, education, livelihoods, peace and, most important, hunger and a deepening inequality, which are disproportionately affecting women and children.  Late last year, we were part of a global survey of 16,000 households across 25 countries that looked at the impact of Covid across multiple levels.  What was notable was the direct impact of lockdowns on women working in the informal sector, who repeatedly stated that, if they did not work that day, they would not eat that night.  Some 60% of women had cut meals, mothers were eating less and last, and violence against women and children was spiralling, in some cases by a factor of four.  A staggering 270 million people are estimated to be acutely food insecure or at high risk.  That is an 81% increase since the onset of Covid.  The figures are mind numbing and staggering.</p><p> As Ms de Barra stated, we cannot blame Covid for everything.  Climate change has played a key role.  The 43 countries most at risk were all experiencing conflict-induced hunger before the pandemic.  In most of the countries where we are working, conflict is a key driver of food insecurity.  In Somalia, 3 million people are in integrated food security phase classification, IPC, 3.  This means that food consumption gaps are widening, matched with increased levels of acute malnutrition.  This is due to a combination of failed rains, conflict and a population that is still dealing with the impact of locusts.</p><p> Haiti is in the news due to the assassination of its President.  Prior to that, 12% of its population were classified as being in emergency phase 4.  This means high levels of acute malnutrition and excess mortality.  People had already started desperately selling off whatever assets they had.  Haiti, which Ireland has consistently supported for many years, is a country that has been in decline, but there was also a poor harvest last year.  The lack of remittances as a result of Covid became a key contributor.  Haiti is a classic example of the UN humanitarian appeal, which is a modest $235 million but is only 5.4% funded.  That is shocking, given the level of need.  Sadly, we know that these figures will get worse.  September to December will be a tough time for people who are depending on harvests.  With the Covid crisis deepening, the number of new cases is doubling every 18 days, with less than 2% of the population fully vaccinated.</p><p> Some front-line staff working with agencies in Liberia have got their vaccines.  Others were told yesterday that they would not get their second doses until August because supplies had run out.  These are the people who are treating cases.</p><p> The level of need is increasing and the level of funding relative to those needs is down.  The global humanitarian appeal of $35 billion is just 25% funded, which is the lowest we have seen and we are only mid-year.  Fortunately, Irish Aid, the EU and USAID are three of the key donors that have stayed the course and increased funding in response to the large-scale humanitarian crisis.  Unfortunately, we are not seeing the same from others, notably the UK, whose recent cuts to aid already amounted to &pound;5 billion this year.  I know that Tr&oacute;caire and GOAL have been affected.  For us, we are looking at cuts of more than $8 million across Malawi, Sierra Leone and Bangladesh with little notice and dire consequences for the poorest communities.</p><p> We must ensure that this does not happen again.  We recognise that this is a difficult message to send home because there are significantly increased needs at home, but it is an even more important message now.  For this reason, we must not just highlight to the public, the voters and the media the urgency of the crisis we are facing, but also the positive impact that aid is having.  An important part of that message is the good news story of prevention and how timely and effective interventions can prevent the horrific images of starvation and suffering.</p><p> It was in July 2011 that the world saw the first famine of the 21st century.  Former President Mary Robinson travelled to Somalia with RT&Eacute;, Concern, GOAL and Tr&oacute;caire.  She sat and listened to the stories of affected families of leaving children and older people behind in order to save the rest of the family.  More than 260,000 people lost their lives tragically in what was a slow and underfunded response.  Five years later, humanitarian actors used improved early warning systems, built with the support of Irish Aid, to respond to and avert four large-scale famines in north-east Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.  This was a phenomenal achievement in terms of early warning and early action.  It is important that we remember Ireland's essential role in preventing crises and famines and fighting hunger.  It is not just a policy strategy.  It is in our DNA and has allowed us to have the foresight to provide solidarity to people caught up in crisis.</p><p> We must also remember that Ireland is one of the few donors that provide multi-annual funding in humanitarian crises, a decision that changes and saves lives.  I saw this first hand in the Central African Republic.  It is a country where 2 million people depend on humanitarian aid but there is a shortfall of approximately 60% in humanitarian funding.  Ireland is providing Concern and other Irish agencies in the Central African Republic with a five-year funding timeframe.  Do committee members know how that changes conversations when we go into communities, say that we will be there for the next five years, we have the backing of the Irish people and we do not have to worry about being gone in six months' time because we could not find additional funding, and we can sit down with the communities to discuss how to plan with them to change the situation positively?  It is transformative.  The ministry in the Central African Republic asked us not just to tell the Irish people "Thank you", but to tell the other donors that this mattered.  We are telling them.  We are rightly promoting Ireland's reputation globally.</p><p> Ireland is not the largest donor, but it is one of the most respected for being principled and meeting the highest standards of accountability and effectiveness.  The Irish Aid team's level of demand for accountable and quality programmes has made what each of our agencies is doing stronger.  Its partnership is deep and demanding, but it is focused on where need is greatest and is connected to and informed by the realities on the ground.  There is a uniquely Irish aspect to the relationship.  It means that Concern and other agencies have direct and open access to senior Irish diplomats and trusted and confidential briefings on highly sensitive situations.  I received a phone call out of the blue from H.E. Geraldine Byrne Nason, who was about to go into a sanctions committee.  She wanted to know what the impact of the sanctions would be on humanitarian operations in Somalia and North Korea.  She told me that she was going into the meeting in half an hour, that she wanted the data and that she wanted to say that she had spoken to the relevant people.  That is exactly the kind of relationship that has an impact.  It connects policy level to the ground, bringing authenticity and integrity to every conversation.  This represents real partnership in action.  I commend the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and its commitment to securing peace and addressing conflict as part of its tenure on the Security Council.  I also commend the team behind Irish Aid on the important role they play.</p><p> It is easy to get overwhelmed by the level of global need, but we have learned over the past year or two that human progress is not inevitable.  We have also learned that we are returning to a world we thought we had left behind.  Extreme poverty has increased for the first time in 20 years and famine, something that we believed had been consigned to history, is back.</p><p>However, history does not have to repeat itself.  Ensuring solidarity is essential in that effort.  Ireland's international aid programme is part of that solidarity and global leadership and a commitment to a better world.  I thank the committee for its time and its commitment to this issue.  I ask my colleagues here today to advocate for the necessary cross-Government support for Ireland's overseas aid programme.</p></speech>

I now turn to members of the committee.  I have received apologies for an inability to attend from Deputy Brady and Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  This 9.30 a.m. slot on Wednesday is not one to which we are accustomed but, as I said earlier, we were very keen to accommodate Ms Keatinge and the team during our last week's work of the term.  I know Deputy Stanton has had an interest in these matters for a long time.  I am pleased that he has joined us and I ask him to kick off proceedings.</p></speech>

It strikes me that, as we sit here today, our country is convulsed with a debate as to whether we should allow indoor dining and whether people should be allowed go into restaurants for slap-up feeds.  Now we hear about what is happening in other parts of the world.  The dichotomy between the First World and the Third World is enormous.  We hear about famine, war and conflict and, on top of all of that, climate change.  Climate change has almost taken a back seat as a result of Covid but we know that it is causing real hunger and devastation in many parts of the world.  It is not getting any better.  It is getting worse.</p> <p>  I understand the fundraising efforts of the different organisations in Ireland have been impacted by Covid and by the restrictions on fundraising.  How has that impacted on the organisations?  The need to bring what is happening across the world to the attention of Government, the Oireachtas, the people and the media was mentioned earlier.  It has been said more than once, especially with regard to Covid, that we should be in this together.  All those in underdeveloped countries should get the vaccine.  We need to roll out that vaccine because, if we do not, there is a risk that more and more variants will emerge and that these could eventually travel here and impact on us.  We are linked in that way.  </p> <p>  Having listened to the debate this morning, I detect a sense of hopelessness and devastation about the suffering going on across the world but I also detect a sense of hope that it can be better.  I certainly agree with the Chairman that we need to encourage Government to maintain funding, or to increase it if possible, and to use our position on the Security Council and in Europe to encourage other countries to do the same.  That is very important.  I know the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his team would agree with us in that regard.  We really need to write to Government and the Ministers and to do what we can to encourage our own Government and other governments to step up to the mark.  A small intervention can make a massive difference in some of these countries.  </p> <p>  We have heard the reports from the organisations.  The Chairman and I worked on the refugee crisis during the term of the last D&aacute;il when we were in the Department of Justice and Equality.  We met many people who had been through hell on earth.  We tried to have the greatest impact we could on what was going on and to help people and bring them here.  Unfortunately, we met resistance from some quarters in that regard.  There is a need for an education programme here in Ireland to help people to see what is going on in different parts of the world.  Our media have a very significant role to play in that because it is not reported enough.  What is happening in other parts of the world does, and will, have an impact on us here.  I again call on our media to highlight what is going on and to inform and educate people in Ireland so that they will again step up to the mark.  I understand there is approximately &euro;15 billion saved up in Ireland because people could not spend money.  That is a huge amount.  If a small proportion of this could be made available to the organisations that are here today, it would make a massive impact.</p> <p>  In all of my contribution I believe I only asked one question, which related to the impact Covid has had on the fundraising efforts of the organisations before us today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#E00400"><p>I thank our guests for coming in, for sharing their experiences and for updating us on their programmes across the world.  I absolutely agree with what Ms Keatinge said in her opening statement, which was that this has been no ordinary year.  It has not been an ordinary year for any of us but the support provided to local communities on the ground by groups such as Ms Keatinge's will be pivotal and really important for future generations not only in the immediate term or in five or ten years' time, but as far out as 25 or 30 years from now.  While the full impact of Covid is not yet known, we can see its visible impacts already.  I refer to extreme hunger, extreme poverty, issues of gender equality and access to education, and the impacts of conflict zones on civilians.  This is deeply concerning.  I will say in the strongest of terms that preventing any further loss of the gains that had been made in those areas must be seen as a priority.</p> <p>  I will disagree with my colleague, Deputy Stanton, in that I am of the opinion that, as Covid has drawn some areas more into focus, it has also brought climate change to greater prominence in people's minds because we were being advised to wash our hands while knowing that there are millions of people who do not have access to clean water.  The impact on those living in conflict zones and issues of food insecurity and extreme poverty have been brought much more to the fore.  I believe it was Mr. MacSorley who mentioned the triple threat.  Ireland has a key role to play and a real opportunity to build on the work that has been done to date in preventing crises before extreme hunger becomes famine and before we see images such as those I saw from Ethiopia on the screen when I was a toddler, images that have stayed with me ever since.  While I acknowledge that the Government has committed to achieving that UN target of 0.7% by 2030, a detailed roadmap as to how that is to be achieved will be key in the short term.  What is going to be done and when?  Targets need to be put in place as part of that year-on-year plan.  As a country, Ireland needs to bring those areas of expertise recognised by the OECD to other areas where there is emerging critical need, when that is possible, while also addressing the areas we already know of.</p> <p>  I will go back to the slippage of gains briefly.  It will take a generation to catch up on the slippage we have seen so far, particularly in the area of education.  It is not just a question of the reading, writing and literacy skills, but a question of everything else education represents, particularly in the context of gender equality, societal and economic changes and the opportunities these represent for the young girls who are now falling out of education.  It is time they will never get back.  In many cases, the potential opportunities are lost to them forever.  For others, it will take a significant period of time to rebuild what they have lost in their time out of education.  </p> <p>  I am most happy to hear vaccines mentioned.  This is going to be key, particularly in the poorest of countries.  We have seen variants arise quite regularly over the past year and a half.  We have also seen lockdowns come and go.  Until we get to a point at which a critical mass of people are vaccinated, that is not going to stop.  That puts us all at risk.  It has been said before, and I will say it again, that until we are all safe, none of us is safe.  We are a global community.</p><p>That is the world in 2021.  International travel is as easy as jumping onto a train or a bus would have been ten or 15 years ago.  The further impacts of those and the lack of vaccinations in developing and poorer countries will impact everybody.</p><p> Chairman, I agree with what you said about Covid-19 and the budget.  Cutting overseas aid at this time would be a retrograde step.  Things can get better, but things getting better does not happen by chance.  They happen through funding and planning, and through groups such as the groups here working with communities on the ground to empower them and give them the capability and resources to do for themselves as much as what we can do for them.  Notwithstanding the cuts that other countries may make, if funding from Ireland is not increased and remains the same, looking at it through the prism of Covid-19, what will be the impact on the work the organisations can do on the ground?  Will it be primarily focusing on the bedding down of programmes and regaining the gains lost through Covid-19?  Will there be any capability to extend the work they do?  What plans and programmes do the organisations have that cannot be implemented until the UN target of 0.7% is reached?  Outside of financial aid, what other areas of positive change could make a further impact on the relationships Mr. MacSorley discussed?  Are there other areas which could be improved that we should be looking at also as a priority?</p></speech>

They have set out a compelling and heart-rending case across all the areas, and I appreciate that.  I wish to comment rather than ask many questions.  It behoves all members of the committee to state publicly where we and the committee stand on all this.  I endorse your opening remarks, Chairman, which were supported by my two colleagues who contributed, on whether this year there should be a net increase in our contribution to overseas aid.  We should have a net increase this year.  Populist or wrong arguments could be made the other way in the context of the demands that Covid-19 places nationally, but there is an onus on us to do the opposite.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanton created a vivid picture when he said we are animatedly debating the reopening of restaurants at a time when so many in the world are starving, as was pointed out today.  The three contributing factors are the conflict, climate change and Covid-19.  The confluence and combination of those factors make it incumbent on us to support a net increase in the budget to support the organisations with us this morning, individually and under the umbrella of D&oacute;chas, in the work they are doing and to applaud that work.  It is important that the latter point made about transparency in the operations and accountability are all in place.  That is critical.  The witnesses make the case well around the world.  I do not have questions, just a supporting comment.  I will certainly be strongly supportive at any forum available to me of the committee's view stated by you, Chairman, that there should be a net increase in our budget this year.  It is the signal, but it is the way we will reach the 0.7%.  It is also very much the Irish signal that is required this year.  It is where we will show our calibre and quality.  The onus is on us to do it because of Covid-19 rather than in spite of it, as it were.</p></speech>

I will be very brief because I have a commitment outside Leinster House in a few minutes, so I will have to move quickly.  I thank our guests for attending.  They are always very welcome to appear before the committee.  I thank them for their submission which, as Senator Joe O'Reilly said, is compelling and heart-rending.  I echo Deputy Clarke's words that we must develop a roadmap to the 0.7% by 2030.  I will take this opportunity to state my party's position of support for that target for the multi-annual funding.  Irish people are very proud of the work these organisations do.  We probably are the best in the world at delivering meaningful aid to developing countries.  I believe supporting these organisations can be the most effective way of alleviating poverty, spending money and getting the best outcome for our investment.  Certainly, we and our party in the Government will do everything we can do to support the organisations and their requests and, indeed, to develop that roadmap through to 2030.</p> <p>  My apologies, but I must leave now.  Thank you, Chairman, for this opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#F00500"><p>I heard most of the presentations on the way in but, sadly, Mr. MacSorley filtered out shortly after he started.  I am sorry I did not hear all of his presentation.  The case the organisations make is very strong.  I will support it 100%, although I am a tiny cog in this very large wheel of Leinster House.  Particularly as we emerge from Covid-19, more aid must be put into the areas in which the organisations work.  It has always been a hobby-horse of mine that we can see the most deprived parts of the world where millions of dollars are spent on arms and ammunition, but we cannot feed the people in these areas.  It is an outright scandal.  Ireland should not step away from its commitments and, as most of my colleagues have said, it should increase its commitment to the areas in which the organisations work simply because ours is a wealthy country, regardless of whether we like it.  Over the next couple of years there will be a tightening of budgets as we emerge from the pandemic to try to get our economy back, but we must support those who cannot support themselves.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  I apologise to Mr. MacSorley, and I will read what he said.  However, I heard the contributions from Ms Keatinge and Ms de Barre and they make a compelling case.  I promise I will do anything I can within my office.  I am sorry I had to drop out for a short time, but I am back now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#F00600"><p>Thank you for your attendance, Senator.  I will refer to Ms Keatinge now.  There were a number of questions from members which I ask Ms Keatinge to distribute among our guests as appropriate.</p> <p>  I will briefly add to the questions that were asked by members.  Reference was made to Ireland's leadership role on the sustainable development goals.  Earlier this year, shortly after Christmas, we received a quite stark presentation on the manner in which the sustainable development goals and targets have, perhaps, run the risk of falling off the rails.  As it is July, six months later, Ms Keatinge might have an update on that.  I welcome Ms Soma from South Sudan and acknowledge the very bleak nature of her presentation.</p><p>I want to ask her about the movement of people and migration, which is a major challenge in South Sudan and in neighbouring areas.  What more can a country such as Ireland do in that regard?  It seems that the uninhibited movement of people from South Sudan and the neighbourhood, right up through north Africa to the coast, is continuing, while not at the scale that it was at over recent years.  How best might we assist the displaced people?</p><p> I will hand back to Ms Keatinge to answer the questions as appropriate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Keatinge" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#G00200"><p>I will ask my colleagues to help answer as many questions as possible and if there are more, we can come back to the committee.  Rest assured we are all here, including Mr. MacSorley, so we will be able to catch up on what we have said afterwards.</p> <p>  I will turn to Ms Soma in South Sudan first.  That is the most important testimony.  It will bring the lived experience for the committee and I will ask her to answer the question on what the likely impact on the ground is if aid is not increased.  I will then ask Mr. MacSorley to come in and after that I will ask Ms de Barra to talk about fundraising and vaccines.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gloria Soma" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#G00300"><p>I will talk about the issue of funding.  Donors love bringing it up because I am part of that testimony myself.  I know the impact of aid has been able to be bring me to be who I am today.  In the case of South Sudan, we all know that for a long time we have been aid dependent and the majority of people in my generation and those who have come after my generation are still dependent on issues related to aid.  It is what we know and what we have depended on for a long time.  Funding gives local communities, including both women and children, the hope to be able to continue to live sustainably and to live a dignified lifestyle in the country, given the fact that the leadership in the country cannot even provide basic services to their people.  It is critical at this moment and it has always been critical that, unfortunately, aid has been the backbone of survival for the majority of the population in the country.</p> <p>  On the issue of movement and migration that the Chairman raised, we have consistently seen that for a long time people's movements into different regions around east Africa have not been the will of the people but have happened because of the conflict that has been generated by the different warring parties in the country.  As such, people move to neighbouring countries for safety and to get a better lifestyle.  I mention, for example, Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia, where the majority of South Sudanese have been going.  When we come down to the realities, it is not that South Sudanese communities want to move into the different regions; it is because of the context we are in and the atrocities that are being committed against communities.  We saw in 2016 that in a village in Central Equatoria, in the greater Yei region, people were killed along tribal lines.  There was all this genocide coming through from 2016 to 2018.  Those are some of the challenges that local communities and South Sudanese in general have been facing.  A slight support from the international community would go a long way to ensuring that these communities can live and lead better lifestyles and hope for a brighter future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dominic MacSorley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#G00400"><p>I will take members back to the Central African Republic.  When I was there I asked the head of United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNOCHA, how it managed a 63% shortfall in its budget.  I appreciate that I am talking to people who manage budgets all the time.  He said to cut pretty much everything, which is costly, and in that case it brought down the food rations by half.  He said that they had become firefighters, they only went for the most acute cases and they had to leave the moderate cases today, which, in turn, become the most acute cases tomorrow.  That goes back to the message of prevention.</p> <p>  The second point is that traditionally, when different appeals are considered, what tends to be funded are food, shelter and water.  What does not get funded are protection, gender-based violence, GBV, and education.  This is where Ireland comes in.  I mention the example of kids in Syria getting the schooling they had missed out on for four or five years.  Ireland is supporting 6,000 such kids with a view that when they go back there will be a generation that has not completely lost out and that will have the capability to go back.  The Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office, FCDO, is a brutal reminder of how cuts should never happen.  The hardest conversations are when talking to partners in communities about cuts in funding, having built up a level of trust and confidence and having asked them to go on this journey together.  Nobody understands why.  That is the toughest thing about dealing with cuts.</p> <p>  We are not in that position.  We have learned a lot from the 2008 crisis, as agencies, around efficiencies.  We have learned about the importance of cash and how to spend money more astutely.  Ms de Barra will talk about fundraising but the relationship with the Irish public has been phenomenal.  Ballybofey is one example of a fundraising team that has been going for 20 years.  When they could not go out and do their Christmas bazaar, they did all the online activities that everyone has been doing such as jumping, skipping and God knows what.  The people of Ireland have stayed and they are a key part of this package.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caoimhe de Barra" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#G00500"><p>I will address the questions on fundraising, vaccines and priorities.  On fundraising, to follow on from what Mr. MacSorley said, what we have witnessed to our surprise, at least initially, has been an outpouring of support and solidarity from the Irish public.  Across the country, people have recognised that while the Covid pandemic is having a devastating impact on us in Ireland, personally and in our everyday lives, it is far more acute overseas.  As several members said, it is ultimately far more damaging in the long term for people living in communities in fragile states, particularly in conflict-affected states.  The generosity of the public at a time like this has been phenomenal.</p> <p>  Our fundraising has changed but it has remained strong.  This sends an important signal that the public are fully behind overseas development work.  They have demonstrated their solidarity in a practical way over the past year by donating directly to organisations such as Tr&oacute;caire, Concern and others.  We know from the research that D&oacute;chas has done that 77% of the public say that development assistance is important.  This is an example of a case where perhaps the public are ahead of the political decision-making.  The public are backing the kind of work we do and understand that Covid's impact and the impacts of climate change are far more significant overseas, even while we have to support those who are vulnerable at home.</p> <p>  That is important and I would underline what several members said, which is that there is a need for a roadmap that will get us to 0.7% of GDP by 2030.  Within the lifetime of this Government, we need to see a commitment to an interim target, which is solid and which will ensure that we are taking a stepwise approach year-on-year with meaningful incremental increases and that do not suddenly push the burden of increasing aid to later in the day when another Government might be in place.</p><p>In D&oacute;chas, we believe that there needs to be a commitment to 0.5% by 2025 and that every budget should have an incremental step that builds gradually and sustainably towards that point.</p><p> Everybody appreciates how shocking the vaccine inequity is.  It is palpable, tangible and deplorable.  It impacts on our staff and the communities that we are working with.  People are dying needlessly of Covid.  While here in Ireland, there is a successful and welcome roll-out of the vaccine, can any of us live with the fact that across the world, over 50% of the global population has received one vaccine but in low income countries, only 1% of the population has received a vaccine?  In Ireland, we are up to 70%, which is welcome, but 1% of the population of low-income countries are currently vaccinated.  I underscore the point that Ms Soma makes, which is it that it is not just about access to the vaccines right now, although that is critically important.  The TRIPS waiver is a priority.  If there is a temporary waiver through the World Trade Organization TRIPS mechanism, there is capacity to scale up the production of vaccines.  That is known and documented.  We believe that Ireland should take a strong position at the WTO, aligned with many other countries that see the need, the moral imperative and the logic, for our own sake, of scaling up vaccine production worldwide.</p><p> Health systems need to be strengthened, which is a long-term investment that speaks to the need for 0.7% and the multi-annual approach.  If Ireland is able to commit to a stepwise approach to funding over the next five or ten years and to working with partner countries and agencies such as us and the United Nations, we can build stronger health systems that will be more resilient to future health crises.  The reality is that crises will continue to happen.  Covid is the latest and the most visible.  In the countries that we and Ms Soma work in, health systems are under severe strain at the best of times.  They need a long-term investment which can only happen through a long-term commitment to aid.</p><p> On the question about other priorities beyond increasing overseas development assistance, climate is one.  Everybody's intervention today has referred to climate and the importance of addressing climate justice, climate inequality and the impacts of climate.  Ms Keatinge said that one of her requests is that there should be dedicated additional targeted funding for climate financing.  That is an important message to come from this committee if possible.  That would demonstrate that we are adherent in our approach as a country and that in going into the negotiations, Ireland is demonstrating its commitment through its aid budget and through the legislation which I hope will be passed and meet the high standards, with the latest amendments improving it, and that Ireland is prepared to face the reality that there will be significant changes in everything we do.  We will embrace those changes because we recognise our global responsibility regarding climate.</p><p> The global economy is another priority and what form its recovery takes.  The global economy is crucial to recovery and the livelihoods of millions of people who are part of supply chains in developing countries.  There is a significant risk now that those supply chains will become more dangerous places for people to work and for the communities affected by them over the coming years, because of the impact of Covid and because people and governments are more vulnerable.  Governments are less likely to be able to stand up to take a strong stance on the standards of implementation that need to be in place.  This Government needs to look at human rights in business and to welcome, embrace and even get ahead of the legislation movement coming from Europe about mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence.  That would demonstrate policy coherence for development across the board in Ireland.</p><p> We mentioned the UN Security Council and Ireland's seat on it a number of times in this meeting.  It is extremely important.  For the next 18 months, we continue to have an opportunity to be courageous, principled and effective at the UN Security Council.  Ireland has already stepped up to the mark in a number of difficult situations.  The importance of Ireland's success, together with Norway and others, with the Syria cross-border resolutions, cannot be overstated.  Ireland needs to continue, with the full support of the entire Government, to dedicate every resource possible to its work at the UN Security Council to prevent and resolve conflict for all the reasons that we heard earlier.  It needs to focus in particular on the protection of women, girls and other people who are vulnerable to gender-based violence in conflict.</p><p> Ireland can be a strong voice for climate security at the UN Security Council, potentially including during its presidency.  It is contingent on passing the strongest possible version of the climate legislation that is currently before the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Keatinge" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#H00200"><p>In response to Deputy Stanton's question about the media, I agree that we need to see more media coverage of what is happening outside Ireland.  I know that our members are concerned, especially since the end of last year.  The committee has heard from my colleagues that the Irish public want to hear more.  They support overseas development assistance, ODA.  Our survey said that 79% believe that ODA is effective in bringing about positive change.  It is a challenge for us all to get more stories and coverage in the media.  They should bring hope and positivity rather than always being too overwhelming.</p> <p>  The sustainable development goals, SDGs, are probably close to the Chair's heart, since he signed them in 2015.  I agree that there is a sense that they are falling off the rails.  When talking to our members, there is a sense that if ever something like the SDG framework was needed, it is now.  I will admit that we probably did not know the word "Covid" in 2015 but the beauty of the SDG framework is that it shows the links between things like climate, conflict and now Covid.  That relationship is important.  The SDGs demand partnership and collaboration to solve these complex problems.  Within our community and Coalition 2030, we will continue to challenge the Government to do more.  The year 2030 is not that far away.  This framework is needed now more than ever.  Remember that even when it was being signed in 2015, there was a concern about the funding gap.  That has not gone away.  That is why our conversation on ODA is so important and relevant to the roadmap.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair.  I hope we have answered most of the questions.  If there are any more, we would be happy to answer them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#H00300"><p>I thank Ms Keatinge and her colleagues.  We now move towards next steps.  I thank members for their proposals.  I acknowledge the proposal from Deputy Stanton that we would write to the Government.  I take it that it is agreed.  Ms Keatinge mentioned that we could write to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, who is not our line Minister, but I acknowledge what Ms Keatinge has said and his pivotal role in the Government.  I think that we should write to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  What should we say?  I acknowledge what Senator O'Reilly said about a net increase, especially in times of Covid.  I acknowledge what Deputy Clarke said about advising against any form of reduction or cut.  I acknowledge what Deputy Clarke said about having a more consistent, certain or definite roadmap or pathway towards the 0.7% GNI each year.  I acknowledge what the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said to us in that regard last year.  Nevertheless, I think that Deputy Clarke makes an important point, which should be included in our letter.  I acknowledge the proposal from Deputy Leddin about multi-annual funding.  We raised this with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and Minister of State, Deputy Brophy.  It is an important point in the context of the presentation and what Ms Keatinge and colleagues said.  We should revisit this issue and strongly state that our committee believes that this is an important way forward.</p><p>I advise members and guests that we will have an opportunity to engage with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, or the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, or both prior to the budget.  Again, all the commentary this morning, including the presentations in writing and otherwise, will certainly feed into that process.  It is likely the budget will be announced in mid-October but at the end of August and during the course of September we should have the opportunity to engage directly with the Ministers.  If that does not happen, we will engage indirectly and segue into the submissions that came in the context of our meetings.  I acknowledge the support of Senator Craughwell.  If members are happy to draft a letter along those lines, we will do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#J00200"><p>The Chairman refers to the multi-annual funding raised by Deputy Leddin.  We should look for a roadmap to bring us to the 0.7% that we are talking about, which could be reviewed on an annual basis to see how close we are getting to the desired figure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021071400002#J00300"><p>Yes.  That point has been made and we will take it on board.  If we are agreed on that I will move to Ms Keatinge's proposals that the Government might engage in prior to the budget.  I ask for an endorsement of these proposals from committee members.  The first is an increase in Ireland's official development aid assistance to ensure we keep pace with global needs now and in the post-Covid environment.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The next is that we ensure additional and targeted financing for climate change mitigation and adaptation to support least-developed countries and small island development states.  That is along the lines of what Deputy Leddin was saying.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Leddin is Cathaoirleach of the climate change committee in the Houses.</p> <p>  The third proposal is to use Ireland's voice at the UN Security Council and EU levels, as well as in other international fora, to champion human rights defenders on the role being played by civil society.  This is a matter we took up with the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, and it will certainly form part of further discussions with both the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy.  Is that proposal agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The fourth proposal is to advocate to ensure that the global community produces enough vaccine doses for everyone everywhere.  This is in line with our earlier report, which we forwarded to the Government following our work earlier in the year on COVAX and universal vaccination.  It is important that we again urge the Government to show leadership in this sphere.  The fifth proposal is to strengthen Ireland's global leadership on zero hunger.  This again feeds into our influential role in international bodies and the United Nations in particular.  Is there agreement that we will include these proposals in our letter to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and to be copied to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Brophy?  This is the proposed stance of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence prior to the budget.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I thank members for that.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Keatinge for a closing comment, having agreed that we will take this stance.  On behalf of committee members, I acknowledge the great work of all the agencies, including non-governmental organisations.  There are almost 60 full and associate members of the association of NGOs advancing the cause of what the Irish people support, as Ms de Barra has said.  It is important to emphasise, in speaking about budgets and priorities, that 77% of the Irish people are giving the Government a mandate to commit to international development assistance.  That is important, in the context of our priorities and going back to what Deputy Stanton quite rightly referred to as the national obsession with pubs and pubs opening.  I acknowledge Irish Aid and Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca's team of field officers and officials, which works closely with D&oacute;chas for and on behalf of the Irish people and its Government.  As Ms de Barra has said, the NGO community is working in the most challenging parts of the world in very difficult circumstances for its members, as well as for the people they serve.  I acknowledge the importance of this meeting and we will proceed to the next steps.</p></speech>

It means much to many of the people in the D&oacute;chas network working here in Ireland and, most important, overseas.  I am sure Ms Soma is listening today and can take home that message of hope to the people she supports in South Sudan.</p> <p>  This is not just about the tangible actions that the committee is willing to take but also about hearing that it sees the importance and value in long-term aid.  Mr. MacSorley spoke about prevention and Ms de Barra argued that aid is about transformation, which takes time.  That is where the multi-annual and long-term planning comes in.  We must make progress with incremental increases each year to reach that all-important target of 0.7% of GNI by 2030.</p> <p>  I also thank my colleagues here today who are members of D&oacute;chas.  They are Ms de Barra, Mr. MacSorley from Concern and Ms Soma.  I also note the many members of D&oacute;chas listening to this and who amplify our voices.  This is a collaborative effort and it is about working together.  It is only if we can do this that we can show global solidarity and bring the hope that is so desperately needed.</p> <p>  I again thank the committee and the Chairman for his leadership.  They should know that we are around if there are further questions.  We will certainly follow up with the committee after this meeting.  I hope members get to enjoy some of the summer holidays.</p></speech>

Unless members have any final commentary, I will bring matters to a close by thanking the guests for the presentation.  I will be forgiven for singling out Ms Soma for joining us from the front line in South Sudan, which is, as she mentions, the world's youngest country.  It faces enormous challenges and yet we know that Ms Soma had the sense to finish her stark and bleak presentation on a note of high optimism and good news on the matter of the impact of international funding.  That exemplifies the spirit in the face of extreme adversity.  We thank Ms Soma and acknowledge her work.  We wish her and her team in the Titi Foundation well in facing its challenges.  We acknowledge the leadership and management of Ms de Barra, Mr. MacSorley and Ms Keatinge in Ireland and across the world in these difficult times.</p> <p>  There is no doubt we will have the opportunity to re-engage in the autumn.  In the meantime, we assure the witnesses of our positive and constructive activity between now and budget day in mid-October.  We thank the witnesses for furnishing us with their very important pre-budget submission.</p></speech>

I am pleased to bring before the committee two draft Government agreements giving force of law in Ireland to a new double taxation agreement with Kosovo and separately, a new protocol to the existing double taxation agreement with Germany.</p> <p>  The new double taxation agreement with Kosovo was signed by ambassador O&rsquo;Neill on behalf of Ireland and the acting head of mission, Ms Arrita Gjakova, on behalf of Kosovo on 25 June 2021 in London.  The protocol to the double taxation agreement with Germany was signed on 19 January 2021 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the German ambassador to Ireland, Ms Deike Potzel.</p> <p>  As the committee will recall, arising from the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, Ireland ratified the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting in 2018.  The convention was discussed at this committee and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and was included in the Finance Act 2018.</p> <p>  The BEPS multilateral convention came into force for Ireland in 2019 and updates the majority of Ireland&rsquo;s existing double taxation agreements to make them BEPS compliant.  As was previously indicated to the committee, however, our existing double taxation agreement with Germany was not updated by the multilateral convention but will instead be updated bilaterally to reflect BEPS changes.  This is what the German agreement before the committee seeks to do.</p><p>It is another important step in the implementation of the BEPS process and one which Ireland takes seriously in both signing and ratifying the multilateral convention.</p><p> Ireland has written to those partner jurisdictions that have not yet signed the convention to discuss options for implementing the BEPS recommendations.  We are committed to ensuring that all our double taxation agreements meet the minimum standards agreed in the BEPS process.</p><p> A common feature of both the new agreement with Kosovo and the protocol with Germany is the incorporation of strong tools for tackling tax treaty abuse and anti-avoidance measures.  Both contain the minimum standards committed to during the BEPS project, as well as several measures which are recommended best practices under BEPS, as agreed bilaterally.</p><p> Ireland first signed a double taxation agreement with Germany in Dublin in November 1962.  That treaty was replaced in 2011 and there has been one protocol to the new treaty in place since 2014.  In May 2017, the German Federal Ministry of Finance asked the Office of the Revenue Commissioners if the 2011 agreement between Ireland and Germany could be updated by protocol, instead of using the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS.  Ireland agreed to the request and negotiations successfully concluded in February 2020.  That protocol was signed in January of this year and is before the committee today.</p><p> The new double taxation agreement with Kosovo is comprehensive in scope and while it generally follows the OECD model convention, it also includes some provisions that feature in the UN model convention.  The agreement contains provisions to deal with BEPS and to make the new double tax agreements fully compliant with the minimum standards under the BEPS project.  As well as the minimum standards, the double taxation agreement contains several measures which are recommended best practices under the BEPS project, as agreed between Ireland and Kosovo.</p><p> The treaty with Kosovo will enhance economic relations and co-operation in tax matters between both countries.  Following an approach from Kosovo in 2017, the negotiations were successfully completed.  The treaty is designed to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation.  The reduced rates of withholding tax on certain dividends, interest and royalties and the safeguards against discriminatory taxation in the agreement will support existing trade and facilitate further trade and investment between both states.</p><p> Our network of double taxation agreements is an important aspect of our competitiveness in attracting investment and facilitating Irish business in operating internationally.  In addition, double tax agreements are a cornerstone of Ireland's trade policy and are a key element in stimulating trade and investment flows between countries.  They provide greater certainty and fairness for taxpayers regarding their tax obligations in foreign jurisdictions and they are key to the prevention of double taxation.</p><p> The benefits of double taxation agreements are well known but concerns have been expressed that treaties may inadvertently facilitate aggressive tax planning.  This concern was central to the BEPS project and to the BEPS multilateral convention.  Updating our existing double taxation agreements, whether via the multilateral convention or bilaterally, helps to ensure they cannot be used for aggressive tax planning arrangements.</p><p> Ireland has been a strong supporter of the BEPS process since its inception and continues to engage positively at both EU and OECD level in addressing the tax challenges that arise from the digitalisation and globalisation of the economy.  Proactively updating our double taxation agreements is a key example of that support.</p><p> As indicated in the update to our corporation tax roadmap that I published in January, it is my intention to publish a treaty policy statement at the end of this year or early in 2022.  The proposals under discussion at the OECD have implications for the global network of tax treaties and it is important that any potential treaty outcomes agreed in that forum are reflected in the treaty policy statement.  The rationale for this statement is to take stock of our existing network and formalise our treaty policy.  As a small open economy, a robust treaty network is necessary to facilitate international trade.</p><p> We have come from a period of expansion of the network to the point where we have treaties with the vast majority of our international trading partners.  It is my intention that the policy statement will have a particular emphasis on tax treaties with developing countries, having regard to Ireland&rsquo;s development commitments.  We have an excellent reputation for our positive policies towards developing countries through Irish Aid and I want to ensure that our treaty policy is fully consistent with our development policy.  This is also in line with the Government commitment to domestic resource mobilisation policy the aim of which is to strengthen developing countries&rsquo; tax administrative capacity.</p><p> To inform the treaty policy statement, I launched a public consultation in April this year that ran until May and received 15 submissions, all of which are available on our website.  My officials have also held a series of stakeholder engagements to discuss the content of the submissions in detail and this will inform our future treaty policy.</p><p> If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the making of these orders by Government, I will include the orders in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by way of an amendment in the upcoming finance Bill.  This will enable Ireland to complete the necessary notifications to finalise the ratifications of both agreements.</p><p> I commend these draft orders to the committee.  I am happy to take questions on them.  I am also aware that the members of the committee have expressed a desire to discuss the ongoing work on the international tax framework at the OECD and I am also open to discussing that matter with the committee.</p></speech>

In the orders for the double taxation agreements before us, in some cases we are replacing existing tax agreements with new agreements such as with the Netherlands, whereas in the case of Germany we are adding a protocol to the existing agreement.  Why is that the case?  The Minister told us that in 2017 Germany requested that the 2011 agreement be updated by way of protocol.  Why was that request made?  Why is that the preference in this case?</p> <p>  The Minister also said the Government had written to some other jurisdictions that have not yet signed up to the BEPS multilateral convention to discuss options for implementing the BEPS recommendations.  Which jurisdictions are they?  </p> <p>  The Minister said the agreement and protocol before us today both contain minimum standards.  Does he not believe that we should not just advocate for a minimalist approach but for something that is more enhanced?  I ask him to elaborate on the other measures which he described as recommended best practices under BEPS.</p></speech>

While they are doing that, I will deal with the Deputy's first question as to why we are dealing with our colleagues in Germany through a protocol.  As he will be aware, most of our double tax agreements will be modified using a multilateral convention to implement tax treaty-related measures to prevent BEPS, which entered into force with respect to Ireland on 1 May 2019.  However, in some cases a treaty must be updated bilaterally by protocol.  This is generally where our treaty's partner's domestic law prevents it from implementing the BEPS changes through a multilateral instrument.  This is the case for Germany.  This is being done via a protocol as opposed to the broader multilateral instrument that we use elsewhere because of the compatibility of this issue with German domestic law.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if I believed we should be adopting standards that are ahead of what is recommended in the OECD BEPS process.  I would generally be cautious about that because my appreciation of these matters is that their force derives from the consistent implementation of the same standards elsewhere and in Ireland.  If we were to develop or implement standards that are not consistent with the BEPS process, it might lead to issues of inconsistency with other jurisdictions.</p><p>The countries with which we have not signed a multilateral instrument and which we have contacted are Belarus, Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Moldova, Montenegro, Thailand, the United States of America, Uzbekistan, Vietnam and Zambia.  We have written to all of these countries with regard to this process.  We have received an indication from some of them that they are willing to go ahead with a multilateral instrument.  For example, Thailand has given this commitment.  This is the status of the communication at present.</p></speech>

The agreement with Kosovo that is before us will reduce the tax rates on withholding tax on dividends, interest and royalties.  I have serious concerns about our tax architecture.  Will the Minister outline to the committee the changes that will take place in this regard on foot of the agreement?</p></speech>

The change we are making with regard to the taxation of dividends refers to the minimum holding period.  The change we are making is in line with the recommended best practice of the OECD in this area.  If the Deputy would like a bit more information on it, I can invite Revenue to fill out the answer a bit more.</p></speech>

None of these commitments have been relayed to us in the Parliament or in the finance committee.  Will the Minister now take the opportunity to explain what are the commitments he gave to the European Commission?</p></speech>

It refers to a number of areas.  These include applying enhanced control foreign company rules to the list of non-co-operative jurisdictions, with effect from 1 January 2021.  I am aiming to do this in the Finance Act 2020.  I also committed to publishing external independent economic research on the impact of recent legislative changes domestically and internationally on outbound payments for Ireland.  This has already been made available publicly.  This was done on 14 June.  I also committed to carrying out a public consultation on the introduction of measures to ensure outbound payments do not avail of a double non-taxation.  The public consultation on this and the responses received will all be made available on the website of the Department of Finance.  I also committed to introducing legislation to safeguard against the possibility of double non-taxation of outbound payments by the Finance Act 2023 at the latest.  These are all different areas of policy action that were part of the broad pathway of change I indicated in the second edition of our corporate tax roadmap.</p></speech>

The Minister has outlined to the committee, in response to questions I put to him, his determination to secure Ireland's interest and the 12.5% tax rate.  He committed to not having this rate increase in the foreseeable future.  Looking from this position, the Minister is spectacularly failing on these negotiations with regard to defending Ireland's interest.  A situation emerged on 9 July whereby 132 of the 139 member jurisdictions of the OECD signed up to the pillar 2 solution to address the tax challenge arising from the digitalisation of the economy.  Seven member states are holding out, including Kenya and Nigeria because, we understand, it does not go far enough.  Meanwhile, Sri Lanka, Barbados, Estonia, Hungary and we are in the situation of holding out because it has gone too far with a minimum effective tax rate of at least 15%.</p> <p>  I have outlined on the floor of the D&aacute;il where Sinn F&eacute;in stands on this matter.  We need to defend our national interest.  What is the roadmap ahead for the Minister for Finance in these negotiations given the level of support for pillar 2?  Does the Minister still believe our corporate tax rate for the applicable companies, which have a turnover of three quarters of a billion euro per annum, will not have to increase?  What is his strategy?  This is what we are trying to figure out.  What is the Minister's strategy as the international community is pushing ahead with pillar 2?  Yesterday, the US Secretary of the Treasury, Ms Yellen, commented that the hold-out countries are not needed, that the other counties can proceed without us and that the companies will pay the higher level of tax anyway.  Will the Minister outline his strategy to the committee and reassure us we are not spectacularly failing, as it appears the Minister is at this time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021071400002#C00900"><p>I am not sure how Deputy Doherty can derive the analysis of spectacularly failing in any way given that other finance ministers will make a decision regarding what is in the interests of their people and economies.  That has what has happened with more than 130 countries.  I can engage with them.  If we are going to recognise that I have a prerogative here I also have to recognise that other finance ministers do also.  I am making the case for our rate.  I am making the case for the ability and role of small and medium-sized economies to be able to use a low rate as part of their competitive tax model.  What I will do in the coming period is to continue to engage with the OECD.  I will engage with a group of countries, including obviously our friends and partners in the United States of America.  I will better understand what their own intent is as we approach October.  We will continue to indicate that Ireland wants to be in the negotiations and in the process.  For us to be part of a final agreement we have to have more certainty and more predictability about what that agreement will be than we do at present.  This is the objective I am pursuing.  I believed it was appropriate, with the level of certainty available to me approximately a week ago, that Ireland indicated we want to be part of this process and continue to be part of it but we could not for now be part of the consensus.</p></speech>

The reason I say it appears the Minister is failing is because this comes down to the level of countries and where they want to see it.  There are big influencers, as the Minister mentioned, such as the United States.  With 132 out of the 139 signing up to pillar 2, it appears the odds are very much against this country and against the Minister in succeeding to convince enough member states the 12.5% rate would be the appropriate effective tax rate that should be introduced in pillar 2.</p> <p>  We know the rate is one thing.  We also know there is potential for carve-outs under pillar 2.  The Minister has decided to maintain a hold-out position.  Is the Minister concerned at all about the reputational damage this has caused?  I made the point previously that the facilitation of some of the practices that went on in our tax code in the past and how our code interacted with others has reputationally damaged us.  I do think this is helpful in the context of these negotiations.  There is potential to provide for carve-outs.  Is this what the Minister will look at?  Does he envisage a situation in October whereby Ireland would still be outside the final agreement?  When the negotiations are finished, does he envisage a situation whereby we could be one of a small number of countries that would be outside the agreement?  As the US Secretary of the Treasury, Ms Yellen, said, the 15% corporate tax rate would apply.  The Minister for Finance, if he is still in position at the time, may not increase the rate but it would apply anyway because of what is contained in pillar 2.</p><p>It would just be the case that we would not benefit.  Does the Minister envisage a situation where we would still be holding out or does he believe that, having negotiated hard and put Ireland's interests forward, which he definitely should do, we will be part of this process in the end?</p></speech>

If the Deputy is still where he is now at that point, he will be able to form a view on it as well when we get to October.  Of course I am aware of the commentary about Ireland, as I have been for a number of years.  I have always made the case that we have made far more positive and proactive change to our corporate tax code than we have got credit or recognition for.  The final assessment of the reputational impact of the BEPS process will be on individual countries, not just who is in the agreement in October but, more particularly, who will be involved in actually implementing that agreement, what is the speed of that implementation and where countries stand with regard to it.</p> <p>  In terms of the different issues that are at play, I make the point respectfully to the committee that this is a negotiation we are involved in.  I want to accept the good faith of others who are involved in it and, because of the sensitivity of the issues that are involved, not speculate too much on what outcomes could be.  Having said that, I can still acknowledge that amidst the different issues that we need to have greater certainty on, such as what the base and the rate would be, the Deputy is right to say that there is a language in the current agreement in regard to the scope of carve-outs, but that language is, at the moment, still caveated.  These are really important issues for us to understand.</p> <p>  In terms of where we could be at the end of October, there is a range of possible scenarios, involving lots of different countries, regarding where this process could be.  Where I would like us to be at the end of October is in a positive place and position with regard to what the end point of this could be.  However, we are not there at the moment and I have a lot of work and engagement to do, which I am currently carrying out with a number of countries and with the OECD to see where we could be by October.  As the Deputy is aware, I am about to launch a public consultation in regard to the current BEPS text to draw attention to some of the details of that to stakeholders in our society and economy, including in the political system.  I aim to have that consultation complete by the start of September and to have a synopsis of the views across our country on this sensitive issue.</p></speech>

We expected this year's summer economic statement to be published yesterday.  Another committee of the Oireachtas is to discuss it with the Minister tomorrow morning.  We understand there are squabbles within Government, memorandums have been pulled from Cabinet and party leaders have to convene because they cannot agree on what they have called the priority of Government, namely, funding for housing.  When is the Government going to get its act together on this?  More importantly, when will we in the Opposition and the finance committee see the summer economic statement?  Will it be published today?</p></speech>

That is seen, for example, in the number of homes that are being built directly by local authorities, through the Government, throughout the country.  Given the importance of laying out our budgetary framework, there is a great deal of engagement going on at the moment in regard to it.  I expect that engagement to conclude and I hope to be in a position to publish the summer economic statement very soon.  I am aware of the commitment I have with regard to the budget oversight committee tomorrow and I hope to be in a position to provide clarity on where we stand.  I am working to publish the summer economic statement and I am hopeful it will happen.</p></speech>

Similarly, however, I have to ensure that the same right is afforded to members of Government.  That is an equal imperative for me.  I think the Deputy will understand that I have a duty to brief Government on an economic statement when it is concluded.  As soon as I have done that, the members of the committee will, of course, be briefed.  I will be in front of the committee on at least one more occasion before the budget process begins.  I am aware of the need for Deputies to be briefed and I am equally aware of the need for members of Government to have the same expectation delivered.  I am working to do both at the moment.</p></speech>

On double tax agreements, many people are of the view that if someone is working in two countries, he or she cannot be paying tax in both and that there is a need for an arrangement to be put in place as a result.  In practice down through the years, however, double tax arrangements, in essence, facilitated large corporations in reducing the amount of tax they paid to a particular state, opting to shift profits to the state where tax is paid at a lower rate and saving themselves considerable sums of money in so doing.  I recognise that arrangements have been put in place to try to cut across that, but they have not succeeded 100% or anything like it.  Will the Minister comment on the extent to which large corporations might be able to continue to shift profits and pay tax at the lower rate?  Does he consider this still to be a major problem and is he of the view that the steps that have been taken are in any way mitigating against it?  I ask him to reply to those questions before I move on to the other points.</p></speech>

The measures we have brought forward aim to make progress against some of the issues he raised.  In particular, on the issue of evasion or aggressive tax planning opportunities, there are two aims of the changes we are making that are relevant to his concern.  The first is that double taxation agreements provide for the exchange of information between countries and facilitate Revenue investigations.  That exchange of information is vital in dealing with concerns tax authorities may have in regard to tax evasion.  In this context, double taxation agreements try to create a legal environment in which further progress can be made on the issue to which the Deputy referred.  They also prevent what is deemed to be treaty abuse.  This involves putting in place measures, such as a principal purpose test, to deny treaty benefits where one of the main purposes of a transaction is to obtain those benefits.  I refer to transactions that are put in place with the main aim of trying to utilise some of the benefits that would be available through double taxation agreements.  Overall, there are positive developments that provide further tools for allowing tax authorities to deal with issues of aggressive tax planning and evasion.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned in his reply to Deputy Doherty that Ireland is not alone on this issue and is putting its case alongside other small and medium-sized economies.</p><p>The reports I read indicate eight states currently are strongly opposed to the 15% proposals.  Those states are Estonia, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru, Sri Lanka, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a tax haven, and Barbados, another tax haven.  Would the Minister care to comment on the other small and medium sized economies, including these tax havens, and does he not believe that puts the State in an embarrassing position?</p></speech>

He is right in that I said there were other countries that had a similar view to Ireland on this issue but I did not say there was also a very large group of countries which share that view.  I accept, and it is a matter of public record, that the majority of countries have indicated they will be part of the consensus.  As to what that means for us, as I said in a response to Deputy Doherty, it is important to realise and recognise we are still in a political process that is due to conclude in October.  The best time to evaluate where we stand, who our company might be and what could be the effect on our reputation would be well after that point if an agreement is reached and by the metric of who has implemented the agreement.  It is early in the process to conclude who will be there at the end of it and what countries will be in or out of it.</p></speech>

If, on the other hand, I had indicated last week we would go into this agreement, a whole range of issues and concerns would have been created by that, for which I would be held to account as well.  I must be aware of that in the context of decisions I make.  In assessing where we are currently, it is critical for me to emphasise we are still very much engaged in this process.  It still has some way to run.  We will do our part to try to get a balance between issues that are very much in our national interest while recognising the world is changing around us and changes that could happen in other jurisdictions inside the OECD could yet have a big impact on us.</p></speech>

A comprehensive Zucman study in 2018 stated Ireland was the world&rsquo;s number one tax haven with an effective tax rate of 4%.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s opinion as to what the effective corporation tax rate is in this State?  Zucman stated it is 4%, Deloitte, Matheson and Grant Thornton have all marketed themselves as companies that pay an effective 2.5% tax rate in this State.  We know in 2017 Apple, Google, Facebook and Oracle paid less than 1%.  The galleries would collapse in laughter if the State was to try to keep a straight face while arguing the effective tax rate is 12.5%.  We all know it is less than that.  What does the Minister estimate the effective tax rate currently to be?</p></speech>

I understand the last time they published this information they indicated our effective tax rate is just below the nominal tax rate of 12.5%.  Publications from the Revenue Commissioners have indicated the effective tax rate is somewhere between 10% and 11%.  That is information I base my views on.  The Revenue Commissioners publish this information impartially and fairly.  It is the organisation that should guide our view on what our effective tax rate is.</p></speech>

Many observers would raise an eyebrow at it being claimed our effective tax is between 10% and 11% but in any case I will park that one.</p> <p>  On the issue of the summer economic statement, we are given to understand from press reports this morning that the issue at stake at Cabinet is the question of the public spend on housing.  People are currently experiencing the sharpest housing crisis in the history of the State.  To deal with that we need to start from the base of what are the needs of the people and what is needed to effectively tackle and end the crisis.  I doubt whether Fianna Fail in government would go that far but yet there seems to be a real tension between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il on this issue.  I would like the Minister to comment not on the detail but on the broad issue of the public funding needed to tackle the housing crisis.</p></speech>

There is debate and discussion but there is complete agreement on the need to make a higher level of funding available to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to deal with the many grave difficulties and challenges we have in housing.  That is what I am doing.  I am confident we will agree a summer economic statement, which in turn will lead to a credible and ambitious Housing for All plan.</p></speech>

The requirement is not 35,000 or 38,000 houses but in the region of 70,000 to 75,000 houses in the first year and the second year and then we would need to review the situation.</p><p>This will become more acute as the country recovers from the pandemic, something we all expect and hope for.  The demand will be greater and the need for housing provision will be far more than it has been in the past.</p><p> I am not asking the Minister to give a commitment today but I am asking that it be borne in mind.  My experience and my humble knowledge of the housing situation and the manner in which I have had to deal with it over many years have long since led me to the conclusion that we should not do things over a five-year period or a ten-year period.  If we go that route, the children who are being born now will be adults before we reach a situation where we can say a person will have a house within a reasonable time.  It is all about affordability, availability and supply.  The only way that can be done is by a dramatic upsurge in the delivery of houses by whatever means possible.  Even if we have to appeal to building firms from abroad to do the construction work, we need to do it soon.</p><p> Another point relates to the national summer report and the plan.  In the United Kingdom there are indications of inflation above what was anticipated by the UK Government.  How are we heading in that direction?  How do we see it developing given that we have had to give, correctly, considerable incentives to employers and employees to maintain some semblance of support for the economy?  Some economists have said in the past that where such incentives are given there may be a necessity to control prices as well.  I can see where that is coming from.  How do we deal with that?  Do we ignore it?  Do we introduce any measures to discourage inflation given inflation on housing will be an even greater catastrophe than we have seen before?  They are my two questions.  Do I let the Minister reply or will I go on to the other questions?</p></speech>

Of course we are going to do all we can to try to deliver a significant increase in the building of homes as quickly as we can.  I do not need to tell Deputy Durkan about the step back we have taken in home construction due to the impact of Covid-19.  This is why trying to open construction in Ireland safely is so important and that is what we are trying to do.  In the funding decisions we will make for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage we will try to ensure we have the level of funding in place to allow those involved to build as many homes as quickly as they can and in the greatest number.</p> <p>  That leads on to a point the Deputy made with me.  As much as we want to do this quickly, we have constraints in terms of the size of the construction sector as it rebuilds itself after Covid and in terms of the need to ensure we have sufficient planning permission available to be activated for building.  These are all issues Deputy Durkan is well aware of.  I would respond to the key point he is making by saying we are trying to put in place the funding and commitment to build as much as we can as quickly as we can.</p> <p>  The second issue raised related to inflation and price controls.  Deputy Durkan will be aware of the real legal obstacles in place when it comes to the installation of price controls.  He will know better than I do we operate within the Single Market and within the European Union.  Price controls are legally difficult to do.  Moreover, I am not sure they are always in the best interests of the consumer.</p> <p>  That being said, inflation is undoubtedly an issue we need to monitor closely in Ireland.  The inflation outlook for the Irish economy is moderate, at between 0.7% and 1% for the economy overall.  However, the inflation figures published in America yesterday were in excess of 5%.  This demonstrates to us the pressures under way elsewhere in the global economy.  What can we do to try to mitigate their effect in Ireland?  It is about supply and taking measures to drive efficiency in the economy.  Then it will be about safely opening in a sustainable way so that as higher demand for certain things materialises, fuelled by higher levels of savings within the economy, we have an economy that is operating as normally as possible to provide the goods and services to meet those demands.  These are the avenues through which we will be better able to deliver rather than by imposing price controls within our economy, for the reasons I have touched on.</p></speech>

Mind you, we do not always get the same benefits in terms of various issues as some of our colleagues across the European Union.  That is why I raised the issue in the first place.</p><p>In the 1980s the construction sector had what was called a certificate of reasonable value.  That was dreaded by those in the construction industry on the basis that it was a big hold-up in the construction of houses.  It was not actually as the houses were constructed but it prevented interventions.  For instance, investment funds could not intervene unreasonably and impose an extra cost on the houses being built for consumers and the people.  I would like that to be borne in mind.  No one wanted it but it had an effect.  The fact is it has not been introduced since.  There was no need for it to be introduced as we were able to produce houses to meet the needs of people.</p><p>There is a double taxation agreement affecting Germany and other countries.  Does it affect Ireland's competitive position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>countries within the European Union and outside?</p></speech>

Kosovo has double tax agreements with other countries.  By virtue of our moving into an agreement with Kosovo, we get consistency versus what is happening with other countries that have double tax agreements with Kosovo.  The overall competitiveness benefits are negligible, if any.  We are doing this for other reasons.  Anyway, these double taxation agreements will not diminish our competitiveness in any way and certainly will not diminish the competitiveness of exporters to these economies.</p></speech>

In the context of all issues discussed, can the Minister deduce from what happened that the relative position of Ireland is as near as possible to what it was heretofore given that any disadvantage arising therefrom would have serious consequences for Ireland?  Is it generally acknowledged that Ireland is geographically on the periphery of Europe, even more so following Brexit?  This is a distinct disadvantage as we now know.  Notwithstanding the strong support we received from European colleagues, which we greatly appreciated, we should not allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security or into the belief that we are through that.  We are now going to be judged on a different level and this could have serious consequences for us because we still have to transport goods and services throughout or around the neighbouring state and into the European Union before we come into the area where we are at the centre of activity.  Our hearts might be in Europe but our geographic location places us somewhat at a disadvantage.  The Minister might respond to those two points.</p></speech>

I assure Deputy Durkan that I regularly and forcefully make this particular argument.  However, in the spirit of candour it is also important to acknowledge on the tax architecture across the world and in Europe, there is a lot of momentum behind the agreement the OECD is drafting.  That is evident in the number of countries which have opted in to the consensus.  I strongly make the points about the challenges we face because of size and our location on the geographical edge of Europe in the discussions on this topic.</p></speech>

What has been done on the evaluation of the benefit for us?  Like the Minister, we are all anxious that Ireland is not disadvantaged in any way.  I know one of the people who spearheaded this, Mr. Guigold, an old adversary of mine.  It was not intended to be an advantage to us.  As time goes on, if we protect ourselves properly, which is the Minister's intention, it might be fine but if we cannot do that we may have a disadvantage.  My two questions are on collection methodology and need to ensure universal application.  </p></speech>

It will be an important issue later in the year.  A key issue for all in the OECD process is if an agreement is reached, how will it be enforced and when will it be implemented?  That is deeply important.  If countries will move, they will do so in an expectation that others are doing so at roughly the same time.  All I can do now is acknowledge that the Deputy's question does cut to the heart of where the process is now and is one which requires much further clarification as we approach October.</p> <p>  On the means of collection, I think the Deputy was referring to the importance of tax measures that recognise innovation and research.  That is why an important feature of our tax code is the research and development tax credit.  An important issue in the OECD engagement is the status of those different allowances.  That would affect the Deputy's first question, in that were agreement reached, that would influence how that tax was collected. </p></speech>

The OECD's multilateral instrument, MLI,  was obviously an attempt to provide common minimum standards for all existing and future double tax agreements.  The minimum standards set out in the MLI have been designed to close tax avoidance loopholes.  Article 12 of the MLI relates to defining when a multinational corporation has a taxable presences or a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction.  When Ireland signed the MLI in June 2017, I understand that article 12 was not adopted, thereby missing the opportunity to close this loophole.  Has this been closed since?</p></speech>

The UN, the World Bank, IMF and OECD all recommend the double tax treaties with developing countries should include anti-abuse provisions.  This is to stop aggressive tax avoidance by multinationals through the use of double tax treaty provisions.  What progress has Ireland made on this?  Is such an anti-abuse provision included in the treaty with Kosovo, which the World Bank considers a developing or emerging economy?</p> <p>  I was also going to ask about the summer economic statement.  As I had to pop out of the meeting to participate in Questions on Promised Legislation in the D&aacute;il, I am not sure if that question has already been asked.  The Minister will be before the joint committee to discuss that tomorrow morning.  We will need time to digest all the information to ask the appropriate questions.  Will we get that information soon?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we are engaged in a process of public consultation on this issue.  We have engaged with stakeholders and NGOs, some of which have advanced strong views on this.  We are considering different submissions and I hope we will be in a position to be able to draw conclusions on the consultation and publish them by the start of next year.  In the consultation, we specifically sought the views of the World Bank.  We actively sought its views on this in order that we could understand it a bit more and feed it in to our thinking.  I have a differing view on our standing on this issue but I am not blind to the debate which has developed and I know it is important that we have a policy statement in place that allows us to give a clear narrative and perspective on our position.</p> <p>  Article 12 of the multilateral instrument introduced a new test for when an agent can constitute a permanent establishment.  As it is not a minimum standard under the multilateral instrument, signatories are free to opt out of the recommendation.  We did not adopt this provision but we have committed to keeping the decision under review.  It is open to us to lift our reservation in respect of Article 12 at a later date.  We did not adopt Article 12 as there is significant uncertainty as to how the test would be applied in practice and this is still the case.  Similar to Ireland, many signatories to the multilateral instrument are choosing not to adopt Article 12 due to this uncertainty.  Some of our major trading partners such as the UK did not adopt Article 12 either as adopted by the final position deposited within the OECD.  While we are not in it at present, once there is sufficient clarity as to how the test might be applied, we are open to including it in our tax treaties.</p><p>This could potentially be done bilaterally case by case.</p><p> The summer economic statement was mentioned by earlier speakers.  We are in the final phase of working on it at the moment.  I need to brief Government first and, when that is done, I hope to be in a position to be able to present it and update the Oireachtas committee on it.</p></speech>

These things always takes time to examine properly.  Obviously, we would like to see that as soon as possible.  If the Minister wants to bring it to us first before he brings it to Government, that is no problem either.</p></speech>

I am chairman of the Ireland-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Society.  I am also associated with and vice chairman of the European group in support of Taiwan and our engagement in terms of trade, culture and so forth.</p> <p>  Under Michael Noonan when he was Minister, efforts were made to put in place a taxation agreement.  It was suggested at that time, to get over the politics of it, that the model adopted by the UK would, with some changes, facilitate the arrangement.  Has that made any progress?  Is there any hope that taxation agreement will be put in place sooner rather than later?</p></speech>

We have changed the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by amending sections 8 to 6 of that Act.  This is to allow for agreements to be made with countries with non-governmental entities.  This has paved the way legally for engagements with a view to seeing whether an engagement or a conclusion is possible with Taiwan.  Those discussions are ongoing at the moment.  Engagement is now possible because of the changes to the Taxes Consolidation Act.  That engagement is now happening.  They are, by their nature, confidential.  I am not, therefore, able to tell the Chairman what the outcome of them will be or whether it will be successful.  I can confirm to the Chairman that the engagement is now under way, however.</p></speech>

Anuas air sin, dearbha&iacute;onn na col&aacute;ist&iacute; don phobal Ghaeltachta gur &aacute;is luachmhar at&aacute; sa teanga ar fi&uacute; &iacute; a neart&uacute;, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in ar ch&uacute;iseanna m&oacute;rtas cine ach ar ch&uacute;iseanna eacnama&iacute;ochta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite go gcaitheann an St&aacute;t suas le &euro;5 milli&uacute;n ar sc&eacute;im na bhfoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge, ach meastar go ngineann na col&aacute;ist&iacute; idir &euro;50 milli&uacute;n agus &euro;60 milli&uacute;n do gheilleagar na Gaeltachta &ndash; sin m&eacute;ad&uacute; faoi dheich, agus n&iacute;os m&oacute;.  Gineann na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge fosta&iacute;ocht th&aacute;bhachtach a mb&iacute;onn baint dh&iacute;reach aici leis na col&aacute;ist&iacute; - mn&aacute; agus fir t&iacute;, m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus ceannair&iacute; - agus go hind&iacute;reach le siopa&iacute;, bialanna, comhlachta&iacute; iompair agus mar sin de.  Ar an mbonn eacnama&iacute;ochta amh&aacute;in, b&rsquo;fhi&uacute; don Rialtas breis infheistithe a dh&eacute;anamh san earn&aacute;il th&aacute;bhachtach seo.</p> <p>  Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; r&oacute;l l&aacute;rnach ag an nGaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais.  Ma&iacute;odh i r&aacute;iteas an Rialtais in 2006 i leith na Gaeilge go nd&eacute;anfar &ldquo;infheist&iacute;ocht fheabhsaithe ... i dtaca&iacute;ocht do mhodhanna nu&aacute;lacha teagaisc agus foghlama&rdquo;.  Sa strait&eacute;is 20 bliain tugadh gealltanais maidir le col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge, i measc ruda&iacute; eile, nach bhfuil &aacute; gcomhl&iacute;onadh.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r don St&aacute;t oibri&uacute; i gcomhph&aacute;irt le leis na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge maidir le deiseanna &uacute;s&aacute;ide Gaeilge a thabhairt do dhaoine &oacute;ga at&aacute; &aacute; foghlaim sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais fhoirmi&uacute;il.  Taca&iacute;m le h&eacute;ileamh CONCOS go dtabharfa&iacute; ar ais an deontas caipit&iacute;ochta.  Ba scannal &eacute; an deontas a chur ar ceal mar a rinneadh in 2008.  Bh&iacute; drochthionchar ag an chinneadh seo ar an earn&aacute;il a leanann go f&oacute;ill agus col&aacute;ist&iacute; beaga, ach go h&aacute;irithe, buailte.  Is mithid an ciorr&uacute; a aisiomp&uacute; agus deontas caipit&iacute;ochta in aghaidh gach dalta a thabhairt ar ais.</p> <p>  Is fi&uacute; a r&aacute; go bhfuil tionchar na Roinne Oideachais le feice&aacute;il thar an earn&aacute;il ar fad &ndash; m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; c&aacute;ilithe, c&uacute;rsa&iacute; faofa &ndash; ach n&iacute;l an Roinn ag maoini&uacute; col&aacute;ist&iacute; leis na freagrachta&iacute; a chomhl&iacute;onadh, mar a rinneadh roimhe.  I bhfianaise a th&aacute;bhachta&iacute; is at&aacute; na col&aacute;ist&iacute; d&rsquo;fhoghlaim na Gaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais, is n&aacute;ireach an rud &eacute; nach bhfuil an Roinn Oideachais d&aacute; maoini&uacute;.  T&aacute; Gael Linn ag tac&uacute; leis an moladh a rinneadh go mbonn&oacute;fa&iacute; coiste sti&uacute;rtha n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, task force, ar dt&uacute;s ar a mbeadh CONCOS, an Roinn Oideachais, Roinn na Gaeltachta, an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, COGG, agus Gael Linn, a bhfuil an c&uacute;ram orainn mar cheanneagra&iacute;ocht deiseanna a chruth&uacute; do dhalta&iacute;.  An phr&iacute;omhaidhm a bheadh ag coiste mar seo n&aacute; monat&oacute;ireacht a dh&eacute;anamh ar chaighde&aacute;in oideachas&uacute;la agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir lip&eacute;ad feabhais a bhun&uacute; do gach c&uacute;rsa.</p> <p>  Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; todhcha&iacute; na hearn&aacute;la ag brath ar an bpolasa&iacute; Gaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras scola&iacute;ochta, na siollabais, na curaclaim, agus na scr&uacute;duithe san &aacute;ireamh.  Faoi l&aacute;thair, t&aacute; 40% de na marcanna ag dul don bh&eacute;altriail.  N&iacute;or ch&oacute;ir aon laghd&uacute; a theacht air seo mar go n-aithn&iacute;tear go bhfuil na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeltachta ar cheann de na h&aacute;iseanna is fearr d&aacute; bhfuil ann do dhalta le marcanna n&iacute;os airde a fh&aacute;il sa scr&uacute;d&uacute; sin. </p> <p>  Creideann Gael Linn gur ch&oacute;ir cur le l&iacute;on na scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il chun an deis a bheith ag dalta&iacute; &oacute; ch&uacute;lra faoi mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste freastal ar chol&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge.  Dh&aacute; bhliain &oacute; shin, buna&iacute;odh sc&eacute;im scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; le haghaidh scoileanna DEIS.  Bh&iacute; 50 dalta sa t&iacute;r ar fad inch&aacute;ilithe le scol&aacute;ireacht &euro;850 an duine a fh&aacute;il.  Is suarach &eacute; l&iacute;on 50 dalta sa scol&aacute;ireacht nuair a th&eacute;ann suas le 27,000 dalta chun na Gaeltachta.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh, ar a laghad, 500 scol&aacute;ireacht don saghas seo le freastal fi&uacute;ntach a dh&eacute;anamh ar an &eacute;ileamh.  Nuair a bh&iacute;onn muid ag caint faoi chol&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh agus col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge, go hiond&uacute;il, is ar dh&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; a bh&iacute;onn muid ag caint.  Ach baineann foghlaim na Gaeilge le hoideachas fadsaoil, le daoine f&aacute;sta chomh maith.  N&iacute;l ach f&iacute;orbheag&aacute;n taca&iacute;ochta ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d i l&aacute;thair na huaire.  Mar sin, is c&oacute;ir cur le l&iacute;on na scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine f&aacute;sta le freastal ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeltachta.</p> <p>  Ba mhaith liom focail a r&aacute; faoi dhalta&iacute; &oacute; Thuaisceart &Eacute;ireann.  Is maith mar a mheascann siad le dalta&iacute; &oacute;n Deisceart ar na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge, i dT&iacute;r Chonaill go h&aacute;irithe.  Bh&iacute;odh sc&eacute;im an-mhaith scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; ag Roinn na Gaeltachta i gcomhar le feiseanna &oacute; Thuaidh le dalta&iacute; a mhealladh go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht.  Ceathr&uacute; scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; a bh&iacute;odh i gceist, ach cuireadh deireadh leis an sc&eacute;im sin in 2009.  Ba ch&oacute;ir don Rialtas tac&uacute; le d&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; &oacute; Thuaisceart &Eacute;ireann le hiad a mhealladh chun na Gaeltachta ar&iacute;s agus an sc&eacute;im sin a thabhairt ar ais.</p> <p>  Mar a d&uacute;irt M&aacute;ire Denvir, t&aacute; na col&aacute;ist&iacute; ar an bhf&oacute;d le breis agus 120 bliain.  T&aacute; an modh oibre athraithe ach t&aacute; s&eacute; a bheag n&oacute; a mh&oacute;r mar an gc&eacute;anna.

Is &eacute; sin le r&aacute; an mbeidh siad ag tos&uacute; ag cur br&oacute;isi&uacute;ir ar an margadh, ag cur su&iacute;omh Idirl&iacute;n ar f&aacute;il agus an bhf&eacute;adfadh siad dul ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; maidin am&aacute;rach leis na h&eacute;ilimh ar fad.</p> <p>  D&uacute;irt an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v ansin go bhfuil &eacute;ileamh m&oacute;r ar mhn&aacute; t&iacute; anois agus tagaim leis sin go huile is go hioml&aacute;n go bhfuil &eacute;ilimh orthu ach t&aacute; &eacute;ilimh uaf&aacute;sacha arda ar chol&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge freisin.  T&aacute; m&iacute;le cine&aacute;l c&aacute;ip&eacute;ise ann agus gan chaint ar bith orthu nuair a bh&iacute; an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v ar chol&aacute;iste samhraidh &ndash; m&aacute;s f&eacute;idir liom &eacute; a chur mar sin - na blianta &oacute; shin.

T&aacute; pr&aacute;inn leis an rud seo go dtiocfar ar r&eacute;iteach l&aacute;ithreach faoi c&eacute;ard &eacute; an socr&uacute; at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh do na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge, do na halla&iacute; pobail agus do na halla&iacute; eile a &uacute;s&aacute;ideann col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge.</p> <p>  Chomh maith leis sin, sular f&eacute;idir le haon chol&aacute;iste smaoineamh ar dhul ar aghaidh an bhliain seo chugainn le col&aacute;iste Gaeilge, caithfimid a chinnti&uacute; go gcaithfear isteach sa bhosca bruscair agus go bhfaighfear r&eacute;idh leis an dr&eacute;acht-ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is leighis a cuireadh ar f&aacute;il ag comhairleoir&iacute; leighis don Roinn Turas&oacute;ireachta, Cult&uacute;ir, Eala&iacute;on, Gaeltachta, Sp&oacute;irt agus Me&aacute;n mar n&iacute; eisp&eacute;ireas col&aacute;iste Gaeilge a bheadh ann.  N&iacute; fhoghlaimeodh aon ghas&uacute;r Gaeilge, n&iacute; mh&uacute;infeadh aon mh&uacute;inteoir ar an gcaoi sin n&aacute; n&iacute; bhainfid&iacute;s aon s&aacute;saimh aisti.  Bheadh deireadh le comhr&aacute; agus tuige go mbeadh siad ag dul go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht?  T&aacute; siad ag dul ann le spraoi, sp&oacute;rt, cult&uacute;r, craic agus teanga a fhoghlaim idir ranganna taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh.  N&iacute; raibh bealach ar bith a bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; rud ar bith mar sin a dh&eacute;anamh sa dr&eacute;acht-ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is seo.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go dtabharfa&iacute; ord&uacute; d&iacute;reach dearmad a dh&eacute;anamh gur tharla an dr&eacute;acht-ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is sin riamh.  T&aacute; a fhios agam nach c&aacute;ip&eacute;is ioml&aacute;n a bh&iacute; ann ach dr&eacute;acht ach lu&iacute;onn s&eacute; f&oacute;s leis an Roinn Turas&oacute;ireachta, Cult&uacute;ir, Eala&iacute;on, Gaeltachta, Sp&oacute;irt agus Me&aacute;n agus caithfear &eacute; sin a cheal&uacute; le go dtabharfar soil&eacute;iri&uacute; do na col&aacute;ist&iacute;.  </p> <p>  Aonta&iacute;m go gcaithfimid a bheith c&uacute;ramach agus beala&iacute; agus strait&eacute;is&iacute; eile a &uacute;s&aacute;id le go mbeidh gach uile dhuine s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilte agus sl&aacute;n &oacute; thaobh sl&aacute;inte agus c&oacute;ir&iacute;ochta de sna col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge.  Caithfear na beala&iacute; eile at&aacute; ann at&aacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os &eacute;ifeachta&iacute; n&aacute; an ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is a cuireadh ar f&aacute;il a scr&uacute;d&uacute;.</p> <p>  Caithfear deireadh a chur leis sin agus airgead cobhsaithe a shol&aacute;thar l&aacute;ithreach agus ansin caithfimid na h&eacute;ilimh ar fad at&aacute; againn a sh&aacute;samh, n&oacute; go mbre&aacute;th&oacute;fa&iacute; orthu, le gur f&eacute;idir linn dul ar aghaidh.  Cuir i gc&aacute;s go dt&eacute;imid beagnach siar anois 100 bliain sna col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge.  Beidh scol&aacute;ir&iacute; ag teacht ag an nGaeltacht nach dtuigeann c&eacute; h&iacute; bean an t&iacute;.  Roimhe seo thiocfadh 50%, n&oacute; b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir ar a laghad 30%, de ghas&uacute;ir a bh&iacute; acu anuraidh ar ais ag gach uile chol&aacute;iste.</p><p>Thuig siad an c&oacute;ras agus thuig siad bean an t&iacute;, t&eacute;arma&iacute; ar n&oacute;s "su&iacute; s&iacute;os ag an mbord" agus go rabhadar i seomra&iacute; le ch&eacute;ile.  T&aacute; an tuiscint sin ar fad imithe.  Bh&iacute;odh ceannair&iacute; t&iacute;, c&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; agus na daoine seo ar fad ag na col&aacute;ist&iacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin ar fad imithe.  T&aacute; na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus pr&iacute;omhoid&iacute; imithe ag cuid acu.  T&aacute; orthu ruda&iacute; a fh&aacute;il amach.  Caithfear an-chuid airgid agus oibre a chur isteach i dtraen&aacute;il daoine le go mbeimid in ann an tionscal a thabhairt ar ais ar bhealach ar bith.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; sa gc&aacute;ip&eacute;is, n&iacute; theasta&iacute;onn uainn go nd&eacute;anfaimid galltacht ioml&aacute;n den Ghaeltacht, go dtiocfadh gr&uacute;pa gas&uacute;r siar ann nach bhfuil a fhios acu c&eacute;ard at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute;.  Is c&oacute;ras iontach eagraithe a bh&iacute; sna col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge don chuid is m&oacute;, n&oacute; sa tromlach d&oacute;ibh.  Bh&iacute; siad thar a bheith eagraithe.  Bh&iacute; na gas&uacute;ir ag foghlaim.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Teachta Calleary ar ball, is ceann de na c&uacute;iseanna go bhfoghlaim&iacute;onn na gas&uacute;ir an oiread sin i gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge n&aacute; go mbaineann siad s&aacute;samh, spraoi agus taitneamh as.  T&aacute; an t-am acu.  T&aacute; siad tr&iacute; seachtaine i mbun foghlama.  T&aacute; ceithre rang 30-n&oacute;im&eacute;ad n&oacute; 35-n&oacute;im&eacute;ad agat m&aacute; t&aacute; an t-&aacute;dh leat mar mh&uacute;inteoir Gaeilge istigh i scoil.  Caithfimid smaoineamh air sin.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; sa ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is, is iad seo todhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge agus todhcha&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann.  Go minic, is as na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge a thagann ceannr&oacute;daithe na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il againn gur mar sin a leanas ach t&aacute; an sc&eacute;al anois pr&aacute;inneach.  N&iacute;l muid ag caint faoi rud a leigheasfar i gceann tr&iacute; mh&iacute; n&oacute; ceithre mh&iacute;.  Caithfear gn&iacute;omh a dh&eacute;anamh taobh istigh de choic&iacute;s n&oacute; tr&iacute; seachtaine le go mbeidh a fhios againn go mbeidh col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge ann n&oacute; go bhfuil muid chun dearmad a dh&eacute;anamh ar an tionscal.</p></speech>

T&aacute; siad an-chabhrach d&uacute;inn.  Tuigim an dua a bh&iacute; ar na finn&eacute;ithe teacht anseo.  T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as sin.

B'fhearr liom a bheith ag caint faoi conas is f&eacute;idir Gael Linn a &uacute;s&aacute;id agus na smaointe at&aacute; aige &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de agus &oacute; thaobh ranganna breise agus ranganna do dhaoine f&aacute;sta.  Ba mhaith liom tuilleadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta a bheith againn anseo maidir le ruda&iacute; mar sin.  Is cuid de r&eacute;iteach na g&eacute;arch&eacute;ime at&aacute; ann &oacute; thaobh na teanga &eacute; sin ach, ag an bpointe seo, t&aacute;imid i gcruach&aacute;s &oacute; thaobh na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh.  De ghn&aacute;th, tagann na focail "scannalach" agus "maslach" as mo bh&eacute;al.  Bu&iacute;ochas le Dia, n&iacute;l siad ag teacht as mo bh&eacute;al inniu ach ag teacht &oacute; bh&eacute;al Frank &Oacute; Maol&aacute;in ansin.</p> <p>  Cad at&aacute; tarlaithe anseo?  An bhliain seo caite, socra&iacute;odh pac&aacute;iste c&uacute;itimh tar &eacute;is br&uacute; &oacute; na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; agus uainn sa D&aacute;il.  Rinne an Rialtas an rud ceart i ndeireadh na D&aacute;la.  Bh&iacute; pac&aacute;iste c&uacute;itimh i gceist do na tr&iacute; rud, do na col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh agus na mn&aacute; t&iacute; ar dt&uacute;s agus, ina dhiaidh sin, do na halla&iacute; pobail.  An bhliain seo, t&aacute; deighilt d&eacute;anta.  N&iacute; maith an rud &eacute; sin.  Is rud tromch&uacute;iseach at&aacute; r&aacute;ite, is &eacute; sin, nach raibh an m&eacute;id sin cruinnithe i gceist.

Is rud bun&uacute;sach &eacute; sin.  Breathn&oacute;imid air sin agus muid ag r&eacute;iteach &aacute;r dtuarasc&aacute;il.

T&aacute; sin marc&aacute;ilte agam mar phointe.</p> <p>  Maidir leis na col&aacute;ist&iacute;, t&aacute; obair bhliana i gceist maidir leis an samhradh.  An bhfuil easpa tuisceana &oacute; thaobh na Roinne de go bhfuil obair bhliana i gceist seachas obair samhraidh?  In ainneoin gurb &iacute; an Roinn at&aacute; freagrach as an nGaeltacht at&aacute; i gceist, an bhfuil easpa tuisceana ann &oacute; thaobh c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach is at&aacute; na col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh agus na mn&aacute; t&iacute; don Ghaeilge?  Seachtain i ndiaidh seachtaine, b&iacute;mid ag caint faoin ng&eacute;arch&eacute;im at&aacute; i gceist &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; easpa seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge ann.  T&aacute; formh&oacute;r na daoine &oacute;ga ag caint tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla, faraor.  Chuala m&eacute; sc&eacute;al inn&eacute; - n&iacute;lim chun &eacute; a athr&aacute; ach chuir s&eacute; imn&iacute; orm - faoin m&eacute;id daoine &oacute;ga as na Gaeltachta&iacute; at&aacute; ag caint faoin nGaeilge.  Tuigim gur ciorcal at&aacute; i gceist ansin ach t&aacute; neart fadhbanna ann.  T&aacute; r&eacute;itigh ann do na fadhbanna seo.  Cad at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l?  T&aacute; s&eacute; luaite go bhfuil CONCOS ag iarraidh comhaont&uacute; tr&iacute;-bliana a bheith acu.  N&iacute; thuigim &eacute; sin.  Cad at&aacute; i gceist maidir leis sin?  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th a bhfuil deacrachta&iacute; faoi sin?  </p> <p>  Maidir le Gael Linn, ba mhaith liom tuilleadh a chloiste&aacute;il, taobh amuigh de na laghduithe agus na ciorruithe c&eacute; n&aacute;r ceart go bhfuil siad f&oacute;s i bhfeidhm.  Ba mhaith liom a chloiste&aacute;il faoi na socruithe n&oacute; r&eacute;itigh at&aacute; ann maidir leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn agus na cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; sa strait&eacute;is 20 bliana a bhaint amach.  C&eacute;n chusp&oacute;ir a bh&iacute; ann?  An rabhthas ag iarraidh 40,000 duine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a bheith ag labhairt na Gaeilge?  Cad iad na smaointe at&aacute; ag Gael Linn faoi sin?  An bhfuil aon rud &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn n&oacute; ag an gc&oacute;ras chun na cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; sin a bhaint amach?  Ceapaim n&aacute;r thuig aon rialtas c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach is at&aacute; an dea-thoil ar an talamh.  Caithfear t&oacute;g&aacute;il air sin agus neart c&uacute;rsa&iacute;, ranganna agus tr&eacute;imhs&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht a chur ar f&aacute;il.  Is fi&uacute; an infheist&iacute;ocht sin m&aacute; t&aacute;imid i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin ng&eacute;arch&eacute;im at&aacute; ann.  N&iacute; saineola&iacute; m&eacute;.  I nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, is duine nua don Ghaeilge m&eacute;.  T&aacute; s&iacute; agam le c&uacute;pla bliain anois.

Is &eacute; an rud a tharla anuraidh n&aacute; go bhfuair na col&aacute;ist&iacute; &euro;150, figi&uacute;r a bh&iacute; bunaithe ar 15% den t&aacute;ille.  Fuair na mn&aacute; t&iacute; &euro;4 in aghaidh an lae, &eacute; sin bunaithe ar 15% den teacht isteach a bh&iacute; acusan.  Fuair an d&aacute; thaobh an c&eacute;atad&aacute;n c&eacute;anna anuraidh.  De bharr sin, bh&iacute;omar beo le tosach i mbliana.  Ar an drochuair, th&aacute;inig an cinneadh mall ar&iacute;s.  Shuigh muid s&iacute;os leis an Roinn.  B'fh&eacute;idir gur sin an &aacute;it a raibh an mh&iacute;thuiscint aici.  Bh&iacute; c&uacute;pla cruinni&uacute; againn faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; a re&aacute;cht&aacute;il i mbliana seachas faoi chobhs&uacute;.  Bh&iacute;omar ag iarraidh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; a re&aacute;cht&aacute;il mar is &eacute; sin an gn&oacute; at&aacute; againn.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach.</p> <p>  Mar fhocal scoir air seo, ba mhaith liom picti&uacute;r beag a tharraingt.  T&eacute;ann daoine go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht don ch&eacute;ad uair sa ch&eacute;ad bhliain ar an m&eacute;anscoil don chuid is m&oacute;.  Chaill na daoine a th&aacute;inig isteach sna col&aacute;ist&iacute; in 2019 agus a bh&iacute; sa ch&eacute;ad bhliain 2020 agus t&aacute; 2021 caillte acu.  N&iacute; bheidh siad in ann freastal ar&iacute;s go dt&iacute; 2022.  N&iacute; bheidh an chuid is m&oacute; de scol&aacute;ir&iacute; na me&aacute;nscoileanna in ann freastal ar an nGaeltacht go dt&iacute; go bhfuil an teastas s&oacute;isearach d&eacute;anta acu.  Beidh siad san idirbhliain.  Beidh s&eacute; f&iacute;ordhoiligh.  T&aacute;imid druidte.  Bh&iacute;omar druidte anuraidh agus t&aacute;imid druidte i mbliana.  Beidh s&eacute; f&iacute;ordhoiligh ar na col&aacute;ist&iacute; athoscailt.  Mar a d&uacute;irt M&aacute;ire Denvir, is &eacute; sin an rud faoina bhfuilimid ag caint.  T&aacute;imid druidte agus caithfimid a chinnti&uacute; go mbeimid in ann oscailt i gceann c&uacute;pla seachtain le hearn&aacute;il 2022 a thos&uacute;.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh an tac&uacute; n&oacute; an cobhs&uacute; seo a fh&aacute;il chomh luath is a thig linn.  Mar a d&uacute;radh sa Chamber anseo tr&iacute; na blianta, t&aacute; s&eacute; iontach furasta rud a dhruid ach i bhfad n&iacute;os deacra &eacute; a athoscailt.  Is &eacute; sin an jab is m&oacute; at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh againn.  Beidh cuid mhaith de na mn&aacute; t&iacute; caillte againn an bhliain seo chugainn.  T&aacute; cobhs&uacute; faighte acu i mbliana ach an mbeidh siad linn an bhliain seo chugainn?  Caithfimid daoine nua a mhealladh isteach.  Mar a d&uacute;irt M&aacute;ire Denvir, caithfimid c&uacute;rsa&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il do cheannair&iacute; agus d'ardmh&aacute;istr&iacute;, daoine at&aacute; caillte againn, mar n&iacute;l na daoine seo fostaithe go l&aacute;naimseartha ag na col&aacute;ist&iacute;.  Oibr&iacute;onn siad ar fad an tsamhraidh gach uile bhliain.  Beidh cuid mhaith de na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus pr&iacute;omhoid&iacute; maithe caillte ag na col&aacute;ist&iacute;.  Beidh orainn tos&uacute; &oacute;n t&uacute;s ar&iacute;s.</p></speech>

Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, t&aacute; s&eacute; tite.  Is tionscadal &eacute; nach bhfuil ann ag an bpointe sin le dh&aacute; bhliain.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, caithfear go leor ama, smaointe agus airgid a chur isteach lena at&oacute;g&aacute;il, b&iacute;odh s&eacute; mar a bh&iacute; s&eacute; n&oacute; i bhfoirm eile.  T&aacute; go leor beala&iacute; ann go bhf&eacute;adfadh gas&uacute;ir agus daoine f&aacute;sta a thabhairt go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht ach caithfimid taca&iacute;ocht an St&aacute;it a bheith againn agus, leis sin, taca&iacute;ocht Roinn na Gaeltachta &ndash; t&aacute; ainm an-fhada uirthi anois, ach tugaimid Roinn na Gaeltachta uirthi - agus taca&iacute;ocht na Roinne Oideachais.  Ba cheart d&oacute;ibh sin a bheith ag obair i dtaca a ch&eacute;ile.</p> <p>  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v ar ball, is &iacute; an Roinn Oideachais a bhunaigh c&oacute;ras na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge agus a bh&iacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; leo go dt&iacute; 2008 nuair a th&aacute;inig an c&uacute;l&uacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta deiridh.  Go dt&iacute; sin, bh&iacute; &aacute;it l&aacute;rnach ag an Roinn Oideachais sna c&uacute;rsa&iacute; seo.  T&aacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; i gceist le oideachas, le foghlaim teanga agus le forbairt gas&uacute;ir &oacute;ga n&aacute; &euro;52.  Bh&iacute; ionchur an-l&aacute;idir sa ch&oacute;ras seo ag an Roinn Oideachais ag an am, &oacute; thaobh leagan amach an tsiollabais teanga a mh&uacute;inf&iacute; agus mar sin de.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir a r&aacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; sin amhlaidh anois mar nach bhfuil an Roinn p&aacute;irteach i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  C&eacute; go nd&eacute;antar cigireacht agus go bhfuil cigir&iacute; tugtha isteach, n&iacute;l s&eacute; sin s&aacute;s&uacute;il ar chor ar bith do na col&aacute;ist&iacute;.  T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh dul ar ais ag an staid a rabhamar ansin agus chabhr&oacute;dh s&eacute;.</p> <p>  Ba bhre&aacute; linn d&aacute; bhfaighimis an seans su&iacute; s&iacute;os leis an Roinn Oideachais agus le Roinn na Gaeltachta le go l&eacute;ireoimis leo na beala&iacute; difri&uacute;la gur f&eacute;idir cabhr&uacute; ar chuile bhealach le m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeimis ag obair mar sin.  Is &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anann muid; feabhs&uacute; na ngas&uacute;r ina gcuid Gaeilge.  Cabhra&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin.  Bheadh s&eacute; thar a bheith sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il taighde agus staid&eacute;ar a dh&eacute;anamh ar c&eacute; hiad na gas&uacute;ir is fearr a n-&eacute;irigh leo sna scr&uacute;duithe St&aacute;it &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de.  Creidim gur fhreastal go leor acu ar chol&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge.  D'fhoghlaim siad sna ranganna.  N&iacute;l aon amhras faoi sin.  B&iacute;onn tr&iacute; huaire acu ar feadh seacht l&aacute; na seachtaine.  N&iacute;l aon amhras ach go bhfoghlaim&iacute;onn siad ansin ach foghlaim&iacute;onn siad i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; taobh amuigh, ag spraoi le ch&eacute;ile, ag na c&eacute;il&iacute;, sna tithe l&oacute;ist&iacute;n, leis na mn&aacute; t&iacute; agus bean an t&iacute; ag caint leo agus muintir an t&iacute; ag imirt c&aacute;rta&iacute; leo.  T&aacute; siad ag maireacht&aacute;il.</p> <p>  T&aacute; an-deis againn breathn&uacute; ar bheala&iacute; difri&uacute;la amhail c&uacute;rsa&iacute; idirbhliana, ach mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; ar ball, ceapaim go bhfuil rud pr&aacute;inneach againn don bhliain seo agus b'fh&eacute;idir gur cheart go mbeimis ar ais anseo ag pl&eacute; na todhcha&iacute; agus, mar a d&uacute;irt an Teachta Connolly ar ball, ag pl&eacute; na ruda&iacute; dearfacha gur f&eacute;idir a dh&eacute;anamh faoin Ghaeilge.</p> <p>  Faoi l&aacute;thair, t&aacute; s&eacute; pr&aacute;inneach go mairfimid, agus nach nd&uacute;nfar na col&aacute;ist&iacute; in &aacute;iteanna nach bhfuil aon tionscal eile ann.  I gc&aacute;s an col&aacute;iste at&aacute; againn, agus n&iacute;l m&eacute; ag iarraidh aon chol&aacute;iste a lua go pearsanta, n&iacute;l aon tionscal eile i gCamas ar chor ar bith.  N&iacute; raibh riamh.  N&iacute;or chuir an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, n&aacute; an Roinn n&aacute; duine ar bith aon tionscal ceart ar f&aacute;il i gCamas ach Col&aacute;iste Chamuis.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin f&oacute;s ag maireacht&aacute;il, ach an mbeidh s&eacute; in ann dul ar aghaidh sa todhcha&iacute;?  T&aacute; go leor col&aacute;ist&iacute; eile d&iacute;reach mar a ch&eacute;ile.  D&eacute;arfadh muintir Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire an rud c&eacute;anna leat, go bhfuil fadhb an-mh&oacute;r acu, mura bhfaighidh siadsan deis tosaigh, fios n&oacute; eolas ar c&aacute; bhfuil muid.  T&aacute; col&aacute;iste beag b&iacute;deach acu th&iacute;os ansin.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh f&aacute;il amach c&aacute; bhfuil muid.  T&aacute; muid i liomb&oacute;.  N&iacute;l a fhios againn c&aacute; seasann an tionscal seo.  An bhfuil muid in ann dul ar aghaidh n&oacute; nach bhfuil muid?</p> <p>  T&aacute; taca&iacute;ocht n&oacute; cobhs&uacute; geallta.  C&eacute;ard &eacute; an cobhs&uacute;?  C&eacute;n leagan amach at&aacute; air?  N&iacute;l a fhios againn.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; i mo chuid cainte, is cinnte go mbeidh traen&aacute;il i gceist agus ba bhre&aacute; linn go mbreathn&oacute;dh Roinn na Gaeltachta ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; tr&iacute; l&aacute;.  T&aacute; c&uacute;is agam leis an tr&iacute; l&aacute;, n&oacute; ceithre l&aacute; ar a mh&eacute;ad, mar in amanna sa scoil, b&iacute;onn s&eacute; an-deacair na gas&uacute;ir a fh&aacute;il ach d'fh&eacute;adf&aacute; D&eacute; hAoine, D&eacute; Sathairn agus D&eacute; Domhnaigh a fh&aacute;il.  In amanna, n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus b&iacute;onn deacrachta&iacute; ag scoileanna.  Is iarmh&uacute;inteoir m&eacute; f&eacute;in.  B&iacute;onn m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; eile a thabhairt amach ag gear&aacute;in go bhfuil siad ag dul amach as an seomra r&oacute;mhinic n&oacute; go bhfuil siad imithe go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht n&oacute; mar sin de.  Ach t&aacute; beala&iacute; ann le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.  In &aacute;it a bheith ag dul anonn go dt&iacute; an Sp&aacute;inn, n&oacute; go P&aacute;ras ar a gcuid tr&iacute;, ceithre l&aacute; n&oacute; c&uacute;ig l&aacute; a dh&eacute;anann siad, ba ch&oacute;ir d&oacute;ibh dul go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht agus cur lena saibhreas f&eacute;in agus aithne a chur orthu f&eacute;in mar dhaoine.  Cuireann t&uacute; aithne ort f&eacute;in tr&iacute;d an teanga and tr&iacute;d an gcult&uacute;r.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i s&iacute;c&eacute; na n&Eacute;ireannach.</p> <p>  N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sin, ach ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeimis ag cur m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte roimh dhaoine a th&aacute;inig isteach, na h&Eacute;ireannaigh nua, agus go mbeid&iacute;s ag teacht chuig an nGaeltacht in &aacute;it muid a bheith ag breathn&uacute; orthu amuigh ansin.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn iad a thabhairt isteach agus go mbeid&iacute;s ag foghlaim &aacute;r mbeala&iacute; &Eacute;ireannacha tr&iacute;d an teanga.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; in &aacute;it ar bith n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre n&aacute; ansin.

I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Dillon and his wife on the birth of their new baby.  It is nice to hear some good news in Leinster House.  The meeting has been convened to consider Revised Estimates for Public Service 2021: Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media - Vote 33 - programme areas A, B, D and E, which were referred to the select committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I welcome the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Minister of State and their officials and thank them for their briefing document provided to us prior to the meeting.  The opening statements and any other documents submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p> <p>  As the Minister and Minister of State are present, officials should not speak in public session.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House or the convention centre to attend today's public meeting.  I cannot permit a member to attend when he or she does not adhere to that constitutional requirement.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask members to identify themselves when contributing to the debate for Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report so I ask members to mute their microphone when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.  I also ask members to use their raise their hand button when they wish to contribute and remind all those present to ensure their mobile phones are in silent mode or better again, switched off.  </p> <p>  To commence our discussion, I invite the Minister to make her presentation.  We will suspend the meeting while we try to resolve a technical issue.</p></speech>

Cuireann na hearn&aacute;lacha seo go m&oacute;r le geilleagar na t&iacute;re, agus taca&iacute;onn siad le foll&aacute;ine an duine aonar agus an pobal ar fud na h&Eacute;ireann chomh maith.</p> <p>  The diverse range of sectors served by my Department have been among those most severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Employing many hundreds of thousands right across the country, these are the sectors that thrive when people congregate to enjoy time together and when local communities and businesses flourish.  All of them, however, have been dreadfully impacted by the restrictions imposed on our society during the pandemic.</p> <p>  Large parts of these sectors will be among the last to return to full operations as the country reopens.  Our cultural institutions and theatres, tourism destinations, hospitality businesses, sporting occasions, Gaeltacht communities and local media have endured great challenges since March of last year, yet these are the very sectors that have brought us light through the dark times and it has been demonstrated that without question, they are essential for our physical, social and mental well-being.</p> <p>  I am deeply conscious of the effects that measures taken in the interests of public health have had on businesses, in particular the hundreds of thousands of workers whose ability to make a living has been excruciatingly curtailed and for so long.  We should also recognise that these tough decisions have enabled all of us through collective action to protect the most vulnerable in our society and with the ongoing roll-out of the vaccination programme, we now find ourselves positioned where we can start to move on from the pandemic and focus our efforts on economic and social recovery.  Over the coming months, as the restrictions continue to ease and the vaccine programme continues its roll-out, we will see the safe and successful reopening of our society and with it, our tourism sector, arts and culture venues and events and the eventual welcoming back of fans to our sports grounds.</p> <p>  The 2021 Further Revised Estimates for my Department have been informed by ongoing engagement with sectoral representatives.  The additional funding is providing for a strong suite of significant measures as a robust and targeted response to this crisis.  It it will support resilience and recovery and ensure that Ireland can prosper once more on the global stage in the fields of tourism, culture, sport and linguistic heritage.  These sectors, individually and cumulatively, are an integral part of the fabric of our society, most particularly in rural and regional areas where they support economic activity and physical and societal well-being.  Well-being is a core principle underpinning the living with Covid plan and it will be fundamental to public confidence and resilience as we emerge from and manage the crisis over the longer term.</p> <p>  Total 2021 funding for the sectors supported by my Department is as follows.  There will be &euro;220.9 million for tourism services, including a &euro;55 million support fund for strategic tourism businesses and &euro;5 million for training and digitalisation support in the sector.  These measures are complementary to the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Covid restrictions support schemes and the restart scheme.  Thus far, three phases of the tourism business continuity schemes have been launched aimed at improving the competitiveness and viability of businesses in the sector.  I also launched a &euro;17 million outdoor dining enhancement scheme being delivered in partnership between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and local authorities across the country.  This scheme is providing funding for tourism and hospitality business to develop and increase their own outdoor seating capacity and is providing funding to local authorities to develop permanent outdoor public dining spaces in towns and urban centres similar to those that exist in various European cities.  In addition, the tourism sector has been able to avail of cross-Government supports, including the reduction in the VAT rate, which was recently extended to September 2022; the Covid restrictions support scheme and the rates waiver extension, representing a significant cross-Government response to the existential impact of Covid-19.</p><p> Total funding for the arts and culture sector in 2021 is &euro;341 million, an increase of 74% compared with the initial allocation in budget 2020.  The additional funding provides for a 2021 allocation of &euro;130 million for the Arts Council, an increase of 24% on 2020.  This additional investment empowers the Arts Council to help artists, arts workers and arts organisations come through this crisis and play their part in the national recovery.  Significant support is also being provided for live entertainment in the amount of &euro;50 million.  This funding has allowed for &euro;25 million to fund a new live performance support scheme, &euro;14 million for a new support scheme for live entertainment businesses, &euro;5 million to support local authorities for outdoor live performances, &euro;5 million capital supports for the live entertainment sector and &euro;1 million to fund the St. Patrick's Festival.</p><p> There is provision for &euro;8 million to facilitate the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall.  This will be a significant step towards the objective of enabling the orchestra to be established as a world-class orchestra that will, with the National Concert Hall, provide a creative and imaginative programme strategy that will greatly enhance the offering of the combined organisation to the public.</p><p> The audiovisual industry was been one of the success stories of 2020, with on-screen success in the form of "Normal People" but also its track record in maintaining output in the face of Covid-19.  I am, therefore, very pleased to be able to increase Screen Ireland&rsquo;s funding by &euro;6 million to &euro;30.1 million in 2021.  Funding of &euro;280.5 million will be provided for media and broadcasting in 2021 in recognition of the critical communication role of this sector during the current crisis.  An additional &euro;3.5 million is being provided to TG4 and the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall outlined earlier will also have reciprocal benefits for RT&Eacute; and is evidence of the synergies that can be brought to bear with the culture and broadcasting and media sectors now part of the same brief.</p><p> I am satisfied the increased allocation for my Department in 2021 of &euro;1.092 billion allows for the continuation and enhancement of its very diverse but critical work programmes.  As Minister, I intend to do everything possible to ensure that as we emerge from the shadow of Covid-19, we will have a world-renowned tourism industry, a vibrant arts and culture sector, a dynamic sports and media sector and a landscape in which our language and our engagement with it can continue to grow.  I thank the committee and I will now hand over to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, to speak about the Further Revised Estimate for 2021 as it relates to sport.</p></speech>

Within this, the 2021 provision allows for a new round of the sports capital programme.  In addition, resources have been provided in 2021 to progress the first projects allocated funding under the new large-scale sport infrastructure fund.  Current funding support for Sport Ireland programmes totals &euro;91.91 million, enabling Sport Ireland to ensure our athletes are supported to achieve their potential at the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, to ensure core grant funding for our sporting bodies to sustain them through the challenging months to come and to fund Sport Ireland participation programmes.</p> <p>  This is a very considerable investment in sport.  The funding will allow grant funding for our sporting bodies to sustain them through this challenging period and I know clubs across the country have welcomed the sports capital programme, while the increase in dormant accounts funding will promote and sustain participation in sport and physical activity, particularly in hard to reach communities.  The Minister and I will be happy to take any questions from members.</p></speech>

The tourism gig is a tough one at the moment and it is a case of rather you than me.  It is a very difficult time in tourism and the work being done by the Minister and Minister of State has an impact on hundreds of thousands of workers, families and households.  I am sure they are under no illusion as to how important the job is and I wish them well with it.</p> <p>  To follow Deputy Munster's question, when international travel and tourism restarts in earnest, the market will be more competitive than ever.  There will be an additional requirement for support for Tourism Ireland.  I know the aviation sector is technically under the Department of Transport but the relationship between it and the Minister's sector is very important.</p><p>Is there a plan to increase supports for co-operative marketing, etc., to try to establish new routes, to support routes and to re-establish existing routes? </p></speech>

However, he rightly pointed out the importance of marketing the establishment of connectivity to make it very clear that Ireland has reopened.  We are very much moving into that space from next week.  Tourism Ireland launched a new &euro;3.5 million promotional campaign on 7 June.  Phase 1 of that involves a major digital video campaign, which went live from 7 June with the slogan, "Let's get back to Ireland".  That is definitely the message we want.  We hope that online video will build anticipation for holidays in Ireland this summer.</p> <p>  From my engagement with Tourism Ireland, it is quite clear that there is pent-up demand to come here and we are tapping into that.  Tourism Ireland also hopes to launch the next phase of the campaign in the coming weeks in line with Government plans for the reopening of international travel.  This will deliver a very clear "book now" message to prospective international visitors and will single-mindedly drive visitor numbers back to Ireland.  It is clearly stated in the national economic recovery plan that supports will remain in place for sectors as they need them.  We are acutely aware that more supports will be needed after the summer period.</p></speech>

However, that subhead increased by just &euro;38.2 million in the Revised Estimates for 2020-21.  How was the missing &euro;11.8 million made up?  Does this mean &euro;11.8 million in cuts to the budget for regional museums, galleries, cultural centres and projects or did the Department make an error?</p></speech>

That &euro;50 million was hard fought for and I can guarantee that no sector will receive any cuts.  The focus is completely on extra funding and that is what was achieved in the budget.  Unprecedented funding, for the first time, of &euro;50 million for the events and commercial music sectors brought total funding of the Arts Council to &euro;130 million.  There is no accounting error.</p></speech>

I presume we will get it.  The scheme has been very well received.  One positive out of all this is that the reopening of outdoor dining and activity is reimagining our cities and many areas in rural Ireland, including those the Chair represents in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency.  It is breathing life into our towns and villages, which is a positive.  The only feedback I have received has been through personal interaction, where the scheme has been very well received.</p></speech>

I compliment the Minister on the significant investment in, and advancement of, the Arts Council, which was needed prior to the pandemic.  Funding increased to a historic &euro;130 million and that has been very useful and helpful to the Arts Council in supporting artists who have seen 15 or 18 months of their work schedule wiped out.  For the future, I encourage the Minister to ensure that supports not only remain but are enhanced in any way possible for organisations like the Arts Council because the artists it is supporting have no other forms of income.  It is their umbrella organisation, their peace and security, their stability and their future.  It is critical that the Arts Council is supported by the highest possible financial means into the future.  That is more a comment than a statement.  I wanted to compliment the Minister on that.</p></speech>

What are the future plans for the Arts Council?  Specifically, what are the budgetary plans regarding support for Irish film?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-14a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOS2021071400002#D01400"><p>Arts Council funding has made a significant difference in helping to sustain artists and organisations.  I am very conscious of that as we move into budget 2022 negotiations.  I thank the Deputy and Chair for their kind words.  I am very aware of the difference the funding has made as I go into these negotiations.</p> <p>  As I have said, the film industry that has managed to do very well under awful circumstances.  In budget 2021, Screen Ireland was allocated an additional &euro;9 million over and above its 2020 allocation.  This increased funding has helped to address significant levels of feature film production delay and will assist with costs relating to the implementation of health and safety protocols.  Much of the groundwork for the success of the audiovisual sector in Ireland was laid in recent years, for example through the launch of the audiovisual action plan in 2018.  The budget 2021 announcements addressed two key elements of that action plan: the regional film development uplift, which will see the enhanced tax credit of 5% in place for an additional year, and the announcement that work will now commence on the development of a tax credit for the digital gaming sector.  Again, I am acutely aware, but it is no harm saying it on this platform, that this funding has made a difference.  I am aware of that as I go into the budget negotiations.  I place a high value on both sectors.</p></speech>

The live performance support scheme was recently announced.  I spoke to the Minister about the live entertainment business scheme.  All of that is very welcome and very much needed.  We have had numerous eyewitness accounts from organisations that have come before us to talk about the devastation for them and the uncertainty as to when they will get back to work.  The scheme is welcome.</p> <p>  Has the Department carried out any analysis on the spread of that nationally in terms of areas that were and were not successful?  I am mindful of the fact that in more urban areas, there could be a tendency to have more applications.  Has there been any analysis of an even geographical spread or any feedback on that?</p></speech>

A total of 237 applicants received funding under the &euro;25 million scheme.  That funding ranged from small to large venues, encompassed producers and promoters and supported live events in every county, including festivals, concerts, theatre productions, comedy and outdoor events.  While there appears to have been talk of disappointment from certain counties, we would have to consider how many applications we actually received from them.  Every county got a grant and we will keep that under review.</p> <p>  Similar to tourism, I am aware of the impact that social distancing has had on this industry and its viability.  In the national economic recovery plan, it is stated that the industry will remain supported.  If the Chair has any specific queries, I ask her to bring them to my attention offline and I will be happy to talk to her about them.</p></speech>

I want to compliment the Minister and the work she has done on having those events that have taken place outdoors.  It has been great to see them.  I did not get to attend anything yet but there have been concert events in the Phoenix Park and Kilmainham.  I have listened to a lot of commentators and observations since that.  Huge kudos to the Minister for getting trial events up and running.</p> <p>  The question will be whether it is sustainable financially in terms of the cost of running events like that and the extra layers of costs due to social distancing and health and other guidelines that have to be adhered to.  Has the Department carried out any analysis of the sustainability and extra cost output that it will create for live events across the country if they are to proceed in that manner?</p></speech>

For example, the event in Iveagh Gardens was the first ever event after a period of complete closure.  Even that was about the logistics of entry and exit, managing social distancing and how we are living with Covid.  Things started at that basic level.  As the Chair can see, things are moving further and further.  It is essential that we have these events.</p> <p>  A range of indoor and outdoor events are taking place across the country.  Consideration is being given to further pilot events but the key factor in determining these events will be the need to generate data and the operational guidance to support the resumption of financially viable live performances.  It is likely that live performance support scheme, LPSS, supported events may be considered for future pilot events in the coming weeks, as well as further events supported by the Arts Council. </p> <p>  Like the Chair and every member of the committee, we all want a return to an economically viable live performance as soon as possible.  There are many reasons to be optimistic.  The roll-out of the vaccination programme is the most important factor underpinning our hopes of what may be possible.  This week at Cabinet, I notified my colleagues that I want further detailed advice on how we can get a return to live music at outdoor licensed premises and indoor licensed premises.  I want that return to happen as soon as possible and notified my Cabinet colleagues of that.  I am writing to seek that advice. </p> <p>  In terms of what it will take to reopen things safely, I want to know that and plan for and do it as soon as possible.  Lead-in times are required.  It is not as simple as pressing an on or off button and suddenly opening doors, as the Chair will know from her involvement in this sector.  We are working on it. </p></speech>

I want to congratulate him on the progress he has made to date on a number of important issues, in particular the issue of ladies Gaelic players, as well as a number of other issues.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the new local round of sports capital funding.  I am not sure how familiar the Minister of State is with the New Testament but the loaves and fishes come to mind when one considers the &euro;200 million ask and the &euro;40 million budget available.  Given the level of funding and demand there is bound to be disappointment unless additional funding is secured for the programme.  Is the Minister of State working on trying to secure additional funding?  How is that looking?  Is funding for the new round of sports capital allocations likely to be increased?</p></speech>

As he said, we have had a record number of applications.  Over 3,000 applications have sought over &euro;200 million.  As he said, the allocation currently apportioned is about &euro;40 million.  There are two parts to this process, as the Deputy knows from his previous role.  There is the equipment-only part first, which we hope to process pretty quickly.  We hope to announce equipment-only grants in the next couple of weeks.  They are currently being finalised.</p> <p>  The sports capital or mixed applications we hope to have ready in mid to late autumn.  Between now and then we will seek to increase funding to ensure delivery to many communities and have appropriate allocations that go above the &euro;40 million figure.  We will engage with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The national development plan process is ongoing and is due to conclude in quarter 3.  Between our direct discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the national development plan, we will look to increase that beyond the &euro;40 million allocation.</p></speech>

Following on from Deputy Griffin's analysis of the situation, we all know that capital grants are very important.  Very often they involve all-weather pitches, which are invaluable in our climate.  An increase in funding is needed.  As the Minister of State is aware, these are very good projects.  In my area, a new hockey pitch is being developed.  There are some great hockey players in the area, who have played in all-Ireland competitions, have won medals and so forth.  What is the possibility of there being an increase in funding?</p></speech>

Obviously to what extent that will happen is still to be determined, as the Deputy knows.  The dual process involves the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the national development plan.</p><p>Deputy Griffin was Minister of State previously.  It obviously increased from the baseline closer to when the allocations were made.  As Deputy Mythen said, there are many good projects across communities that need State backing.  With a demand of &euro;200 million and a current allocation of &euro;40 million, we will be looking to increase that.  We will be able to give certainty on that in the autumn, closer to when the allocations and announcements will be made.  That will be mid to late autumn, so there is some time yet to work through that with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, the broader position of this Government on capital, as part of the recovery, is focused on regional employment, getting people back to work and promoting recovery.  The capital is very important.  Sports capital hits every community in every corner of the country and has positive regional employment benefits as well as long-term benefits around participation in sport.  That has to be underpinned with backing, and we will be seeking to increase it beyond the &euro;40 million baseline so more projects will be captured in the coming years.</p></speech>

I was going to ask if this was predominantly taken up with the sports allocation grants, but the Minister of State said there is &euro;40 million for that.  He also acknowledged that there is a record number of applications.  As Deputy Griffin knows, there is a record number of applications year on year and many do not qualify.  I am curious.  The Minister of State said he intends to do it, but I would imagine he would have put a little more focus on it at this stage and be able to give us the figure, given that he already knows there is a record number of applications and the number of clubs and sporting organisations the length and breadth of the State that are waiting on this funding and, more importantly, depending on it.</p></speech>

The applications only closed in March, and we extended it to facilitate as many clubs as possible to apply.  What we are doing currently is working through the equipment-only part of the application process.  I am confident when that is announced the Deputy will see a very generous allocation on the equipment side.  A massive amount of clubs across the country will benefit from that.  That is one side of the scheme, and that will be positively responded to by both me and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.</p> <p>  On the sports capital side, we have had engagement and direct conversations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his Department on the sports capital allocation generally.  As there are more than 3,000 applications, we are working through that assessment process.  We have a broader national development plan review as well, which will set the trajectory of capital over the coming years.  However, we are all on the one page as regards trying to back as many good projects across our communities as possible, and I am confident there will be a significant increase on the current baseline.  That is obviously subject to finalisation through the NDP and ongoing discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but these applications still have to be assessed.  It will be mid to late autumn before we will be announcing anything anyway, so there is a little space.  I am not going to mislead the committee and give a projected figure until that is finalised and decided.  I will just say I am confident it will increase beyond the current baseline.</p></speech>

Since 2017, the arts and culture budget was increased by &euro;124.5 million while the Gaeltacht budget was only increased by &euro;16.5 million in the same period.  As a result, bodies such as Foras na Gaeilge and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta are being further disadvantaged compared to their English-language counterparts in culture promotion and regional development.  Will the Minister attempt to address this inequality in future budgets?</p></speech>

The Estimates for the Gaeltacht are now taken by a separate committee chaired by the Deputy's colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  We dealt with the Estimates for the Gaeltacht.  We have a new strategy for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and there were significant increases in funding for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta over the last 24 months, particularly in respect of the impact of Brexit and Covid-19.  The new strategy for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is about trying to give the prospect of regional employment for young people and backing enterprises across Gaeltacht areas.  We can send the committee details on that.  However, if one looks at the comparative breakdown, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has received significant support.  I outlined that in the Estimates process for that committee when I appeared before it in the last week or so.</p></speech>
