    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Muireann Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019092500002#E00200"><p>I will find it challenging to complete my presentation within three minutes, but I will try to address the main points.</p> <p>  The appropriate measurement of fuel poverty is not a settled question in the literature.  Generally there are three distinct definitions.  The first considers a household to be experiencing fuel poverty if it spends more than a certain percentage, typically 10%, of its income net of housing costs on fuel.  The second measurement considers modelled rather than actual spend.  In other words, it looks at the expenditure on fuel that would be required for a certain level of warmth, taking into account household and dwelling characteristics.  The third metric relies on self-reported subjective data and categorises a household as experiencing fuel poverty if it has difficulty in affording adequate heating or fuel.  These definitions relate to thermal energy expenditure only and do not consider the cost of private or public transportation.</p> <p>  Choosing an appropriate measurement of fuel poverty from the three definitions to which I have referred is not straightforward for reasons that are, perhaps, best explained by means of a simple example.  The figures used in the example are illustrative, rather than indicative of something that may happen.  The Murphy household is a low income household that spends slightly less than 10% of its income net of housing costs on fuel.  The Murphys live in a poorly insulated house and have a low efficiency gas boiler for central heating.  They cannot afford one of the eleven indicators of basic deprivation - I have provided a full list of the indicators for the committee as an appendix to my statement - meaning that they are not considered to be experiencing basic deprivation.  Let us assume carbon taxation is increased by a quantum such that the Murphys' energy bills will increase by &euro;200 per year if they make no changes to their behaviour.  The household includes a small baby and an elderly relative.  As such, it will not cut back on heating costs but will, rather, continue to heat the house as normal.  Instead, the Murphys cut back on social activities and put off replacing worn out furniture.  In these circumstances, they would qualify as experiencing energy poverty under the first and second definitions but not the third, although they would qualify as experiencing basic deprivation.</p> <p>  In another scenario, let us assume instead that the Murphy family consist of a couple with teenagers.  Instead of continuing to heat their house as normal, they respond to the increase in carbon taxation by switching off the heating in the mornings.  They leave the house earlier and eat breakfast at work or school.  They would not qualify as experiencing energy poverty under the first definition but would under the second and third.  They would be considered to be experiencing basic deprivation because being unable to afford adequate heating is one of the criteria for basic deprivation.</p> <p>  We will assume the Murphys take out a loan of &euro;2,000 from the credit union to invest in a new and more efficient boiler.  In order to repay the loan at a rate of &euro;21 per week, they cut back on social expenditure and put off replacing worn out furniture.  In that circumstance, they would not qualify as experiencing fuel poverty under the first, second or third definitions but would qualify as experiencing basic deprivation.  The point I am trying to make is that whether one is considered to be fuel poor depends on the definition chosen and the household's behaviour, but, no matter what definition is chosen, the household in these scenarios qualifies as being deprived.</p> <p>  I will skip over most of the research I was going to mention, but I draw attention to a paper by Dorothy Watson and Bertrand Ma&igrave;tre of the ESRI which considered these indicators of basic deprivation and data from Irish households and found that energy poverty was not a distinct type of deprivation, meaning that if a household is experiencing energy poverty, it is also experiencing poverty.  Energy poverty is difficult to measure and the final determination of its extent and degree is highly sensitive to the definition chosen.  The research is clear that if one combines carbon taxation with appropriate revenue recycling mechanisms, the entire initiative can become progressive and the poorest households are the greatest beneficiaries.  We recommend that the committee try to target poverty, rather than energy poverty, as it is an appropriate metric and would ensure all households that might be affected by increases in carbon taxation would be covered.  Recycling these revenues through the taxation and welfare system would, therefore, be an obvious way of protecting low income households.</p></speech>

As the largest charity of social concern in Ireland, working to address energy poverty is a core aspect of our work, the solutions to which are closely related to tackling climate change.  Our work across communities demonstrates that energy poverty remains a major issue for a large number of households.  According to a survey of income and living conditions in 2017, almost 400,000 people went without heating owing to cost.  Last year SVP spent more than &euro;4 million in helping people with fuel and utility bills.  Approximately 70% of this expenditure was on solid fuel and oil.</p> <p>  The combination of increased energy prices, poor quality housing and the persistence of low income impacts significantly on the households SVP assists.  Low income households in rural areas, those living in social housing or the private rental sector and one-parent families are particularly exposed to the risk of energy poverty.  We are concerned about the impact of carbon tax increases on these households.</p> <p>  As outlined by Dr. Lynch, ESRI research has shown that an increase in the carbon tax, as it is currently designed, would hit low income households harder.  Unless there is greater investment in income supports, public transport and energy efficiency schemes, low income households will have to absorb these costs and will be unable to afford to switch to climate friendly alternatives.  Energy poverty will increase as a result.</p> <p>  I wish to provide our perspective on how the schemes available to those experiencing energy poverty are working.  We are concerned that energy unaffordability persists, in spite of the availability of energy income supports and without accounting for increases in carbon taxes.  At current levels, the fuel allowance is insufficient to meet the cost of energy for people on low incomes.  An additional week of fuel allowance payments was introduced in budget 2019, bringing the payment to &euro;630 for the winter months.  However, in terms of purchasing parity, it is &euro;200 less than the rate in 2010 as a result of cuts to fuel allowance and subsequent energy price increases. Furthermore, fuel allowance is a highly means-tested payment.  If carbon taxes are increased and a decision is made to offset them through this scheme, many people experiencing energy poverty will not be compensated.</p> <p>  We note that recent ESRI research suggests recycling revenues via maximum social welfare rates and tax credits for those experiencing working poverty as the most administratively straightforward and equitable option.  However, increases in maximum social welfare rates must not be at the expense of broader policy goals of reducing poverty and improving income adequacy for low income households.</p> <p>  On energy efficiency schemes, SVP is supportive of the warmer home scheme which is available to social welfare recipients who own their own home.  The scheme may be a good option for older homeowners, but it is more likely that low income households with children live in social housing or the private rental sector.  SVP is concerned that the enhancement of grants without examining eligibility criteria or measures to support take-up across tenure type would not not be an effective mechanism for protecting households from increases in carbon tax. </p> <p>  On transport, a lack of an integrated public transport system in rural areas has a significant impact on low income households&rsquo; ability to afford a minimum essential standard of living.  The development of the rural transport scheme is welcome but sustained and increased investment is required. </p> <p>  Overall, it is clear that current schemes for addressing energy poverty are limited and that a large proportion of the population continues to experience energy poverty, which is why Ireland needs an ambitious target to eliminate energy poverty by 2030.  SVP would support the establishment of a just transition fund in meeting this goal.</p><p>This would ensure coherence across goal 1 relating - no poverty - and goal 13 - climate action - of the sustainable development goals.  If Ireland is to be successful in addressing climate change and energy poverty, the Government needs to see both issues as both sides of the same coin and, critically, of equal importance.  Without addressing energy poverty, it will not be possible to meet our climate obligations as energy-poor households will be unable to change their behaviour in response to measures such as increasing carbon tax.  This will lead to longer-term social, health and environmental costs in the future.  </p><p> Our budget 2020 submission proposals, which are included in appendix 1, include a range of measures that can help address energy poverty.  They include the provision of community energy advisers, increased investment in the retrofitting of social housing, measures to support the introduction of minimum efficiency standards in the private rented sector and investment in rural transport.  If energy poverty was eliminated, it would not only improve the living standards of low-income households, it would also upgrade the energy efficiency and quality of our housing stock, reduce health-related costs and, more important, help meet our climate change obligations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matthew Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019092500002#F00200"><p>The Department commissioned a modelling study in 2016 that applied what is called an objective approach to measuring energy poverty.  The research found that 28% of Irish households were in fuel poverty.  In recent months, the ESRI applied the same methodology and its analysis showed that the rate of households spending more than 10% of their income on heating now stands at 17.4%.  A separate ESRI study also noted the strong correlation between energy poverty and basic deprivation so a number of studies have been undertaken by the Department.</p> <p>  To address data challenges relating to energy poverty, the Department and the SEAI are participating in a CSO-led project to develop energy poverty indicators.  It is anticipated that this work will provide valuable outputs in informing future national policy and presenting key statistics in the public domain to further our understanding of how to alleviate energy poverty.  We are also hopeful that it will also help us to focus energy poverty supports on those most in need.  This project is ongoing and the CSO has indicated that it will begin publishing reports in late 2019 or early 2020.</p> <p>  The committee is probably aware of a number of policy responses to address energy poverty.  These include income supports, consumer protection, building regulations and efficiency schemes.  There is a strong rationale for helping low-income households to heat and light their homes adequately through dedicated energy efficiency support schemes.  While improving the energy efficiency of the home may not be sufficient to lift a household out of poverty, it can drastically and permanently reduce its energy needs in a way that income supports cannot.  The key role of energy efficiency is reflected in the climate action plan's objective of retrofitting 500,000 homes by 2030.  A high-level retrofit task force has been established and a total of &euro;3.7 billion has been provided under Project Ireland 2040 to support the achievement of this target.  </p> <p>  The warmer homes scheme is our primary grant support scheme for households in energy poverty.  The scheme provides free energy efficiency upgrades to vulnerable households making those homes warmer and more affordable to heat.  Recent years have seen a significant increase in the funding provided for the warmer homes scheme.  The allocation has increased from &euro;15 million in 2015 to stand at &euro;40 million in 2019.  In addition to increased funding, the scheme has also been expanded to include deeper measures such as external wall insulation, heating upgrades and window replacements in the worst-performing homes.  The eligibility rules underpinning the scheme have also been extended to encompass greater numbers of people.</p> <p>  The Department also funds the warmth and wellbeing scheme, which is a joint policy initiative with the Department of Health.  This pilot scheme aims to investigate the health impacts of improving the energy efficiency of a home.  Since 2016,in excess of &euro;25 million has been invested in improving homes under this scheme.  Other schemes administered by the SEAI such as the better energy communities scheme also provided higher rates of grant for lower-income households.  These schemes have resulted in more than 140,000 homes receiving free upgrades since 2000.  </p> <p>  I understand the committee has the full text of my statement.  In conclusion, energy efficiency measures are central to addressing the root causes of energy poverty as opposed to just treating the symptoms.  The Department will, therefore, continue to improve how energy poverty schemes target those most in need in line with our climate action plan commitments.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Matt McGann, who leads the economic fiscal analysis unit within the Department.  I thank the committee for its invitation to discuss the review of the public consultation on the uses of any carbon tax increase that may occur.  Members will be aware that with the budget less than a fortnight away, we are not in a position to comment in any shape or form about what the Minister may or may not do in the taxation space in the next two weeks.  He told the Committee on Budgetary Oversight last week that he was still considering his options.  He did say, however, that if changes are to be made in carbon tax, the revenue from such a change should be treated in a different way from other tax changes that have been carried out.  Separately, the Taoiseach stated earlier this week that all new revenues raised from carbon tax will be ring-fenced to fund climate action and a just transition to protect those most exposed to higher fuel and energy costs and for whom new jobs must be found.</p> <p> In its report entitled, Climate Change: A Cross Party Consensus for Action, this committee recommended that the Department of Finance conduct a public consultation examining the options for use of revenue raised from increases in carbon tax.  In line with this recommendation, the Department launched a public consultation asking respondents to select from a list of options.  A report of the responses received is set out in the paper, Climate Action and Tax, presented to the tax strategy group in July.  The consultation was conducted between 30 May and 28 June 2019.  A total of 66 submissions were received broken down along the following lines: 19 from private individuals, 28 from businesses or business representative organisations; 13 from social, voluntary and community, SVC, bodies and six from other bodies, including political or public administration bodies, academics or academic organisations, including some members of this committee.  The predominant view from the public consultation is that the additional carbon tax revenues should be ring-fenced for the purposes of enhancing the current SEAI grant scheme for household energy efficiency improvements and to fund sustainable transport infrastructure.  The majority of respondents favoured these two options while most respondents were against the use of revenue for general Government expenditure or to pay EU fines arising from failure to meet targets.</p> <p>  Increasing the national fuel allowance to support those at risk of fuel poverty received a mixed response among all respondents.  The option of returning the proceeds by way of dividend to citizens or households through the social welfare and-or tax system received a negative response overall, being one of the least supported and most opposed options.  The option to use additional carbon tax revenues for broad climate action purposes, for example, through the climate action fund or similar, received a slightly negative response overall with most respondents stating their preference for transparent and visible use of revenue arising for measures related to climate change.  The option to incentivise businesses to switch to more sustainable production measures garnered support among industry respondents and limited support from other respondents.  The results were published in the climate action paper presented to the tax strategy group in July this year.</p></speech>

I will start with both Departments.  It is disappointing from this committee's perspective.  We worked well over a number of months to broadly agree a cross-party approach regarding how Ireland will tackle climate change.  Regarding the price on carbon, there was a majority consensus with regard to setting that at &euro;80 per tonne by 2030.  We requested that a draft policy paper on the outcomes of the public consultation from the Department of Finance and a poverty review be submitted to the committee by the end of July to enable us to make recommendations.  It seems that the Departments of Finance and Communications, Climate Action and Environment have given a disjointed representation today.  Mr. Kenny spoke about the public consultation regarding how the carbon tax will be used while Mr. Collins spoke about energy efficiency.  While this is all very positive, this is a whole-of-Government action plan and I would like to know what the collaboration between the two Departments comprises and when we can expect this policy document.  Who would like to respond?  Will we get this policy document regarding a poverty review?  I very much welcome the input of the ESRI so we have had information but it seems to be disjointed.  As this is an whole-of-Government action plan, we need a more co-ordinated response from all the different Departments.  Can Mr. Collins explain how his Department is working with the Department of Finance?</p></speech>

The priority for us was to improve the data to inform policy development.</p><p>The Department carried out a study through the ESRI and a number of subsequent studies have been carried out.  We have worked with the CSO which, as the national statistics office, is best placed to develop the right types of metrics and analysis.  It has undertaken to take a much more accelerated approach to making those data available.  While we have undertaken studies in the past, which have produced results, and studies have been conducted separately by other bodies, the key for us was to go to the national agency with responsibility for statistics to work with it together with the SEAI to provide the best metrics to inform that policy development.</p><p> The challenge is that it is a difficult and complex area.  Based on the wide-ranging policies that are already in place and the socio-economic factors that have been referenced by the ESRI today, one can see how complex the area is.  If we are to make an intervention in this area, it is important to have the best data available.  That is why we are focusing as an initial step on working with the CSO to develop those metrics.</p></speech>

We have a budget coming up.  We are all expecting an increase in carbon taxes.  We are looking at protecting those who are most vulnerable, the fuel poor and those in energy poverty.  We were expecting an analysis.  What collaboration is taking place between the Department of Finance and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on protecting the most vulnerable as we increase carbon taxes as agreed by the majority of this committee?</p></speech>

We deal with the tax aspects of it.  We complied with the committee's request to hold the public consultation.  The normal approach for us with anything that feeds into the budget process is through the tax strategy group and that is why that approach was taken.  There is probably a wider collaboration through both Departments' involvement and the use of what our colleagues in the ESRI are producing.</p> <p>  Last year, there may have been an expectation that the Minister would do something on carbon tax in the budget.  Afterwards he said he did not feel he had enough information and analysis.  In that regard we went back to talk to the ESRI about further studies which are ongoing.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is in a similar position in working with the ESRI.  All of that feeds into the final decisions that are taken by Government. </p></speech>

A portion of the work the ESRI is doing is jointly funded by both Departments.  Dr. de Bruin's I3E model is primarily funded by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, but we also partly fund a subset of that modelling work under our joint research programme with the ESRI.  Both Departments sit on the steering group for that model.</p></speech>

As a first step, the intention would be for the data to be finalised and published towards the end of the year or at the start of next year.  That will provide us with more information at that stage.  We would then undertake a review of our strategy to assess what the impacts have been.  Using the results of that, the data that have been provided by the CSO and ongoing data coming from the CSO, we will develop a new strategy later in the year.</p></speech>

My questions are similar to those the Chairman asked.  When was the decision made not to follow the committee's recommendations?  It is clear the Department has decided not to do what was requested of it, which was to conduct a poverty review.  When was that discussed?  Who decided that a fuel poverty review would not occur?  Who decided it would be separated out or outsourced to another body?</p></speech>

We have already undertaken work in this area.  Rather than just us carrying on and doing the same work again, the added value is through bringing the real expertise.  There are leading academics in the research institutes and the CSO.  Drawing on their expertise will provide much more valuable data that can inform that policy development.  As I said, we carried out a study in 2016.  The same methodology was applied again and separate research was done by ESRI.  The question was whether the Department should carry out its own study while the separate work was going on in the CSO.  It did not seem to be the best use of resources that we would in some way divorce ourselves from what the expertise in the CSO was doing.  The ESRI has an extensive ongoing programme.  The funding comes from both Departments and there is oversight from both Departments.  It really was an attempt to establish the best way of getting the most value for money and the most useful indicators to inform the policy.  It is working towards developing that analysis.</p></speech>

On what we are discussing today and the carbon tax issue, there was a request that both Departments develop a draft policy paper on the issue of fuel poverty and the effect of a carbon tax to allow this committee to develop a broader consensus.  From what officials from both Departments have said, there seems to have been a siloed approach.  Mr. Kenny mentioned his role as analysing direct taxation.  Mr. Collins mentioned the CSO and external experts, but there is a serious deficit over who is taking ownership of this within the departmental structure.  If at the first port of call we are seeing a failure on that front, how do the witnesses expect the public to accept a consensus around what might be announced on budget day when the work that is being requested of the Departments has not been prepared?</p></speech>

That will mitigate any impact of the carbon tax on people living in fuel poverty.  It would be very much us advocating for particular interventions to be made using the carbon tax revenue.  It is very difficult to measure the impact of the carbon tax without taking in to account the ameliorating measures that would be brought in, as the Taoiseach has mentioned in recent days, of how the revenue will be hypothecated and how it will be used to protect people from the potential negative impacts of an increase in carbon tax.  As Mr. Kenny has said, the focus of the Department of Finance is on generating the revenue, but we have had discussions with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance on how that money can best be spent.</p></speech>

It also calculated the increase in fuel poverty under a &euro;10 carbon tax increase, not including any recycling options or behavioural change.  For example, under the subjective self-reported measure, 8.7% of households are in fuel poverty and, under the 10% of expenditure figure, it is 17.4%, which is huge difference.  The 17.4% moves to 18.1% under a carbon tax increase.  For a retired single person, it is 5.6% under the subjective measure and 41.4% under the expenditure measure, with the latter figure moving to 42.8% following an increase.  There can be a massive difference depending on the definition chosen.  I will give the clerk a copy of the paper for circulation to members.</p></speech>

Surely, there will be an outcome from that work.  Academics review lots of things all the time.  When will the detailed work recommended by this committee be completed by the Department?  Mr. Collins's response concerns me and causes me to ask whether the Department has even commenced the review.  If it has, is there a generic tracking of the process?  It is important we clarify this issue.  If the committee's recommendations around key issues are collapsing on day one, in terms of the consensus we are supposed to be formulating on this issue, that does not fit with the high-level principled rhetoric elsewhere around this issue.  It is important that we see outcomes.</p></speech>

There is a commitment that this would be done by the end of the year.  This is about having a practical impact on delivering change for people living in energy poverty and making sure resources are going to those in need.  There has been significant increases in funding in recent years and that is continued this year.  We want to make sure that that money is being used to best effect, that we are getting value for money and targeting those in need.</p> <p>  The national energy and climate plan, NECP, report will be concluded by the end of this year and will go to the European Union.  It will also include energy poverty indicators and the measures we will be taking to help tackle energy poverty in the years ahead.  Tangible work is ongoing.  As mentioned by Mr. Collins in his opening address, one of the issues that will be examined by the retrofitting task force chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, is how we can bring people in energy poverty along in that 500,000 houses target that we must hit as part of the climate action plan target.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019092500002#H00800"><p>Reference was made to the three definitions on energy poverty and how they are measured.  In the case of fuel poverty within the home, people are assisted with the fuel allowance payment.  In terms of the definitions, I would imagine the net is cast wider than people in receipt of social welfare benefits and would include people on low incomes because they will also be hit by a carbon tax, which they cannot afford.  In the discussions between the two Departments, is consideration being given to this cohort of people, who already are under serious pressure and will not be able to afford to upgrade their heating system and so on?  These people are very much tied to the use of fossil fuel, be it coal or oil.  Those who did manage to get an SEAI grant in recent years did so for the purpose of upgrading their oil boilers.  I am concerned about this cohort of people.  In terms of our discussions on energy poverty and helping people, we should be talking about both social welfare recipients and lower-income earners.  All of these people are already under pressure and they need to be looked after.  They are afraid of what will happen in the upcoming budget in the context of a carbon tax.</p> <p>  There is a lot of talk about a just transition and the sectors that will be affected.  There is a general acceptance that people living in rural Ireland do not have the option of public transport.  While Rural Link is welcome, children cannot avail of it to get to school and it only facilitates people getting into town.  There is also a lack of broadband provision in many rural areas.  The ambition is towards electric vehicles but I do not envisage these people being able to get their hands on such vehicles for some time.  There is a lot of discourse about the pre-2008 cars in respect of which people are already paying high levels of motor tax and which will now be hit with a further addition of carbon tax.  What conversation is going on about helping this cohort of people?  </p> <p>  My next question is for the ESRI.  The objective is no sale of new diesel or petrol cars from 2030 onwards.  At what rate do we need to be introducing electric vehicles into the market to meet that target?  As I understand it, even with a grant, the cost of an electric vehicle could be approximately &euro;40,000.  Many people in rural Ireland own cars that are valued at between &euro;3,000 and &euro;5,000 and they cannot afford to upgrade.  If we are to support a just transition, it will be ongoing for years.  We need to address the issue of the impact a carbon tax will have on those people because they will not have the choice of travelling by DART and so on.  How are these people being accommodated and how might that be reflected in the budget?   </p> <p>  Returning to the issue of fuel poverty in people's homes, I understand there is a one year waiting list for the warmer homes schemes.  If the carbon tax funding is to be ring-fenced, will there be additional funding for the warmer homes scheme or will people have to continue to wait for a long time for funding to improve the energy efficiency of their homes and thus reduce their bills?  Is it proposed to increase the budget allocation for this scheme?</p> <p>  Mr. Kenny mentioned the public consultation.  This committee is keenly aware that the measures, many of which are reflected in the Government action plan, require that the public be brought along on the journey with us.  I am concerned about the lack of public consultation across the board.  Consultation can yield information on what is bearable for people.  The objective is to reduce carbon emissions.  In my opinion, most people have not been engaged with.  I am not taking from the public consultation undertaken by the Department of Finance.  My understanding was that there would be roadshows.  There are a lot of people calling for action but there will be a huge cost in that regard.  It is about making decisions and I do not think people are engaged on that level.  In countries that have taken these steps, be that France, Canada and so on, there has been a big backlash and they are not implementable.</p></speech>

We are concerned about them.  There are a number of schemes that are tiered.  For example, the warmer homes scheme is open to people on particular social protection schemes, including the working family payment.</p><p>That is a payment that would be for families that might not be earning as much as other families, as well as jobseeker's and other payments.  It is not just for people who are on those other payments.</p><p> The better energy homes scheme is another scheme.  It does not provide as high a percentage in terms of support, but it is a support that is available to families that might be able to contribute in some way to their income.  As I said in response to Deputy Jack Chambers, one of the climate action plan targets is to ensure that we are targeting the right people.  Any decision to increase the eligibility threshold by increasing the amount of income that somebody could earn could have the result that the worst off in society might have to wait longer.  In any kind of budget constrained scheme we are trying to target those most in need.  By stretching it to people on higher incomes, that would mean there is less to spend on those on the lowest incomes.</p><p> Senator Mulherin referred to the waiting list for the warmer homes scheme.  She is correct that the waiting list is increasing.  The reason is that the measures available under the scheme have been expanded and made deeper.  Every person who is availing of the scheme now is getting deeper interventions that cost more money and also take longer to do.  We also expanded the range of people eligible to apply for the scheme.  We made the scheme more attractive and we opened it to more people.  The impact of that is that demand has increased.  There has been a significant increase in the budget.  This year the warmer homes scheme has gone up to almost &euro;40 million.  It is about continuing to look at the way the scheme operates to see if we can tweak it and improve it in terms of who it is targeting and at the same time seek additional resources for it so we can tackle the waiting list.</p></speech>

It is something the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment would support.</p> <p>  Senator Mulherin also referred to public consultation in terms of selling the climate agenda.  That is something the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has been quite strong on.  He has been all around the country.  I do not know how many roadshows he has done at this stage but he has personally attended at least five or six.  He has been getting out and about and trying to sell the message.</p> <p>  There is a whole section in the climate plan on just transition and a range of actions is outlined in that regard.  The issue has not been overlooked.  Again, it is something the Minister feels quite strongly about.  He wants to ensure that cohorts in society that could be negatively impacted are protected to the greatest extent possible.  The Taoiseach's recent comments have been very supportive in that regard.</p></speech>

A large proportion of people, in particular the working poor and households with children, will not benefit if carbon tax is recycled through this scheme.  Approximately 40% of the poorest children, those in receipt of a qualified child increase, are living in households that do not get the fuel allowance.  If carbon tax is offset through that scheme a whole range of people who are experiencing energy poverty would be missed.</p> <p>  As I outlined in the opening statement, the warmer homes scheme is a good one for people who are on a low income and who own their own home but we know that energy efficiency is especially poor in the private rented sector and in social housing.  The commitments in the climate action plan on deep retrofits of social housing is welcome, but there is a significant challenge in terms of the private rented sector.  We would like to see an action plan in terms of introducing minimum energy efficiency standards in the private rented sector so that those households are able to access grants, whether that is through incentivising landlords in an awareness campaign or finding some way of linking it to security of tenure as well.  For example, landlords who agreed to let their property to HAP tenants for a five-year term could access grants to compensate.</p> <p>  We have a lot of information on energy poverty.  We have the subjective measures in the EU survey on income and living conditions, EU-SILC, that is collected annually.  I understood the household budget survey will now move to an annual collection as well, so we will be able to track energy poverty in terms of that expenditure method.  One of the recommendations we made to the national climate and energy plan is that a baseline energy poverty measure would be set for this year.  The current strategy to combat energy poverty ends in 2019 and we do not know what will succeed it.  It is important to say that as well.  What we suggested for the national climate and energy plan is that a baseline would be set using both the household expenditure method and a subjective method and one would set a target to eliminate energy poverty by 2030, so it would work alongside our climate action targets as well.  That is something we have been advocating.</p></speech>

A mixture of regulatory steps, taxation and subsidy policies are being implemented there.  Over time, the expectations from the global analysis is that the cost of purchasing and operating electric vehicles, EVs, will come down to the same level as an internal combustion engine.  They are cheaper to operate at present but the challenge is the buying costs at the moment.  The reason we already have subsidies in place is to help reduce the differential pricing between an electric vehicle and one with an internal combustion engine.  We intend to continue to work on that.</p></speech>

Another example from a regulatory point of view is the role of biofuels.  That will be in the vehicles that people are using at the moment, again, to improve the carbon intensity of the transportation.  There is a range of options rather than one single option in terms of addressing that factor.</p> <p>  Senator Mulherin is concerned about EVs being the solution and the impact that will have on families but, again, we are supporting the roll out of a network of EV charging points.  That is to provide reassurance to people in rural communities as well that there will be sufficient charging points and mobility will be maintained in rural areas.  We are taking a suite of actions to address the climate issues, but we are also very conscious that there are interim steps that can be taken that do not have as much impact on lower income, rural families as well.</p></speech>

I do not see much evidence of joined-up thinking from the two Departments.  Mr. Kenny from the Department of Finance said it is focused on raising revenue in indirect taxes.  I do not see any joined-up thinking in terms of the Department looking at increasing carbon taxes from the perspective of reducing people's carbon footprint and changing people's behaviour.  Our focus is on exactly that; it is not on raising revenue.  There are lots of different ways in which we can raise revenue, but my understanding of the purpose of the carbon tax is that we change people's behaviour.  I am not convinced that is what the Departments are looking at.</p><p>My question for Mr. Collins is whether the Department of Finance has conducted a study of whether carbon taxes are progressive or regressive from its perspective.</p></speech>

It has also recommended a trajectory out to &euro;80 per tonne.  The climate action plan has a similar trajectory in place.  The Department of Finance deals with taxes on their merits and sees what can be done.  Our tax strategy group papers outline options and policies around a range of taxes, including carbon taxes.  That is what the Department does.</p></speech>

My focus is on reducing the carbon footprint and changing people's behaviour, which should be done by providing alternatives.  I will cite examples of two people, one of whom is an older individual deemed to be living in fuel poverty.  If the carbon tax is increased, what analysis has either Department conducted regarding the options available to that older person for changing his or her behaviour?  What advice would Mr. Kenny give?  How could that person change his or her behaviour if the Minister increased the carbon tax?  The older person's home is heated by oil or gas.  What can that person do to offset the cost of the carbon tax increase or change his or her behaviour?</p></speech>

The Minister and the Taoiseach have stated that any additional revenue raised from the carbon tax will be treated differently than revenues raised in the normal course of events.  In other words, it will not go to the Exchequer for general expenditure measures.  If there is an increase in carbon tax, the Minister and the Taoiseach are saying that revenues will be available to encourage people or mitigate against the increase in carbon tax for people who are in fuel poverty or, as Senator Mulherin mentioned, have transport deficits.  That is my understanding of what this committee has recommended, in that there would be a trajectory in place so that people could know that this was coming and that we needed to change behaviour, but that there would also be a mechanism within that trajectory that would raise revenues to do just that.</p></speech>

While what he has said may well be the case, no one knows how much the Minister will increase the carbon tax by or how much revenue it will raise.  We can already do the type of thing that Mr. Kenny mentioned through general taxation if a Government wants to do it.  Mr. Kenny stating that if we raise enough money through the carbon tax, we can put in place mitigating measures at some point in the future and people may have alternatives then.  At this point, though, they do not.</p> <p>  Perhaps the other Department can address my second example.  I live in a rural village.  There is no bus running through it.  How can someone living in rural Ireland offset the cost of the increase in petrol or diesel or change his or her behaviour?</p></speech>

It is the case that energy is the least responsive to a change in price, but there is still a bit of a response.  We cannot get into the nitty-gritty of what they actually do, but Dr. de Bruin's team has examined the economy-wide impact.</p></speech>

Even if we increased the carbon tax to &euro;80 per tonne, that would correspond to a 10% increase in energy prices.  It is not that energy prices will suddenly double on budget day.  Small, incremental increases can initiate changes in behaviour that can be later supported by other schemes.  It is important to consider that prices will not suddenly double tomorrow.</p></speech>

It is unhelpful that the entire debate is framed through carbon taxes.  The best thing we could do would be to provide alternatives for people and allow them to make the transition, but there are no alternatives.  I put that point to Dr. Keilthy.  If the carbon tax increases, someone in fuel poverty might well change behaviour, but that might only be because he or she cannot afford to heat the home.</p></speech>

Approximately &euro;435 million of that amount came directly from carbon taxes.  In the ten years that we have had carbon taxes, our emissions have not decreased.  Is the Department of Finance still of the belief that our carbon emissions will reduce if we jack the tax up by a further &euro;20 or &euro;40 per tonne or to a total of &euro;80 per tonne?

The real question is counterfactual, that is, how much higher would carbon emissions have been had we not had the carbon tax in place.</p></speech>

Some of those households are paying up to 60% of their incomes in rent and household costs, which we know from research that was helpfully provided by some of the other witnesses and the bodies that they represent and that are doing useful work.  Will the landlords who own the 497,101 homes transition them into super A-rated or B-rated properties in the next year, two years or three years?  We know that the houses in question have the lowest energy ratings.  That is certainly the case in my constituency.  I have been in rented flats and houses that are iceboxes between October and April.  Does the Department believe that there will be a transition within two or three years?  How will it be done?</p></speech>

An advisory group was established in 2018 to consider the best ways of improving efficiency in the rented sector.</p><p>The objective of the group is to identify the appropriate policy interventions while keeping in mind any potential adverse impact on the supply of rented accommodation, because that is the absolute last thing we would want in the constrained housing environment that exists.  The group will be publishing a public consultation paper in the coming months - definitely before the end of the year and probably in the next month or two.  The intention is that this would feed into the discussions around how we can tackle the efficiency of rented properties without diminishing the supply of rental accommodation.</p></speech>

Many of the occupants of private rented accommodation are the lowest paid workers, as well as people on social welfare who are not entitled to fuel allowance.  While it has been mentioned people might be given tax credits, many of the people I know are not even earning enough to get tax credits because they are on the minimum wage.  What will happen to that cohort while the consultation and everything else is happening?  We are trying to point out today that there are real situations where people will be caught in poverty traps, in particular fuel poverty traps.  I also want to highlight the position of farmers whose income is &euro;10,000 to &euro;12,000 a year.  There has been a cessation of turf cutting and, in many areas, turf cutting is not and was never available.  Those people are going to be caught.  We hear about reviews, studies and everything else but, out in the real world, among those 497,101 households, a huge cohort are facing freezing cold winters.  They have gone through such winters before but, in the future, if these carbon taxes are loaded on, many of them will suffer from hypothermia.</p></speech>

I want to go back to what Deputy Chambers said earlier about priority recommendation No. 3 from chapter 6, on which we worked long and hard hours to get agreement.  The recommendation was that the Government would conduct a fuel poverty review.  Will the witnesses please answer "Yes" or "No" as to whether the Departments have ignored that?  Instead of obfuscating, as they did in response to the two or three parliamentary questions which I put down over the summer, please give the public a "Yes" or "No" answer on whether they had no intention of conducting a poverty review.</p> <p>  I then want to ask the witnesses about priority recommendation No. 4 from the same chapter.  The recommendation was that the Department of Finance would commission an inquiry into the revenue that could be realised through the introduction of a carbon tax on the profits of corporations and firms directly linked to the production and sale of gas, oil, coal and other related fossil fuels.  Has the Department any intention of conducting that inquiry to try to establish how it could ring-fence profits on industry for dealing with climate change?</p> <p>  Will the ESRI repeat the figures it gave us as to how energy poverty is measured when one moves from one band to another?  I am fascinated by the figure which suggests that, depending on the criteria used, energy poverty among retired single people moves from a low percentage right up to 42.8%.  That has been my experience as a Deputy.  My clinic is packed every day with pensioners trying to access the grants I am told are available, such as the warmer homes scheme, retrofitting and all the rest, but it is not there for many pensioners who may be in receipt of a tiny occupation-related pension.  It is not there for pensioners who are in receipt of fuel allowance but do not suffer from COPD or a lung-related disease.  They may be crippled with arthritis, they may be going blind and be freezing cold all the time, but they are not getting any help and they are told not to even bother applying when it comes to schemes that are supposed to help them.  They are worried about the increase in carbon tax and it incentivises them to say, "I would love to get new windows and solar panels, and get the house retrofitted", but they cannot access it.  They do not have the &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 upfront to say, "There is my contribution to doing up my home, now give it back to me."  It does not work like that.  There is a cohort of middle Ireland caught in the middle.  It includes, critically, the Traveller population, and the Traveller MABS carried out serious research into this.  It also includes lone parents, pensioners and working people who are on low pay, which is most working people in this country.</p> <p>  We are witnessing a farcical exercise where we are told by Mr. Gerry Kenny that his job is to raise revenue through indirect taxation.  We then hear from the others that there are no real facilities to help people who are going to be impacted by this carbon tax.  I would remind the committee members that the vast majority of this committee recommended a carbon tax.</p> <p>  I have a question for the Department of Finance.  We do not know by how much the Minister will put up the carbon tax.  Let us say he put it up by &euro;5 per tonne.  Am I right that this would raise about &euro;108 million?  If he put it up by &euro;10 per tonne, would that raise &euro;216 million?  How far does the Department seriously think that will go to help the most vulnerable people change their behaviour, improve their lives and get them out of fuel poverty?  Will the Department please undertake that exercise which priority recommendation No. 4 asked it to do, and look at how we can tax the profits of the fossil fuel and related industries, and ring-fence that tax so they do not pass it on to the poor again, and instead use it to undo the damage they have done to the climate and to the planet?</p></speech>

In regard to the query on the recommendation by the committee on reviewing the extent and nature of fuel poverty, and also the most appropriate measure, at the outset I gave a very brief summary in the opening statement which explains that a review of fuel poverty was undertaken by the Department in 2016.  More recently, a similar study was carried out to again give an estimate of fuel poverty, so two studies have taken place already, with the ESRI's being the most recent.</p> <p>  In terms of the issue of identifying the most appropriate measure, I also outlined in my opening statement that, along with the SEAI, we are working with the CSO - the State's national statistics agency - which is best placed to inform us, in order to use its expertise in terms of identifying the most appropriate measure to be used in regard to fuel poverty, which will further inform policy development and the development of schemes. </p></speech>

It is problematic.  I have asked the Department these questions in writing and I have got nothing back but obfuscation.  Is the Department going to conduct a review of fuel poverty in this country or not?  It has not done it and we know that.  Is it going to?</p></speech>

It used a similar methodology to that which was used in the 2016 study so it used the current measure of fuel poverty, and that was published in the ESRI report of June.</p></speech>

It is utterly frustrating.  I have heard from the ESRI, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, National Traveller MABS and Age Action Ireland.  I have seen their material.  What the Department was asked to do was to use all their empirical evidence and material and present us with a report.  It has failed to do that and within days, the Minister will increase carbon tax in the absence of the Department doing that piece of work.  I am not asking Mr. Collins to repeat the good work these women have done in identifying where fuel poverty lies, how it is measured and possibly the extent of it, although that is not an absolute.  He was asked to give us a report and he has refused to do so.</p> <p>  Will he please answer on what he intends to do with priority recommendation No. 4, which is to give us a measure of what potentially could be raised by a tax on the profits of the fossil fuel and related industries?</p></speech>

My apologies.  The short answer is that I do not know what, if anything, is being done on that recommendation.  I suggest that such companies are subject to corporation tax on their profits in the normal course of events and are subject to every other tax applied across the board.</p></speech>

The figures she has are broadly in line with what we would expect to raise in terms of an increase of &euro;5 and &euro;10 a tonne.</p> <p>  On the mitigating factors, our tax strategy group paper will set out what the mitigants could be but as I said here earlier, those are matters for the decision of the Minister and the Government in the context of the budget as to how, if he does decide to increase carbon tax, what he will do with the revenues afterwards.</p></speech>

If, say, one is spending a huge amount of one's income, net of housing costs, heating one&rsquo;s swimming pool and sauna, technically, one would qualify under definition A as fuel poor but one will not answer that one has difficulty meeting one&rsquo;s fuel bills, which is the reason one does not qualify under the subjective measure.</p> <p>  On the particular differential for retired single people, we do not know the reason 35.8% of them are spending more than 10% of their income on energy and yet are not reporting that they have difficulty meeting their bills.  Presumably, it is because their income is such that they can meet their living costs within the remaining 90% in such a way that they do not feel they cannot afford their energy bills.  The cohort the Deputy is particularly concerned about almost certainly fall into the 5.6% who are reporting that they have difficulty meeting their bills, and they also cannot access these grants.</p> <p>  I reiterate the point that measuring and targeting fuel poverty is very difficult but measuring and targeting poverty is possibly a more salient policy measure that might be one the committee would like to consider.</p></speech>

Approximately &euro;450 million is collected yearly in carbon tax and were the rate to increase by the small amount being bruited about, I believe it would bring that figure to approximately &euro;600 million; I am not good at mathematics.  Is &euro;600 million the total cost of Ireland's fines for not meeting our targets next year?  Where will that money come from?  Will we have to rob it from some other area?  I would like an answer to that question.</p> <p>  The current housing emergency is punitive.  People in Dublin, and everywhere else, are paying over the odds for their rents or mortgages.  The cost of heating, electricity and so on has increased and putting an extra tax on people and asking them to give more when most of them earn average wages is punitive and not sustainable.  The people we represent are on an average wage of &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,500 per month, which is eaten up quickly, so to speak, by increased costs.</p> <p>  My next question is for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Department of Finance.  People who become unemployed are not eligible for the fuel allowance until they have been in receipt of benefit for 390 days.  Consequently, they might have to endure two long winters before becoming eligible.  Were one to become unemployed, say, next month, two long winters would pass before one became eligible for the fuel allowance.  That is an anomaly and it is discriminatory.  Does the Society of St. Vincent de Paul representative have any experience of dealing with that?  I certainly have such experience.</p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Collins.  Since 2016, more than &euro;25 million has been spent on the warmth and well-being scheme, which was very welcome in my area of Dublin 8, 10, 12 and the Tallaght area.  However, &euro;25 million over almost four years comes in at more than &euro;6 million per year, which seems a paltry amount.  What is the average cost per house and how many homes have benefited from the warmth and well-being scheme?  We heard today about concerns for public health as a result of pollutants in the air from which there have been premature deaths worldwide.  In Ireland, there were 1,200 premature deaths in 2016.  The scheme is underfunded.  Are there plans to increase the funding?  How many houses came under the scheme if it has cost an average of &euro;6 million per year in the past four years?</p></speech>

Many people who are working are struggling to meet their energy costs.  There needs to be a broader base in terms of that cohort of people.</p></speech>

We held a very interesting workshop in the audiovisual room here during the summer.  We brought in Kathryn Harrison, a leading academic from Canada, to share Canada's experience; Cara Augustenborg, from UCD's school of environmental studies; Graham Caswell of Carbon Tide; and Barra Roantree of the ESRI.  The analysis from that workshop showed that the carbon dividend model works and changes behaviour, although not as much as we might want.  The change is marginal but not insignificant.  It was shown to be the best way to address income inequality.  It seems their analysis was clear on that.  It would be done through a direct social welfare payment and a direct tax credit payment into the person's bank account.  It would not be a cheque in the post, much as we like to get cheques in the post, but a direct payment.  The Department of Finance told us that this was administratively doable and would be very cheap.  All the data sets the Department has would make it viable at very low cost and pretty much straightaway.  I am therefore very keen to see it as an option.</p><p>I was very pleased to read Ms Lynch's presentation and to hear her say of the ESRI analysis:</p><blockquote>We examined the impact on total income inequality, and found that combining carbon taxation with revenue recycling actually reduces income inequality, relative to a business as usual scenario.  This is in addition to the reduction in carbon emissions that comes about as a result of the tax increase.</blockquote> <p>Did the ESRI make a submission to the consultation process the Department of Finance held in the summer on this issue?</p></speech>

Professor John Fitzgerald said this is a political question.  The allocation of resources is ultimately our job, and it is very difficult for Department officials in a sense.  I wish we had the Minister for Finance here because this is politics at its core, but we have the Society of St. Vincent de Paul represented, and I was very reassured when I read Dr. Keilthy's submission on carbon taxes.  It states:</p><blockquote>It is SVP's view that increasing the fuel allowance alone will be insufficient to compensate for increases in the carbon tax and other mechanisms to protect low income households from carbon pricing should be examined and included.  This may include recycling the revenues via the tax and the benefit system as proposed by the ESRI, which is found to be the most equitable option and administratively straight forward.</blockquote> <p>Am I reading from this that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul also sees that this tax and dividend model, as Dr. Keilthy said consistently throughout her presentation, helps address the core issue of poverty and income inequality?</p></speech>

What is important for us is that while some people may not be worse off after that recycling process - they might be slightly better off - there will still be people whom Society of St. Vincent de Paul members will visit who have heat escaping through their windows and ceiling, whose children are having respiratory problems, who cannot afford to fill their oil tanks and who are reliant on solid fuel.  What we are saying, therefore, is that we need to start seeing measures to tackle energy poverty as part of the solution to climate change.  At the moment we are seeing this as just a barrier to climate action but it needs to be seen as part of the solution.  We have to see some of the measures we have proposed as part of that climate action movement as well.  That is really important.</p></speech>

There is such a job ahead of us and its scale is beyond compare.  The revenues from the carbon tax will not do it all.  We will have to use a large amount of other money targeting exactly what Dr. Keilthy said.  She seems to be saying we could raise the fuel allowance as a mechanism of using the revenues from a carbon tax and as one tool to tackle fuel poverty and poverty in general.  If the Society of St. Vincent de Paul had a choice between that and the tax and dividend model, whereby the revenue would be returned in the form of an increased social welfare payment and an increased tax credit, the latter would be preferable, from SVP's perspective.</p></speech>

To be clear, the fuel allowance has to increase because it has not taken account of recent energy price hikes due to wholesale costs increasing.  We also see the impact of the public service obligation, PSO, levy.  That is probably a discussion for another day.  Regarding compensating for any increase in the carbon tax, we would say it is a case of "only if".  We would ideally like to see measures implemented prior to that.  If it is increased, however, the fuel allowance is not the most appropriate mechanism to do that.</p></speech>

I think our plan was to publish them on the Department website, but we just have not had the chance to do that redaction.

It was not our intention to kill any option.  We tried to put as many options on the table as possible to see what kind of feedback we would get.  We were very interested in doing the consultation process because it is something we do not do an awful lot of, certainly in my place in the Department, which is to get the feedback.  We were slightly disappointed with the reaction.  We got 66 responses, which was low by any standard, but it certainly was not the intent to kill off any option.  What we tried to do was give as much background information as we could on the carbon tax generally and its impacts and so on without trying to favour, get into or do a disservice to any of the options.</p></speech>

I must say, however, that this was a "hands up who would like a grant?" type of consultation and survey, coming back and saying the worst option would be a carbon dividend, whereas no analysis or presentation of the options was done and in fact a whole range of other options were thrown in.</p><p>It is not the most scientific or qualitative research or consultation process.</p></speech>

It is of no use.  I am glad the SVP and ESRI are supportive of the broad approach.  I hope the Minister for Finance and other parties whose representatives have left the room, that have been the main advocates of an alternative approach are listening.  I would love to hear anyone else answer the argument that this dividend approach is the best income inequality and poverty reduction approach that we can take.</p></speech>

Today's discussion has reinforced my objection.  I was concerned that it would give too much licence to the Government to increase carbon taxes on vulnerable households, against a backdrop of failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Three Departments are represented here today.  Perhaps I am naive but do they talk to each other?  Is a single policy pursued by every Department or does each Department operate in its own silo, doing its own thing?  The officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and from the Department of Finance each talked about funding the ESRI to do similar reports but nobody was talking to each other.  It seems nonsensical to me.  Perhaps I am wrong and naive but it seems crazy from what I have heard in this committee so far today.  It justifies why we should not have increased the carbon tax.  We are not getting a coherent message about what will happen with it and that is very disappointing.  I have no particular question on that because there is nobody to give an answer to it.  Do the Departments all have equal responsibilities in this area?</p></speech>

The approach to carbon tax, especially in the past year or 18 months, has probably been a little different with regard to the Department of Finance's revenue-raising activities.  In the past, the Department of Finance collected the money and the Government decided how it would be spent.  There was no hypothecation and there was never any real suggestion that it should be reserved for specific activities.  One has to remember that is the starting point.  There has been significant discussion about the carbon tax and what mitigants can be put in place and the significant mitigants in place relating to the tax and fuel poverty.  The Minister and his Government colleagues constantly discuss issues such as what one does if one raises carbon tax.  That conversation goes on with regard to any tax, but it has taken place to a greater extent with regard to carbon tax.  Perhaps we are not explaining this as well as we should.  There has been a lot of work in the area in looking at what the impacts will be.  The Minister said following the budget last year that he was not in a place to raise carbon tax because he was not happy that he understood all of the impacts.  All of that work has been going on between us, the ESRI and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Perhaps we are not explaining ourselves well.</p></speech>

How long will it take?  This work was supposed to be completed and presented to the committee so that we could take a view in advance of the budget and feed into the budgetary process.  Earlier it was stated that some of the work might be finished early at the start of the new year.  That will feed into the process through the year so it could be June or July before the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is ready to formulate an opinion on that work.  We were being naive because we pre-empted this discussion by at least eight or nine months with our report.  Perhaps our report is naive and the witnesses could explain that.  Should this discussion happen 12 months from now?</p></speech>

We do not have that information here.  As Mr. Kenny said, it may have been done.  The optics today suggest that it has not been done in a co-ordinated way.  We do not have that document in front of us and that is what we had expected.  Perhaps the work is happening and we can hear statistics and facts from the ESRI, St. Vincent de Paul and the Departments.  The Deputy has expressed it well.  It is important that the witnesses understand that we are seeking a co-ordinated approach by the Departments that will help us in our cross-party work to help the Departments to implement this all-of-Government plan and to protect those who are most vulnerable and who will find that transition hardest.  We need that information to work with.</p></speech>

The format is probably slightly tricky because we come here as two or three different Departments and are usually held to account for the activities that we are undertaking, and that is how we have presented it here.  It is important to recognise that the volume of cross-departmental work during the preparation of the climate action plan was phenomenal.  It was driven at a breakneck speed, with tight deadlines from the Minister across the system.  Structures have been put in place to ensure that there is an all-of-Government oversight approach.  The nature of its implementation is that we can assign different actions in those areas.  We are focused on implementing the actions set out in the action plan.  Perhaps that is where we have been overly focused.  There are ongoing discussions at many official levels about implementation, decisions on the different options and the pre-budget process, which is an intensive period where all Departments will liaise with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform about options.  At this time of year, what we can say as officials is very limited.  No formal decisions have been made and the budgetary process is confidential until budget day.  We probably have not been able to convey the level of interaction between Departments about these issues.  I apologise for the disappointment at not being able to provide the information the committee hoped to have for its own decision-making.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Collins not see the committee as part of that process or recognise a responsibility to talk to us?  The committee does not figure in that so the Departments are working away.  I am not saying that they are not doing work or that it is not useful work.  The problem for us as a committee is that we cannot get access to anything.  Perhaps we are talking to the wrong people and we should work away independently to devise our own measures.  Do we fit into and factor into the process, or are we a source of annoyance in making the witnesses attend today?  The impression I got from departmental officials who attended previously during the process of us drawing up our report is that they did not want to know about it.  Where do we fit into the process?</p></speech>

It is always an honour to be invited to attend and present.  The Deputy is addressing a significant issue related to the Oireachtas, which has seen investment in its budgetary and financial capacity to inform the budget process.</p><p>It is probably bigger than the issue we are talking about today.  The Government has set several objectives that have to be delivered.  Our obligation is to give advice to the Minister and ensure the decisions are implemented.  We are happy to come here and account for the actions we are taking.  I can see Deputy Pringle's point about the interaction between the Oireachtas and the Government in developing policy options as well.  It is challenging and it is evolving.  The Deputy probably sees that in the new resources being brought into the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016, which relates to peat extraction, a very relevant issue, was being debated.</p> <p>  I have read all the witnesses' statements with interest.  We need to talk about the cost of carbon rather than consider a carbon tax.  Carbon has immense costs as manifest in all the impacts of climate change on many of the most vulnerable people in the world.  I have met people from Malawi and Bangladesh, and others, who are experiencing the cost of carbon.  Its impact on the climate and on vulnerable people has not been reflected in its price.  That is because the cost and the damage have been socialised.  The price is being paid in terms of people's health and lives, and by governments which deal with flooding, the displacement of numerous people and land that is no longer arable.  Those costs have not featured in the discussion on fossil fuels, as if they are solely a commodity to be traded in the market.  The price of carbon has to reflect more of the cost.  The question for us is: when we have a realistic cost how do we ensure that everyone in society is not affected by that realistic price?</p> <p>  I do not like the narrative that this is a stick to poke people into behavioural change.  It is much more serious than that and is a much bigger issue.  It is not a matter of a tax being introduced as a slap on the wrist but of a serious price.  We need to ensure that all the revenues from that are used to take serious action on climate change.  We have very few conversations but when we do a majority seem to favour a sustainable transport infrastructure or household energy improvements.  </p> <p>  I am concerned about the dividend argument and would like to hear the perspectives of St. Vincent de Paul and the ESRI on that.  As I understand it, the dividend would go only to those who have managed to reduce their household energy bill.  Reducing that bill is not necessarily easy to do in local authority housing.  The retrofitting of local authority housing has been mentioned.  A private tenant receiving rent supplement or the housing assistance payment may not be in a position to get that.  Where does that dividend go?  I agree that fuel poverty needs to be considered but a fuel allowance is not the only mechanism for that.  If the ESRI believes we should consider poverty does it mean consistent poverty or risk of poverty?  My concern is that consistent poverty may be too high a bar.  </p> <p>  I concur with Deputy Smith.  I worked in Older and Bolder and spoke to people who used to sit all day long in supermarkets because they could not heat their homes.  That is a reality for many older people.  If those older people feature in the dividend model perhaps they would benefit from a fast-tracked or accelerated investment in retrofitting every home that the State can retrofit. </p> <p>  My last question is for Mr. Kenny but I would of course welcome comments from Mr. Deegan or others.  This is a very small sum of money.  We should not regard it as revenue raising to deal with climate change.  As I said, it is a matter of carbon pricing.  Priority recommendation No. 4 in chapter 6 of this committee's report raises the question of a levy on the profits of fuel and related industries.  We need a timeline on that.  If we are going to ask the public to start switching off their lights because we want to reflect the real price of carbon we cannot allow companies to continue to absorb profits. </p></speech>

We have spoken about income and energy efficiency but prices are increasing.  Ireland has some of the highest gas and electricity prices in Europe.  One of the main reasons for that is our reliance on imported fossil fuels.  As we move to more renewable forms of energy, we might see a decrease in prices.  In the interim it would be really important to explore the option of introducing social tariffs into the Irish energy market because other European countries have price caps for people on very low incomes for any future price hikes.  St. Vincent de Paul would be particularly interested in advancing that.</p> <p>  We are fully aware that poor communities around the world are more likely to experience the negative impacts of climate change.  That 10% of the wealthiest people in the world contribute to 50% of our carbon emissions means that we really need to consider how a tax on consumers is not proportionate to tax on the fossil fuel industry, particularly those in high polluting activities - the aviation sector comes to mind for its lack of carbon pricing.  If we are really concerned about climate justice and a just transition we need to consider those particular aspects of carbon emissions and make sure they are proportionate. </p></speech>

None of them, however, was contingent on reducing energy expenditure.  Some of our work considers behavioural changes, some not, for technical reasons.  Whether behavioural responses to carbon taxation are taken into account it is possible to make everybody better off.  The revenues can be redistributed progressively.  That applies to short and long run responses.</p></speech>

The devil is in the detail but the point is that at the broad level we can make everybody better off whether or not they respond.  If they responded they would get this extra benefit in that they would be no worse off financially than if they did not reduce their carbon consumption.  If they did reduce it they would be better off again because they would be saving money on carbon and receiving money through the recycling mechanism that everyone has chosen.</p></speech>

It is about making the price of carbon reflect the cost of carbon.  At present, when people decide to consume anything they weigh up the costs of paying for it versus the benefits of consuming it.  At present, they weigh up the benefits of consuming carbon-related goods against the financial costs to them as individuals.  If the carbon price is included then people would weigh it against the financial costs to themselves and the environmental costs because instead of imposing the environmental cost on the economy and people in general it would be on the person actually buying or consuming the carbon goods.  Does that make sense?</p></speech>

Coming to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul again, those in private rental accommodation and local authority housing that is not retrofitted do not have the same level of choice with regard to the level of carbon they consume.  The compensation will go to everybody but they will not be in a situation whereby they can change the level of carbon they consume.  It will not be not directed, as was encouraged by many who replied, at retrofitting.</p></speech>

This is why the Department with responsibility for housing has a programme to retrofit local authority homes.

Dr. Lynch spoke about the problem being the difference between the cost and the price.  In economics it is what we call negative externality, whereby the costs of an individual's actions are borne by other people.  There are difficult policy trade-offs in how the funds are used.  The more the funds are used to directly recycle to households to target progressivity the less there is available to put towards emissions reduction initiatives.  I am not here to offer a view on what is right or wrong but it is a policy trade-offs.</p></speech>

It was a priority recommendation of the committee.  It is part of the cost and price issue.</p></speech>

It applies to the same argument and question.  If profit is taken in one area but the cost and externalities are being borne in another the case is very strong for an increased levy in these areas.

For example, the question of aviation fuel tax has been raised continually.  There is a question about the contribution that needs to be made to the change.  It would be unrealistic as well as unfair if we expect that the consumer and every citizen of Ireland in their payments and bills will somehow fund the large-scale transition.  Ireland is part of Europe and part of those discussions.  It is a reparational issue also, not simply for the future but in terms of the damage done in the past.</p></speech>

Conversations are starting at European level.  Until now, aviation fuel has been exempt from excise duty at EU level.  This is something that will be discussed by the incoming Commission and I suspect it will look at options in this regard.  It is outside our remit for now.</p></speech>

It is recommended that the committee will correspond with the National Disability Authority to request its observations on the petition and the responses received, and communicate with the petitioner what action has been taken.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00019/19. It is proposed that the committee forwards a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner, and then close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition for consideration is Petition No. 00021/19.  It is proposed that the committee would keep the petition open and refer it to the appropriate committee for its consideration.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition for consideration is Petition No. 00029/19.  It is proposed to keep this petition open, but in doing so we will refer it to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, with this committee's agreement.

There is merit in what the petitioner is trying to do in keeping the age profile open.  I also concur with the Chairman that it is important for the line committee to examine this issue and come back to us on it.  The upper age limit for joining the Garda and the Reserve Defence Force is 35 years.  It is more an issue of health, fitness and well-being, rather than age which should not be a barrier.  As we got rid of the height requirement for joining An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I do not see why age should be a factor either.  I hope to see the petition escalated to the relevant committee.</p></speech>

As we are trying to move towards having a paperless society, there is merit in not issuing receipts.  I understand some business people might need to keep receipts of transactions, but many shops, petrol stations and other outlets now ask customers whether they want a receipt and many people do not because it is surplus to their needs.  We should encourage the Department to look at this issue and perhaps refer the petition to the line committee in order to learn how we can support measures that will reduce both paper and litter.  I think there is merit in that suggestion.</p></speech>

During the course of our private session, the committee asked that this be raised in public session for the purpose of highlighting that we are disappointed we have not had a response from Tusla and following this meeting the secretariat will contact Tusla in order for it to provide us with a reasonable response to the matters raised during that public session up to and including the number of cr&egrave;ches under investigation, the 37 that have been mentioned on several occasions.  It is appropriate we mention that in public session rather than behind closed doors.</p><p>I welcome the members back to the joint committee and also our guests who are joining us this morning.  The purpose of this meeting is to discuss with representatives of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS and Jigsaw, the national centre for youth mental health, youth mental health.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Jim Ryan, assistant national director and head of operations, mental health services, HSE; Professor Brendan Doody, consultant child psychiatrist and clinical director of Linn Dara Child and Adolescent Mental Health services, HSE; Dr. Joseph Duffy, chief executive officer, Jigsaw; and Ms Sarah Cullinan, director of services, Jigsaw.</p><p>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the attention of our guests to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  They are directed that only evidence connected to the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I remind our guests, as I have already reminded the members, to switch off their mobile phones or put them on flight mode as they can interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for those following these proceedings to pick up what they are saying, and we would not want that.  I also advise them that any submission or opening statement they have made to the joint committee will be published on the committee's website following this meeting.  Following our guests' presentations there will be an exchange and members will pose questions.  I note Deputies Buckley and Ellis have joined us this morning in addition to the membership of the committee and I thank them for doing so.</p><p>I call Professor Doody and Mr. Ryan to make their opening statements.</p></speech>

I am the head of operations in mental health in the HSE.  I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this joint committee meeting to discuss youth mental health.  I am joined today by my colleague, Professor Brendan Doody, child and adolescent psychiatrist and clinical director in Linn Dara Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.</p> <p>  I am pleased to be here today to speak to the committee about mental health.  We submitted a briefing paper in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting so I will confine my remarks in this statement to giving members an overview of HSE youth mental health services.</p> <p>  Since 2012, &euro;208 million additional funding has been allocated under programme for Government to HSE mental health services, including youth mental health.  The HSE provides and funds services for young people in community, child and adolescent mental health teams and in inpatient facilities up to the age of 18.  The fact that the Mental Health Act defines a child as being under 18 impacts on the legal and organisational responses to youth mental health.  The main priority of HSE mental health services is providing care for young people with secondary care mental health needs.</p> <p>  Members will be aware of a number of national policies and strategies which inform the direction of mental health services for young people, including A Vision for Change, our national mental health policy, which is currently being updated by the Department of Health; Connecting for Life, Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020; and Sl&aacute;intecare.  We have also been involved in and informed by the recent National Youth Mental Health Task Force Report 2017 and the 2018 report of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care.</p> <p>  Youth mental health services in Ireland are integrated with primary care, acute hospitals, disability services and a wide range of community partners.</p><p>Services are provided in a number of different settings, including health centres, day centres, inpatient units and sometimes in the service user's own home.</p><p> Regionally, the nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, have responsibility for the delivery of community healthcare services within their respective programme areas.  While the chief officer of the CHO has overall responsibility, the head of service for mental health in each CHO area, in conjunction with the executive clinical director, is responsible for the delivery of mental health services across the CHO area.</p><p> In terms of a tiered level of services, the HSE reaches the wider population in a number of ways, including our Little Things campaign and, more recently, our digital mental health service improvements.  Interventions at primary care level are important to support young people when they first start to struggle with mental health issues.  Many young people can be treated at primary care level and make progress without needing to access specialist mental health services.  Primary care services include GPs, Jigsaw and other NGO service providers, primary care psychology services and counselling in primary care, CIPC, which is available to those over 18.  Jigsaw services are fully funded by the HSE and they see young people up to the age of 25.  There are 13 Jigsaw services in communities across Ireland providing mental health support to young people and work continues to develop two new Jigsaw services in Wicklow and Tipperary.</p><p> CAMHS provide specialist mental health service to those aged up to 18 years who have reached the threshold for a diagnosis of moderate to severe mental health disorder that requires the input of a consultant led multidisciplinary mental health team.  CAMHS inpatient units offer assessment and treatment to children and adolescents up to the age of 18, with severe and often complex mental health difficulties.  For those aged over 18, these services are provided by general adult community teams and inpatient units.  Approximately 2% of the under 18 population will require a CAMHS intervention at any given time.</p><p> Mental health services for young people have improved significantly in recent years, with an emphasis on early intervention but also on services for those with severe mental illness using models of care supported by the clinical evidence base.  Notwithstanding the improvements, we are very aware of the continued need to further develop services and deal with challenges, including consultant vacancies, and we will continue to work with all stakeholders, including the Department of Health, in this regard.</p></speech>

We all know that adolescence is a time of huge change and upheaval.  The journey from childhood to adulthood is complex and challenging and for many young people this journey can be particularly tough to handle.  Jigsaw's vision is an Ireland where every young person's mental health is valued and supported.  Jigsaw was established in 2006, as Headstrong, to meet an identified gap in service provision for young people struggling with their mental health, possibly with emerging mental health issues, who did not require the support of specialist mental health services.<br/><br/>Previous research by Jigsaw has shown that a third of Ireland's young people have experienced mental health difficulties.  Our evidence and our experience of working with young people tell us that many across Ireland struggle daily with anxiety, low mood, stress and isolation.  The cost of this mental health crisis to Ireland's economy is a staggering &euro;8.3 billion a year, not to mention the devastating personal cost to an individual's quality of life and physical well-being.  We know social inequalities are associated with higher rates of mental health difficulties.  The more unequal the society, the greater the rate of distress.  In Ireland, this is particularly relevant given that the gap between rich and poor is growing and the numbers of young people finding themselves homeless is on the rise.<br/><br/>The young people we see tell us about how they feel under tremendous pressure to succeed and excel at school, at home, on the sports ground and in social groups.  Jigsaw supports thousands of young people across Ireland every year through our community based youth mental health services, our work educating parents, teachers and young people, and our information and guidance at <i>.</i><br/><br/>Since Jigsaw was founded, young people have been involved in helping us to develop and design our services.  We now have a youth advisory panel in each of our services and the national office.  These panels are made up of young people aged between 16 and 25 years who may or may not have experience of the mental health system but who all are passionate about this area.  Our youth advisers asked me to emphasise the following to the committee today.  A holistic approach is needed to address the causes of mental health difficulties.  Young people are worried about big issues in society, such as inaction over climate change, increased homelessness, academic pressure and the pressure on minority groups.  More specifically, they are concerned about wait times for mental health support, gaps between child and adolescent and adult mental health services and the cost of private therapeutic support.  Awareness campaigns are not enough; young people respond better to information from their peers.<br/><br/>In Jigsaw, we believe in intervening early with mental health difficulties, offering a therapeutic service to young people at primary care level.  We also believe in listening to each young person's judgment of his or her own needs, hence we have a service with no lower threshold.  We aim to construct an understanding of what is happening in a young person's life with him or her, rather than solely through the objective assessment of the clinician as the mental health expert.<br/><br/>We know that there is no easy fix or miracle solution for mental health problems because these are complex and challenging, but there is much that Government and policymakers can do to better support young people who are experiencing mental health difficulties.  For this reason, we are calling for an increased focus on mental health services that are proactive, community based, integrated and early interventionist in nature.  Investment in keeping people well, rather than waiting until they are very unwell, has the potential to save lives and save significant financial resourcing.  Investing in early intervention, implementing the recommendations of the National Youth Mental Health Task Force Report 2017, will contribute to making a real meaningful difference to the mental health of Ireland's young people and give them the best possible chance for a full and healthy future.<br/><br/>Jigsaw very much welcomes this opportunity to discuss the issues that we have raised further during this meeting.  I thank the committee for the invitation to participate in this process.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1328" speakername="Tom Neville" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019092500002#E00500"><p>I thank our guests for appearing.  My first question is to Mr. Ryan who spoke about A Vision for Change being updated.  When will the full document be updated?  Has a date been provided?  What is the position regarding the implementation of a 24-7 telephone service?  The Minister spoke previously about introducing such a service.</p> <p>  I am working on the path finder service behind the scenes with various Departments.  I would like an update on that but that is more for the Government side.</p> <p>  Two weeks ago, I joined a Limerick Suicide Watch patrol for four or five hours.  It was an extremely humbling experience.  I cannot find another description for it.  One intervention was made during that time but I did not witness it as it occurred on the other side of the city where a second team was on patrol.  We met people who felt low and wanted to speak to somebody and did so before going about their business.  These groups operate across the country and are doing unbelievable work.  My experience was that there was a jovial atmosphere among the volunteers patrolling the bridges because that is how people deal with these types of issues.  However, there is also a sense of nervousness at all times.  For want of a better description, people have butterflies in their stomach for the four hours that they are on patrol.  I was shadowing others as I am not a qualified patroller.</p> <p>  Does the HSE interact with these patrol groups to discuss their findings, the data they gather, the types of interventions they make and the tangible recommendations they may make on deterrence?  They are doing all they can but is the HSE and the other agencies doing all they can to communicate with these groups.  Anecdotally, I heard from the Limerick group that further interventions sometimes occur after people have been brought to hospital by the emergency services.  They recommended having a qualified person on site immediately because the gap between the intervention and the involvement of the emergency services is where they believe the system needs to be improved.</p> <p>  Dr. Duffy spoke about being proactive in reaching out to these people as opposed to being reactive.  I accept that this is difficult.  From speaking to people, those who experience a mental health difficulty often find it difficult to make the call and seek help.</p><p>They need somebody to help them make that call and reach out, as opposed to reacting.  It is all very fine to say to somebody that he or she should get help, but sometimes that person would need somebody else to take the lead and ask whether to make that call for help.  I am trying to consider the system, particularly at this acute emergency level, when there are people in such distress and there is a link between the emergency service and where the cases are.  This is an example but I am coming from an area where I do not have a huge amount of knowledge.  I only spent four hours with these people.</p><p> Was all the new money coming from the Government to the Health Service Executive, HSE, spent in 2018 or was some of it handed back?  We know there have been recruitment challenges in mental health services but has anything been done to overcome those recruitment challenges since the mental health committee sat?  We identified a number of roadblocks in the recruitment process but have any changes or improvements been made?  If there have been, what are those improvements?</p><p> I visited the Jigsaw service in Limerick and it is fantastic.  It was mentioned that Jigsaw is seeking proactive community early intervention.  What type of work, from the experience of the witnesses, has been done on stigma?  Is there a push or move against stigma?  I take comfort that in some people of the younger generation, stigma is not as prevalent as it would have been in the older generations, but we should not take our eye off the ball.  Stigma is still there.  What is Jigsaw's experience of this and what would be its advice for any future campaigns trying to combat stigma?</p></speech>

It is a Department of Health document but it is in the final stages of completion.  It is likely to be published before the end of the year, but it is with the Department.  We expect that the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, will make an announcement on the 24-7 call number on World Mental Health Day in early October, as he outlined earlier.  As the Deputy said, the Pathfinder initiative is challenging because it is across government.  We are waiting for that to happen as it will have an impact on a number of the recommendations from the original youth mental health task force report.  I do not have the details on the patrols on the Shannon in Limerick, but I can get details on that.</p></speech>

Is there a relationship with these organisations?</p></speech>

I can get more information, especially from my colleague, Mr. John Meehan, from our National Office for Suicide Prevention.  I can report to the committee on that.  That office would have a day-to-day relationship with those organisations.  The country has responded in a wide variety of ways to suicide and the threat of suicide.  We try to support that within our resources and also in ensuring that the models being used are appropriate and evidence-based.</p></speech>

The figure in Limerick has gone from 23 per 100,000 to 15 per 100,000 in the past three or four years.  I do not have any evidence of why that is happening but I assume there have been a number of initiatives, including those patrols.</p></speech>

It can be a combination or matrix response rather than a single initiative.  The Deputy asked about the money spent in the HSE.  I assure the Deputy that all the money allocated for mental health is being spent within mental health services.  The Deputy mentioned recruitment challenges and the work of a previous committee, and those challenges remain.  We have invested HSE funding in additional undergraduate and postgraduate nursing, and by September 2020, there should be an additional approximately 60 nurses per year.  The number will go from 295 this year to 350 next year.  That is because we have invested HSE mental health money in paying colleges to put through more undergraduate nurses as well as postgraduate students.  We hope that will make a difference because we have many challenges in that regard.</p></speech>

We identified the 26 to 29 steps to hire psychiatric nurses, but has any of that process changed?  Have any of the recruitment process changed with respect to mental health services?</p></speech>

There has not been enormous change.  We have been affected by some of the recruitment issues from the point of view of staying in budget etc.  We have tried to streamline the system to the best of our ability while ensuring we remain within the licence we have as a recruitment agency.  It is one of the challenges.</p></speech>

We have had some success recently in recruiting consultants in parts of the country where we previously found it difficult, including the north west and the south east.  It can sometimes take six months for people to change life circumstances etc.  The committee is aware that the Minister for Health has spoken about the need to look at the differential between the new recruits and existing consultants.  The mood music may be changing a little on that.  We are also looking at putting in higher support training posts so we can grow consultants over a number of years.  It is a little like nursing in that sometimes we have new developments that essentially denude existing services.  We move people around as distinct from increasing a pool.</p></speech>

There has been a major expansion in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, over the past eight to ten years and there has been a significant increase in the number of consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists.  On the one hand we are developing new services and creating new posts while at the same time there is a turnover of existing posts with retirements.  A number of years ago, many higher trainees left the country to take up employment opportunities abroad.  The reality is there is a worldwide shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists.  They are mobile and there are worldwide opportunities.  Those who would have been eligible for consultant posts would have most frequently gone to either Australia or Canada.  On a positive note, the demand with intake into higher training places in child and adolescent psychiatry is now exceeding the number of places.  It will take a number of years before these higher trainees complete training.  Basic training takes three to four years and higher training is a further three years.  There is going to be a lag with the new consultant posts coming on stream.  It is one factor.</p> <p>  Another factor may be geographical and it is across the various disciplines.</p><p>For recruitment, as can be seen in other countries, there may be geographical as well as service factors.  One needs to consider many factors.  What may apply in one area may not necessarily be at issue in another.</p><p> We are becoming more attractive for external consultants to come and work here.  Some consultants who work in the UK may now consider coming to Ireland and taking up posts here.  Even in the case of recruitment from recruitment agencies to fill posts on a temporary basis, the agencies suggest that consultants in the UK in locum positions, or European consultants who may have chosen to go to the UK, now consider Ireland to be an option.  It will take a number of years before we fill all the posts permanently and it will depend on the demand as we create new services.  As we have created more specialist services, we have experienced that the posts are taken up by existing consultants.  We fill one post but it creates a vacancy somewhere else.</p></speech>

People are put on panels and the system is quite rigid.  Has there been any movement or flexibility in that respect?  If somebody has a consultant psychiatry background in treating adults, is he or she able to move to treating adolescents, or is there a blockage in that regard?</p></speech>

For consultants coming from certain European countries, there can sometimes be an issue with their eligibility to be on the child specialist register.  The major divide is between adults, and children and adolescents.</p></speech>

Nursing panels remain generic.  At various times we have tried both local and generic recruitment.  The benefit of a national panel is that there is only one panel, while the disadvantage is that somebody might say he or she wants to work only in Limerick or Dublin and may wait until such time as a vacancy arises.  Meanwhile, the panel is paused and there are challenges in that regard.  We have put in place a structure whereby if a recruiter cannot hire someone from a national panel, recruitment can be made through a bespoke local panel.</p></speech>

The way we respond to it is by examining the stigma and level of knowledge within different groups.  In particular, we work with young people in schools on peer education.  Our experience, supported by the evidence, is that peer education is very effective in creating a knowledge base and to encourage young people to connect with other young people.  There is a strong peer influence.</p> <p>  There is also a strong influence in the awareness and training provided to adults, whether they are specialists already working with young people or parents working with young people.  We do much work with campaigns.  A current campaign with one of our sponsors, Lidl, is called One Good Adult and is about promoting the wider initiative.  Where we can target, there is good evidence and experience that it is highly effective.  The difficulty is in generational shifts and changes.</p> <p>  While young people who are involved, educated and aware have much more knowledge, and their parents are beginning to have it, there are also groups within the wider community where, at times, there may be difficulties.  As an anecdote, when we were establishing another office for a Jigsaw service, we encountered a difficulty with a landlord who did not want there to be a mental service, although we tried, brought the tenants to another service and did everything we could.  In many ways, we can address stigma where it is clear or obvious with a wider group, which is successful, but pockets of it remain.  It is a continuing issue but we invest many resources.  Much of the work we do with any of the fundraising sponsors is on awareness raising.</p></speech>

A Vision for Change states there should be 13 members on a team.  Approximately 60% of the 71 teams have 13 members and, therefore, we are not at full membership.</p> <p>  Adult teams comprise approximately seven individuals.  The professionals who are represented on the teams are consultant psychiatrists, non-consultant hospital doctors, nurses, social care workers, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and psychologists.  There is a broad range of therapeutic, medical and nursing staff.</p></speech>

Does that relate to the teams?  Will Mr. Ryan explain that commentary?</p></speech>

If a young person is referred to CAMHS and his or her condition is deemed an emergency by the team, there is a target of 72 hours by which the young person will be seen.  The target arose as a result of a particular development a number of years ago.  While we provided the figures the Deputy quoted, I have some concerns about their validity and will have to revert to the committee on them.  We expect 100% of young people in an emergency to be seen within the period outlined.</p></speech>

That is why I have a difficulty with the veracity of the figures and have challenged them in recent days.  I will need to revert to the committee on the matter.</p><p>I need to come back to everybody on that because it might be a little bit about how people have defined what an emergency is.  For example, a person might be referred in an emergency but when he or she is assessed by the team, his or her case might not be regarded as an emergency.  Something else might be going on.</p></speech>

How is the integration going on, particularly for young people who present with issues relating to CAMHS, ADHD and Asperger's syndrome?  As the witnesses are probably aware, approximately 200 young people were on the CAMHS waiting list in Galway.  There was a complete overhaul 12 months ago.  Now there is a disability element.  They were put over to the other side.  Have the 200 people who were moved to disability from CAMHS, which they had been on to begin with, been seen?  What is the update on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.303" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019092500002#H00700"><p>Dr. Doody might comment on this matter as well.  CAMHS is a secondary care mental health service for young people with a moderate to severe mental illness, as distinct from somebody who might have a disability and a mild mental illness.  We have to be very clear about how we manage our services.  Primary care services deliver for people who have mild mental health issues and may have some disability issues.  Our CAMHS teams deliver for people who have moderate to severe mental health difficulties.  That is how we try to differentiate between the two cohorts.  As Dr. Doody said earlier, approximately 2% of the young population will require CAMHS at any stage.  We have to ensure the teams we have are available and able to meet the demand from that 2% - not from those who may have a mental difficulty but do not meet the CAMHS criteria.  We have invested in other interventions like primary care psychology and in Jigsaw and many other non-governmental organisations to make sure there is a primary care response and a more universal response to those who may need to be seen in a secondary care situation.  Dr. Doody might like to comment on mental health intellectual disabilities.</p></speech>

A Vision for Change recommended that areas with a population of 50,000 should be supported by 11 clinicians and by two support administrative staff.  As an average of 25% of people are under the age of 18, there are 12,500 young people in each of these areas.  As Mr. Ryan has said, the number of teams has increased to 71.  Although not all of the teams would have the full 11 staff members, all of the disciplines would be recommended on them.  It was recommended in A Vision for Change that there should be two psychology posts, two nursing posts and two social work posts within each team.  I think there is an average of between six and eight people on each team.  I do not have the exact figure.  However, most teams have close to the full multidisciplinary complement, if not necessarily to the level recommended in A Vision for Change.  The priority has been to fill the multidisciplinary complement.  Not all teams have the full multidisciplinary complement.  There are two issues at stake here: first, whether a team has the full multidisciplinary complement, and approximately 70% of them are at the level recommended in A Vision for Change; and second, whether a team has two psychologists, two nurses and two social workers.  That is what was recommended.  We have approximately 80% of the number of teams recommended in A Vision for Change, which was 90.  Approximately 70% of the teams which are in place have the staffing levels recommended in A Vision for Change.  That brings the figure down to under 60%, if that makes sense.</p></speech>

Surely everybody has a role to play within the team.  There are different levels of sign-off.  How can there be sign-off at different levels if there is not a full complement on the team?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.310" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019092500002#H01400"><p>I would like to make a point about the way teams have been filled.  As I have said, the first priority is to provide a full multidisciplinary complement.  Given that A Vision for Change recommended that there should be a multidisciplinary complement, it is clear that certain key disciplines need to have two members present on the team.  They are in place in some teams, but they are not in place in many teams.  In those cases, there is just one representative of the discipline in question.  Therefore, not all services are at the level recommended in A Vision for Change.  In all cases, the team has the fully multidisciplinary complement necessary to provide a multidisciplinary response.  The needs of children and families who come to specialist mental health services are quite complex.  Access to the full multidisciplinary skill mix is necessary to provide an appropriate package of intervention and care.  As I have said, the resourcing of services is not of the level that would have been recommended in A Vision for Change.</p></speech>

Not all young people who will be accepted for CAMHS will require speech and language services, for example.  When they are being assessed initially as part of an overall multidisciplinary assessment, there is a need to ascertain what element of our service they will need.  In that situation, ideally the psychologist will be there in addition to everybody else.  If we do not have a speech and language service, as is occasionally the case, we might be able to buy it in on an agency basis or we might be able to go to primary care to say we need speech and language assistance.  Our teams develop from consultants to NCHDs to nursing staff to AHPs.  A consultant is needed to start a team because he or she is the team leader.  We are very conscious of the need to have a full multidisciplinary team approach because that is what CAMHS does best, but there are occasions when that is not in place.</p></speech>

By March of this year, however, increasing demand for services had led to a combined national waiting list of 2,738 young people.  This represents both a year-on-year increase and a higher figure than had been anticipated by the HSE.  It indicates that the service, in the round, is under continuous strain.  When the witnesses speak about buying in support for the services, we must remember that they are talking about emergencies.  Anything that is going into CAMHS is acute.  It is an emergency.  Why are we not buying in support?  Could we not have used some of the new funds to buy in support services for whatever part of the team was under pressure?</p></speech>

The demand for services is continuing to increase.  The number of teams has increased from 40 to 70 in recent years.  We are attempting to increase the capacity while meeting demand.  Part of the challenge relates to the recruitment issue that was mentioned earlier.  A consultant child psychiatrist is needed at the beginning in order to get a team.  For all sorts of reasons, for example relating to medication, a medical doctor is needed initially.  The AHPs work have a significant and important role to play in working with these teams.  The Deputy has said that all CAMHS cases are emergencies, but some of them are more urgent than others and we have to try to respond to those initially.</p></speech>

As the committee will have seen, the waiting lists are not evenly distributed around the country.  The areas that have the most consistent resource available are those which have the shortest waiting lists.  As one would expect, it is a question of the availability of teams and of consultants.</p><p>The key is having the multidisciplinary team in place on a consistent basis, with consistent availability.  Issues can arise within teams where there is a lot of turnover of personnel or where there are agency or locum staff in position on a sustained basis.  There may be a number of factors involved.  In general waiting lists are a resource issue but there may be specific issues relating to a particular area that can explain the variations in waiting times and waiting lists.</p><p> Again, to echo what Mr. Ryan said, when a referral comes in it is triaged.  A decision is made as to what response is needed and the timeliness of that response.  As is clear from the various reports, 50% of referrals are seen within four weeks and 75% are seen within the 12-week framework.  Often the issue is that less urgent cases are left on waiting lists.  They are being displaced by new, more urgent referrals which are superseding them.  I can speak for the Linn Dara service and I know how this happens but I am not saying that young people who are on waiting lists do not have an identified need that requires a response.  In the context of fewer resources, such that exist will be taken up by the more urgent referrals which means that those with a less acute need are pushed back and their needs are not met in as timely a manner as they should be.</p></speech>

We agreed that we would focus on the service in Wicklow first.  One of the big issues in providing a service, now that the resources are available, is finding premises.  That is a big issue for us right across the country.  In a number of areas we are finding it difficult to find premises of an appropriate size for an acceptable rent.</p></speech>

The Essex Street service, for example, which is one of the Dublin city centre services, is based in premises belonging to Dublin City Council.  It is bang in the heart of Temple Bar, where it is all happening.  Young people are reluctant to attend services identified with the HSE but when it is Jigsaw, it has different connotations.  We have looked at premises in Tipperary and Wicklow but have not found appropriate buildings.</p></speech>

However, there are cases that I have dealt with in my office that are deeply upsetting and which have stayed with me.  A number of mental health cases involving young people have shone a light on the lack of services in the community.  I refer to the west of Ireland in particular.  I am from County Mayo and we do not really have youth mental health services.  There are voluntary organisations like Pieta House and other charitable bodies trying to bridge the gaps and provide some level of service.  The biggest issue is that if young people are sick after 5 p.m., the only place they can go is the emergency department.  If they have mental health issues, are suffering from severe depression or anxiety and are having an episode or a difficult time, the last place they want to go is the emergency department of a hospital.  As most people know, most emergency departments in this country are overcrowded, manic and chaotic.  That is not the right kind of environment for young people who are ill but that all that is available.</p> <p>  A young girl came to my office who had spent three weeks in an adult mental health unit in Castlebar Hospital.  She was there involuntarily.  There were no activities and no structure to the day.  There was a list of activities on the wall so that if the unit was inspected, it looked as if things were happening every day but none of the listed activities ever took place, apart from a weekly one-hour music lesson and mass on Sunday.  That is all that was available.  She was not able to leave the facility.  It has a small courtyard or garden, no bigger than this room, which is a glorified smoking area.  That was all of the outdoor space that she had in the three weeks that she was there.  She got out of there only because her parents could afford to put her into private care.  She fundamentally believes that she is better now and doing well only because she got private mental health care in St. Patrick's.  She felt that if she had been left in Castlebar, she would be in a very different space today.  Thankfully, she is doing well and is in college.  She is determined now to help others in that situation who cannot get out.  She spoke about a culture of sleeping tablets and medication, with no psychological services.  If the first sleeping tablet did not work, patients were given a second one two hours later.  She said people were left sobbing and crying in the middle of the night with nobody there to show any compassion or to check on them.  She described people of all ages with all types of illness in the same small facility with no way out.  In a wealthy, first-world country, that is disgusting and unacceptable.  This is a HSE facility.  A few months ago I was told that everything was fine in that facility, that services were good and resources and staff were plentiful but the girl who came to me spoke about bedclothes not being changed and elderly patients being left untended.  She talked about the place having a smell and being unhygienic.  This is unacceptable.  I am sure that conditions in that facility are replicated right across the country.  I have no doubt that Castlebar is not an outlier.  It is a fine hospital and provides great services.  As Mr. Ryan pointed out, it is not the fault of staff, who can only work with what they have.  </p> <p>  I received a reply to a parliamentary question recently on staff vacancies in the mental health unit in that hospital which runs to two pages.  A basic-grade psychologist post has been vacant since 2015 but there is no date or deadline for the filling of that vacancy.  There are several vacancies in CAMHS itself, most of which are six months to a year old, if not longer with no final date for those posts to be filled.  Clearly the staff that are working there are doing the job of two or three people.  I cannot see how that is not the case.  How can there be no psychological services within a mental health unit that is treating people who have been involuntarily committed for a number of weeks?  How is that even possible?  There are no gym facilities, no structure and no place to exercise.  If any of us were in such facilities for three days, not to mention three weeks, we would be climbing the walls.  The girl who came to me spoke about not being able to sleep at night because of the noise and because there was no way to burn off energy during the day.  Patients were wide awake in bed at night.  One can imagine the noises in a facility of that nature, where people are stressed and upset and suffering from severe mental health episodes.  I do not think I will ever forget the day that lady called into my office.  I am still in contact with her but she is one of the lucky ones.  She sent me a poem that she wrote but I will not go through it today.  She is an exceptionally talented young person.  She went on to speak to me about her experience in St. Patrick's, the private hospital that she went to afterwards.  She talked of the wrap-around care that she received.  There were basic things like the fact that every service user or resident had to get up for breakfast every morning; that was part of being there.  There was structure to the day.  Bedclothes were changed and patients were made take showers.  There were activities during the day like yoga, dance or art.  There was positivity during the day.  She felt that she was being cared for and given the opportunity to get better.  What really upsets her is the fact that people are being readmitted all the time to mental health units.  The same people are going back into these units because they have not been given the opportunity to get better.  When are we going to change how we deal with this?  If one robs children or young people of the opportunity to get better at a young age, what hope do they have in later life?</p><p>That is not all on Mr. Ryan's shoulders, he is merely the HSE representative today and it is an opportunity for us to ask questions and put those things across, but we need to change how we do things.  Perhaps the HSE needs to look to the private facilities and ask how they do it.  Of course it will be expensive but the proportion of our health budget allocated to mental health is far too small.  We all know this.  It is not enough to tell us that the budget has increased since 2012 to over &euro;200 million.  That is buttons.  It is not working and is not enough.  I am sure that Jigsaw will agree.  It is on the coalface dealing with it daily.  A nice office in Temple Bar is great and it caters for some young people.  It is great that it is in the community but we are failing young people in this country and committing them to lifelong mental health issues, as they will not be able to recover.  Could we have a bit of honesty from the HSE to the Government about the vacant posts and why they cannot be filled, that it requires more money for mental health services and that this has to be a priority?  This is far more important than the next motorway, or extension to the Luas or DART.  The most basic thing that a country can do for its citizens is make sure that they are healthy.  The saying is "your health is your wealth".  If one does not have one's health, one has nothing.  Our health service has to be the top priority and at present, the mental health service is the poor relation.  We need more honesty, rather than being told that things are great and we are progressing in the right direction.  Things are far from good and the Government needs to hear that from those on the front line as when it comes from politicians, it just slides off and does not have the same weight.  I do not know what the HSE can tell Hannah.  She is not the first individual I have met in those circumstances but she has left a mark on me and by having the bravery to come out and tell her story, she  will help others.  She is a young woman who is very determined to ensure that the services improve.</p></speech>

In 1960 there were 20,000 people in psychiatric hospitals in Ireland.  There are now 1,000 acute inpatient beds.  We have one of the lower uses of beds across Europe.  We have changed the model of care from institutional care to community care.  That is challenging as we must ensure that our community services are in place to ensure that the beds that we do have are for those who need them most.  I cannot condone the experience of that young woman.  I understand that.  I have responsibility for the Central Mental Hospital.  There are people on the waiting list to come into the hospital from prisons.  I understand issues like that on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>  We have tried to do various things.  In Galway last week, for instance, we opened a new 50-bed unit.  It is a state-of-the-art unit that had been open for 12 months before being formally opened last week.  We have opened units in Drogheda and Cork and have renovated Limerick and Sligo.  We are trying to change the way in which mental health services are delivered but it is taking longer than any of us would hope.</p> <p>  I agree about budget and staffing.  I am head of operations and obviously, I would prefer that we had more resources.  The submissions we make are based on the need, particularly that outlined in our policy document, A Vision for Change.  We must also recognise our ability to staff the units we have, and there is a constant issue with the recruitment and retention of staff in the psychiatric and mental health services.  </p> <p>  There was a question about what to do during the day when one comes out of hospital.  In Mayo in particular, we have a very strong recovery college based in Castlebar.  Service users have been involved in setting up recovery colleges, including wellness recovery action plans, WRAPs, and other programmes that they have implemented.  That is because we have a relatively small number of inpatient beds and we want people to be in there for the least time possible and we want something for them to plug into immediately when they do come out.  We have employed peer support workers and service user leads who have a lived experience of mental illness and who are changing the way in which we are delivering services.  I will not sit here and say that the experience that a person has had is anything other than unsatisfactory - I am not just saying that, I believe it personally and professionally - but I must try to work with what we have and to try to change things.  I spoke about the budget and the increase in funding.  I acknowledge that the budget increase is going from a low base.  Mental health has about 6.7% of the overall health budget, whereas the equivalent figure in other countries is 8% or 9% but that is an issue which is above my pay grade.  These are points we have made time and again.  </p> <p>  I acknowledge what the Deputy said.  We are always disappointed to hear when people have had bad experiences of our services.  I know the unit in Castlebar and have visited it many times.  I often ask myself what would I want if I was in that situation.  We are trying to achieve a much better service so that when people are in there - for the shortest time possible - they are helped when they come out and have something else to do.  Today, for example, as we speak the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is launching 30 specialist rehabilitation unit beds we have purchased from outside the HSE in two services in Dublin.  We recognise there are those who have been in inpatient units in the long term, who have become institutionalised and who are unable to come out and get into a more meaningful life.  We expect that within 12 or 18 months, those 30 beds in those two areas will make a significant impact and a difference.  We hope to extend that across the country in coming years.  We are making efforts but there are still deficits.  </p></speech>

I do not doubt but that they seek to make a genuine effort to tackle these sensitive issues.  A common theme which is emerging here is that of resources.  I acknowledge the role played by the former Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in seeking to progress matters, particularly in mental health, and the challenges she faced in trying to get a greater slice of the health budget assigned to mental health.  I understand the constraints.</p> <p>  I will speak specifically on Cork.  How many inpatient beds are there in Cork at present?</p></speech>

That unit was built for a capacity of 20.  One of the rooms was a double room.  This was before my time.  There was no high-dependency area, which meant the unit was unable to admit a young person who needed such an area.  As a result, they have used two of the rooms to create a space that is suitable for a young person who needs time out and who may need particular treatment for a period.  The operational number will be 16.</p></speech>

It might be better if Professor Brendan Doody, who manages the Linn Dara unit, explains.  The previous Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, visited &Eacute;ist Linn and looked at how many young people were there compared with the number it was stated were there.  There may be young people out on leave or back home as part of their care plan and so they may not be in the unit on a particular day.</p></speech>

Due to the culture or decision making process, there are situations from time to time when some of those beds are left vacant for prolonged periods when there is clear evidence of a demand for them.  I do not have sight of that and Mr. Ryan might not be able to give an answer on it today, but I would be happy to revisit it with him and the HSE at a future meeting.  If there is such a demand for services and if it is the case that there are empty beds, there is a disparity that must be addressed.</p></speech>

We examine what referrals have been made across the fours units and then talk to the paediatric hospitals if they have young people in the hospitals who require admission.  Every Monday morning, a list is prepared.  I know every day, and each Monday in particular, how many young people are in, how many vacancies there may be and what young people will be admitted during that week.  Professor Doody might speak about the experience of running a unit.</p></speech>

It was not a bespoke build.  We had the advantage in Linn Dara of having a bespoke build on a greenfield site.  We configured it based on best evidence and experience from units elsewhere, particularly in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  There are two 11-bedded units plus a two-bed high-dependency unit.  Our capacity to respond to admissions depends on the acuity of the case mix.  It also depends on the availability of our high-dependency unit.  For a period last year when it was not available, it severely reduced our capacity.</p> <p>  As a CAMHS unit, we must manage young people with a diverse range of presentations and ages.  There are admissions down to the age of 12 years with severe anxiety or depressive disorders.  A significant proportion of our admissions to inpatient facilities have quite severe eating disorders.  It is about trying to manage, in that open facility, a young person who may be in a very distressed and agitated presentation as a result of the person's mental health and how to provide a safe environment for not only managing and treating that young person but also being mindful of the other young people on the ward and providing a safe and therapeutic environment.  That is much easier to do in a unit with facilities such as access to a high-dependency suite, where the young person can be managed for a period until he or she is ready to join the open ward.</p></speech>

In other words, if one looks at the full range of young people who can be admitted, when we get a referral to Linn Dara we must make a determination as to whether we are in a position to provide safe, therapeutic care to the young person.  Obviously, one is looking at staffing resources and the skills of the staff, but one is also looking at the physical environment.  That will be a major factor that will have to be taken into consideration.  Then one is looking at the acuity of the mix of the other cases on the ward.  This is seen across all units.  Even though the capacity of a CAMHS unit might be 11 or 12 beds, the ability to admit a young person at a particular point will depend on the acuity because there may be young people who may require additional nursing or one-to-one nursing.  A number of factors must be considered when one is looking at being able to admit a young person.  Again, it is important that the young person can be managed safely in that environment.</p></speech>

There have been legitimate questions in the past about the culture that exists there.</p> <p>  There are 130 individuals waiting more than 18 months for CAMHS assessments in my neck of the woods.  If I am reading information relating to interventions correctly, and without putting words in anybody's mouth, the term "resources" is the key.  It is preventing children and families in my area from receiving proper assessments.  I understand there is a multidisciplinary team and that there are constraints with regard to recruitment and so forth.  Has the HSE examined the multidisciplinary team model with regard to reducing the numbers on the waiting lists in such a way as to redeploy resources from other areas or through outside recruitment on short-term contracts or by ensuring that with proper supervision it might not necessarily have to be a psychiatrist who would make the initial assessment and it could be somebody else under the supervision of a psychiatrist?</p> <p>  The bottom line is that the families I know must be able to get assessments.  If we are talking about staving off problems down the line, as Deputy Lisa Chambers mentioned, intervention at the earliest stage is required.  That is self-evident, and I am not a physician.  It can prevent many problems down the line.  Are more imaginative solutions being considered at present to ensure we can get the waiting list down in spite of the capacity and resource constraints?</p></speech>

Obviously, staffing is an issue.  We have looked at whether a consultant from another area can cover if a consultant is not available.  We have also looked at bringing in consultants on agency on locum.  The model we have is that a young person is triaged, as Dr. Doody said earlier, but each team will need to-----</p></speech>

I will be down there again on Friday.  We have another way of trying to look at this.

It is an add-on to our current face-to-face service.  If a young person or an adult is on a waiting list, it may be possible in advance of his or her appointment to offer e-mental health initiatives, in other words, e-well or e-CBT.  Jigsaw is working on this in its services.  We are doing that in our own services and through Turn2me and BeLonG To.  We are piloting this with several external organisations to monitor the uptake.  This will take some time because not everyone is comfortable doing this online.  However our experience is that young people access their information online much more than my generation did.  We have to address that.  Social media is seen as one of the difficulties we face but it may also be a solution to some of the issues we face.  As members will know, the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, has been leading that agenda.  I will send the Deputy specific information, but that is the general gist.</p></speech>

Our experience is that young people access resources in a way over which we have no control anyway.  They will go online and look at <i>SpunOut.ie</i>, Turn2me or something else.

Dr. Duffy's opening statement referred to the supports needed to upskill those who work directly with children.  One bit that stuck out for me was his assertion that only 1% of primary school teachers thought they were adequately trained.  What sort of supports do we need and what upskilling do these teachers need to be able to support children?</p></speech>

We connected with them through schools that contacted the Jigsaw service to mention a particular pupil or concern.  We realised several things.  The teachers themselves would say they were trained to teach a subject but found they were teaching the whole person.  They are teaching young people, and a young person's ability to learn and participate in class is very influenced by his or her well-being and mental health.  In working with teachers and the teachers' education centres, we have been upskilling teachers on awareness of mental health.  We have done a lot of work around a concept called "one good teacher".  This means a teacher does not freeze on hearing a young person's concerns and knows how to connect with services in the community.  We have built skills as well.  We have worked with the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and local primary care.  We have particularly worked in Meath and we are now spreading that out through a model called one good school, which looks to support teachers, parents and young people.  We have had a series of smaller initiatives for a long time.  We offer peer education in which young people can participate.  They are trained to talk about mental health and they deliver that message to their peers, the other pupils in the school.  We have educated parents on how they can support young people.  We have looked at this in a very holistic way.</p></speech>

Our outcomes are really positive and show that our early intervention service really does work.  A large majority of the young people coming through the door have greatly decreased levels of psychological distress when they leave the Jigsaw service.</p> <p>  We also seek to help them build capacity to support them when they encounter challenges again in the future.  Jigsaw does not set out to eradicate mental health difficulties, which are part of the human condition.  Young people will encounter challenges again, in relationships, school or transitions.  Part of Jigsaw's intervention is intended to help them so that when they walk out the door, they take some tools and tips with them that will help when another challenge presents itself.  Last week we heard from a panel of service users who came to give us some feedback about their experience.  One of them spoke about a folder she had built up with the clinician she worked with that included some hints and tips.  She talked about knowing her own triggers and being able to remember the things she worked on in sessions with that clinician when things became a bit more challenging and her mental health slipped a little bit.  The idea is that service users bring something away with them for when something else presents itself, as it inevitably does in all of our lives.  The important thing for us is that the data on outcomes, not just for Jigsaw but internationally, show that an early intervention service really does work in alleviating that stress.</p></speech>

In my own area of Coolock, two young lads have committed suicide in the past two weeks.  The community is on its knees.  Knowing the lads and their families, it is so difficult to hear the cries when sitting in church.  Young men are carrying their friends out on their shoulders.  When there is a spike like that in a certain area, can resources be put into the area so that these young men and women can talk about things?  For parents who are concerned, is there an avenue for services to be opened up in an area when there is a spike in suicide?</p></speech>

As the Deputy may be aware, we have a service level agreement with Pieta House, which provides services in local areas.  We also have suicide resource officers in each of our areas.  When a spike happens in an area, they will know about it straight away and will put services in place.  If the Deputy could speak to me afterwards, we can look at that particular area.</p></speech>

I represent Dublin North-West, an area with a very high suicide rate.  People know about that.  It includes Ballymun and Finglas.  It is quite a serious issue.  I am curious about several things.  I refer to the primary care centres that are utilised throughout the country.  They help in looking after mental health issues among the youth.</p><p>The centres are places people can go to engage.  The HSE plans to put one on the Church of the Annunciation site in Finglas.  I hope that is at a far more advanced stage now.  It is badly needed in the Finglas area.  What sort of mental health services will be available for young people there and how will the centre work?  The primary care centre in Ballymun is working very well.  Responses to parliamentary questions indicated that people in Ballymun are waiting between 18 months and two years for psychiatric service for young people, which is a hell of a long time.</p><p> We all know the importance of early identification and intervention.  What engagements take place with schools?  How does that work?  The biggest problem is identifying the people involved and the nature of the problem.  Are schools the primary source?  Is there any other way we can look at it?  Within the schools, there are serious problems with cyberbullying that are leading to mental health issues among young people.  Is that a primary engagement that the mental health services have?</p><p> According to the statistics Mr. Ryan provided, one third of young people are struggling with mental health issues on an ongoing basis, which is a very high figure.  Obviously, we need to have the resources there.  Dr. Shari McDaid of Mental Health Reform has said that the mental health services are seriously underfunded.  We have heard what Mr. Ryan said and we accept they are badly underfunded.  I am also very concerned about dual diagnosis in the context of young children in particular.  It is an area that seems to cause problems.  It does not matter whether it is a young child or someone else who reports to a hospital or otherwise, there seems to be a particular attitude when alcohol and drugs are involved.  Many young children now are smoking hash, which is a big problem.  I would like to hear how we are dealing with the issue of dual diagnosis.</p><p> There are many groups offering help and Jigsaw is one of them.  I am concerned at the amount of private funding they have to get.  Companies such as Lidl are contributing and fair play to them.  However, it shows the deficit of funding from Government for Jigsaw and other groups.  We need regular funding so that they do not need to rely on private donations.  Obviously, education is the big issue.  We need to get to people early and tackle it at an early stage.</p><p> In the past, suicides among young people had a ripple effect with one after another.  A few years ago in Dunsoghly in Finglas there were three or four suicides of young people one after another.  I am glad to hear Mr. Ryan say that the mental health services put in a team and try to focus on getting to those young people.  How do they identify and reach out to those young people to try to stop something snowballing the way it did at one stage in my experience?</p></speech>

Child and adolescent mental health services are delivered to primary care services around the country.  We are trying to provide services for young people in locations they will actually attend.  Young men in particular do not tend to go into HSE-delivered services.  We struggle with that.  It is a phenomenon all over the world and certainly in this country.  I was a youth worker in Tallaght for ten years and there was a group called "the non-joiners".  We needed to have a very particular way of working with some young men because they had significant difficulty attending GP practices or anywhere else.  That is one of the reasons we partner with NGOs to be able to provide services in a more appropriate youth-friendly way.  We do not want a big sign on the road saying "HSE this" or "HSE that" because for some people that is a turn-off.</p> <p>  The HSE provides 94% of funding to Jigsaw.  The other funding it has received recently is for very specific purposes, but all the counselling and the 13 sites are funded by the HSE.  That has been a significant development in recent years.</p> <p>  We will certainly have a secondary-care mental health service.  The waiting list for primary-care psychology is very long in some areas.  We have employed over 100 assistant psychologists across the nine CHOs to try to address that issue.  We recognise that if we have waiting lists at primary care, sometimes GPs and others will refer to the next available service which will tend to be CAMHS.  That means we end up with young people who should not be on our waiting list and who could be dealt with at a lower level.</p> <p>  Dual diagnosis has been an issue for many years.  It goes back to the drug task forces of the late 1970s.  Is addiction a mental illness or where does it fit?  In the drug task force policy and the mental health policy, addiction is not seen as a mental illness.  In this city, we have Trinity Court, which deals with people who have both an addiction and a mental illness.  We are trying to get to a point where we have a "no wrong door" policy which means that nobody looking for help is turned away because they have an addiction or a mental illness.  We try to treat both.  That is taking much longer than I expected.  Internationally it is also an issue.  In most other parts of the world addiction and mental illness are treated the same.  In some parts of the country that is the case here.  We still have considerable work to do to integrate our services so that the person who asks for help is not turned away because they do not meet particular criteria.</p> <p>  We fund hundreds of groups across the country in the context of both early intervention and suicide.  We have to try to manage that because we need to ensure the quality of the services being delivered and the clinical governance behind them is appropriate.  That is one of the reasons that in some respects we need a smaller number of larger organisations.  When an issue happens in the community, many people will come together, as is the Irish way, and form a group which is very well meaning.  However, unfortunately in today's world we need to ensure that is done in an appropriate manner.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned schools.  While our care is secondary care, some of the stuff we have done includes the Mind Monster campaign, which is aimed at second level school students.  We provide posters and people go into schools to support it.  It focuses on examination stress, sleep, digital issues and feelings because the feedback we have got from young people, similar to what Jigsaw would have found, is that those are the areas that cause the most stress.  Studies show that our inpatient units tend to have less demand in summer when young people are out of school.</p><p>School is a stressor.  I am not suggesting it is stressor for all students, but for some young people it is a serious stressor in their lives.  We also have a recharge programme for third level students.  We fund interventions in the Union of Students in Ireland, USI. Members may be aware of its report earlier this week that examinations, sleep and alcohol are the three key issues that we have addressed in our programme for third level.  We are conscious of the need to do this in schools, but there are many young people who are not in school and we have to try to help them remain connected as well.</p><p> On suicide clusters, this has been a feature of the past.  We work with community groups to ensure that the way in which a young person's life is celebrated when there is a suicide is appropriate and does not create a circus of issues that some other young people buy into.  We have tried to analyse that and to ensure that the support provided is done through Pieta and in an evidence way that does not create a drama, which sometimes can happen.  Priests officiating at funerals have been trying to ensure that they are not another drama for young people to buy into.</p></speech>

As stated by Mr. Ryan, the HSE is supportive of the Jigsaw services.  From the beginning, we have worked with philanthropy and private fundraising, particularly around innovation.  We are innovating around schools and online services.  In terms of the research and work we do in the community, we use the funding to develop a proof of concept.  There is no evidence base in regard to how we might work with young people and provide information, so we develop that over time.  This is how Jigsaw developed.  There is real benefit in the community side and the corporate side coming together.  They complement each other in terms of managing the work.</p></speech>

There is also a problem in our primary schools.  How do we identify the young people at risk and where is the first port of call for them?  It was mentioned that they do not want to go into a HSE service.  We have to develop placements and identify those at risk at an early age.  We need a continuous programme within our schools, primary and secondary, with perhaps a particular day or week set aside for engagement with the principals, teachers and the pupils on problem areas.</p> <p>  Previously, when a pupil was frequently absent from school there would be follow-up by an educational welfare officer.  As far as I am aware, this post no longer exists.  This oversight helped to identify children who had problems and needed to be directed towards engagement with services.  Consideration should be given to the reintroduction of that service.</p> <p>  In my earlier contribution I mentioned cyberbullying.  This matter can only be addressed through engagement with the schools and those affected.  There are a few areas on which I think we need to do a bit more work.</p></speech>

From a HSE point of view, we work with schools but we have to be conscious of our role and the limits of it.  At primary school level, we have to be conscious that they are the experts in the area and they also have the relationship with the young people.  What goes on in school will impact in the community and at home.  We would be supportive of it, but we need to recognise the role that the education system also has in this area.</p></speech>

The purpose of the committee's work is to identify the gaps that need to be filled.  I will be frank, as always.  Do the witnesses believe that we have made progress in this area in the past ten years?</p> <p>  Mr. Ryan mentioned consultant-led multidisciplinary teams.  I have received information that indicates that no lead has yet been appointed to the HSE clinical programme announced in December 2015.  As of September 2019, this clinical programme does not appear on the HSE website.  I have been told that it is now a matter for the HSE service improvement board.  In the four years from 2015 to 2019, nothing has been done in terms of dual diagnosis.  In regard to the Kiwi model, the New Zealand Government established an inquiry into dual diagnosis, in respect of which six panel members surveyed people about what was needed.  Following this, they produced a report and the Government accepted the majority of the recommendations made and agreed with the budget allocations.  All of this was completed in 15 months.  Are we plodding along here?  I have only been a Member for a short time but my background has been in the mental health area for the past 15 or 16 years.  It is like Groundhog Day in terms of what is being said and promised, including in regard to recruitment and retention.  I have raised in the House with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste the issue of nurses being trained but not being given a contract by the HSE.  We are shovelling snow while it is still snowing.  Why are we engaging locums and agency staff at huge expense rather than giving nurses contracts?</p> <p>  There are 700 vacancies within the mental health services.  We are training people in mental health but we are not employing them.  This does not make sense.  A Vision for Change was produced almost 14 years ago and the review of it took almost as long.  The Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care also carried out a review of mental health services.  Yet, we have not moved forward.  There is much talk of a worldwide crisis in terms of mental health.  Why is there no plan in place to train, recruit and retain mental health services staff?  In the past ten years, only 68 posts in the mental health services have been filled.  We face 500 possible vacancies within the next two to three years owing to retirements, which will mean a massive shortage of staff.  Capacity was mentioned.  We will not be able to do it.  In a reply to a parliamentary question, I learned that we have a &euro;19 million underspend on recruitment in the mental health budget.  This is ludicrous.</p> <p>  My cousin recently emigrated to the UK because she was not offered a contract here.  Many of our emigrants would have liked to have remained in Ireland.  They want to work here and to pay their tax in Ireland, where they can remain close to their families.  There is no positive news for them.  This is not a personal attack on the witnesses.  I need to put my views on the record in order that their managers will be made aware of the lack of drive in terms of recruitment.  It seems to be a tick-box exercise.  We have all heard about fake news.  We do not need to go the USA or the UK for it.  We sometimes have it in committees.  An additional allocation of &euro;55 million was not provided last year to the mental health service.  The HSE report launched in the audiovisual room showed a &euro;35 million allocation.  Somebody is being spun lies.  The witnesses are trying to do their bit but they do not seem to have the proper information, which I find frustrating. I have said that to bake a cake one needs the correct ingredients.  There is no point using half the ingredients and expecting the cake to taste the same.  It will not happen.</p> <p>  Returning to my original question and following on from my remarks, do the witnesses believe they are restricted?</p><p>They have spoken about models of care changing and I accept that service demand has increased, not only in the youth sector but also in the disability sector.  There is a large ageing population and rural isolation and we are losing general practitioners.  Everything seems to be centralised in accident and emergency services and the delegates' services are being overcrowded.  We are listening to this time and again, yet nobody in the Government or at the top of the HSE is addressing it.  The Government and the HSE should sit down and state they need to come up with a plan rapidly, whatever it takes, and acknowledge that whoever is trained within the service needs to be retained.  Staff are retained by offering them a contract.  I cannot understand what is happening.</p><p> Recently I asked a parliamentary question about CAMHS.  I will put it to the delegates.  Are they genuinely satisfied or dissatisfied with the direction CAMHS is taking?  There is misinformation circulated on it.  The delegates spoke about members of CAMHS teams.  Let us say a premier league of ten teams was set up and each had 11 staff.  We would not be able to run the league at present because team A has 11 staff, team B has five and team C has nine.  Therefore, it would not work in the system.</p><p> The demographic issues are known about.  Cork is a black spot and there are many others.  I will use Cork as an example because I am from there.  The demographic data imply that the rate of suicide and self-harm is high.  Let us have a pilot project and resource and staff it fully, thus facilitating all those concerned because they all have to work as a team and start to reduce the figures, thus showing that this model works.  When one invests in a model that works, it can be replicated throughout the country, thus improving everything.  At present, however, the strategy is to try to do everything together, with no plan A.  Plan A has been shelved for the past four years and is to be transferred to somebody else's department to talk about it.  In the meantime, we are losing nurses and people to suicide, unfortunately.  The information we have shows that there are 76 beds and that 23 or 27 were vacant in July.  I received that information in the response to a parliamentary question.  While the number of beds has increased, the number is only at 75% of the level recommended in A Vision for Change 13 years ago.  In reality, if one removes the 23 beds, or the 27, we are only at a rate of 50% under the CAMHS plan.  If one stops putting out all of these figures, it makes no difference to those who are trying to gain access to the service.  It is a matter of access, as I know from experience.</p><p> I was late yesterday because I had to meet an individual in my office about a crisis case during the so-called break.  Four times I had to have a young man arrested for his own safety.  I will give credit where credit is due in that when I contacted the crisis team in Cork, its response was above and beyond the call of duty and absolutely brilliant.  However, it is just one section.</p><p> I need an honest answer that management and the Government can hear to the question of what the delegates genuinely believe, 13 years on and having had a children's committee, a health committee, a committee on the future of mental health care and the Sl&aacute;intecare report which in fairness was produced in very short time.  CAMHS is only at a figure of 50% of what is needed.  There are 700 vacancies in the mental health service and we face losing another 500 staff in the next two to three years.  There is under-expenditure of &euro;19 million on recruitment because we cannot pay, yet we have money available.  There is misinformation every year.  The original figure was &euro;84 million, of which some &euro;29 million was spent the year before.  There was a total of &euro;55 million and the HSE's report refers to &euro;35 million.  We are trying to do our best, yet we are back again to phase 1.  What is planned for next year?  That is my spiel.  I am not saying this to pick on the delegates, but I need their management and top brass to ask the Government to stop trying to fix everything in one go and try to proceed properly, giving each service the maximum resources, be they for Linn Dara, &Eacute;ist Linn or the Jigsaw project in Galway.  Squashy Couch was in Galway when I started 12 or 14 years ago.  Do the delegates believe services are under-resourced?  Is the plan plodding along?  Is there genuine drive, bearing in mind that in New Zealand something could be done in 15 months?  It came up with a ten-point plan.  There is a video which shows what is being done in New Zealand.  It is patient centred.</p><p> I am here three and a half years.  I am sitting in front of some of the same delegates hearing the same thing time and again.  We flagged the issue of recruitment three years ago.  If the nurses who were trained in the past three years had been retained, we could have 400 vacancies in the mental health service, rather than 700.  There have been 700 vacancies for the past three and a half years and nothing has happened.  As an old lady said to me one time, it is like a penance where one gets a bucket with no arse in it and is told to empty the Red Sea with it.  One will have a bucket, but one will not be able to do anything with it.  We seem to have budgets and nothing seems to be done with them.  </p><p> What is happening is being misconstrued.  This is not to reflect on the delegates.  They will take responsibility, but it is their managers with whom I want to deal.  I would love to sit down with them to ask them to tell us the truth and whether mistakes are being made.  There are mistakes being made, but this is not the platform for addressing them.  It will emerge that there are many parts of the mental health service that are not fit for purpose.  Deputy Sherlock touched on this issue.  Staff are not being disciplined for X, Y and Z, but that is a different story.  My priority is to implement a preventive measure.  There does not seem to be any joined-up thinking.  There is misinformation and we are hearing the same stories.  We are hearing them today and will do so again tomorrow.  We are told that services are short a few bob.  If the delegates outline their position in black and white, we will tell the Government on their behalf.  I have no doubt that they would not be in their current positions if they were not passionate about their work.  They want to make changes, but they cannot be managers of football teams if there are six on one team and 11 on the next.  This puts one team at a disadvantage straightaway.  If the disadvantaged team does not receive funding, it will be relegated.  Once it is gone, it is gone.  It feels the same with mental health services.  Even with the best will in the world and everything that takes place, there is no access and people are being turned away.  The services are oversubscribed and understaffed and those who require them are told by the staff that they are sorry.  This is not a reflection on the delegates.  The front-line staff do their best, but my point is that this should go back to head management.  The Minister for Health, the Minister of State responsible for mental health services and all of the others should be told the truth, even by text, and that the time for talking is long gone.  There is now a different class of politicians who actually give a damn.  We are not talking about statistics and percentages but people.  The delegates are saying - we have heard from other delegates - that when one person dies, 42 to 45 others are affected directly, fluttering out to 220 odd people.  That could be a rural community devastated in just one go and it is happening every day.  The WHO's report states somebody dies by or contemplates suicide every 40 seconds in the world.  There is a crisis and something is going wrong.  Do the delegates genuinely believe we have moved forward in the past ten years?</p></speech>

Where is the evidence for this?  There were six beds in 2006 for CAMHS and now we have 74.  I accept that there are only 48 open.</p><p>We have 70 teams.  While I could trot out any of those statistics, it is much more about how much the way we look at mental health has changed in the past 15 years.  We now have a regulator in charge in the Mental Health Commission; we have the Mental Health Act that was implemented in 2006 and reviewed in 2011, and we have A Vision for Change, a policy document that is recognised as one of the most far-seeing in the western world.  There are a lot of basic building blocks, but the mental health service was at a very low ebb.  Anyone who saw the television programme "Behind the Walls" will have seen what was happening in this country.  While things have changed dramatically, we are obviously still on a journey.  I am in contact with people elsewhere in Europe who look at what we are doing with service users and cannot believe it.  We have a service user on my management team whose sole responsibility is to represent the role and views of service users at national level.  No other division has this.  We have nine area leads for mental health who are service users, carers and family members.  No other division has this.  We have forums and peer support workers, while a lot of the things which are needed from a carer's perspective or the point of view of recovery are in place.</p><p> On the issues raised by the Deputy, I will try to give some context on the figure of &euro;55 million.  Last year there was a figure of &euro;35 million.  One will receive &euro;15 million of it in the year and &euro;20 million the following year.  That is the reason the figure of &euro;55 million can be confusing at times.  I assure the Deputy that it confuses me at times too because I am saying "I thought we got this."  The other figure is &euro;89 million which ones gets when one adds items like consultant back pay and annual increases.  It is not money that is going into a service.  The sum of &euro;35 million is to go into the service.  I told Deputy Neville that all of that money was spent on mental health services.  I acknowlege that it may not all be spent in the areas for which it was given.</p><p> Issues were raised about nursing contracts.  In virtually every area of the country there are nursing deficits.  We have a process whereby if someone leaves, the head of area informs me and it goes to the national director to be signed off on.  If a nurse leaves, we have never prevented that nurse from being replaced.  We try to provide contracts for nurses who are graduating.  We will have an extra 60 graduating in 2020 with mental health service money that we have spent, not education money.  That gives a figure of 350 which will go up to 420 in the following year.  We hope it will address some of the gaps.  I am conscious that we have new developments every year and we try to fill them.  They can sometimes create gaps in the services in which they arise.  It is a churn and can be a question of catch-up, but I assure the committee that that is the rationale behind the figure of &euro;55 million.  I am involved with the Central Mental Hospital and we are offering permanent contracts to graduates as we will need them to open the new hospital in 2020.  If a person wants a nursing contract, he or she will get one.</p><p> Our difficulty at times is with allied health professionals, AHPs.  When we try to balance our budget and activities, we have to be cognisant of the resources allocated to us.  While the Deputy is right about it being above my pay grade, it is to be open about it.  I have to be straight and say each year we advocate on behalf of mental health services.  We put together a business case for additional funding which has been allocated.  At times, we have struggled to spend the money in the areas for which it has been allocated.  Dual diagnosis is one such area, while early intervention, psychosis, perinatal, mental health and intellectual disability are other niche areas where it can be difficult at times to recruit specialist staff.  Sometimes the staff who take on those posts come from our core services, which means that a deficit is created back at base.  It becomes one of the circular difficulties.</p><p> There are a lot of things about which we do not talk in circumstances like this and it can become demoralising for people who work within the system because they hear a great deal of negativity.  However, when we speaks to many service users, they will tell us that things are improving.  While, as Deputy Lisa Chambers said, facilities nationally are still not as good as they should be, we have made some progress.  In order to keep going one must believe things are improving.  For example, over &euro;10 million has been invested with our NGO colleagues in Jigsaw each year from HSE funds.  We do not make a big deal out of it because that is how it is, but sometimes people say we are not doing anything.  The fact is we fund organisations without having our name hugely up in lights.  People can then become confused, but they do not need to.  It is about delivering the service.  It may be our service on which we are working with our partners, but it does not matter as long as people benefit from it.</p></speech>

If Jigsaw has one message for the committee, it is about early intervention.  As Mr. Ryan said, ten years ago there was no such thing as early intervention use of the mental health service.  As such, we have come a long way.  I will not borrow the old phrase about-----</p></speech>

I respect the delegates' honesty which is what I want as I need people outside the realm to know that they are not being fully supported either.  They want to do it.  The Chairman will laugh and my wife will kill me for using this line, but "prevention is better than cure".  We are a reactive society and have to change to become a preventive one.  That is why I acknowledge all the work being done by the delegates.  I asked the specific question in order that the delegates could make an appeal for more to do what they have set out to do.</p></speech>

The discussion and questions have been reflective of the focus we, as a nation, have had on the more acute end of the spectrum which is important and needs to be resourced.  As has come though in the discussion, acute services are overstretched.  As a nation, we need to move our thinking and resourcing upstream.  That is the key message Jigsaw has.  I am always loath to make parallels with physical health because mental health is different and there are complexities to it.  However, as a country, we would not countenance a system which did not have a comprehensive primary care structure for physical health.  We would not countenance a system that did not have a vaccination programme across the board.  While we have made lots of progress and are delighted to have Jigsaw services with HSE support, for which we are very grateful, we are only operating in 13 communities.  We want to operate across the board.  We need to do more than just offer the services we now offer.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether the systrem was under-resourced.  As was pointed out, the mental health service remains the poor relation in the overall health budget.  While the early intervention service is coming along, it is still the poor relation in the overall mental health budget.  The figure referred to of approximately 33% of young people could seem to be overwhelming.  One might wonder how we would ever meet the needs of those young people.  However, we know from our work in Jigsaw that many of them will never need to attend a specialist service if we put adopt a comprehensive prevention and early intervention approach.  Some of it can be online and some of it can be in their own community.  They might never need to cross the door at Jigsaw if we were to empower and equipp parents, teachers, sports coaches and scout leaders, for example.  Some people will I hope have their needs met through online supports, with information and guidance, group chat and one-to-one services.  While some will need to come through Jigsaw's doors and some will obviously need specialist services, the key message is about getting in as early as possible.  If we have a comprehensive approach to early intervention, it will best support the overstreteched acute end of the system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.392" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019092500002#Q00500"><p>As clinical director of services for over 13 years, I can speak about what is happening on the ground.  On the one hand, one looks at the positives.  We have invested in a new purpose-built community service based in Cherry Orchard.  In that building we officially launched last month our specialist community eating disorder service.  It was the first such team and a second is to start in Cork as part of the clinical programme for eating disorders.  We have established a specific ADHD pathway team within our service.  In the west Wicklow-Kildare area we cover the service has four teams, where once there was one and we hope to develop a fifth.  We had an inpatient unit in 2006 with six operational beds.</p><p>In 2015, we opened our brand new bespoke inpatient unit, which has won architectural design awards.  Visitors from abroad have been very impressed by it.  What means more to me is the feedback from young people and families.  The Deputy has visited the unit, and seen that it is all single en suite bedrooms.  We have a sports hall and a gym, attached school and parent accommodation.  All of these are important.</p><p> They are the positives.  The frustrations, however, are that our teams are not at the full complement.  Some teams have the complement of disciplines but not the numbers.  Other teams are not at the full multidisciplinary complement.  Some of this is due to lack of funding for new posts, some to staff going on maternity leave or leaving to take up posts elsewhere, and to delays in refilling an approved post when somebody leaves.  There can be a significant gap.  It is frustrating that we cannot provide the right level of service.  There are much pride in the progress that has been made and frustration that we cannot deliver the service.  Families are very appreciative of the service but it is important for that response to be timely.  </p><p> On the inpatient side, we strive for maximum capacity in our unit.  The way it has been designed has facilitated our capacity.  Since we opened, we have averaged 80% to 90% occupancy but there have been times when we have not reached that level.  That may have been for case mix reasons.  At one point we had to close half of the unit because of staff shortages and we are running with significant vacancies within the inpatient setting.  We require additional funding to fund new posts to build the teams up to the recommended level.  The other frustration is that we are running vacancies where the issue is not funding but difficulty recruiting particular specialties.</p><p> We are involved in the planning of the inpatient unit in the new children's hospital, which will be under our governance.  It will have an eight-bed specialist eating disorder unit and a 12-bed unit.  That is another 20 beds.  Ten beds will come on-stream in a low secure adolescent unit which is part of the redevelopment of the national forensic services.  We are compromised because we do not have access to a low secure facility for those who have a high level of acuity and need that kind of environment for their care.  If we have to manage such young people in open hour units, that will affect our ability to leverage services for others.  The frustration on the ground is that, although there has been progress, it has not been at the level or speed we would like.  Some of that is a funding issue, some not.  Some time ago we were apologising to families for the facility; now we are proud of showing them the unit and the physical environment.  The environment, however, is only one part.  We need the staff to deliver the service.  We need all those levels.  Staff also feel the frustration at not being able to provide the level of service that we would wish to.</p></speech>

Our discussion will build on previous engagements and the committee's valuable report on the subject.  The Department, along with the HSE and the HPRA, last appeared before the committee on 30 January to update it on the preparedness of the health sector for Brexit.  Much has happened in the intervening period, including two extensions to the withdrawal date and the election of a new British Prime Minister.  The committee's invitation is timely, therefore, as we finalise our preparations for the likely possibility of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 October.  No less, I am sure, than committee members, many of us have developed a nightly addiction to the BBC's "Newsnight" and its fascinating dissection of daily Brexit developments in London.  I assure the committee, however, that irrespective of such developments, preparations of the Irish health sector for Brexit have been under way for two years and we are working assiduously to undertake as much further preparation as possible in whatever period remains.</p> <p>  Brexit preparation continues to be a priority for the Department and key health agencies, and significant further work has been undertaken since we last met.  When we last discussed the subject, I stated that Brexit preparation is an exercise in damage limitation for Ireland, generally, and the health sector, specifically.  Had we a choice, all of us would much prefer to devote our intensive efforts to addressing the many positive opportunities that exist to improve the health of our population.  Nevertheless, while we all hope negotiations will be successful in resolving the threat of a no-deal Brexit, we must continue to work with industry and other stakeholders to protect public health against every eventuality.  This year, we have committed more than &euro;10 million in funding to health sector Brexit preparations.  If Brexit proceeds on a no-deal basis on 31 October, it will be necessary to incur further costs this year and on an ongoing basis.  We could do much with the money to improve the health service but instead must use the resources to mitigate any potential Brexit impact on population health.</p> <p>  Brexit is not a temporary or once-off adverse event.  It represents permanent change to many aspects of daily life, encompassing how we trade, import and regulate goods and services, including health related products.  Previously, I outlined to the committee the structures we use for that preparation and they remain in operation.  In summary, there is a heads-of-agency group, where I meet the CEOs of the HSE, the HPRA and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, weekly to review progress on Brexit preparedness and to consider any new issues arising.</p><p> The Brexit operations team, which is chaired by a deputy secretary general in the Department, is comprised of senior officials from the Department and its agencies, and meets weekly.  It works to resolve issues and to escalate them to the heads of agencies group, if necessary.  The operations team has a number of groups active in addressing particular issues.  Two multi-agency expert groups are working to verify the assurances and contingency planning in place in respect of the supply of medicines and medical devices, respectively.  These groups, which include clinical expertise, are working with suppliers to assess the vulnerability of products to supply disruption as a result of Brexit and making further preparations to ensure continuity of care for patients.</p><p> A communications group, chaired by the Department, is leading communications with relevant stakeholders and, as part of Government's overall communications strategy, with the public.</p><p> As I stated at my last appearance before this committee, our greatest protection against Brexit is our membership of the EU.  The Department and the HPRA continue to work very closely with the Commission and with other member states to mitigate the worst effects of Brexit and will continue to do so.</p><p> The additional time granted by the extension to a possible Brexit on 31 October has been used to deepen our preparedness.  We have reached out to all parts of the health sector, including industry and suppliers, patients and healthcare professionals, to understand the challenges they face and to work together to resolve them.  I acknowledge the co-operation we have received across the sector in this work.  We will provide detailed information to the committee on this work throughout this session with a particular focus on the areas the committee has requested in terms of the supply of medicines and the movement of health professionals between Ireland and the UK.  In this work, our overriding concern is to ensure the protection of public health, the continuity in the provision of health services and the maintenance of existing services.</p><p> Our membership of the common travel area, CTA, with the UK also provides certainty to Irish and British citizens resident in the other jurisdiction in relation to access to healthcare.  The Irish and British Governments have committed to the shared objective of maintaining the CTA arrangements, which have long facilitated Irish and UK residents in accessing health services in each other's jurisdictions.</p><p> Provision has been made to ensure the arrangements necessary to maintain health service co-operation after Brexit.  Part 2 of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019 will underpin continuity in the provision of healthcare in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  This will see the maintenance of current arrangements for access to routine, planned and emergency health services for UK and Irish residents and visitors in the other jurisdiction.  It also includes North-South and east-west health co-operation on access to specialist health services in the other jurisdiction.</p><p> In relation to North-South health co-operation, we are committed to protecting the many areas of co-operation in which the health sector has engaged on a cross-Border basis.  These well-established and widely supported arrangements make life easier for people living along the Border and allow for the best use of resources for both health systems.  Examples include: cancer care at Altnagelvin Hospital, paediatric cardiology services in Crumlin, and cross-Border ambulance services.</p><p> The Department has been in regular contact with the Department of Health in Northern Ireland in respect of the commitment of both Governments to ensure the continuation of North-South health service co-operation.  These contacts build on many years of positive co-operation.  In all of our preparations, we have been able to build upon this very strong spirit of collaboration in the interests of patient care, at clinical, hospital, administrative and political levels.  The HSE has been tasked with addressing GDPR and any other issues arising at operational level with its counterparts.  In fact, the Northern Ireland Department of Health officials are due to visit the Department for a further meeting in early October.  I can say with confidence that all existing North-South health co-operation, including arrangements with Northern Ireland health service providers, will continue.</p><p> Safeguarding the supply of medicines and ensuring continuity of care for Irish patients is of utmost importance.  The EU has a sophisticated regulatory framework for medicines and medical devices and detailed preparations are in place across industry and regulators as the UK leaves this system.  Dr. Lorraine Nolan, from the HPRA, will outline this in more detail.  Ireland is at the end of a very sophisticated supply chain when it comes to the importation of medicine and medical devices.  My colleagues from the HPRA and the HSE will provide detailed updates on the current position and contingency plans in relation to supply security.  We are working closely with the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries to modify supply arrangements and minimise potential disruption.</p><p> Ireland is unlikely to face general medicine shortages in the period immediately after 31 October.  Any emerging supply issues will, in the first instance, be dealt with from existing supplies held within the domestic distribution chain.  This supply chain is different to that of some other markets, including the UK.  It is important to reiterate: there are already additional stocks of medicines routinely built into the Irish medicine supply chain; this is different to the wholesaling model which operates in the UK; the pharmaceutical industry and wholesalers have provided direct assurances that they are confident that they will have sufficient stocks to bridge any initial issues at ports, should they occur; and there is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions, as doing so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients.  Patients should continue to fill their prescriptions in the normal way.</p><p> As I have said, strong general assurances have been received from industry but an expert group is also examining categories of medicine where it is deemed especially important to work directly with suppliers to verify that robust contingencies are in place.  Unfortunately, medicine shortages arise from time to time and are a feature of health systems around the world.  Ireland has an existing multi-stakeholder medicine shortages framework in place, co-ordinated by the HPRA, to help prevent shortages from occurring and to reduce the impact on patients and healthcare professionals by co-ordinating the management of potential or actual shortages as they arise.  The health system is, therefore, well placed to deal with any additional shortages as a consequence of Brexit, should they occur.</p><p> Brexit is likely to herald changes in our medicines market as we will be less integrated with the larger UK market.  Therefore, our focus on this issue will continue well past any Brexit date and into the medium term.  Work on the medicines shortages framework and the involvement of clinicians in contingency planning give us an enhanced capacity to respond to any such market developments and, for example, mean that should particular products no longer be available, expert clinicians in the respective medical specialties concerned will have identified equally effective alternatives.</p><p> The committee asked about the recognition of healthcare qualifications.  The Department of Education and Skills has co-ordinated work across Government to ensure that, as far as possible, arrangements will be in place to maintain recognition of UK professional qualifications.  The importance of this work as part of affirming the right to work under the common travel agreement was acknowledged in the memorandum of understanding signed by both Governments.</p><p> At the outset, it is important to say that decisions on qualification recognition that have already been made under EU directives will remain valid and existing recognised health professionals will be able to continue to practice in either jurisdiction, subject to compliance with all regulations within that profession.  In respect of new recognitions, the recognition of qualifications in the EEA is carried out through the implementation of an EU directive.  The directive also provides a mechanism for the exchange of information on professional misconduct as well.  It applies to all regulated professions &ndash; not only those in the health area.</p><p> When the UK leaves the EU, either after the transition period - if it occurs - or on the withdrawal date, UK qualifications and the qualifications of UK nationals will no longer fall within the scope of the directive.  Instead, Irish health professional regulators have "third country" recognition routes, which apply to qualifications which are obtained outside the EEA or which are held by non-EEA nationals.  The regulators have considered these "third country" recognition routes with the objective of ensuring efficient routes for recognition of UK qualifications, while ensuring that this is done in an objective and non-discriminatory way.</p><p> The Irish health professional regulators are satisfied that they can continue to recognise UK qualifications within approximately the same timeframes and the same level of application fee as applies currently, but now under this different legal base.  Similarly, the UK has preparations in place in respect of the recognition of health and social care professions, which will enable Irish qualifications to be recognised in the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p> Irish regulatory bodies have also been linking with their UK counterparts to develop protocols for transferring personal data in accordance with the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  Transfers of personal data by the Irish regulators to their UK counterparts may be required in the processing of recognition applications or in the conveyance of disciplinary information.</p><p> As part of the whole-of-Government preparations, the Department has worked in close partnership with the FSAI, the HSE, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the issue of food safety in the context of the UK's departure.  Enhanced staffing and procedures will be in place at the ports to facilitate inspections.  In order to avoid unnecessary delays, it will also be vital that industry prepares as fully as possible and significant outreach has been undertaken with industry.  Businesses will need to familiarise themselves fully with all relevant customs procedures and ensure that all necessary documentation is properly completed and submitted in advance.</p><p> We have engaged extensively with suppliers both in their industry groupings and on an individual company basis on their individual products.  We have stressed to them the importance of providing early information on any emerging issue.  For our part, we have assured them that we are in problem solving mode.  We are focused on pre-empting or solving problems using pragmatic solutions.  We will be there to troubleshoot on industry issues that arise in the days and weeks following Brexit. </p><p> I am satisfied that the health sector is working well in preparing for Brexit.  We are linking with central government to ensure all cross-sectoral issues will be identified and resolved.  We are working with industry, including the pharmaceutical, med-tech and food sectors and private health service providers, as appropriate, to ensure the health sector, our employees and citizens will be well prepared and protected as far as possible from the adverse effects of Brexit.  I look forward to our discussion.</p></speech>

As the committee has been advised, an HSE Brexit planning group has been in place since 2017 and working closely with the Department of Health and other stakeholders on a range of Brexit contingency planning and mitigating actions.  The focus of this work has been on the implications of Brexit across the following key work streams: continuity of patient and client health services; cross-border and frontier arrangements; emergency health services, including, as Mr. Breslin mentioned, the National Ambulance Service; public health matters; environmental health services at ports; workforce issues and recognition of qualifications; continuity of supply of goods and services and associated procurement arrangements; GDPR compliance; and communications.</p> <p>  On continuity of patient and client health services, the focus of the mitigation measures is on ensuring updated service level agreements and memorandums of understanding will be in place in specific areas of healthcare such as paediatric organ transplants.  </p> <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s EU and North-South unit is working to ensure services currently available to people living on both sides of the Border will continue to be available post-Brexit.  These services include cardiology and radiotherapy services at Altnagelvin hospital, and, as Mr. Breslin mentioned, the specialist cardiac services provided on an all-Island basis for children at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  A detailed mapping exercise has taken place between the two jurisdictions and produced an agreed list of all services being provided.  In addition, the signature of the memorandum of understanding in May on the common travel area has been very helpful in underpinning services in that regard on an ongoing basis. </p> <p>  On emergency services, the national ambulance services here and in Northern Ireland have updated two key memorandums of understanding between the respective services, first, the understanding of understanding on the provision of assistance in the management and resourcing of emergency and urgent calls and, second, the memorandum of understanding on mutual aid in a declared major incident which joins both jurisdictions in response to a major emergency. </p> <p>  The HSE's environmental health service is engaged in ongoing discussions with the Departments of Health and Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the import and export of foodstuffs and the possible divergence of food regulations and controls.  Significant additional resources have been put in place to strengthen the capacity of the environmental health officer service in that regard, with nearly 100 additional personnel recruited.  At Dublin Port and Rosslare Port work is nearing finalisation with the Office of Public Works on new accommodation facilities for new and existing staff.  That accommodation will be completed before the end of October.  Training for new and reassigned staff has been brought forward. </p> <p>  The workforce implications of Brexit have been examined by the HSE's human resources department and the regulators have confirmed that no delays or additional costs related to UK qualifications are expected post-Brexit.  There is also no significant risk envisaged in the supply of UK qualified health professionals.   </p> <p>  On the provision of goods and services such as medical and surgical supplies and medicines, a particular risk for the HSE arises in the supply of medical devices.  A number of suppliers have confirmed that the transfer of certification files from UK notified bodies is not yet complete and that, given the lack of capacity within the EU 27, it will not be able to be completed by 31 October or for some time afterwards.  The number of medical devices in respect of which there will be regulatory issues is significant and represents a particular risk in maintaining continuity of service from early 2020 in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  To address this issue, we are taking in additional stock in these vulnerable product lines and looking for alternatives that do not have certification issues.  In addition, we have supplied the Department of Health with examples of particular devices affected in order that the matter can be considered in seeking an appropriate derogation for a transition period. </p> <p>  A joint working group comprising the HSE, the Department of Health and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, is engaged in intensive work which involves the identification of suppliers of critical medicines to obtain assurances on their continued intention and capacity to supply the Irish market post-Brexit.  Assurances have been received from all relevant companies in that regard.  Some 6,500 medicine line items were reviewed by clinicians and pharmacists to identify vulnerable product lines.  Assurances have also been sought on existing supply routes.  While assurances have been provided, including confirmation that customs requirements have been considered, as appropriate, there remains potential for some delays and disruption to supply routes, for example, owing to delays in transiting the UK land bridge or at UK airports.  The key supply chain challenges in the short or immediate term are likely to be related to medicines with a short shelf life, those with refrigerated supply chains, compounded products and time critical logistics.  A strong focus has put on mitigating these challenges which include putting in place alternative supply arrangements, working with suppliers to increase stock in certain vulnerable areas and putting arrangements in place with Revenue colleagues to fast-track vulnerable product lines through customs. </p> <p>  On vaccines, a two to three-month stock is held in the HSE's national cold chain service which, with the stock held by companies in Ireland, gives approximately a six-month supply to ensure continuation of service delivery.  None of our vaccines is sourced from the United Kingdom. </p> <p>  On GDPR compliance, extensive work is under way to identify organisations which are hosting, accessing or processing HSE personal data within the United Kingdom.  This is to ensure completion of EU standard contractual clause agreements which will allow for the continued legal transfer of HSE personal data post-Brexit.  The HSE's ICT teams have put in place agreements with all of our main UK suppliers.  The HSE continues to notify all suppliers and service providers of their GDPR compliance requirements and expectations in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Appropriate steps are also being taken to address clinical trial compliance issues in co-operation with the HPRA. </p> <p>  We have put in place a detailed communications plan within the HSE and are working closely with the Department of Health's communications team to ensure relevant stakeholders are updated.  We have held a number of stakeholder engagements within the organisation and are keeping our website updated on a regular basis.  We are engaging with our staff and have a dedicated email address for queries or questions they may have.</p> <p>  In summary, the HSE's preparations are focused on ensuring continuity of all-island patient services, environmental health services at ports, workforce issues related to the free movement of health personnel, maintaining the supply of essential goods and services and ensuring the HSE continues to be GDPR compliant.  Notwithstanding these efforts, the risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October still has the potential to cause some disruption to health services, despite the mitigation measures in train.  Working closely with colleagues within in the Department of Health, the HPRA and wider industry, we are focused on continuing to find positive and practical solutions for patients, stakeholders and staff in that regard.  </p> <p>  That concludes my opening statement.  Together with my colleagues, I will endeavour to answer questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

I am the chief executive of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Rita Purcell, deputy chief executive, and Mr. Larry O&rsquo;Dwyer, scientific affairs manager.</p> <p>  The HPRA, as the regulator of medicines and medical devices, has been engaged in preparing for the United Kingdom&rsquo;s exit from the European Union since Article 50 was invoked.  Since the beginning of the year our preparations and engagement with stakeholders have intensified and been based on the worst case scenario associated with a disorderly Brexit. </p> <p>  At a high level, there are three major strands to our work.  Since Brexit was announced we have been working with companies to ensure they understand their obligation to be in regulatory compliance by 31 October.  We have also been working intensively and proactively with the Department of Health and the HSE on the supply of medicines deemed to be critical to patient care.  We have been assisting the HSE in its review of the supply of medical devices.</p><p>This has been supported through our work with primary wholesalers, who introduce stock to the market, to review their capacity to hold stock in the event of a disorderly Brexit.  I will speak more about those shortly.  The HPRA has detailed plans not only to address the immediacy of a hard Brexit, but also to continue with its participation as a key European regulatory agency in the aftermath of Brexit.<br/><br/>The final area of focus has been supporting the Department of Health in engaging with the many relevant stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the issues and a co-ordinated approach to interaction and communication.  In all our work to date, our aim has been to ensure, to the fullest extent possible, that the necessary preparations are completed in time so as to mitigate any potential adverse impacts on patient care.<br/><br/>I will now provide an update on specific elements of our preparations for a no-deal scenario.  The committee will be aware from its meeting on 30 January this year that the HPRA has been engaged in an extensive industry engagement exercise with the Department of Health and the HSE, focused on the supply of critical medicines.  These are medicines with a short shelf life, refrigerated supply chains, time-critical logistics or compounded for specific patients or patient groups.  However, working with the HSE, we have also been able, through this exercise, to review supply arrangements for all prescription medicines regardless of criticality.  The review involves liaising directly with hospitals, companies and distributors to identify supply routes and ensure companies have contingency plans in place if their supply routes have been from, or through, the UK.  This exercise was first conducted in quarter 1 of this year and work has been ongoing since that time.  In advance of the 31 October deadline, we are again repeating this co-ordinated outreach to companies to seek final reassurances of their supply arrangements and contingencies for 31 October in the event of a disorderly Brexit.  This work is continuing.<br/><br/>Radiopharmaceuticals, which have a short shelf life and very specialised transport and storage requirements, are one example of this work.  While some of these do not transit the UK, the majority are flown from continental Europe to Ireland via East Midlands Airport by one logistics company.  Companies which use this route have previously received assurances from their logistics provider that it will continue to operate these supply routes post Brexit.  We have been in contact with the companies which supply these products to the Irish market and they confirmed their intention and plans to continue the supply to Ireland post Brexit.  We have also requested written assurances from the logistics provider involved.  Separately, there is ongoing direct engagement with the logistics provider to ensure that its service can be relied upon and, if necessary, consider alternative solutions that may be required.  Currently, all the responses we have received indicate that all parties believe they can continue to supply the Irish market and all parties are actively considering contingency plans.  This is a good example of the complexity of the issue and the many players involved in getting product to Ireland.  In this case, as the product is intended for both Ireland and the UK, it must stop first at East Midlands Airport.  This introduces an element outside the control of all parties.  While there is no indication that this will cause a problem, it is indicative of the general position that where there are multiple independent players involved in the supply chain, it is not possible to rule out all risks.  However, the HPRA and the HSE plan to actively monitor this situation and manage it as necessary.<br/><br/>Another example is insulins, which are critical medicines for diabetic patients and need to be refrigerated during transportation and storage.  We have engaged with the three suppliers of insulins to Ireland all of which have provided assurances that they will have a minimum stock of eight to ten weeks of all insulins in Irish wholesalers on 31 October.  In addition, all have taken steps to ensure they are in a position to replenish these stocks post Brexit, including by using alternative transport routes which do not involve supply from or via the UK.<br/><br/>A key part of our Brexit planning is to ensure that there is sufficient stock in Ireland in order that temporary delays during transportation will not significantly affect access by patients to medicines.  We have contacted all the primary wholesalers which have provided assurances that they will hold between eight to ten weeks of stock for the vast majority of medicines.  This level of stockholding will allow Ireland to manage short-term disruptions to the supply of medicines.  We have also, as part of our engagement with companies supplying the market, requested that they confirm they will have sufficient stock on 31 October and can maintain these levels in the post-Brexit period by appropriate replenishment procedures.  We have also continuously stressed to companies the need to be aware of, and comply with, customs procedures and requirements and have issued individual letters, follow-up calls and a checklist to that effect.<br/><br/>For medicines where stock levels are less than that, we are actively working with the wholesale sector to address potential Brexit impacts and ensure that cases where continuity of patient care could be compromised are addressed insofar as possible.  This includes the ability, if possible, to build additional stock levels and the development of contingency arrangements to ensure a sustained process of stock replenishment.  Work in this regard is ongoing.<br/><br/>On the supply of medicines post Brexit, it needs to be recognised that some products will still either come from the UK by air or sea or, by necessity, will be transported across the UK.  The assurances received from companies are based on the continued operation of these transport routes combined with the maintenance of sufficient stocks levels in Ireland.  However, significant and prolonged delays anywhere along these routes could potentially interrupt supply to the Irish market.  While our preparations are focused on ensuring that such impacts are prevented or minimised, there are no absolute guarantees.<br/><br/>No major supply concerns for continuity of patient care have been identified to date and we have, through our shortages protocol, plans in place to address issues should they arise.  This framework predates Brexit, as medicines shortages can occur for various reasons on an ongoing basis.  I emphasise again that there is no need for hospitals, healthcare professionals or patients to order extra quantities of medicines ahead of Brexit.  To do so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients.<br/><br/>Marketing authorisations for medicines place a number of regulatory obligations on the holder.  These include that the holder must be based in the EU and that each batch of product imported from a non-EU country must be retested and released in an EU member state.  Regulatory compliance among companies has been improving steadily as affected operations have moved from the UK to an EU 27 country.  In a repeat of the exercise conducted in quarter 1 of this year, we issued a list of questions in August to those companies which potentially may not be in regulatory compliance on 31 October, or 31 December if they availed of a Commission approved temporary waiver of retesting requirements on importation into the EU.  A medicine which is non-compliant as of 31 October does not automatically present an immediate risk and we will work to ensure that regulatory issues associated with Brexit will not hinder the supply of medicines in the immediate aftermath.  We are continuing to engage with companies to ensure that they address outstanding regulatory actions in a timely manner.<br/><br/>Medical devices, unlike medicines, are not authorised by the HPRA.  Each medical device on the market requires a <i>conformit&eacute; Europ&eacute;enne</i>, CE, mark to demonstrate conformity with the regulatory framework and for medium to high risk devices a CE certificate must be issued by a notified body located in any EU member state.  The HSE, as the main procurer of medical devices for the Irish health system, has engaged in an in-depth exercise of analysing medical devices for exposure to the UK - landbridge or manufacturing - and for certification from a UK notified body.<br/><br/>The HPRA is participating in the HSE-led criticality assessment group for medical devices and is sharing information with the HSE to assist in its risk assessment of critical medical devices supplied to and used in the health services.  The HPRA has communicated with manufacturers and authorised representatives at national level a number of times to ensure appropriate awareness of the implications of a disorderly Brexit for medical devices.  We have also led on EU work with other competent authorities to promote awareness and to prevent adverse impacts on medical devices used in Ireland.  From our engagement, we know that larger manufacturers have measures in place to transition their UK medical device certificates to an EU 27 notified body, while many small and medium sized manufacturers have indicated that their main challenge is in securing an EU 27 notified body to issue new certificates.  As such, it remains the case that a significant number of UK certificates have not transitioned to an EU member state.<br/><br/>There are a number of factors contributing to this.  Historically, there has been a high dependency on UK notified bodies for medical device certification activities.  This is due to the broad ranging designation scope which the UK notified bodies have to conduct such activities and to their size.  Notified bodies throughout Europe are also preparing for new EU regulations which apply from May 2020, a factor which is impacting on their ability to take on additional certification activities.</p><p> The HSE is reviewing the impact of this on medical devices on the Irish market.  The situation is not unique to Ireland, although our market is likely to be more impacted.  The HPRA and other EU authorities are working together to develop and agree with the European Commission a European approach to manage UK certificates that have not transitioned by the deadline.</p><p> If such an approach is not agreed, the HPRA has developed contingencies to manage this.  Given that a medical device which becomes non-compliant with regulatory requirements after 31 October does not present an immediate risk, we will work to ensure continuity of care for patients while ensuring that products return to compliance as quickly as possible.</p><p> As Government public communications have recognised, any Brexit outcome that does not include regulatory alignment will mean change as the UK and Irish markets adjust over time.  Brexit will bring change across all areas and in the dynamics of the supply chain and model in Ireland for both medicines and medical devices.  The issues we see in the longer term may be quite different to those in the immediate aftermath.</p><p> It is realistic to expect that companies may after a period of time make commercial decisions with respect to the continued viability of supply of certain products to our market.  We have stressed to companies that, in advance of making any such decisions, they should let us know of their plans as soon as possible.  The earlier we have this information, the better we can plan for change, including working with HSE colleagues.  Alternatively, we may be able to help in identifying a course of action to prevent such an outcome.</p><p> In closing, I would like to assure the committee of the strenuous efforts being made by HPRA staff in relation to protecting the supply of medicines and health products to Irish patients post Brexit.  I also wish to acknowledge the considerable collective efforts of our colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE and the substantial engagement by industry and healthcare professionals.  It is this open and co-operative approach among stakeholders across the health products sector that will help to ensure we effectively and collectively manage the potential impact of Brexit on supply and availability.</p><p> We will be happy to address any questions.</p></speech>

I thank everyone for their contributions.  Apologies for missing the first few minutes here.</p><p>Before I open the debate to members of the committee, I have a number of questions of my own.  I might come back on some of them as well, if that is okay.</p><p>In her submission, Dr. Nolan stated:</p><blockquote>We have contacted all the primary wholesalers who have provided assurances that for the vast majority of medicines they will hold between eight to ten weeks of stock.  This level of stockholding will allow Ireland manage short-term disruptions.</blockquote> <p>I note &quot;the vast majority&quot;, but not all.  Is there an issue with some?  Are there some for which we do not have that necessary buffer?  Will we have that issue resolved in advance of a potential no-deal Brexit?</p></speech>

We have contacted 44 wholesalers.  Nearly 90% of all stock is held by our two primary wholesalers and they are confident.  When they say "the vast majority", they are saying, "but for a few product lines".  They are, however, giving us details of those product lines and we are working through those.  We are able to see whether there are alternatives and whether we need to take contingency action.  It is a picture that changes day by day because they have a considerable throughput of stock.</p> <p>  We are also predicting forward as to what the expected picture will be on 31 October.  Right now, what we can say is that we are working through any products that have been identified but they have not identified a significant issue of supply to the Irish market.  They believe, I would use the word "substantially", all products that are used will have that level of stock.  Should there be an issue with a product, our shortages framework would work through it.  Does Mr. O'Dwyer want to add anything to that?</p></speech>

Irrespective of Brexit, there will be ongoing shortages of medicines.  Some of the products mentioned are products that are already in short supply, in a number of cases, for global reasons such as manufacturing issues and logistics issues.  I emphasise that some of those medicines would fall into that category.</p></speech>

I note the HPRA's advice to people is not to stockpile but people rarely do exactly what they are advised.  Anecdotally, I understand that is happening, albeit on a small scale.  I wonder has Dr. Nolan information about that.  Has the HPRA encountered that at all?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.417" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lorraine Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019092500002#F00600"><p>From the intelligence we have, we do not have anything to substantiate that such is the case.  Consistently, through all our messaging on Brexit reparation, we have engaged with healthcare professionals and we really have cultivated their support in pushing that message out, particularly to patients, to ensure that they do not stockpile.  As I mentioned in my statement, it is important.  The marketplace operates on a precise dynamic and stockpiling that may occur will upset that balance.  In terms of ensuring continuity of supply, it is important that there is messaging to refrain from stockpiling.</p></speech>

I suppose the advice to them is not to upset the equilibrium and to ensure that they do not stockpile.  Human nature being what it is, however, I can foresee an issue with that.</p> <p>  I have a question on the European health insurance cards, EHICs.  A commitment was given by the Government that the EHICs would be made available to people in the North.  Can they give us an update on that?</p></speech>

We received approval at Government last week on the approach to that Bill and we will be going back shortly.  We have a priority team on it, and drafting is under way with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I would think we will be going back to Government with a full Bill before the end of the month.  At that point, we will work with the Whips to schedule time in the Oireachtas.  We will obviously make ourselves available as officials to the committee members to talk them through the approach there.  It is a priority to have that legislation brought into the Oireachtas in October.</p></speech>

I have a couple more questions but I will hold them over.</p> <p>  Is there a supply line from mainland Europe straight into Irish ports bypassing Britain?  Has that been looked at?  Is that being sourced?  Are we ready to go with that?  Can Mr. Breslin give us an update?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.421" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019092500002#F01000"><p>There are significant supply routes directly from the Continent into Ireland, with shipping companies coming into Dublin Port and shipping coming into Rosslare.  They are well-established routes.  There is capacity on those routes.</p> <p>  Something Dr. Nolan referred to was the modification of supply chains that has already taken place by pharmaceutical companies.  Some of them will, depending on the nature of the product, find it just as realistic to come directly into Ireland and will have modified their supply chain and be doing that now.  Others will be keeping it under review.  There are particular products that are not relevant to that, particularly products that are sourced from and originate in the UK.</p> <p>  There is substantial shipping capacity to come direct from the Continent.  It adds approximately 20 hours to the journey and it is an issue in terms of the product.  If one hears the discussion being held on a wider basis, there are certain perishable products - I am not talking about medicines or medical devices - where those 20 hours are a challenge.  In general, once one adds 20 hours, one is adding cost because one will need a driver for longer.  For pharmaceuticals and medical devices, which often are reasonably high-value products, that route exists.  Companies have already made the change or will consider the change in the event of Brexit fallout.</p></speech>

Has Mr. Breslin been engaging with his counterparts in the North in terms of the maintenance of that supply on the basis that there is a logic that, as a small island, we would do our best to withstand Brexit as a unit?</p></speech>

There is also the fact that much of the trade that ends up in Northern Ireland comes through Dublin Port.  We are conscious of that.  We would be working collaboratively - as we would work with authorities throughout the UK including on east-west trade - to ensure that there is smooth flow at all stages of that supply chain.</p></speech>

Would that include meetings, phone calls and a plan worked up together?</p><p>We have overall engagement with the department in Northern Ireland.  This is intensive engagement on all elements of Brexit.  Mr. O'Connor has led this interaction.  I will not say we have daily engagement but we certainly have weekly engagement with counterparts, as we do with Whitehall and the department in London.  In all of this engagement everyone is focused on health, which is the important issue, and everybody is seeking to ensure exactly what we are trying to achieve here, which is no disruption.</p></speech>

United Drug and Uniphar are our biggest wholesalers.  This does not mean they import all of the drugs.  They are part of the supply chain for those drugs and those drugs could be delivered to their warehouses by the manufacturers.  It is not that the two companies do all of the logistics.  They do the wholesaling, particularly out to community pharmacies.</p></speech>

There is a lot of public concern about the impact on drugs and devices and the messages are mixed.  In preparation for this meeting I had a quick look back.  On 20 August, the <i>British Medical Journal</i>reported a no-deal Brexit may worsen drug shortages.  On 6 September, a headline in <i>The Irish Times</i>read, &quot;Varadkar rules out food, medicine shortages under no-deal Brexit&quot;.  Unfortunately for us, on 19 September the British Brexit secretary, Steven Barclay, pointed out that two thirds of our drugs come across the UK by land and that there could be shortages in Ireland.  The next day the Government dismissed those warnings.  The<i>British Medical Journal</i>is warning, as is the Brexit secretary, but in Ireland these warnings are being dismissed as they relate to us.</p><p>We have also had statements made this morning and reported on RT&Eacute; last night that there are risks.  Specifically what was picked up was the risk to medical devices.  Casual observers and those relying on these drugs and devices hear very conflicting things from very senior sources.  Is it the case that two thirds of the drugs come across the UK land bridge?  There is a very serious risk to multiple days of disruption to that land bridge and we have no idea how long these delays could go on for.  Is it the case that two thirds of the drugs come across the land bridge?  If so, which drugs are the highest risks?  I accept the witnesses are all trying to do everything they can to mitigate the risks but, understandably, their language is hedging, which it has to and this is not a criticism.  Mr. Breslin said Ireland is unlikely to face medicine shortages in the period immediately after but it may face them.  The language is couched.  Do two thirds of the drugs come across the land bridge?  What are the risks?  Which drugs are at risk for which type of patients?  This morning, we have heard some quite stark warnings about medical devices.  Will Mr. Breslin speak to us about which medical devices these are?  Are they pacemakers?  Are they life-saving medical devices?  Are we speaking about more day to day devices such as disposable syringes?  What devices are we speaking about?  For the drugs and devices that are high risk what type of risks or impact does Mr. Breslin foresee and hope to mitigate against for patients?</p></speech>

With devices it is not primarily a supply issue, it is a regulatory issue so it is quite distinct.  Of course we are listening to what UK sources say but it is clear the UK sources are not working from the same information basis as us.  The figure of 60% originated in Ireland.  It is the figure we looked at two years ago when we started Brexit planning.  It is not just what is coming over the land bridge as it also includes what originates in the UK.  It is product with UK touch points.  They are the products we sought to protect when we set about making our preparations two years ago .  As Deputy Donnelly has heard, we have done a significant amount of work and number of exercises to guard and protect those products.  This is a figure we originated.  It is not a figure the British have come up with.  It is the universe of products on which we have been working with the industry for two years to protect them in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>  The engagement with industry on this has been at two levels.  It has been with suppliers, whereby we have sought, as regulator and the HSE as customer, reassurances that companies have undertaken the Brexit preparations they need.  I have spoken about some of the options they face in this situation, including drugs coming directly to Ireland.  All them have reassured the regulator and the HSE on their Brexit preparedness.  We heard this when we brought everybody together in a full discussion on this.  People are confident about the preparations.</p> <p>  At the start of this year we went at this from another direction.  Rather than going from top down with companies we put in place a criticality assessment exercise, whereby we looked at particular therapies-----</p></speech>

The criticality assessment exercise looked at therapeutic areas where there would be high impact if we did not have the drug.  It also looked at the vulnerability of the drug, including its relationship to the UK.  It then interrogated with the manufacturers those products to verify, and not simply be assured on, the extent of the preparations in place.  Resulting from this we have very much whittled down the type of risk we face.  Without being categoric, our biggest risk in the initial period is with regard to short shelf life drugs.  If we have disruption of a drug where we have eight to ten weeks of supply already buffered in Ireland we can replenish over that period as we go along but if we have a short shelf life drug and there is disruption in the UK it is of concern to us.  Most of the very short shelf life drugs do not come over the land bridge but some come directly from the UK to Ireland.  They are manufactured in the UK and come across the Irish Sea.  We have worked with the suppliers of these particular drugs to assess the capacity we have in the country in the first instance.  If we had no ability to-----</p></speech>

He is answering a very broad question that I am not really asking.  He is answering a question on the safety concerns.  I am specifically asking which drugs and devices would be affected.

Let us imagine that the British Prime Minister and the US President do a wonderful trade deal, which the latter astonishingly stated will quadruple trade with the UK, and let us say American beef starts landing in Belfast.  In order to protect Irish beef and impose EU standards in respect of it and  on the broad assumption that beef from the US will almost certainly not meet EU standards in a variety of ways, what will happen?  Will the State have to take action to prevent beef from crossing the Border from the Six Counties?</p></speech>

On that day, however, there will be inspections for east-west trade through the ports.  The UK will be a third country and there will be an inspection process with environmental health inspectors in ports to spot-check food products that are imported, while the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will have the same in respect of meat.  That will be in place irrespective of the fact that, on day on , the UK's regulatory standards will be equivalent.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, we are 26 working days from a <i>de facto</i>no-deal Brexit.  Foodstuffs that fall outside any recognised regulatory regime will come into Northern Ireland.  We are all agreed that nothing will be stopped at the Border and that the only place goods can be checked is when they land in Northern Ireland.  In the case of foodstuffs and drugs, both of which will no longer be under any safety or regulatory regimes we recognise, will the State have any officials present when the goods land in Northern Ireland, whether at the airports or ports?  Is there a plan for Irish officials to be present on the basis that once the goods leave the ports, nobody will check anything in the short term, particularly as there will be no checks at the Border?</p></speech>

Is there a fiscal plan with the HSE for that eventuality?  Does the Department have a plan for next year that outlines the money we assume we will have but that notes there is a good chance we will have, say, &euro;500 million or &euro;1 billion less?  Is there contingency planning for running the healthcare system in the event of having less money than we would like because of a no-deal Brexit?</p></speech>

We have made provision in that regard this year and will make further provision, which is important and will include the environmental health staff who will be required at the ports.</p> <p>  The second issue falls within the overall fiscal budgetary strategy the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has outlined.  We are all operating to a no-deal Brexit budget at this stage.  In finalising the budget for next year, it will not be done on the basis of hoping that nothing happens.  Rather, it will be finalised on a no-deal Brexit basis, and the Department and the HSE will develop their plans for next year on that basis.  We do not envisage they will require to be adjusted in the event of no deal.</p></speech>

If there is a no-deal Brexit, the UK will not be governed by the GDPR.  There is quite an active exchange of patient information, whether for the treatment abroad scheme or various others, particularly between the North and South.  Given that the UK will be outside the GDPR regime and that we have a statutory responsibility to protect the data of our citizens here, what are the implications of that?  For example, if somebody travels to Northern Ireland for a cataract operation, as happens frequently enough, are there any GDPR implications?</p></speech>

All our regulators have been in contact with UK regulators, while all service providers have been in contact with their counterparts North, South, east and west to inform them of their obligations to interface with the EU where the GDPR applies.  We have supported in practical ways our agencies and service providers to do what I outlined.  Standard contractual clauses will need to be put in place to ensure that the information in respect of a patient in Altnagelvin Area Hospital, for example, will be treated with the safety, security and confidentiality that is expected in the EU.  The matter has constituted an awful lot of the work in recent years.  When one compares our preparedness now with that in March, we are now much more comprehensively ready.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connor stated that all the stakeholders are engaging with their counterparts in Britain on the sharing of information.  Is it his expectation that such people will have local level agreements between themselves in respect of how the data are managed?  For example, if the headquarters of a 32-county organisation are in Dublin, it may hold information on people North and South.  Will the Department rely on such an organisation to make a local agreement?  Such an organisation would be based in both the Thirty-two Counties and the Six Counties.  Is the Department giving such organisations direction with regard to how the data will be managed?  On 1 November, potentially, some of the information such organisations hold will be governed by the GDPR while some will be governed by whatever the new rule will be.  Will such organisations be expected to devise rules and has the Department given them guidance or instructions?</p></speech>

It is the organisations' responsibility in the first instance but we have been proactive in supporting the agencies and service providers to understand how to secure the agreements.  Much like in the case of other issues, the EU has total equivalence and the exact same standards now and for the immediate future, but there is a large programme of work to ensure that the local-to-local interaction will continue.</p><p>In maintaining treatment abroad and cross-border directive services there are a lot of data exchanged to ensure reciprocation and reimbursement.  Provision is being made to develop GDPR agreements at national level.</p></speech>

For perishable, short-life products, insulin is not one of them.  It can be used after six months out of the fridge.  I assume the delegations are referring to feeds and chemotherapies.  This is a vulnerable patient cohort.  I imagine it concerns feeds for premature babies in, say, the Coombe hospital and bespoke chemotherapy bags.

Just because there is a risk does not necessarily mean that there could be a serious case of disruption of supply.

They were top of the pyramid and we engaged directly with the companies.  We have identified the suppliers to the Irish market and hospitals.  It involved going to the hospitals involved in the clinical space and understanding from where they were sourcing.  It then involved going back to the suppliers to understand on several levels if they were committed to continuing supplying to the Irish market.  Given that the United Kingdom is an island, the companies had to be asked if they had the materials to continue manufacturing the products.  The assurances we received up to the first phase in April were positive.  We repeated the exercise recently and the responses we received were extremely positive.  There has been a high level of assurances in terms of commitment and the ability to supply the Irish market.  There is a risk in moving the products from point A to point B.  The companies have been asked to consider and are putting in place contingency measures also.</p></speech>

We recently experienced a shortage of these products linked with manufacturing issues at the facility.  The medicines shortage framework kicked in at that stage.  We worked with clinicians on the ground through the hospitals network and the company involved to minimise and avoid any clinical impact on patients.  This was done through using authorised total parenteral nutrition products through the normal channels and the available compounded product capacity for patients with bespoke clinical needs.</p></speech>

That is why we can talk about no immediate issues.  Up to 15% of our volumes of cancer compounded products come from the United Kingdom.  That means that 85% originate here.  We will seek to boost that figure.  We have facilities, including in public hospitals, where over time and with other strategies we can seek to boost it.  We will also seek to husband the product to ensure it is managed as efficiently as possible.  It is all built on the interrogation of suppliers coming across the Irish Sea and the resilience of their supply chains, as well as their contingency planning.  These are our contingency plans.  They just do not operate on the basis that we hope everything will go well.  We scenario-plan them such that if three or four issues go against us, we will have a further back-up plan.</p></speech>

Are we expecting a tariff to be placed on the 15% of products coming into the country?</p><p>Are we expecting anything like that to happen?  As for the portion we cannot make ourselves, or for which we do not have a ready-made equivalent, what can be done?  Can we be held to ransom as a state in being charged exorbitant amounts for the few per cent of product we get in from the United Kingdom?</p></speech>

On other issues, we have contractual relationships and are a customer in that situation.  It is more a question of where a problem will arise that will not be of anybody's intentional making.  For example, there has been a lot of discussion about the fact that products may not be able to get through the Dover Strait, certainly within current timelines.  However, the products about which we are talking which are coming from England are not subject to being brought through the Dover Strait.  They will come via the Irish Sea.  They may be coming from Holyhead or Liverpool.  There will be other ports available too such as Pembroke, Fishguard and so on.  There is more than one route into Ireland and products that originate in the United Kingdom will not have to come through the Dover Strait.  If the issue of the Dover Strait were to persist for a significant period, supply through that route would become an issue.  The Chair has made reference to this matter.  In that situation people would look to divert and not come through the Dover Strait but instead come directly into the country.  The short shelf-life products, the particular products on which we are touching, are not subject to that risk.  While there is a risk related to the Dover Strait, it concerns other categories of product.</p> <p>  To be comprehensive, in her opening statement Dr. Nolan talked about radiopharmaceuticals.  They are a category 1 product in our critical assessment exercise.  We have investigated fully the supply chain, which is by air freight into East Midlands Airport where the UK stock of radiopharmaceuticals is taken off and from where the Irish stock transits to Ireland, again by air freight.  The detailed discussions with the logistics and supply companies on the continued resilience of that route are really important, but it is not a Dover Strait issue.  That issue does not affect that product, but, as set out in the opening statement, we have to be alive to it.</p></speech>

Everybody has said it will work and that it will need to work for the UK supply.  It is actually difficult to envisage how or why something would arise in that situation.  There is full agreement between the European Union and the United Kongdom on the issue of air transit.  It is not that somebody would do something intentionally, nor is it enough for us to say &ldquo;job done, move on.&rdquo;  Because of its impact, we have to have specific contingency arrangements in place.  We are talking to the suppliers and monitoring the position for any rapid response we would have to introduce or a fall-back position that we would have to have.  By far the most resilient and preferable route is the one being used.  Sustaining it is our key strategy.</p></speech>

There is no headroom for radiopharmaceuticals in that respect because they cannot be stored.  There are other contingencies we would explore with the companies, but there are inherent risks associated with them also.  The supply chain is necessarily &ldquo;just in time&rdquo;.  There is a very specific timeline for getting to the airport on the Continent, flying in and flying out again.  That is the situation.  It should be noted that the companies involved have contingency measures in place to deal with those issues now and that they can be employed in the shorter term.  We are looking to engage and have engaged with the suppliers, distributors and logistics companies involved in providing for higher levels of assurance.  We want to provide the utmost assurance we can in this space.  The Deputy, rightly, points out that there is a risk, but a risk does not necessarily translate to there being a problem.  It is a matter of what steps we can take to mitigate it.</p></speech>

These European systems will keep going after Brexit.  We have a very close working relationship bilaterally with our counterpart agency in the United Kingdom, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, MHRA.  We have set up a process for engagement at frequent interval.  The sharing of information on supply chain integrity will be included in that protocol.  Radiopharmaceuticals is an issue on which have had extensive discussions with our colleagues in the UK agency also.  We have also agreed to work bilaterally to support each other.  As colleagues from the Department of Health have indicated, these are products with a very short shelf-life.  The maximum they possibly have is 24 hours or less.  They have a discrete usage and are only intended for particular patient groups.  Therefore, there is no competition between two markets for them.  It is a matter of working to ensure we can keep the flow moving.  We have a commitment from their side that they will work with us to ensure this happens.</p></speech>

There has historically been a high dependene on the United Kingdom.  In May 2020 things are due to change.  Therefore, we really have only a nine-month period in which something could go wrong.  Is there a concern about new medical devices coming onto the market?  Is there anything in particular that we think we will really need that will come on-stream in the next few months?  I am asking the delegates to predict the future.  Do they see anything coming out that patients may have to do without if there is a fallow period?</p></speech>

I will then pass over to colleagues from the HSE to talk about their ongoing review and evaluation of medical devices.  </p> <p>  The Deputy is right that historically there has been a high dependence on the United Kingdom's regulatory activities, specifically certification of activities for medical devices in Europe.  That being said, there is an issue of scale and numbers that may be impacted on.  We are working very hard and have close dialogue with the European Commission on this issue and are hopeful a European solution can be achieved to have an ordered regulatory transition.  If that is not achieved, at the end of the day, from the point of view of the safety of these devices and their quality and performance, just because regulatory compliance may fall as and from 31 October, it does not necessarily present any immediate risk to patients.  In fact, from a regulatory viewpoint, given that the United Kingdom will be totally aligned up to 31 October, we have a full alliance.  We will manage that situation on a national basis in terms of regulatory compliance because we will not allow it to compromise continuity of care for patients.  To give reassurance on the regulatory process, it can be managed.  Obviously, we will have to work with the industry to ensure it is working towards achieving that compliance and to making devices compliant as soon as possible.  The position is changing as regards the regulatory basis in Europe.  That is excellent in terms of the protection of public health because the framework coming into place is to raise the standards of patient protection.  The notified body system in Europe is working through a process.  Therefore, there is a timing issue with it which will sort itself out over time.  It is unfortunate that Brexit and the introduction of the new regulatory changes have coincided, but I am confident that a European solution can be found.  </p> <p>  I will pass over to colleagues in the HSE who will speak about the assessment work that has been taking place.</p></speech>

Mr. Swords will talk through some of the detail.</p></speech>

We spoke of risk earlier.  We examined areas of risk and what might cause problems.  We looked at what was manufactured in the UK, what is distributed through the landbridge and whether there are alternatives.  There was also the matter of notifying bodies, which was the critical area that was highlighted as a red risk.  If it fell under that, we were very concerned.  We have worked with the Department and the HPRA on mitigating against those risks and seeing as we go.</p> <p>  The medical devices question is enormous.  Worldwide, there are 600,000 categories of products.  One can imagine the amount of items which fall under that.  Our area covers approximately 2 million items in 39 categories across 274 companies.  We are working quite a lot on communications.  There have been many communications with companies in conjunction with the HPRA and the Department and we also meet them face to face.  We are now at our third iteration of meetings.  Yesterday, we were with 70 companies in Galway and had a good engagement around products which we consider to be at risk because of notifying issues.  As we went through the risks, we honed down on areas.  We received assurances that the companies were aware that this was coming and that Brexit was very serious.  It took a little while for them to understand the depth and extent of the work that has to be gone through.  We pestered them with communications and we compliment them on staying with us and remaining patient with us in respect of all the questions we asked of them.  It should be noted that the response from industry and from distributors has been fantastic.  When one considers the effort made by the Department, the HPRA and ourselves in the HSE in our work every day, it can be mapped with the co-operation we have received from the manufacturers and distributors.  It has shown a great unity to ensure there will not be risks that affect patient care.  </p></speech>

One advantage that we have in Ireland is our reliance on distributors but less so on manufacturing, which is different to Europe.  We have transport issues across the seas, as has been outlined, but it is an advantage in that we have many irons in the fire and there are more areas of supply.  Nonetheless, we all rely on the transportation across the seas and how that is dealt with.  We are seeing many companies and manufacturers diverting from the UK and going around the landbridge.  We are getting strong information on how the supply chain operates.  Another distinct advantage of Brexit coming, if one wishes to call it an advantage, is that one learns a great deal about the supply chain.  We have found that the supply chain has learned a lot about itself, in that many of the distributors did not understand where their products came from but they have had to learn because of how we have probed them and how we have worked with them on this.</p> <p>  We are at the stage where we are satisfied that the distributors and manufacturers are looking at this in a very serious way and that they have found assurance on notifying bodies.  They are willing to transfer the notifying body from the UK to an EU 27 notifying body but the capacity within that is taking time, because of the pressures on it.  Deputy Donnelly asked what are the areas of risk.  Whether one wishes to call it risk or contingency planning, we are forward planning on this.  We are taking all the areas that have not confirmed that they have transferred the notifying body and we are looking at those areas in particular to see if we need additional stocks, which is a very concentrated effort, rather than saying that we should take stock and stockpile.  The Vice Chairman asked if there was evidence of stockpiling.  There absolutely is not.  We took a policy decision with the Department at an early stage not to stockpile, which is the correct thing to do.  As members are aware, stockpiling creates its own issues.  There are peaks and valleys in manufacturing, jobs can be lost and then when one returns to it, the capacity is not there.  The best supply chain is a straight line and continuity of supply, which is what we have worked on all along.</p> <p>  There is evidence of stockpiling in the UK, which is causing problems and concerns in some of the areas we are examining where the notifying bodies have not transferred or have not been confirmed to have transferred over.  Approximately 30 companies are affected by this now across 6,500 line items.  We are meeting with the companies on an ongoing basis to put the mitigating action in place.  We have taken an additional 50,000 sq. ft of storage space in Ballycoolin, purposely for the event of ring-fencing stock that will be required or that we deem to be at risk.  We are not saying that we are putting it into hospitals or into the NDC or that we are asking the companies to take extra; this is a contingency on top of the contingency.  We have approximately three weeks' stock in the hospitals - some will have four weeks and others two and a half - and seven weeks' worth of stock used across 6,000 lines in the NDC.  On top of that, the HPRA has mentioned how in the distribution of drugs in particular, there is eight to ten weeks of stock.  On average, it is about six weeks.  We are looking at buying some time for any issue that may arise because of notifying bodies and examining each of those areas.  They are across cardiology.  In the case of one particular company, we have taken in an additional four months of stock to ensure that we do not have an issue around paediatric cardiology.  I refer to ophthalmics and areas like that.  We are taking in surgical packs, which are very bulky.  We are in discussions with the 12 suppliers we have on that and in detailed discussions with the manufacturers here.  We are confident that we will be able to allay any issues which may arise in that area.  Those are the types of contingencies that we are putting in place.  We are at the final stages of going through scenarios.  We are confident that there is supply in the system, that the distributors and manufacturers are working with us and that with the Department and the support of the HPRA, we are confident that we will overcome any issues that may arise.</p></speech>

I thank our witnesses for appearing and for giving such detailed replies.  Has provision been made for sensitive and short-life products in the event of stockpiling happening elsewhere which may impact on us?  Is there sufficient refrigerated space to deal with such products to ensure continuity of supply for the Irish market?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.514" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019092500002#M00300"><p>Yes, absolutely.  One important factor in the Irish distribution chain is that it holds quite an amount of stock even on a normal basis.  Wholesalers, pharmacists and the HSE have an existing buffer and for product that needs to be refrigerated, there is a large amount of refrigeration space.  This is the norm for us.  Other markets that are just-in-time and that run with much lower levels of stock would not be able to hold at the level that we do.  Particular features of our wholesaling and distribution system mean that we have that built in.  It will be one of the things that we will call on if we run into temporary problems.</p></speech>

Those who are in the business of distribution must look at where products are coming from.  If they are sourced in the UK, that is likely to cause a problem.  To what extent has provision made for alternative sourcing from the Continent?  With regard to fluctuations in the money markets in the context of sourcing products in the UK, presumably the Department has factored in the value of sterling and the buying power of the euro, which is likely to go lower as we go deeper into the uncertainty.</p></speech>

For much of the product, we are talking about some of the largest multinational enterprises that exist.  Some of them have a manufacturing presence here but all of them have a multinational reach.  Many of them have logistics operations that would far outweigh anything that the Department of Health, the HSE or HPRA has.  Our biggest defence in this situation is the sophistication and expertise of the industry with which we are dealing.  When we engage with them, it is clear that a considerable amount of logistical thought has gone into this issue and into the quality control systems that need to be operated.  This is not pick and lift.  This is product that has to go from manufacturer to patient under certain conditions and there is a rigour in the industry in quality control and logistics.  The industry has been solving this problem and tell us of its progress over the course of our Brexit preparations.  It has been giving us good reassurance throughout the process.</p> <p>  On sterling, it might help Deputy Donnelly's point around how far a euro or dollar will get next year-----</p></speech>

Ideally the island of Ireland would apply the Single Market and customs union rules.  This is particularly important with regard to food supplies.  Has the Department been in contact with distributors, including importers and exporters?  Northern Ireland suppliers and distributors have a vested interest in ensuring the highest possible standards are applicable on the island of Ireland.  That is in their interests.  If one talks to Ulster farmers in Northern Ireland, for example, they will very quickly tell one that they are inextricably linked with the South and with the EU in the context of standards.</p> <p>  This leads me to a question on ports and airports.  To what extent has the Department been in touch with port and airport authorities and their customs units with a view to ensuring that the dumping of products from lower standard economies does not happen via the North of Ireland?  The standards that apply here must also apply in the North.  Has the Department been in touch with them?</p></speech>

The Northern Ireland relationship is between the FSAI and its counterpart in Northern Ireland.  A strong mission is shared between them in respect of food safety standards.</p> <p>  On the question of ports and airports, and particularly the ports, an inter-agency approach is being taken.  The Departments of Health and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the HSE, the FSAI and the customs division of the Revenue Commissioners are working together.  The logistical planning of the operation of the ports is being led by the Revenue Commissioners.  We have built into our operations the staffing capacity to scale up our existing inspection processes in the ports.  It is important to say that third-country products, including product coming into Dublin Port from all over the world, are currently subject to food controls and inspection on a risk rated basis.  That would apply to east-west trade if the UK leaves and we will have the personnel in place to upscale the inspection capacity without impacting the flow through the port, as and from the date that the UK leaves if it does so without an agreement.</p></speech>

The methodology for Dublin Port, for example, is that the documentation will be lodged by the importer in advance of the product getting onto the ferry in Holyhead, let us say.  The importer will have lodged the documentation and it will be assessed, including in respect of food items, as to whether the cargo is risk rated for inspection.  The Revenue Commissioners will send a message to the haulier on the ferry that he or she will have to go to an inspection point to be inspected.  The inspection might be conducted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine staff if the product is meat, for example, or by customs officers if they have an interest in the cargo or by HSE environmental health staff in respect of certain food items.</p></speech>

Currently, product from third countries is risk rated and we will be doing the same in this situation.  Depending on the category of food involved, we will determine the risk attaching to it and will inspect on that basis.  Much of the &euro;10 million to which I referred has been invested in the environmental health service so that it has additional staffing.  We will have inspections in place from day one.  We will have to review that and build on it over the period ahead.</p></speech>

The quantities involved my be small but such supplies are important nonetheless.  I refer to products coming from a number of sources, including through the UK.</p><p>Is it possible to alter the source of supply in all cases, particularly where a serious health risk might arise?

We have worked with the Revenue Commissioners.  Where we are trying to fast-track products through a port because of their sensitive nature, we have an advance-notice arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners so their inspections or delays on their end will not apply.  More generally, as we have explored, in many situations we do not have single-supplier products.  In many circumstances, as in the context of therapeutics, different types of products can be used, depending on availability.  We currently manage this.  Where a shortage arises in respect of a particular proprietary product, we consider alternatives or different sourcing mechanisms.  We also have the ability within our system to make sure that whatever product we do hold in Ireland is used in the most effective way possible.  The HPRA will have experience of our running into a supply shortage for a period, although not of circumstances in which we do not have any product.  The important point is that all the product be available, and available for the most effective use.  It is important not to have products not being used.</p></speech>

If we have eight to ten weeks of stock, it is important that the industry not wait until the final week to replenish it but instead do so on an ongoing basis.  We have discussed this with the industry.  Even where there are delays of a number of days &ndash; for example, on the route between Dover and Calais &ndash; we would still get product through over the period of eight to ten weeks.  The important point is that everybody work to the worst-case scenario, anticipate any issues that arise and replenish as they go rather than wait until a problem arises.</p></speech>

I can ask my colleagues to talk about the detail.  On foot of the legislation passed earlier this year, we have an agreement in train with the United Kingdom to facilitate using the common travel area to ensure the kind of reciprocation we currently enjoy.</p> <p>  On the treatment abroad scheme, we sent 590 patients to the United Kingdom in 2018.  We sent just 73 to European locations outside the United Kingdom.  The patients were predominantly sent to England.  Of the 590, only 37 went to Northern Ireland.  The patients generally go for specialist treatment.  We have an understanding at the highest levels that both countries are committed to continuing with the arrangement.  The HSE has individual relationships with the particular service providers that are delivering the services.  They have reinforced that in the run-up to Brexit as part of our preparations for it.</p> <p>  The Deputy will also be interested in cross-border treatment.  In 2018, 6,308 patients went to the United Kingdom on a provisional basis under the cross-border directive.  Just 420 went to locations in Europe outside the United Kingdom, with approximately half going to Poland.  Of the 6,308 patients, the majority went to Northern Ireland, for ophthalmic and orthopaedic treatment and so on.  As part of our arrangements with the United Kingdom authorities, we have signalled that we wish to continue with that, and we have provided for it in the legislation.  The authorities are happy to facilitate us in that regard.</p></speech>

In the course of his negotiations and deliberations with the various bodies he liaised with in the past 12 months or so, there would have been one or several issues about which he had some concerns and was not happy.  I am not asking him to tell me what they might be, for obvious reasons, but I am wondering whether he has put in place an alternative to deal with these issues in any given circumstances.  I can think of several scenarios and I am sure Mr. Breslin can too.  This is a very important issue from the point of view of the medical, health and food sectors in this country.</p></speech>

The original concern was that people did not believe Brexit would happen and that, while there was a lot of talk about it, something would come to the rescue.  Without being facetious, I believe some of the developments in recent months have taken from the complacency.  People have been very exercised this year in seeing Brexit as a real threat, not only to the public health sector but also to their businesses.  They have also been exercised by the need to get that sorted.</p> <p>  In the final preparations, particularly where there will be significant costs, people have done a lot of work up to the final trigger and have been operating on the basis that a deal might be arrived at.  The important point is that they be ready to make any changes they need to make and do so on a timely basis.  We have been stressing the importance of planning and doing so as speedily as possible, rather than working on the basis that something will come to the rescue and that it will all go away.  The latter presumption is not a safe one in any contingency planning.  I ask Dr. Nolan to talk about the detailed engagement.</p></speech>

To put it in context, 7,000 medicines are authorised for supply in our market.  We have contacted the marketing authorisation holders for all those products, not just once but on many occasions.  We also engaged with all the wholesalers.  They have reassured us that they are considering everything they need to put in place and that they are planning for Brexit.  They are also examining their contingency plans, including for identifying alternative transport routes.  The companies are very sophisticated and since logistics are key to their viability, they have high levels of expertise in respect of anticipation and planning in this regard.</p> <p>  We are doing everything we can do and anticipating everything we can.  We will continue in this regard until the deadline, or until the United Kingdom exits.  That said, things can happen.  The co-operation arrangement developed between the HPRA, the Department and the HSE and the mechanisms we have in place through the operations group and the criticality assessment are such that, coming into the existing systems and from a regulatory viewpoint in terms of our shortages framework, we have  really strengthened our intelligence capability.  I am confident that we can anticipate and that we have systems in place to manage what may happen.</p><p>However, there are many unknowns with Brexit.  I must be honest about that.  As stated earlier, there are no guarantees, but I believe we have anticipated insofar as it is possible to do so.  I also believe we have developed a good methodology to be able to manage the situations that may arise over the coming period.</p></speech>

It is in place and we are 26 working days away from God knows what.  My understanding of what Mr. Breslin is saying is that there is an active agreement in place such that on the 27th day, people will be able to continue to go to Belfast, Derry or wherever, they will pay for their treatment as they currently do and the HSE will reimburse them when they return.  Can Mr. Breslin confirm that is the case and that there is an agreement, in writing, between the two Governments to the effect that it will continue?</p></speech>

There is the legislation, the overarching memorandum of understanding that was signed between the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and his counterpart and we have a drafted agreement between ourselves and the UK which will be signed on the last day before the UK leaves.

Mr. Breslin said in his statement that "strong general assurances have been received from industry but an expert group is also examining categories of medicine where it is deemed especially important to work directly with suppliers to verify that robust contingencies are in place".  Various people here are still using the present tense - examining categories and looking at supply chains.  Again, we are 26 working days away from it.  When will the Department be moving from a position of examining to one where it has examined.  When will this work be completed to his satisfaction?</p></speech>

For example, for the end of March we had to examine it in the preceding period before that.  We are now going back and refreshing that.  Even in the event of a Brexit we would continue to monitor the market.  It will not be a final, one-off exercise where we will say, "They were compliant in May or they were compliant in June".  We will ensure and verify compliance up to the point of departure and, in fact, beyond for the most risky areas.</p></speech>

We have been here for hours and it sounds as if an enormous amount of work continues to be done.  It also sounds as if it is good, multi-agency work, which we do not always have conversations about in the committee when it comes to healthcare.  I wish to ask a question I asked previously again.  Mr. Sullivan stated, "The number of medical devices that will have regulatory issues is significant and represents a particular risk to maintaining service continuity from early 2020".  He also stated, with regard to medicines, that there remains a potential for delay and disruption to supply routes and that a no-deal Brexit still has the potential to cause disruption to health services.  That is fine, but my understanding of what we have been told today is that there are no specific risks at present, the breadth of the work that has been done has looked at all the medicines, the devices and regulation of qualifications and so forth and that the witnesses' position is that, of course, things might happen and we are in a world of unintended consequences and unknown unknowns but they have, therefore, reasonable caveats in their statements.  Is it the case, however, that they do not have a shortlist of specific risks where they think things are more likely to go wrong?  Essentially, the sense I am getting is that on 1 November things will carry on.  They may not, but our guests have nothing left on their plates which says, "However, we think the following two or three disruptions are likely to occur".  To ask again a final time, are there specific risks about which they are still concerned, such as specific devices?</p></speech>

Once one risk rates, one will risk rate in terms of impact, such as if we did not have it, and based on vulnerability.  If I could use a different terminology, we do not have a current concern that a product will not be available to us on day one or week one.  There are products that, due to their nature, we will be monitoring very intensively over the period and we require, and have put in place, a number of contingencies to guard against any issues.  There is risk, therefore, but it is not a risk that we are saying is of current concern, that says we have a shortage that we must deal with at this point in time.</p></speech>

That is at the fore of the European Commission's position in saying that they must become compliant.  However, in a situation where, Europe-wide, there are products that are required for healthcare and have public health implications and which up to the last day have a full CE mark signed off by a European member state, but on day one there is an issue over that, then we, the Minister and the HPRA have stated in Brussels that we need to solve that problem as part of a European system.  It is not a supply issue but a regulatory one.  We will be making our voice very clear.  I understand why that decision will not be made until the end of this process.  To make it six months out, one gives people no incentive to comply.  However, we will have to examine it in that situation and look at the implications.  Ireland and other member states will have a view on that and will be seeking to come up with a solution.</p></speech>

The headroom is up to 12 weeks and that can be replenished in the intervening period.  The only issue is devices and that is a historical issue because of the piggybacking on the UK regulations.  We are stockpiling surgical packs and so forth to some extent, but that is because of the device element and not the drug element.  Is that correct?  I only have three minutes.</p></speech>

We have a very significant buffer with medicines and we have always had that.  We also have a significant buffer with medical devices.  At national level, the HSE, on a specific product basis, might make a decision to increase the buffer for medical devices.  That is where the HSE is, but that is quite different from individuals or even service providers such as hospitals, pharmacists and so forth making a decision on that.</p></speech>

It is not really an authorised product and I am aware the HPRA is helping out in this regard now, but I assume it will not be subsumed into the HPRA's work.</p></speech>

First, the EMA has no role in respect of the regulation of medical devices.  It is a notified body system.  It is a decentralised approach.  Our organisation does not issue certificates for devices.  They are issued by certification organisations throughout Europe.</p><p>We are transitioning to a new regulatory regime, which enhances the standard those notified bodies have to comply with.  From the notified body viewpoint, one can imagine that their quality systems and resourcing are all being elevated in standard.  That takes time and is the complexity for them when they are being asked to accept certification activities that were previously conducted by the UK in order to bring them in.  They are struggling with capacity issues in this.  It can be managed, which is the one thing to say about the regulatory system.  Mr. Breslin has outlined that we are confident that a European solution can be found.  If it cannot be found at a national level we can make decisions as a regulator to work with those companies to bring them into compliance.  I have spoken about the fact of the risk that these present.  It is the same regulatory system on 31 October as on 1 November.  We will do whatever it takes to keep continuity of care going and will work with the companies.  There is a risk over time that, commercially because of uncertainty, that may change in terms of whether manufacturers will supply the marketplace or not.  That is a problem we have with Brexit in general.</p></speech>

The batch will have to be tested for release onto the European market.  Have we the qualified persons in place here?  I believe we discussed that to some extent on the last occasion.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct.  The European Commission has given a derogation until the end of this year, so the testing that is currently performed in the UK continues to be performed there.  This is a transition agreement.  The industry has made very good progress on transferring regulatory activities that were conducted in the UK, which would have been the location of the marketing authorisation, the holder of the testing, and the batch released activities to the EU 27.  Ireland has received many of those transfers.  We have not received them all as they have also gone to other European countries.  That work has been very much in train over the last number of months.  There are still levels of non-compliance but the industry is continuing to work towards these and as the deadline approaches will see a big push in that direction.</p> <p>  There may be issues with the testing, to be honest with the committee on this point.  For some complex biological medicines that are proteins etc., the relocation and the finding of a facility in Europe may not be as easy and then there is competition for contract laboratory space.  It will depend on where we end up across the European system on this.  A European solution will probably be determined, if necessary.  If not, it can be managed on a national basis and we can work with companies towards compliance on that as well.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Daly's decision not to run again.  The next D&aacute;il will be one good person down, if he were to be re-elected.  I know it can be very difficult but I acknowledge that the Minister of State is a fine parliamentarian and has done an exemplary job.  He has done himself, his family, his party and his constituents very proud in his work.  He will be missed.  I also note that he looks about ten years younger than the last time I saw him.  The weight of the world is coming off him.  I wish to acknowledge his fine work over many years here in Parliament.</p> <p>  We can get into it whenever the Minister of State wants, but perhaps he and his officials would like a bit of time to prepare for it.  My question is on the Brexit-proofing of the legislation and what may happen.  The Bill deals with the recognition of qualifications within an EU framework and Brexit will potentially cause all sorts of problems.  The Minister of State could indicate when is the right moment to discuss it.</p></speech>

We have a lot of excellent healthcare professionals here who have been trained in the UK.  They may be Irish citizens who have trained and have come back or they may be UK citizens but they hold UK qualifications recognised here, or in some cases perhaps not recognised here.  Post Brexit, what is the thinking on their status here?  It is probably not within the remit of this Bill, but if it is relevant, if there is any reciprocity with the UK in any of this, does it have any impact on healthcare professionals registered or qualified here who are working in the UK?</p></speech>

I also thank Deputy Donnelly for his nice welcoming comments, which are very much appreciated.  I will come back to his question on Brexit at the first opportunity.  The amendments will bring CORU's, the multi-profession health regulator, fitness to practise process into line with those operated by the other health regulators.  The Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, and the Dental Council operate a two-stage fitness to practise sanction process wherein the fitness to practise committee may recommend a sanction to the council with the council making the ultimate decision as to the sanction.  CORU is an exception, as its legislation currently requires that the council also seeks recommendation from a profession's registration board before determining what sanction should be applied.  The council is not required to accept this recommendation.  This additional step generates a significant cost and administrative burden on the regulator and has been subject to criticism by the President of the High Court.  The additional step also creates an additional financial and emotional burden on the registrant during what is typically an extremely challenging period in his or her life.  The amendments will remove the requirement for the council to refer all sanction recommendations by the fitness to practise committee to the registration boards.  It should be noted that a representative of each of the designated professions sits on CORU's council.</p><p>I also wish to signal that a further amendment will be required on Report Stage to delete the recommendation making it a function of the registration boards contained in section 27 of the Act.</p></speech>

The Bill's draft section 26B sets out the means by which the Dental Council can recognise the qualifications for registration.  Section 26B.(1)(d), to which these amendments relate, concerns the recognition of qualifications which are neither an Irish qualification nor one automatically recognised under the professional qualifications directive.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit - a matter Deputy Donnelly was concerned about - this will apply to UK qualifications.  Section 27 of the Dentists Act is being repealed and the Bill's proposed text in section 26B.(1)(d) replicates the text from section 27(2)(d) of that Act.  However, on review, it was considered that the text could be made clearer.  The amendment to the Bill makes it clear that the Dental Council may approve courses of training and exams already undertaken to allow for registration, as well as specifying exams set by the Dental Council which applicants must take and pass to show equivalence in order to achieve registration.  This makes clear the legal base for any mutual recognition agreement which the Dental Council might make with a third country.  That is relevant to Deputy Donnelly's query.  The new text replicates text being inserted into the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, by virtue of section 83 of the Bill.</p></speech>

In medicine, concerns have been consistently raised with me suggesting that the examination bar the State has set for doctors is not adequate and that in some cases we are taking in doctors who, maybe through no fault of their own, simply are not trained to the level that our doctors are required to be trained to.  I have no idea if that is the case in dentistry.  This amendment goes to the heart of the check, so if we are taking in dentists from other states, my understanding is that if they are from within the EU their qualifications are simply recognised.</p><p>Are checks done on dentists from other EU member states or do we simply accept that they are fully qualified?  In the case of non-EU dentists, or EU dentists in the event that we do not automatically recognise their qualifications, what safeguards are in place to ensure the bar is adequately set and dentists from other states are subject to the same level of rigour and training that we demand of Irish-trained dentists?</p></speech>

There is an acceptance and recognition of qualifications among EU countries, other than language requirements which will apply in some countries.  In the case of dentists from outside the EU, the Medical Council will have to satisfy itself that any applicant from outside the EU is appropriately qualified.  That may be done by a process of examination or research into the person's background.  There is no automatic acceptance of qualifications obtained outside the EU.  The Medical Council has responsibility in this regard.</p></speech>

Different standards seem to apply at times.  Let me give an example.  A number of doctors have been appointed to positions for which they were not qualified and we only found out about it afterwards.  Whatever system is in place, it is not working.  The system in place in veterinary medicine works extremely well because everything is blocked and nothing gets through, not even the smallest technical detail.  Qualifications make no difference because everyone has to sit the exams again when they come here.  I know that is a restrictive practice and I know the reason for it.  We need to be a little more alert in the area of human health too.  We must apply the highest European standards.  I do not agree with the notion that we should test everybody again and have a separate test, as we have in the medicines area, but we need a very rigorous application of the rules.  Without that, we will undermine the quality and standard of the health services, whichever branch it is.</p></speech>

I am concerned that section 15 sets the High Court as the place for the person to go, including, I believe, for quite minor sanctions.  The High Court is very intimidating for many people, including myself.  It can be vastly expensive.  The idea that a healthcare professional who may have a legitimate grievance about a sanction against himself or herself would have to go to the High Court seems over the top.  Certainly healthcare professionals have raised the issue.  I know some of their representative bodies have raised the fact that various healthcare professionals would have to engage solicitors and barristers.  In respect of the workings of the courts, the High Court obviously deals with numerous issues and can have quite serious backlogs.  I wonder whether the High Court is the right place to go, first, as a reasonable path for somebody appealing what could be a very minor sanction and, second, for the courts in terms of the severity of some of the matters with which they deal.  Is that the right thing for the courts to do?  My focus, though, is on healthcare professionals.  I raised this issue on Second Stage and hoped there might be a Government amendment to that effect.  Could the Minister of State explain why such a high bar is being set for an appeal against what could be quite a minor sanction when minor sanctions in other areas, for example, driving or drug offences can be dealt with in lower courts?  </p></speech>

Appealing to the High Court is really onerous in terms of the time it takes and the stress it causes.  Let us not lose sight of the fact that it also costs the State a fortune.  I have been in the High Court on an appeal when I was given leave to represent a member.  He or she turns up with a full team.  It is a very expensive process for the State.  The High Court is there as an option but sometimes it is the only avenue for relatively minor matters.  Number one, it is extremely intimidating and number two, it costs a significant amount of money.  The healthcare professional is paying his or her retention fee so the organisation that receives that fee can spend a significant amount of money taking that healthcare professional and his or her colleagues to the High Court, not for serious matters - everybody appreciates that - but for relatively minor matters.  It seems a bit heavy.  It is very intimidating and time is also a factor because the courts probably have more onerous things with which to deal.  The healthcare professional has that hanging over him or her the entire time.  We are dealing with processes that with the best will in the world can take years.  The process has a significant impact on people's lives.  Nobody goes into these professions to have to deal with the legal profession and it is something that can hang over him or her.  Even where the appeal is successful, one is still talking about a lot of time, effort, energy and money being expended in the intervening time.</p></speech>

It is not the sanction but the finding that is appealed.  Reference was made a number of times to a minor sanction but it is the finding, which is on a person's professional conduct and fitness to practise, which is very serious, that is appealed.  A finding can impugn a person's professional good name.  That brings up the level of seriousness notwithstanding the Deputy's concerns about the person's ability to access the High Court and the cost.  I am not diminishing those issues but I want to give a bit of context.  This is why the High Court is included.</p> <p>  There are two sides to the argument about costs.  This is about trying to find a balance between the patient and the registrant, protecting the integrity of the healthcare system and the delivery of services to the patient and ensuring his or her rights are there and that the strictest and toughest standards are met at all levels.  If someone does go to the High Court, the costs will be awarded to the employer in some cases.  If someone has been wronged by his or her employer, one would expect the costs to be awarded.  I cannot prejudge what will happen or what an outcome will be.  Unions take a lot of these cases.  The main thrust of what I am trying to say is that it is essentially the finding that is being challenged, which is never minor.  There is no such thing as a minor finding when it involves fitness to practise and impugning someone's character and professional reputation as opposed to the sanction.  The focus is not on the sanction.  </p></speech>

I have to admit that I have been in the High Court on numerous occasions for my various sins over the years, although not in a personal way.  If a professional issue has been raised against a practitioner, it is a serious matter.  We need to be very careful about what we do.  I am not sure whether the High Court should be the court of first instance.  It may be possible to have the matter dealt with in a lower court such as the Circuit Court with the option of referring it to the High Court for both sides.  It can be intimidating but based on my experience, I have found the judges at High Court level to be very cautious in the way they deliver judgments and very careful about ensuring that the rights of the individual are observed at all times - perhaps to a greater extent than one would find in some of the lower courts.  I have been in all of them as well.</p></speech>

To protect that, it is deemed appropriate that an office such as the High Court would be the appropriate office when a person's good name has been challenged by his or her employer.  It is essentially still focusing on the registrant and keeping him or her in mind but that right is a very significant one.  I acknowledge the learnedness of the speakers opposite who have quite an experience of the courts system of which I was not aware so well done to them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.642" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019092500002#D00900"><p>Why is a lower court not considered suitable?  Was this looked at?  We have probably all dealt with cases where healthcare professionals have had their lives destroyed by the HSE.  I have dealt with more than one case where it was done intentionally, vindictively and wrongly.  I have seen good people who had done nothing wrong, some of whom were what we would now class as whistleblowers, destroyed by management within the HSE.  I have seen how they have had to leave work and I have seen them leave the country.  I have seen people sitting in the High Court wondering whether the judge was going to award them costs because if the judge did not, they would lose their house.  Telling anyone that he or she has to go to the High Court to clear a minor sanction is an extraordinarily onerous thing to do.  It can cost the person his or her mental or physical health, reputation or house and it can destroy him or her financially.  Making it the first place somebody can go to is setting an exceptionally high bar.  If it is a major decision, such as a decision that a medical practitioner is unfit to practise, the High Court might be the only place he or she can go.  My understanding of the legislation is that this is for minor sanctions.  If a person's entire professional reputation is up for grabs and has received a decision that he or she is not fit to practise then maybe the High Court is the place to go.  As Deputy Durkan said, the judges in the High Court are very skilled and experienced.</p><p>My question is on minor sanctions because the reality is that for nurses, doctors and dentists, some of them will have the wrong decision made, even with the best will in the world, because bad information will be used in some instances.  I have seen cases, as most members probably have, where the HSE has intentionally moved to destroy good people for vindictive, petty and bad reasons.  If the only safeguard these people have is the High Court, they are stuffed.  It is not reasonable for someone to have to go to the High Court and put everything on the line, including their family home potentially, over a minor sanction.</p><p> Were other less onerous mechanisms looked at for minor sanctions?  If they were not looked at, will the Minister of State give an undertaking to the committee that before this comes back for Report Stage, maybe we can have an informal meeting with him, or with the Minister, Deputy Harris, the officials and the committee members?  Could the Minister of State come back and assure us he has looked at everything else and ideally come up with a better solution?  It is not reasonable because we all know what will happen.  When wrong decisions are made, as they are made sometimes with the best will in the world and the best motivations, what will happen is there is no way people will go to the High Court and risk their family home with everything that is involved in taking a High Court action against the State, because, as Deputy Durkan said, the State uses it as a tool.  A medical professional walks in with whatever solicitor and barrister he or she can afford but the State does not.  The State walks in with an army of lawyers.  It is not a fair fight.  Why does this happen for minor sanctions?  Has every other option been exhausted?  If it has not been exhausted, can we please look at this before this legislation comes back for Report Stage?</p></speech>

The Minister of State has heard the concerns that have been raised if there is to be an informal meeting, which would be helpful.  I would suggest that we ask someone to come in who has been through that experience, either from the representative bodies or the legal profession, who might be able to speak to how it happens.  It is a long and drawn-out process and I am not a legal expert but I have been through this process on more occasions than I would have liked.  I am talking about practical, hands-on experience but I am not somebody who will take us through the legalities of it.  The Minister of State can hear the concerns we have.  It is daunting and the State brings a big team.  I remember standing in the foyer of the court and my poor members were looking at me because the other side all came in a big bus and it seemed like there were millions of them.  It is extremely expensive and it is really intimidating for the person taking the action, bearing in mind this person has already been through the wringer and been through the harsh process and then at the end they are facing into this.  If we are to organise a meeting, which I would support because it would be useful, we should bring in someone who has a bit of practical experience who might be able to speak to us about that.</p></speech>

Of course the officials would be happy to sit down and discuss this.  There are a lot of precedents that inform these kind of decisions, namely the existing judicial system in Ireland.  If one is caught for a misdemeanour or an offence under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, he or she goes to the District Court.  If it is something more serious on a higher level, one goes to the Circuit Court and if it is of a high standing the High Court is appropriate.  This is following those legal precedents that are there.</p> <p>  I have to comment on Deputy Donnelly's repeated use of the term "minor sanction".  It is not a sanction.  The sanction cannot be appealed.  The finding can be appealed.  The High Court will not say that dismissing a claimant for three months was wrong and that he or she should have only got two months.  It will not do that.  It will just say that such a case was an impugnment of his or her professional conduct or character, and that is the most serious impugnment any of use can have on our fitness to practise on a daily basis.  It is recognising the seriousness of the finding that dictates the seriousness of a case, where it should be and the most appropriate forum in which to deal with it.  It is not to make it difficult for the registrant to access justice.  They can always go in their individual rights to any court on the day but there is an accepted legal journey that people take, depending on the viciousness of the wrong that is done to them.  Of course I accept there are costs involved but costs are awarded in accordance with the legal system and all of that.  This is not designed to make it difficult for the registrant to access justice.  I assure members this is just in recognition and respect of the existing judicial norms in the State.  If the Deputies opposite would like a further briefing to get further clarity on this, there is no problem there and we will arrange that for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.646" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019092500002#E00400"><p>I am not looking for further clarity.  I am looking for a better answer.  I accept the Minister of State's point.  It is a semantic point and I know the Minister of State is not trying to play with words.  When I say "minor sanction" I am talking about a minor finding, because there can be a finding where the Medical Council of Ireland says a person has committed gross misconduct and has been negligent to the point that he or she is believed to have endangered the lives of his or her patients.  That is the kind of finding one might take to the High Court.  Every single finding below that may not have had due attention paid to it for a particular period.  This person may have failed to follow a World Health Organization, WHO, protocol before going into an operating theatre, that had no effect on a patient although they should have followed the protocol.  There are myriad such scenarios and some are fairly minor findings.  The other thing this legislation does is state that every single finding against a healthcare professional will have to be made public.  This is serious because for anyone running a practice, people will be able to look up findings made against them.  That transparency is welcome but it puts an awful lot of weight on the findings; when a member of the public is looking at a dentist, a doctor or whatever service, they may just see that a person has had two or three findings made against him or her by the Medical Council of Ireland and decide not to go near him or her, whereas in fact those findings may be pretty minor.</p> <p>  This is very serious for the medical professional.  It is very serious for a GP, for example.  The Minister of State said in his response that the medical practitioner can go to any court.  He or she cannot; he or she can go to the High Court.  That is the point of this.  The only place he or she can go under section 15 of the Bill is the Court of Appeal or the High Court.  That is it.  I am not looking for a briefing to get clarity on why that is the case.  I do not accept the argument that this is the existing judicial norm.  The existing norm is that we have four or five layers of courts, depending on where the Court of Appeal is put.  Broadly, the severity of the situation warrants a higher court.  That is not the case here, however.  There is only one court and it is the second highest court in the land, which is not accessible to most people.  I am not looking for more clarity.  I am asking why other solutions were not looked at, such as an independent appeal board linked to the Medical Council of Ireland.  How about a non-judicial appeal first?  That could have been looked at and I do not see why that could not happen.  I am sure there are myriad other non-judicial or quasi-judicial solutions that could have been looked at.  Perhaps if the Medical Council of Ireland finds against someone and there is a professional non-judicial appeal board that also upholds the Medical Council of Ireland's finding, then the Circuit Court and the District Court simply are not equipped to deal with findings against a person's name and there is simply no choice.  This is binary.  The Medical Council of Ireland finds that one did not follow the correct WHO protocols, and while no patients were put at risk, protocols should have been followed.  The only option is to go to the High Court in that instance.  I am not asking for clarity on the decision made.  I do not wish to speak for anyone else on the committee but this does not feel appropriate.</p><p>Will the Minister of State undertake to find a better solution between now and Report Stage?  That is the briefing I would like rather than having this explained in more detail.</p></speech>

Okay, that was getting lost in the discussion.  By necessity, it must be to a forum such as the High Court or something of a similar level but it does not necessarily have to be the High Court.  We are talking about particular situations and some are much more serious than others.  It is not fair that they would be treated the same or that they would all have to go to the High Court so there should be some sort of stopping-off point.  I appreciate that it cannot be to a lower court since it must be like for like, that is fair, but there must be something else.  It is really frightening for those who have to do this.  We might come back and discuss that based on what we have just discussed here.  I am sure the Minister of State understands our point.</p></speech>

Some differ, however.  We live in a changing world.  False allegations can be made and false evidence used to back them up.  Modern technology makes that possible.  We need to weigh that possibility against the need to achieve the highest possible standards while giving the individual at the eye of the storm his or her constitutional rights and entitlements.  That is a serious issue.  If someone is banished into the darkness for a sin.  There can be serious professional consequences.  Different professions deal differently with these things.  Some allow things to wither on the vine, where an issue may be ongoing for years and the professional involved has no future.  They are afraid about the extent to which they may have to involve themselves in the cost of going to higher courts and so on.  This is an issue on which we must keep a close eye and if possible make a provision whereby the individuals rights are not ignored.</p></speech>

I will try to deal with some of the issues.  To answer Deputy Donnelly's question on whether other options were considered, which I may not have answered earlier, the answer is that they were.  There is no question about that.  There is existing legislation in place which this amends.  We must keep mind of existing legislation and that is where I raise the matter of precedents.</p> <p>  I do not want to trivialise this and I would not like these words to be misconstrued but there can be an impression that we are treating a parking ticket in the same way as a drink driving offence.  A threshold already exists to access the Medical Council; this is about fitness to practise.  I am not trying to trivialise this matter, I am trying to be helpful.  However, someone arrested for a parking ticket, say, or something at that level, cannot access the Medical Council fitness-to-practise tribunal.  There is a threshold that must be reached before a case can be entertained.  One of the Deputies referred to vexatious cases and even social media and so on but that will not launch into a fitness-to-practise investigation.  This is about recognising the seriousness of that accusation that a practitioner is not fit to practise for whatever reason.  In line with that, the High Court is the appropriate forum.</p> <p>  The legislation introduces an appeals process for practitioners and registrants which was not there before.  That is the motivation behind the legislation.  The High Court will be informed of all decisions on fitness to practise once the legislation comes into effect.  That notification will be automatic.  It will review them and their sanctions which is a further safeguard.</p> <p>  I take on board the frustrations of members regarding the accessibility of the High Court and its capacity to intimidate for registrants but we must balance that with the seriousness of the issue at stake.  We must respect existing legislation and due process.  A more informal conversation on the matter might be helpful for members and I would be happy to arrange that.  That is not a bid to not answer their questions but it might be more straightforward if we discussed this across the table, if members were happy to do so.  If they wish to continue the discussion here, I will answer any further questions as best I can.</p></speech>

Some years ago, I represented a nurse who had been struggling with addiction.  During the period of her addiction, she was guilty of poor professional performance but thereafter she had worked very hard and, with the support of her family, she got her life completely back together.  She had two years working seriously hard at recovery and returned to work in a healthcare setting, but not to nursing.  She had put everything behind her but then had to go through the fitness-to-practise hearing.  It is something that could have been kept out of the public domain, and giving the fitness-to-practise committee leeway to do that was really important there where the case could be made that that was not who that person is now and their life is different now.  This woman had made vast changes in her life.  All that publication, indeed mandatory publication as outlined here, would have achieved would be to bring her back to where she was.</p><p>The purpose of the amendment is to open a dialogue but also to remove the compulsory element in order that it should not be mandatory and that they be allowed to exercise a high level of discretion, especially in minor incidents.  We should also be mindful of the time it often takes to go to committee, with so much evidence to be gathered, that people can get back on track in the intervening time.  In that case, and in others, I felt that publication served no purpose.  It did not serve the public interest, it only undermined that woman and to bring her back to a place she had worked very hard to get out of.  Where there is a public interest, I fully respect that it be done.  That used to be the case.</p><p>In cases where discretion can be applied it should be.  This is the purpose of this amendment.</p></speech>

The Bill provides, in any event, that regulators will have the discretion to publish, or not, information they receive about health professionals sanctioned in other jurisdictions.  This includes notification to the HSE and an employer, where known.  This is particularly important given the free movement of workers across the EU arising from the professional qualifications directive and the increased mobility of health professionals globally.  While we must support professional mobility, we must equally protect the public from practitioners whose competence, behaviour or conduct has been found to be deficient in other jurisdictions.  In this instance, the Deputy's amendment would remove the regulator's ability to make such notifications about dentists who have been sanctioned in another jurisdiction.  Acceptance of this amendment would treat dentists differently from practitioners governed by the other four health regulatory Acts.</p> <p>  For these reasons, I cannot support the amendment.  It would speak specifically for dentists and would exclude the others.  We will be dealing with the whole issue of publication with one of the upcoming amendments, specifically the publication element.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for two key changes.</p><p>It removes the requirement to notify the Minister.  While it is important that the HSE and employers receive information about sanctions against their employees, it is not necessary for the Minister to receive this information, particularly as the Acts provide for no function associated with receipt of it.  </p><p>On the other hand patients need to know that they are in safe hands when they entrust their health to a doctor or to another healthcare professional.  The public needs to have confidence in the role of the regulator to address deficiencies in competence, behaviour or standards, through a transparent system of mandatory publication of sanctions.  Accordingly, the Bill also provides that information on all sanctions will be made known to the HSE, to employers and to the public, where they are known.  This is an important patient safety measure, widely supported on Second Stage, which will ensure that information relating to sanctions imposed on registered health professionals is placed in the public domain.  Accordingly, the Bill provides that all disciplinary sanctions imposed by the five health regulators will be published, once confirmed by the High Court.  While I understand concerns raised that the publication of all sanctions may negatively affect registrants, this must be balanced against the public's right to important information about the fitness of a health professional to provide them with safe healthcare.  </p><p>However, I have considered the concerns raised by stakeholders outside of this forum, and in balancing these concerns with the public interest, I have decided to amend the Bill to provide for mandatory publication of all sanctions, unless publication is inconsistent with a decision of the High Court.  </p><p>Deputies will be aware that when holding confirmation of sanction hearings, the High Court, in specific circumstances, can order reporting restrictions or can hold hearings <i>in camera</i>.  These amendments will provide for those circumstances, where it is shown to the court's satisfaction that there are compelling reasons against publication, for example, when dealing with vulnerable registrants.  I trust that this approach, which is supported by the regulators, will address the Deputy's concerns on amendments Nos. 36, 59, 117 and 160. </p></speech>

It is not that anything should be kept from the public, where it is in the public interest, but it has to be absolutely balanced with the impact that publication has on a person's life.  One must consider, with the best will in the fastest process in the world, that these things still take a long time.  By the time it comes to publication, one is dealing with issues that have happened previously.  We need to insert the maximum compassion and balance that with the public interest.</p></speech>

It is only at that stage that a decision to publish can happen in any event.  At that stage there is a facility for the High Court to say, yes, I agree or accept that there are extraneous, extraordinary or unusual circumstances that this information should not be published.  These are my words and not-----</p></speech>

We must be very careful and we must absolutely protect the public interest where it is in the public interest to publish.  Erring on the side of:"we will publish unless there is" is a necessary discretion.  If I am hearing the Minister of State correctly, the appeal would be the event that the regulatory body, or the fitness to practise committee, decided to publish, and the appeal would then be to the High Court to request that it would not be published.  Am I incorrect in that understanding?</p></speech>

The purpose of this exercise is to tease it out, and if I am reading incorrectly, I am perfectly willing to be corrected on that.  The way that it is published is that there will always be publication unless there is a substantial reason not to, whereas it might be weighted the other way around.</p> <p>   I say this on the basis that it takes such a long time and is very onerous for people.  If one is talking to some person who is going through this process, it feels like it is never going to be over and it never leaves them.  I know that dealing with these people, where I was in the happy position of being able to go home after meeting them or after one of the sessions.  It is not my life, but it is every single day for them and it never goes away, no matter what they are doing.  Even in the back of their minds, when they think they know, all that they can think about is that, no matter what happens, they still have another hurdle to go through and it can still come back at them.  I am not saying we should not protect the public interest and that we should not publish where there is good reason to do so.  The emphasis should be and should start from the point that there will not be publication unless it is in the public interest to so do, in which case there will be publication.  This is a difference of emphasis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.681" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019092500002#G02100"><p>The difficulty we face here collectively is putting that into legislation, and how we would word this particular option of not publishing, unless it is in the public interest.  When one legislates, as the Deputy is aware, there is no room for doubt.  What we are talking about is extraordinary, special circumstances where there are legitimate reasons not to publish.  All of us accept that they exist, which is the point that the Deputy is trying to make and has succeeded in bringing to our attention and having recognised here.  There are exceptional circumstances that exist where publication is not in the best interest.  We would maintain that they are rare, are not the norm and are the exception, but they exist.  The question then arises where we can put it into legislation here that one does not publish unless one is absolutely sure it is right, or whatever, but that is restricting the whole objective of this, which is to give patients, as well, the right to know if somebody has a history.</p><p>We have to try to balance the right of the patient to know and the right of the registrant to have his or her particular circumstances taken into account.  How do we do that?  How do we strike that balance and who makes the judgment call?  </p><p> Deputy O'Reilly spoke about the regulator and argued that he or she could make the case.  Of course, the regulator, as I understand it, can make a case to the High Court ahead of publication as things stand currently.  The regulator can say that he or she understands the case very well and believes it would not be in the interest of patients to publish but ultimately the determination must be made by somebody.  The registrant may not have to make the case to the High Court.  The regulator could say that having dealt with this, he or she would not be recommending publication and that happens.  The crucial point is who makes the final determination and we must accept, in a democracy, that the courts are the overall superseding authority when it comes to making determinations.</p></speech>

At the end of hearing, one goes back for a confirmatory hearing.  One is sent the result, if I recall correctly.  I only have experience with one regulator and the system has changed somewhat.  My recollection is that one gets a result, goes back in for the confirmation and then one makes the case in situations where the issue is minor.  One does not go to the High Court with that because it does not need the approval of the court.  One goes in, brings a witness along and says that the person has got his or her life back together or that this was one minor incident that happened four years ago and the person&rsquo;s record has been exemplary since then and so forth.  One can make the case directly to people who are in the same profession and argue that the public interest will not be served by publishing the finding.  Now, however, that step is removed.  I am not referring here to cases where the issues are serious and the person has been struck off.  I am talking about cases that merit censure or admonishment because they are minor, although they may not seem minor to the person affected.  Under this legislation, such cases will now be funnelled automatically into the High Court and it is then up to the High Court to decide on publication.  Surely, at the lower level, where one is sitting in a room with a committee, one should be able to give reasons as to why it is not in the public interest to publish.  Once it goes to the High Court, one is in a somewhat adversarial process which is expensive.  It becomes quite intimidatory and scary and the process will take time.  It never gets to be over for the person.  I do not understand why in the case of lesser incidents, one would still have to go to the High Court.  That seems like a big change and one that is not necessarily in the public interest.  I do not believe it is in the public interest to always have these cases published, although I do fully accept that there are cases where it is in the public interest to publish.  The change proposed here is a big one.  It adds an extra layer for people and it is quite-----</p></speech>

We are not in the territory of minor incidents here.  This is somebody&rsquo;s fitness to practise being questioned and that cannot happen or be entertained by the Medical Council unless the case is deemed by the council to be serious.  To go back to my analogy of parking tickets and drink driving, parking tickets will not enter this process because they will not get through the first stage.  This is as much about the registrant&rsquo;s right because his or her fitness to practise is being challenged.</p></speech>

They will and they do.  It is not fault of any one person but it happens.  The potential exists within this legislation to wreck a person&rsquo;s life.  I have serious concerns about this.</p></speech>

It is to protect the public on one hand and to protect the registrant on the other.  We are trying to balance their rights.  Essentially, what this legislation is all about is building confidence in the function of regulators.  The right to publish is essential in order to have an open, transparent, fully accessible, accountable and credible system of regulation.  If one comes at it from the other side and says that there is no right to publish then one is taking away the element of transparency which is essential in underpinning faith in the system of regulation.</p></speech>

Such cases do not currently go to the High Court but they will when this legislation is enacted.  There are three sets of people involved in this, namely the regulators, the general public and the registrants.  The rights and entitlements of all must be balanced and I do not believe this legislation is being fair to one set of people.  I do not want to labour the point but-----</p></speech>

I am listening intently to the points she is making and am doing my best to explain my perspective on this.  We can unpick this bit by bit if we take a sectoral or silo-like approach but if one stands back and looks at the system in its entirety, taking into account the threshold for a fitness to practise inquiry, one sees that the fitness to practise findings and the sanction have to be fed to the High Court anyway.  They also have to be approved by the High Court before there is any talk of publication.  It has reached that stage anyway, having been through three or four steps.  We cannot look at this in isolation, from the original misdemeanour to the point of publication.  All the necessary steps will be taken and I am sure that all of us, collectively, want to ensure that regulators have a full range of powers but are also open to scrutiny and publishing is part of that.</p> <p>  I accept that not everything runs like clockwork and Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly has brought that insight to this legislation.  She has pointed out that there are circumstances where it is legitimately in the interests of a person not to have the findings published.  We have recognised that in this legislation by affording the High Court the right to determine that it would not be published.  That can be done through the regulator at the time of the investigation.</p></speech>

Section 38 sets out the circumstances under which a registration board should grant registration.  Section 38(2F), which was inserted by means of an amendment to the Act in 2017, relates specifically to the Physiotherapists Registration Board and allows persons who graduated from the Institute of Physical Therapy and Applied Science after 1 January 2013 to register with the board up to 31 December 2019.  The amendment will remove the obligation that the specific qualifications referred to must have been awarded after 1 January 2013.  This is to enable a small number of qualified professionals who returned to the State after practising in another jurisdiction and had spent several years out of practice to register with the board.  The amendment will extend the time allowed for such applicants to make an application under this section of the 2005 Act by two years to 31 December 2021.</p><p>The amendment to section 31 of the 2005 Act is a consequential amendment and provides for the deletion of the reference to the date of 1 January 2013.</p></speech>

It is referred to in several times in the Bill, including in section 86, and I will address the totality of the issue.  There is a serious issue in this county with non-specialists working in specialist posts.  In layperson's language, non-consultants are working as consultants.  In some cases, they do not have the requisite qualifications and training, and patients have absolutely no idea that the person they are seeing is not a consultant.  We have discussed this issue before in the committee.  My fear is that if it is found in the future that there was negligence by any of these people, there could be serious consequences for patients, in the first instance, and for the State.  Anybody who is going in to see a consultant, having waited two or three years for an appointment, needs to know whether that person is, in fact, a consultant.</p> <p>  This issue has been raised several times since I became a member of the committee and the numbers are increasing.  I have submitted various parliamentary questions on the matter and, if I recall correctly, the latest figure was 168 non-consultants in consultant posts.  I am concerned that this Bill provides more ways for doctors who are not qualified specialists to be put on the specialist registers.  Rather than coming back to the issue as we discuss each relevant section, will the Minister of State agree to discuss it in totality at this point?  It may be the case that this provision has been carefully thought through. He referred to a two-year timeframe in this instance, while another section refers to a one-year timeframe for a different group of doctors.  Will he outline precisely which types of doctors who are not specialists could end up on a specialist register?</p></speech>

This definition was considered at length by the High Court and the Supreme Court following a judicial review instigated by Professor Martin Corbally regarding a finding against him by the Medical Council of poor professional performance.  The Supreme Court decision confirmed emphatically that a threshold of seriousness exists for all cases involving poor professional performance.  The court clarified that this threshold is provided for in the definition of poor professional performance in the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and is followed in the other health professional regulatory Acts.  I am satisfied that the judgment leaves no doubt as to the interpretation of "poor professional performance" and that there is no doubt among the regulators who apply the threshold in arriving at their decisions.</p> <p>  I accept that amending the definition as suggested by the Deputy might appear to do no harm, but my preference is not to risk introducing unintended consequences to something that has been the subject of detailed court examination and on which there is now a substantial body of case law.  I, therefore, do not support the amendment.</p></speech>

I do not accept, as he has suggested, that the judgment is incorporated into this legislation.  The court unanimously dismissed the Medical Council's appeal against the High Court's quashing of a council decision that Professor Corbally should receive an admonishment for a once-off error.  The court found that the a threshold of seriousness, which is what I am seeking to introduce in this amendment, must be met.  It further found that it was neither fair nor just that somebody like Professor Corbally should be subject to a public inquiry with the attendant extensive publicity, some of which lacked fairness and moderation.  The purpose of our amendment is to incorporate that ruling into the Bill, but I would be happy to support a similar Government amendment.  Our objective is to legislate across all the primary Acts to incorporate the Corbally judgment into the definitions of poor professional performance.</p><p>This issue has been raised with me by a number of people and I am sure it has been raised with other members of the committee.</p></speech>

I agree with her wholeheartedly and support the amendment, but it is not necessary because what it seeks to achieve is already inherent in the Bill.  I want to assure her that I share her ambition and that it is part and parcel of what we are doing in this provision.  The Bill provides for the Supreme Court's decision in the Corbally case that where poor professional performance is identified, a level of seriousness automatically attaches to it.  The matter is serious by nature such that there is no need to include the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo;.  I understand from where the Deputy is coming and agree wholeheartedly with what she is trying to achieve, but the amendment is not necessary.  As legislators, in putting forward words that will be interpreted by the courts we need to take appropriate care in the words we use and the wording that is necessary to state the intention of the legislators at the time of legislating.  My understanding is it is not necessary to include the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; following the Supreme Court's decision that the term &ldquo;poor professional performance&rdquo; indicates a level of seriousness.</p></speech>

We cannot leave it to case law to determine this matter or to set a precedent.  There is a salutary lesson for me in what is going on in another jurisdiction in leaving things to precedent.  It is important that the judgment in the Corbally case be legislated for.  I do not believe that has yet been done in primary legislation.  It was a landmark judgment and recognised as such by members of the medical and legal professions.  I do not understand why it has not been incorporated into primary legislation.</p></speech>

My understanding is the regulators understand the seriousness of poor professional performance.  We could argue all day every day over the need for the inclusion of the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo;, but I argue that we will not be relying on case law.  What matters is the interpretation of the regulators who will be applying it and their understanding of it.  I know that they are not in any doubt about the interpretation following the Supreme Court's judgment.  The Deputy is a legislator and entitled to her very strong view on the interpretation, but I do not propose to argue the matter further.</p></speech>

We have had a discussion on the effectiveness and impact of publication.  The Minister of State is aware of my concerns about the need to balance the rights of the regulator with those of the general public and the registrant.  There are three actors in any scenario.  The current system provides for an appeal at regulator level in regard to publication, but it is being removed and admonished censure will now automatically always be a matter for the High Court.  For all of the reasons I have outlined, I do not think this is necessary.  That is not to suggest I do not value and welcome any provision that strengthens the public interest element of the legislation, but what is proposed is unnecessary and unduly harsh on the registrant.</p></speech>

In 2008, the HSE introduced a requirement that consultants be registered on the specialist division of the Medical Council register.  Consultants appointed prior to 2008 under the standard recruitment arrangements in place for the filling of consultant posts at the time did not have to be registered in this division.  The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 included a provision allowing a five-year period for which the council could grant registration to any medical practitioner who, being able to be registered in the general division, satisfied the council he or she had obtained sufficient training and experience such as he or she should be registered as a specialist on that list.</p><p>A small number of consultants appointed prior to 2008 did not avail themselves of this provision.  They are unable to apply for registration on the specialist division because they do not have the specified qualifications for specialist registration.  This relates to a small number, between 30 and 40, of consultants.</p><p>The amendment would enable the Medical Council to register in the specialist division a medical practitioner registered in the general division who satisfies the council he or she has obtained sufficient training and expertise such that he or she should be registered as a specialist.  This window of registration will be available for one year from the commencement of the relevant section of the Bill.</p><p>The amendment also provides that within this timeframe, and for the purposes of the above provision, the Medical Council will work with specialist training bodies to assist medical practitioners registered in the general division to achieve the necessary standard for registration in the specialist division.</p></speech>

That is the qualification.  As I said, they have the necessary experience and training.  There is a difficulty which, to be fair, is more than technical.  They have to satisfy the Medical Council, but it is important to appreciate that these consultants are properly qualified.  They hold their consultant posts having met the criteria that applied to them when they were advertised and filled.  They acquired their posts having been deemed to be eligible to compete for them when their applications were assessed.  They did not acquire their posts through contracts of indefinite duration.  The provision has also been framed so as to ensure the council will be satisfied that the consultant concerned has the necessary training and experience to merit inclusion in the specialist division.  Does that answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question?</p></speech>

I know that is the Deputy&rsquo;s sense of it also.  I have heard him speak on the issue many times.  The specialist register requires an additional layer of qualifications.  It requires certain qualifications for people to be allowed to work as consultants.  They include certain training and experience.  The people concerned need to work with the Medical Council to have this additional layer of qualifications.  They are qualified to work as consultants, but they need additional qualifications to be included in the specialist register.  This provision gives them the opportunity to obtain the additional qualifications.  It is about the difference between the qualifications of and the training and experience of people in the field.  This provision will allow them to work with the Medical Council to achieve the higher level of qualifications required for inclusion in the specialist register.  It does not give anyone a shortcut or pass.  I was going to say a hospital pass.  It does not give anyone a break; it just allows them to reach the higher level set.  They have the qualifications; this provisin will just ensure their training and experience are recognised.</p></speech>

Recognition of experiential learning is covered by the Act that deals with qualifications and quality.  Is the Minister of State saying the cohort of people who will be captured by this provision comprises those who are eligible for admission to the register not by virtue of their experience but by virtue of their qualifications and who did not apply for admission at the time?  Will the Medical Council have a role in reviewing their experiential learning, or other forms of training undertaken in the course of their duties, with a view to deeming it to be the equivalent of a qualification?  The issue is whether a person is not only capable but also qualified.  The Minister of State is seeking to change whether a person can be admitted to the specialist register.  I have a particular interest in this issue which I have raised on countless occasions.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is saying the people concerned will not practice as a consultant by virtue of their legal entitlement to a contract of indefinite duration.  I might be reading this incorrectly, but I believe such persons could do so.  There is nothing to prohibit it.  Currently, a person can work and be paid as a consultant without the necessary qualifications for admission to the specialist register.  If the amendment is accepted, could a person amass sufficient experiential learning, on-the-job training, and experience, some of which could be obtained under a contract of indefinite duration because it is not specified that it cannot be, to allow him or her to be admitted to the register?  I do not see how this excludes someone who is acting and being paid as a consultant and now entitled to a permanent position by virtue of a contract of indefinite duration, but I may be missing it.  How is a person who is on a consultant&rsquo;s wage under a contract of indefinite duration, rather than by virtue of his or her qualifications, excluded from admission to the specialist register?</p></speech>

As I said, this cohort includes 30 or 40 consultants.  This provision does not reduce standards in any way, shape or form, nor does it make it easier for anybody, but there was a cohort of consultants who did not qualify for inclusion in the specialist register during that period.  They were not eligible or missed the window to apply for inclusion in the specialist register.</p></speech>

The understanding at the start was that they just did not apply, although they could have done so, but the Minister of State is now saying they were not eligible.  Can we have clarity as to which it is because it matters?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.828" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019092500002#M01000"><p>I apologise for not being coherent and clear enough.  I understand the importance of the issue and I am trying to understand it.  There was a five-year window for consultants who were in place, qualified and had received appropriate training and experience to be included in the specialist register.  There is no question about their qualifications, but they did not avail of the opportunity in the five-year period.  It is not that they were not eligible but just that they did not avail of the opportunity to do so within the five-year period.  With this provision, we are seeking to open the window again.  The specialist register was introduced under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and there was a five-year window for registration.  Some 30 to 40 consultants who are in post did not avail of that opportunity.  They have continued in post and are still not on the specialist register.  This provision allows them an opportunity to apply for inclusion in the register.  It does not reduce the requirements they have to meet, which is the Deputies&rsquo; concern.  It does not diminish in any way, shape or form the requirement to have the necessary training, experience and qualifications.  It gives them an opportunity to apply for inclusion in the specialist register.  We are reopening the window which legislation previously opened for a five-year period, of which opportunity these consultants did not avail.</p></speech>

I can support the explanation the Minister of State has given just now, namely that they did not bother, they forgot or were too busy saving lives.  Had they applied in that five-year window, they would have got onto the specialist register like everybody else.  They did not do so and now we are trying to clean that up, for good reason.  If that is the rationale, I can support it.  However, what I heard was that they are not on the register because they do not have the requisite qualifications.  Was that just incorrect?</p></speech>

I appreciate that the previous contribution I made was more helpful than some of my previous contributions.  The reason there was a five-year window was that we might have required applicants to have an additional layer of qualifications to be on the specialist register.  The five-year window allowed for that.  The people involved were perfectly qualified, trained and experienced but to get on the specialist register, they may have needed to complete a course or to add another layer.  I am not a medical expert so I do not know what is involved but they may have needed an additional layer.  They may have needed to undergo additional training, as is the case in many areas, in terms of continuous professional development because standards are being raised all the time.  They may have been eligible at the time but the goalposts have changed now and they are no longer eligible.  In that context, they may need to fill that gap.</p></speech>

They were given the five years to get whatever qualifications were required to move themselves over but they did not do that in the time provided.  Is the Minister of State certain that we are only talking about that group of between 30 and 40 people?  It seems a little broader and appears to include people who are not in that group.  We are talking here about people who could have but who did not, for various reasons including maternity leave, sick leave or study abroad, apply to be included on the specialist register.  It is limited to that group and there is nobody who would fall outside of the scope of that group who could benefit from this.  Is that correct?  I am happy to take the Minister of State's word on that but my reading of it is that it is sufficiently open-ended to benefit people who are not in that small group of 30 to 40 people.  We are talking about people who, between 2008 and 2013, would have had the opportunity to go on the specialist register but did not do so.  My reading of this is that people who are not in that tight little group could benefit from it and could get themselves onto the specialist register.  If that is the case, I cannot support it but if the Minister of State is confident that this is ring-fenced and only applies to that very tight group, then I will support it.</p></speech>

A larger cohort of consultants who may be acting up are not on the specialist register but this does not facilitate them in moving up.  This is designed around the 30 or 40 people who have the necessary experience, training and qualifications but who, for bureaucratic or other reasons, did not get on the specialist register at the time but who were perfectly entitled to be on it.  They may have to work with the Medical Council on some level but provided they do that, they are perfectly entitled to be on the register.  The Medical Council will continue to uphold standards.  This legislation will not diminish in any way the standard of consultants in this country.  This is just about addressing anomalies.  We all know that anomalies can occur when legislation is enacted.  Legislative changes can impact negatively on one cohort and positively on another.  This is a fairness measure that is designed to give people the same right to access the specialist register as their colleagues with whom they have been working.</p></speech>

It balances things out.  However, I am concerned about people who were not in that scenario back then but are now by virtue of experience.  Given the nature of healthcare delivery and the recruitment crisis in the health service, people who would not be eligible to be on the specialist register are now acting as consultants.  Would they not be able to claim, under this section, an entitlement to be on the specialist register by virtue of their experiential learning, training and so forth, which do not necessarily amount to a qualification?  Could they not do what the group of 30 to 40 practitioners can do, which is to go to the Medical Council and ask for recognition for their work?  These people are acting as consultants.  All of their experience since taking up their acting post is relevant.  Whether they have a contract of indefinite duration or not is irrelevant; they are still acting.  Are they not entitled to the benefit of this legislation?  Would it be deemed unfair if this Bill goes through as is?  Would such people not consider it unfair that they could not benefit from this legislation?  Could they not go to the Medical Council under this provision?  That is my primary concern.</p></speech>

We are not changing the standard that is required in to be admitted onto the specialist register.  All we are doing is making provision for a cohort of people who have achieved that standard but who, for a bureaucratic reason rather than a standard, training or experience deficit, were unable to get onto the register.  Previous legislation put a five-year time limit in place and they were locked out because they did not get on the register within that period.  This provision will give them the opportunity to get on the register but they will still have to attain the same standards and so forth.  There is no question that anything we are doing today will lower standards or allow others to get in through the window now.  There is certainty about that.</p> <p>  I understand the concerns of the Members opposite and am quite happy to get them a better and more extensive briefing on this particular aspect of the Bill-----</p></speech>

It questioned whether it made sense for proceedings to be held <i>in camera</i>until adverse findings were made, at which point the whole thing would be made public.  I am of two minds about this because we want as much transparency as possible.  The IMO's concern is that for practitioners against whom vexatious or well-intentioned but unsubstantiated allegations are made, the proceedings themselves could cause them damage.  When no findings are made against that practitioner, the damage potentially remains because of the public nature of the hearings.  I am also cognisant of the fact that court cases are held in public, regardless of the findings, except in exceptional circumstances, for children, or in family law, where they are held <i>in camera</i>.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's views on the IMO's concerns.</p></speech>

We can debate that principle in this forum or any other, but that is the accepted principle on which this section was based.  There are concerns, which the justice system has addressed by making exceptions in childcare cases and so on.  No amendment has been proposed to this section to which I can speak.  Under the existing Medical Practitioners Act, cases are held in public.  We do not propose to change that.  It is the norm.  This section proposes to grant the fitness to practise committee the power to order certain information regarding a hearing not to be published.  It introduces a degree of latitude to the pre-existing legislation and allows for situations where the fitness to practise committee can decide whether such information is in the public interest.  I hope that addresses the Deputy's concern.</p></speech>

Section 91 of the Medical Practitioners Act places a duty on the Medical Council to satisfy itself as to the ongoing maintenance of doctors' professional competence.  Section 91(7) of the Act provides the council with the explicit power to make a complaint to the Preliminary Proceedings Committee where a doctor in a specialist division or trainee specialist division fails to meet the standard of competence that can be expected of them, despite being given an opportunity to do so.  The proposed amendment extends this power to include doctors registered on two other registers, namely the general division and the supervised division.  This amendment would ensure that the Medical Council's powers of complaint in relation to professional competence apply to all relevant categories of doctors, which would enhance patient safety.</p></speech>

This has caused operational problems for the regulator and, in some cases, has lengthened the time it takes for an inquiry to conclude.  This section removes this requirement.  Since the Bill was published, concerns were raised that the section, as drafted, might have unintended consequences for the composition of committees.  Specific concerns were that neither a nurse nor a midwife might be required to sit on a committee and that a nurse might not sit on a committee inquiring into a nurse or a midwife for a midwife.  Following further consideration and discussion with the regulator and the OPC, it is agreed that these concerns would be addressed by the removal of paragraph (11A)(a) in subsection (<i>c</i>) of section 129 and this amendment has been drafted accordingly.</p><p>When applied to the Bill and the existing Act, the net effect of the amendment is that there will be no change to the PPC and there will continue to be at least one nurse and one midwife on a preliminary proceedings committee and any subcommittee.  There will be a change to the fitness to practise committee for inquiries and, beginning after the section comes into effect, there will be at least one nurse or one midwife on a fitness to practise committee or subcommittee and, where a nurse is being inquired into, a nurse must be on the committee and likewise for a midwife.</p><p>This amendment also introduces another key feature, which will assist the NMBI to process complaints more quickly.  The Bill, as drafted, provides that the new streamlined committee structures will apply only to inquiries into complaints made after this section comes into effect.  However, the amendment provides that the new provisions relating to fitness to practise composition will apply to complaints currently being examined but which have not yet reached the fitness to practise hearing stage, which is when a midwife or nurse would be included, as well as to the complaints made after the section has come into effect.  These hearings are held towards the end of the inquiry and this amendment will, therefore, allow a large batch of complaints currently at the early or middle stages of investigation to be heard by the streamlined committee structure.  Concluding these hearings as quickly as possible is in the interest of both the registrant and the complainant.</p></speech>

Currently that is not the case.  In the context of a particular circumstance which has been brought to my attention, there is a facility for registrants to seek that hearings take place other than in public and this can be granted by the fitness to practise committee.  When it is granted it predominantly involves cases where there is a relevant medical disability.  My opposition arises from the fact that, if it has to go to court and there is misconduct arising from a disability - most probably a mental health issue - this will form part of the admonishment or censure and it will be read out in open court.  A person may take a compassionate view of professional misconduct or poor professional practice and, at the moment, the fitness to practise committee can use its discretion to hold back information from the public out of concern for a person's mental health, but this facility will be abolished by virtue of the admonishment containing elements of the disability, which will then be confirmed by the court and go on the public record.  The Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 currently allows discretion but this section will change that and my information is that this change may have unintended consequences.</p></speech>

The facility that exists at present means it does not go any further than the committee and does not have to go to the court.  I believe the confirmatory nature of having to go to the court is unduly burdensome.  We have had this discussion and I am conscious that we have another session, so I am not going to labour the point.  However, I want to record that I am opposed to section 155.</p></speech>

The Health Act 2004 is amended&mdash;<br /><br />(a) in section 2, in subsection (1), by the insertion of the following definition:&ldquo; &lsquo;Regulations of 2017&rsquo; means the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2017 (S.I.

The amendment gives the Minister for Health the power to designate the HSE as the competent authority to compare the equivalence of non-Irish qualifications to the qualifications of certain health professions which are not regulated on a statutory basis but which are regulated for the purposes of the EU professional qualifications directive.  The Minister is currently the competent authority for these professions.  The amendment being moved allows the Minister, by order, to designate the HSE as a competent authority for those professions for which it sets the qualifications required for the pursuit of that profession in the publicly funded health sector and which will not be subject to statutory regulation by CORU.  The professions which currently come within the scope of the directive are those of audiologist and environmental health officer.</p></speech>

Under the provisions of the relevant roads and road traffic legislation, the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads, together with traffic management measures, are the statutory responsibilities of each local council.  The Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport is responsible for overall roads policy, the provision of technical guidance and, within the budget available to it, grant funding to assist local authorities with their road programmes.</p><p>As a result of the cutbacks in funding for roads during the recession, grant funding for road improvement projects under the specific improvement and strategic regional and local road grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013.  This was necessary because expenditure on maintenance and renewal was falling well short of what was required to maintain the regional and local road network adequately.</p><p> Under Project Ireland 2040, there have been increases in grant funding for the regional and local road programme particularly in 2018 and 2019.  This has allowed the Department to provide local authorities with additional grant support for maintenance and renewal of the network.  However, in order to avoid deterioration in the existing condition of the regional and local road network, 4,700 km of regional and local road pavement needs to be maintained and 4,700 km needs to be strengthened every year.  This target is not being met at present.  The maintenance target this year is 2,400 km and the rehabilitation target is 2,150 km.</p><p> Overall, it is estimated on a conservative basis that expenditure of &euro;630 million is needed per annum to keep the regional and local road network in a steady state condition.  For this reason, the main focus of grant expenditure on regional and local roads continues to be on maintenance of the network.  Project Ireland 2040 makes provision for the implementation of 12 regional and local road improvement projects, subject to necessary approvals, in the period to 2023.  Outside of that, some limited provision is being made in the regional and local road capital budget for the appraisal of a pipeline of upgrade projects.  This is intended to cover the appraisal of projects for development, if possible, in the later years of the national development plan.  The scope for carrying pipeline projects through to development stage is dependent on the future availability of funding.</p><p> If a local authority wishes to put forward a future project for consideration, it must comply with the requirements of the public spending code and the Department's capital appraisal framework.  The Department issued detailed guidance to local authorities in April 2018 setting out project appraisal requirements.</p><p> Under the appraisal process, a preliminary appraisal has to be submitted on each proposed project.  Projects costing over &euro;5 million also need a detailed appraisal report if they progress beyond the preliminary appraisal stage.  At preliminary appraisal, the local authority application needs to demonstrate sufficient analysis to underpin an assessment of the merits or otherwise of the scheme.  Local authorities are required to outline what consideration has been given to investment options, including different transport modes and traffic management options.  The preliminary appraisal also encompasses a preliminary multicriteria analysis which is used for comparing options.</p><p> Meath County Council has prepared a draft preliminary business case for a bypass of Julianstown.  Further liaison is required with the council with a view finalising the council&rsquo;s preliminary appraisal submission.</p></speech>

The council is committed to playing its part to improve the quality of the built and natural environment of the village, while catering for the needs of the local community, as well as ensuring the village develops in a sustainable manner.<br/><br/>On an average day more than 20,000 vehicles pass through the village on the R132.  This is despite the opening of the Drogheda bypass section of the M1 motorway in 2003.  The high traffic volumes create a situation which is incompatible with the council&rsquo;s long-term vision for Julianstown and which is likely to worsen as Drogheda and east Meath develop further.  We, therefore, believe the provision of a traffic solution for the village is central to realising the aspirations for Julianstown.<br/><br/>The council raised the matter of the traffic situation in Julianstown directly with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport at a meeting in January 2017.  Subsequently in March 2017, the director of services for transportation communicated with both the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Transport Infrastructure Ireland requesting them to engage in discussions about advancing a solution to the transport situation.  In December 2018, the council also submitted a draft preliminary business case to the Department which concluded that there is a <i>prima facie</i>case for doing something to address the traffic volumes in Julianstown.  The initial analysis also showed that a bypass of Julianstown emerged as the preferred option in both the multicriteria analysis and preliminary cost benefit analysis that were undertaken.<br/><br/>The committee will appreciate that it is beyond the resources of Meath County Council to deliver the scale of intervention that is potentially required in Julianstown without capital grant support from central government.  If this is forthcoming, the council would prioritise the process to identify and progress the optimum solution.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the council has made provision of &euro;800,000 in its capital investment programme 2019-2021 for traffic management measures for the village.  Environmental studies are currently being undertaken on the proposed interim traffic management measures in preparation for an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for approval.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.979" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh U&iacute; Loinsigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019092500002#B00500"><p>I thank the Chairman for inviting representatives of Julianstown and District Community Association to give evidence about the heavy traffic and its effect on the village of Julianstown in County Meath.</p> <p>  Julianstown is a village of 600 people situated on the R132 road between Drogheda and junction No. 7 of the M1 motorway.  The R132 used to be the old N1 Dublin-Belfast road.  In 2003, the M1 motorway opened taking through traffic around Drogheda.  However, the traffic volumes remained high and continue to be grossly excessive for a small village.</p> <p>  While it might have been expected to alleviate traffic congestion in Julianstown, the M1 has had little effect since it remains the primary access route for traffic to south Drogheda and east Meath.  The area has seen high population growth in the past decade with more planned.  Even now, there is enough zoned land in the southern environs of Drogheda to accommodate a population of more than 18,000 which is just short of the size of Sligo.</p> <p>  While there have been some suggestions the heavy traffic is caused by toll avoidance, this has not been borne out by technical studies on the traffic in the area.  According to a briefing prepared by the National Roads Authority, NRA, in 2016, it has always been recognised by the authority, as well as borne out in traffic studies undertaken, that the old N1 &ndash; the existing R132 - route would continue to attract significant traffic volumes due to the commercial and residential traffic movements in and around Drogheda town, the movements to and from Drogheda, and the movements to and from Drogheda Port.  The decision of the NRA board to adopt the toll scheme noted that the existing R132 route would continue to operate as a toll-free public road.  A study carried out by the authority in 2012 demonstrated this toll strategy has been effective as the overall volume of toll avoidance rates on the M1 is relatively low at less than 3% through the length of the scheme.</p><p>Current average annual daily traffic, as measured by TII, is in excess of 20,000, with weekday levels exceeding 22,000.  According to the TII design manual for roads and bridges, a type-2 dual carriageway, not a village street, is recommended for this level of traffic.  Julianstown has the 16th busiest road in the country based on an analysis of the TII network of traffic counters on a total of 86 roads, including all motorways and national roads.  It is busier than the M6, M8, M9, M17 and M18 and all national roads apart from the N1, N6, N7, N8, N18 and N40.</p><p> Under EU law, traffic noise in the village has been modelled as being 15 to 20 dB in excess of the World Health Organization threshold for human health.  It is suspected that the traffic is causing significant air pollution, particularly NO2.  If one breathes in NO2 for more than ten minutes, one will die.  In a letter sent to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on 14 March, Mr. Des Foley, director of services for Meath County Council, noted that the expected volume of traffic has grown significantly faster than was anticipated when the M1 was approved.  He noted that the future growth of Drogheda, Laytown and Bettystown areas will further increase pressure on the roads through the village and that the council considers it imperative that work begin on finding a solution in order to significantly ease traffic volumes to a level that befits a village street.  He forwarded a 2015 study by Aecom which shows that a local bypass of Julianstown is the most effective solution, rather than a proposed distributor road in Bryanstown and a new link to the M1.</p><p> In December 2018, Meath County Council submitted a draft preliminary appraisal for a Julianstown bypass to the Department  It considered a cost-benefit analysis of various proposed solutions.  This document recognises lengthy journey times due to congestion and unsafe conditions for all road users, particularly pedestrians and cyclists.  There is approximately 1 mile between the two pedestrian crossings in Julianstown.  Trying to cross the road in the morning is like running a gauntlet.  The appraisal further notes the unhealthy environment due to air pollution, vibration and noise, as well as the lack of resilience of the transport network in north-east Meath given increased future demands.  It concludes that a bypass of Julianstown is the preferred option based on multiple criteria, including a cost-benefit analysis.  In fact, the benefit-to-cost ratio based on reduction of congestion alone is 4:1, with an anticipated saving of &euro;80 million.</p><p> Although the Julianstown and District Community Association acknowledges that public transport has a role to play in transport policy overall, Julianstown is a special case because the health and safety of residents are of paramount concern. No public transport strategy can solve the problems in Julianstown because a major portion of traffic travelling to Drogheda and east Meath, including HGV traffic to the port, passes through the village.  It clear that the R132 should be designated as a national route in light of the traffic volume and the fact that it is a strategic access route to Drogheda, Laytown and Bettystown, which have a population in the region of 50,000.  It can be upgraded to a national road by ministerial order under section 10 of the Roads Act 1993.  This would be a purely administrative act.</p><p> The Julianstown and District Community Association asks that the R132 be upgraded to a national road; that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport include Julianstown on the capital plan and expedite it; and that Meath County Council adopt meaningful policies in the new county development plan in order to monitor the traffic levels and the environment in Julianstown and to rapidly advance plans for the Julianstown bypass.  For example, it could progress corridor selection in order to avoid granting planning permission, etc.</p><p> Residents of Julianstown hope that public authorities at local and national levels meet their responsibilities to accommodate the population of Drogheda and east Meath with appropriate infrastructure.  Julianstown is being crushed by extreme levels of traffic.  We are fully committed to driving a solution and are prepared to go down the path of litigation if necessary.  We are confident that there have been breaches of EU environmental law and of our fundamental right to a healthy environment.  If the administrative authorities fail to take action, they will be forced to so do by the courts.</p><p> I thank the committee for this opportunity to put evidence before it.  We look forward to answering members' questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.981" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Logue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019092500002#C00200"><p>I wish to reflect on some of the human consequences of the chaos in Julianstown.  As my colleague, Ms U&iacute; Loinsigh, stated, it is the 16th busiest road in the country.  It is busier than many motorways, main arteries and so on.  However, Julianstown is not an artery like other major roads such as the M50.  Rather, it is a blocked artery that will lead to heart attacks for many people, as well as in the political system.  Two years ago, Mr. Foley stated that it was imperative that work begin on finding a solution so as to significantly ease traffic volumes to a level that, as Ms U&iacute; Loinsigh noted, befits a village street.  Apart from the Duleek road which was realigned, roads generally in the east Meath area are the same as they were 200 years ago.  That is not a big issue as far as east Meath is concerned.  We are back to the era of the horse and cart.  Anyone who has attempted to go through Julianstown into Laytown knows that at some narrow points, such as the bridge under the railway line or beside the Church of Ireland church, the road is not wide enough to accommodate two cars.  These roads are hardly adequate for a horse and cart, let alone the traffic volume coming from the east Meath and south Drogheda areas which have an estimated population of 40,000 with a planned increase to 65,00, taking account of zoned land in the area.</p> <p>  It is of note that the traffic count is increasing by 2% per annum which, when calculated on a compound basis, gives a far greater figure than one may expect.  To the best of our knowledge, the traffic counter in Julianstown is located at the school at Whitecross and, as such, does not take account of traffic travelling to or from Drogheda on the R150 Duleek road.   An Aldi supermarket is under construction and will open shortly.  It will bring a far greater volume of traffic from the hinterland and along the R150 Laytown road through Julianstown to Aldi.</p> <p>  I ask members to picture a commuter travelling to work from south Drogheda or east Meath and sitting in a traffic jam which probably extends 1.2 km to 2 km along the road in the direction of Drogheda.  Traffic may be creeping along or at a standstill.  The driver may be under pressure to get to an appointment or be utterly frustrated with the way things are happening.  The situation is even worse in the evenings as traffic becomes backed up on the R132 as far back as the Gormanston interchange or even the slip road onto the M1, which is a safety hazard.  As Ms U&iacute; Loinsigh indicated, it is not just about the financial cost as there is a very significant human cost to this issue.</p> <p>  Ms U&iacute; Loinsigh also referred to the risks to pedestrians.  There is no safe place to cross the R132 between Whitecross school and the village community garden, a distance of 1.2 km.</p></speech>

As one can imagine that opportunity is not available to elderly people.</p> <p>  There are also two aspects to the problem that are not dealt with in any of the material we have seen.  First, there are the traffic jams in the morning and evening.  In between, that is at the non-commuting times and at night, there is very fast-moving traffic which is averaging 70 km per hour in a 50 km per hour zone.  Some of these are heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, carrying petrol and gas and I will leave to the committee to imagine the consequences of an accident in these circumstances.  </p> <p>  We cannot see much progress happening at the moment and believe that eventually this blocked artery will lead to a political issue.</p> <p>  As Ms U&iacute; Loinsigh has stated, air monitoring is a major issue and we have installed such a device at our own cost.  If the air pollution is indicated to exceed EU levels, the local residents will take legal action against the county council and the Department, should that be necessary.  I thank the Chairman and the committee members for listening to us.</p></speech>

In its submission, it was invited to speak about the Julianstown bypass and would have been notified about this.  In the Department's opening statement given to the committee, Julianstown was mentioned twice: once in the headline, and then in the last line.  I am unhappy - and this is not a personal criticism of the witness - with the Department's response where it comes into an Oireachtas committee to talk about the 16th busiest road in the whole of Ireland.  This is totally and woefully inadequate.  The statement makes no reference to the North-South economic corridor, to the development of Drogheda, to the huge developments in east Meath, or the traffic counts.  All of these issues are absent from the Department's contribution.  I note this with regret.  We want to do something today to inform the Department of the real issues involved as it will be its decision, having done due and proper analysis of the facts and figures, to put this road on the national primary road list.</p> <p>  As I understand it - perhaps the county councils can assist me in this - approximately 20,000 cars on average use this road daily.  That is equivalent to the traffic that is using the Port Tunnel travelling in and out of that village.  It is more than that because there are thousands of new homes on their way both in east Meath and in north Drogheda.  The equivalent of the population of the city of Waterford - 60,000 to 70,000 to 80,000 people - will be in this area in ten years time, all funnelling through this road which was built 200 years ago.  This is totally unacceptable.  </p> <p>  The importance of this nationally is for the Department to recognise the pressure that development is putting on places like Julianstown, but also on the commuters who are delayed.  I am delayed, on average, a half an hour a day by going through Julianstown, with the attendant costs to me and other drivers.  The question raised in the report which the council has done, which requires further examination, concerns public transport alternatives to using the motorway.  I welcome the DART development, which is of great importance and will significantly increase capacity.  This is only part of the solution.</p> <p>  I will bring my committee colleagues in now to contribute to the meeting but I ask Meath County Council to address that issue in terms of the four options they have looked at for the future.  The weakness in its case - which is not a personal one - is that it needs to examine further the public transport options.  </p> <p>  The Department needs to consider how it ought to respond now.  I point out to the Department that as Chairman I sought a briefing note and I got it from the Department two months ago.  It is far more comprehensive, with respect, than its opening statement here today.  Whoever was talking to the Department did not tell it anything about the story of Julianstown.  None of the problems or issues was iterated.</p> <p>  I welcome local councillors Paddy Meade and Annie Hoey, who are very concerned about this issue.  I hope these proceedings will inform the council's debate also.  I call Deputy Breathnach and then Deputy Munster.</p></speech>

The constituency of Louth stretches from Omeath to Julianstown.  I particularly welcome Mr. Des Foley, alluded to by the Chairman, with whom I have soldiered on Louth County Council and Drogheda for a long time and, equally, welcome the representatives of the Department and the residents association.  I commend the latter on the difficulties it is experiencing in the presentation of Julianstown because of the traffic issue.  Every time I go through the village I find huge improvements through the efforts of the Tidy Towns and their association.</p> <p>  Without being repetitive, it is important to stress the area of Drogheda south, of Bettystown, Laytown and Julianstown, has exploded exponentially, from the time I was a young man who went on summer holidays to Bettystown.  To try to find one's way around this town is exasperating, to say the least, compared with the way it was many years ago.</p> <p>  We can blame planning and all sorts of issues around the growth of transport, but the reality is that the Border corridor, as it has often been described - with an equidistance between Dublin and Belfast - has created the huge growth in the area.  I am here today to support the residents' view that the village is being "crushed" by traffic.  As a public representative, I testify to this congestion that I experience on a daily basis.  There is a safety issue not just in relation to the village but whether one is coming on the motorway or having to traverse the traffic flows.  With a 2% growth in traffic, there will be a problem on the motorway very shortly, as has been alluded to, unless the Department sits up and takes note.  Congestion, pollution, and health and safety are all huge issues.  I would certainly not like to see a legal approach to this matter with it going into the courts.  </p> <p>  The designation of road as a national route, with the provision of a bypass, needs to be ramped up.  We are all aware that the road network is the lifeline for all communities but no community should suffer to the degree that Julianstown is suffering.  This issue needs to be prioritised and expedited in the next number of years.  I commend the residents for their presentation and assure them that whatever efforts we, as members of the Oireachtas, particularly from the Louth and East Meath constituency, can make, we will, to try to impress upon the Department and the Minister the need to prioritise this route.  I am delighted that the residents group has come here today to highlight the fact that this is one of the busiest road networks and to seek the help from the Department to prioritise this project and alleviate that congestion.</p><p>I started by describing this area as an economic corridor.  The people at the centre of that economic corridor are living almost equidistant from Dublin and Dundalk, and also at the centre of development between Dublin and Belfast.  It is a great place to live.  People who use it as a suburb from which to travel to work in Dublin or Belfast are frustrated and need to be supported, particularly those travelling to and from Dublin every day.</p><p> I support Mr. Logue's comments on the R132 road into Laytown.  It is beyond me how cars can pass each other on portions of that road.  Something must be done with regard to the railway bridge in Laytown to prevent a serious accident, although I am sure there have been accidents.</p><p> I commend the presentation and hope it will highlight the need to ramp up the priority given to this important road project for our region.</p></speech>

People have to see it to believe it.  Trying to cross the road in the middle of the village of Julianstown involves taking one's life in one's hands.  It is like trying to cross an extremely busy dual carriageway.  It is almost impossible.</p> <p>  Meath County Council has submitted the business case for the project.  Mr. Mullaney stated: "At preliminary appraisal, the local authority application needs to demonstrate sufficient analysis to underpin an assessment of the merits or otherwise of the scheme."  The Department received the business case in December last.  Based on that business case, has the local authority demonstrated exactly what the Department would call for in a preliminary appraisal?  Has it demonstrated the merits of the case for a bypass?</p></speech>

There is one particular aspect of the appraisal on which we are seeking more information.  It relates to the public transport analysis.  We believe that an origin and destination survey is required to identify where people are coming from and where they are going to.  The reason I say that is that before we rule out a public transport option - I am not saying what the correct option is at this stage - we need to see what the possibilities are for people being able to use buses or trains.  TII estimates that it takes between eight and 13 years to bring a road from start to finish.  In a case such as this, it could take between eight and ten years, which is a long time.  By that time, it is hoped the NDP will have delivered major public transport improvements on the rail corridor to Drogheda and Dundalk.  That is the analysis that needs to be done before we decide that the road option is the appropriate one.</p></speech>

Many people using east Meath routes are from the area.  The ongoing congestion is the result of significant developments in the area.</p></speech>

The tender has issued.  It will be much quicker than 2027 because it will not be necessary to wait for the electrification of the line.  Maybe we could ask the clerk of the committee whether it is in order to write to the National Transport Authority to get clarity on that.  The DART will run to Drogheda before electrification and each DART train will be capable of carrying upwards of 1,000 passengers.  It is an important analysis that has to be done.</p></speech>

It will take time to procure it.  I know many people appear here and state that procurement is an issue; it is the same for us.  It typically takes two months for us to procure someone to undertake such a survey.  Some companies, however, have information available now that we might be able to tap into.  It is expensive, but Google and Bluetooth have information we might be able to use.  The process could take about six to nine months.  Generally, I underestimate the time needed because of my optimism bias, but I estimate that it could be done in six months.</p></speech>

I agree with Mr. Mullaney regarding the process.  The Department and TII are bound by the same process of the public spending code and the capital appraisal framework.  Regarding accelerating the scheme, if there is to be a bypass, there is no advantage to be gained by going to the TII to accelerate it.  We must be careful about jumping to that as the conclusion.  There is a process to be gone through.  Listening to the debate, it is important to note that this is not the beginning and end of all the project appraisal that will be done during the scheme.  It is an iterative process that will get progressively more detailed as we go through it.</p></speech>

If Meath County Council and the Department agree to proceed, I ask them to communicate with us after those discussions.  That would commence the process.</p> <p>  I also want to raise another issue.  Part of the problem with massive construction is that it is almost a builders' paradise.  There is almost a concrete jungle in east Meath at this stage.  Quality of life is being seriously and adversely impacted by the lack of proper public transport, although there have been improvements recently regarding Bus &Eacute;ireann services.  The question of green space remains, however.  Is every green field going to be built on?  Is there going to be a zone where there will not be untrammelled and unfettered development by builders and speculators?  What is the future for east Meath?</p></speech>

Regarding the first point, we will have further discussions with the Department on the draft pre-appraisal report.  We will follow through on the aspects mentioned previously, including the origin and destination survey that needs to be done and the public transport elements of the report that need further analysis.  We can certainly do that.  We will get into early discussions, following this meeting, with our colleagues in the Department to try to finalise those elements of the report.  Turning to the further development of Drogheda and east Meath, Meath County Council has started working on a review of the county development plan for the next six years.  The councillors will be getting briefings on this process soon.</p> <p>  I will give some details of our population projections, starting with Drogheda.  It is recognised as a regional growth centre in the national planning framework.  Our current population figures indicate that Drogheda has a population of 41,000 people.  That is set to increase to 50,000 people by 2031.  The current population of east Meath is 11,800 people.  The county development plan sets out a policy of consolidation there.  By 2026, the lifetime of this new county development plan, the population projection for east Meath is 13,300 people.  There will, therefore, be some growth.  The main emphasis, however, will be on consolidation. </p></speech>

People are fed up of long daily commutes.  According to the CSO, residents in east Meath have the longest commuting times in the country.  The average commute is one hour and 30 minutes.  I appreciate, however, that Mr. Foley might not be aware of that.  Major issues exist in Drogheda and east Meath.  A new focus on the overall development of both communities is necessary.  Closer alignment of the two councils is suggested within proposed legislation.  Joined-up thinking and incisive and decisive actions is needed.  I appreciate the departmental officials listening to us, and we understand their theoretical position.</p><p>We need to really put a bomb under the Department on this issue because east Meath and Drogheda are a timebomb as the area is developing without adequate infrastructure.  That is certainly the case for Julianstown.  </p></speech>

Following the meeting, I wrote to the chief executive of TII and asked to meet him to discuss this important issue.  He responded yesterday evening but did not respond to my request to meet him.  I am concerned about that and consider it unacceptable that he will not meet the Chairman of the committee to discuss the matter further and other issues that may arise.  I propose that, with the consent of the committee, we write to TII seeking transparency and accountability on its decision to cease the tender of the project, and seeking its files and documents from 30 September.  I believe that was the date, although I will confirm that with the clerk to the committee later, on which it instructed Louth County Council not to proceed.  It is appropriate and proper that we request all the documentation and reports TII has relating the decision.  When we receive them, we should consider them but in the meantime, with members' permission, I will write formally again to the chief executive and seek a meeting with him.</p> <p>  I turn to minority sports in Ireland.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has been active in encouraging the committee to identify, support, laud and applaud successful people in minority sports in our country.  We are delighted that, at his request, the following representatives from Rowing Ireland are present: Ms Michelle Carpenter, chief executive; Mr. Eamon Colclough, president; and Mr. Neville Maxwell, Olympian, chairman of the Rowing Ireland high performance committee and member of the board.  I also welcome Ms Sanita Puspure, Olympian, twice world gold medallist and 2019 European champion in the Olympic boat class, and Mr. Phil Doyle, world silver medallist in the Olympic boat class.  Their achievements are fantastic.  Finally, I welcome Ms Eimear Lambe, Ms Aifric Keogh, Ms Claire Feerick, Ms Mary Moloney, Mr. Stephen King, Mr. Fran Keane, Mr. Dominic Casey, Mr. Ronan Byrne, Mr. Fintan McCarthy, Mr. Leo Gibson, Ms Monica Dukarska and Ms Tara O'Hanlon, who are sitting in the Public Gallery.  Our guests are very welcome and we are delighted for them to appear before the committee.  It is great to see so many people achieving so much in sport.</p> <p>  I invite Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh to address the committee.</p></speech>

It is a special occasion because it is the first time that Rowing Ireland has presented to an Oireachtas committee, but also because of what Rowing Ireland does and how it inspires people whom its board members do not know and will never meet.  In some cases, a board member could walk down a street 50 yd. away from a rower, and the latter might not see or hear what the former does.</p><p>We need inspiration in our country in many ways and people like the delegates to give it to us.</p><p> I am particularly grateful to the Chairman, the executive and my colleagues for totally supporting the request I made that the delegates come to address the committee and the people of Ireland.  The proceedings are available live on the Oireachtas television channel.  In Ireland we must all become much more aware of what the delegates do and the efforts they make.  I speak specifically to Mr. Colclough, Ms Carpenter and Mr. Maxwell as members of the executive, as well as the team around them in terms of what they achieve.  I will not speak for long now as it is not for me to speak for them.</p><p> Just over six years ago I had a heart attack and was quite ill.  My heart stopped and I asked myself what I would do.  When a great guy from Galway, Mr. P&aacute;draig Bree, asked me to go rowing, I said I would never be able to do it, but I went and it was the finest thing I did in the six years since.  I have met people from the Tribesmen rowing club who have inspired me to keep going and fighting, telling me that life is about what one can do, not the obstacles before us.  Rowing Ireland does this for many people, including me.  It is an incredible privilege that the delegates are here and they will be in the audiovisual room at 2 p.m. to address all Deputies and Senators on what Rowing Ireland is about, what its challenges are and what it has achieved with little or no resources.  I got to know a little about what rowing was about a good few years ago as I went to school at the "Jes" in Galway where I used to teach  I had some awareness of rowing.  As I lived in Connemara, I had to get a bus in and out and did not have time to go training.  I go to know some of the athletes, including incredible people like Sam Lynch and others.  They put in huge effort and had pride in the jersey which is equal to that of any international athlete in any place.  We are very privileged to have it.</p><p> The purpose of the meeting is to enable the delegates to share some of their story, what they are doing and trying to achieve.  I also want the State to acknowledge this and give the financial support to which are entitled and deserve.  They are punching so much above their weight without sufficient resources.  It is incumbent on us to support Rowing Ireland properly, at least in order that its rowers can fight on a level playing field with the New Zealanders, the British and all other countries of the world that are receiving resources way over and above what they get here.  I know that all of the athletes are dependent on their parents, families and friends just to get by.  That is not good enough.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.1058" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Michelle Carpenter" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019092500002#M00300"><p>I am joined by Mr. Eamonn Colclough, president of Rowing Ireland, and Mr. Neville Maxwell, chairman of our high performance committee and board member, as well as by world silver medalist Mr. Philip Doyle and twice world gold medallist Ms Sanita Pu&scaron;pure.  I thank the joint committee for giving us the opportunity to present on the challenges facing minority sports in Ireland.</p> <p>  There is one week every four years when the mass media cover minority sports.  It is the first week of the Olympic Games.  However, in recent Olympiad the amateur ethos has been abandoned and we have seen the introduction of professional soccer, basketball, tennis and rugby.  This development has resulted in an incursion into the domain of minority sports as the summer Olympiad has a ceiling of 10,500 athletes and the introduction of the sports I mentioned has resulted in a reduced allocation of athletes in traditional Olympic sports.</p> <p>  There are many challenges facing minority sports in Ireland and they are exacerbated by the overwhelming media coverage of major sports like Gaelic games and professional sports such as soccer and rugby.  When opening an Irish newspaper, people observe that these sports enjoy 90% of sports coverage.  They are mainly mass participation sports in that the games can fill a stadium, although their coverage does not regularly extend our sporting success as a nation.  The former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has stated "the nation unites when [we] succeed on the international stage.  All sport is a powerful force in creating social harmony."  Minority sports, however successful, are conducted in a virtual media vacuum and, therefore, struggle to attract significant commercial sponsorship.  They rely on remittances from participants, the excellent sports capital grant system and Sport Ireland funding.  However, what pride and achievement they bring to a country when they bring home those medals.  This affects not only the country's mood but also the economy as a whole.  To those of us involved in minority sports, it is a source of amazement that such a vast amount of State funding goes into the major sports which enjoy in our perception vast financing by gate receipts, television coverage and commercial sponsorship.  Most of these significant sports have the luxury of being held behind high walls, which enables them to command significant income from gate receipts.</p> <p>  In the 2016 Olympiad in Rio de Janeiro Ireland won its first Olympic rowing medal.  In a post-race interview after the semi-final our two athletes decided to have a bit of craic with the interviewer.  The interview was so refreshingly different from the media trained, clich&eacute; ridden conversations that it went viral.  With that, the O'Donovan brothers became an Internet sensation.  In Rowing Ireland we assumed we would be able to capitalise on this publicity to attract significant commercial sponsorship.  However, despite contacting dozens of Irish firms and corporations, the media circus had quickly moved back to major sports and it became evident that if a sport was in a virtual media blackout for all but one week of the Olympiad, commercial sponsors were not interested.  I have been fortunate to be involved in rowing since I was 13 years old.  Rowing has followed me from Limerick city and its six rowing clubs to Dublin and the banks of the River Liffey throughout my career in Strasbourg and Frankfurt and back to Ireland.  I have seen the benefits, as have my colleagues, of the sport of rowing.  They are dedication, hard work, perseverance and the ability to work alone and in a team.  It sounds like a job specification, but it is what we learn with our sport.</p> <p>  One of our first achievements when I took over as chief executive officer was launching our strategic plan last year and its four main pillars.  The first pillar is "Rowing for All: A Sport for Life".  In 2019 Rowing Ireland has increased its membership by 25%.  This total does not include anyone who does not race and just rows for pleasure or recreationally.  They are licensed, competitive members, but there are thousands more members of Rowing Ireland.  Rowing Ireland also has 30,000 individual students as part of the Get Going, Get Rowing programme, a schools programme that allows students to row, with a pathway to clubs and on-the-water rowing.  In 2019 we had numerous students from the Get Going, Get Rowing programme who went on to clubs and represent Ireland at junior international level.</p> <p>  Being in line with the national physical activity plan is key for us in Rowing Ireland, working with all ages and abilities, from women in sport to men on the move, as well as children and young people with autism, Down's syndrome and other skills.  We see no barriers in our sport.</p><p>Although we may be considered a minority sport with only racing licence memberships captured, we punch well above our weight and work hand in hand with our local sports partnerships, as is recommended under the national physical activity plan.<br/><br/>Our second pillar is leading our sport.  With a small staff base and limited resources, we strive to do this.  We are one of the few national governing bodies that has achieved the governance code of Ireland.  Despite constraints, we will continue to strive to be an innovative national governing body using effective and efficient internal structures and systems.<br/><br/>Our third pillar involves supporting clubs.  Rowing clubs are the hub of our sport.  Many are located in areas of socioeconomic need and cater for all.  Most of our clubs are struggling with volunteers and the ability to provide for new members.  However, last year, our Irish championships, which took place at the National Rowing Centre in Cork, had the highest ever number of participants with thousands racing over three days.  Our regattas are seeing record numbers and clubs have the highest ever membership.  We have clubs that cater from the ages of eight to 88 across the 32 counties of Ireland from Cork to Antrim, Galway to Dublin.<br/><br/>Last but not least is the pillar of the sport of which we are so proud, namely, high performance.  Our objective is to excel.  We had five athletes after the Olympic Games in Rio, two of whom retired.  In August 2017, when our high-performance director joined our team, we had 11 lightweight rowers in our programme, a category in which Ireland has always been steadfast.  However, we were aware that the lightweight programme may be slashed from the Olympic Games and we needed to up our game.  Two years later, we have nine lightweight men and women and ten open weight men and women.  Three of those open weight boats have qualified for the Olympic Games.  We are now in a different place.  We are ranked second in the world in Olympic boat classes ahead of our rivals in Germany and Great Britain and such great rowing nations as the US and Australia.  We have qualified more boats than ever before.  Four boats will go to Tokyo to represent us.  With three world championship medals in Olympic class boats, we are poised and ready for it in less than 37 weeks' time.  We will not stop there because we are also confident we can qualify a fifth boat at next week's regatta in Lucerne.  In addition, we have an amazing athlete - Katie O'Brien - who took home a bronze medal in this year's PR2 event.  She was trained by a volunteer coach all year.  If one was to look at research on world rowing, one would see that it is a well-known fact in coaching that it takes &euro;1 million per year per boat to win an Olympic medal.  It also takes one-to-one coaching of crews.  We have qualified on a fraction on that.  Pathways are crucial.  In 2019, we won two medals - silver and bronze - at the World Rowing Under 23 Championships.  The winners were also coached by volunteer coaches.  Our junior men's four came fourth in the World Rowing Junior Championships while the same crew won a silver medal at the European championships.  Our future is bright.  We are ready for Tokyo and the benefit it will bring us as a country.  Sport provides a platform for people to come together and support their country.  International events like the Olympic Games serve as a point around which to rally and show national pride and unity.  We are ready to drive this.  Despite efforts, we still do not have a large sponsor or philanthropist to support us.  As stated, most minority sports suffer from this ailment.  Despite our success, it seems few want to invest in our journey to Tokyo and the dream and reality of Olympic medals.  We rely on Sport Ireland for funding and are very grateful for its support.  As an organisation and a country, we must give our athletes, who dedicate their lives to training more than 15 times per week, the dream and reality of medals.  It is also important to support the pathway so that we can continue until Paris and Los Angeles.<br/><br/>I will conclude with the words of our high-performance director in his recent summary of our position.  He stated:</p><blockquote>With three Olympic class medals, Ireland was ranked 2nd in the world for the Olympic Boat categories (not including the Para), surpassing all objectives and expectations and in doing so breaking Rowing Ireland records.  With three medals and four crews selected for the Olympics, we are no longer the Irish <i>underdogs</i>, but we are now what countries and crews worldwide will look at and think of when training and striving to improve their performances.  This means that we have now set a bar and that more than ever, we as a team must be even more dedicated, committed, and focused.  We must strive to look for ways to improve and keep our foot firmly flat on the accelerator.<br /><br />All our opponents will put the photos of our medallist athletes on their mirrors because they are the ones to beat.</blockquote></speech>

If there is anything this committee can do to help Rowing Ireland, it will do it.  Hopefully, some potential sponsors will appear on foot of this meeting.  Some people might like to get involved anyway.  Achieving at the highest level is fantastic.  Participating is equally important.  I visited Kew Gardens about two Saturdays ago.  There were hundreds of people rowing on the river there.  It took about two hours to go by so there is considerable interest and participation.  I welcome the increased participation about which Ms Carpenter spoke.  Believe it or not, I rowed in my youth.  Ms Carpenter probably does not know Gerry Daly but he might be listening.  He was a local solicitor at the time who got us all involved.  We had a great time as well as a great club so there is a social side to it as well.  Friendships are made.  The important thing about rowing is that people are all together.  It is about teamwork and organisation.</p> <p>  I will take Senator O'Mahony first but does any witness wish to say anything else?  Our guests are more than welcome to offer any views they might have at any time - they do not have to do so now.  We want to hear their thoughts.</p></speech>

These are the prime athletes in Irish sport.  Ms Pu&scaron;pure, who is beside me, is the golden woman of Irish sport with two World Championship medals - one gold and one silver.  It is an amazing privilege.  I started rowing in the 1960s.  It was beyond our wildest dreams and it was not until the 1970s that Se&aacute;n Drea almost single-handedly dragged us into the sport closely followed by the Garda coxed fours rowing team.  We decided then rather than having individuals or clubs doing it, we would open up a national squad so that talented athletes from all the clubs throughout the 32 counties could have the opportunity to be brought together, nurtured and developed - not only to compete with the best but to beat the best.  We have been phenomenally successful.  How well our athletes have done has been a revelation.  I was at a FISA congress after the World Championships this year at which several people, including the president of FISA and the great Sir Steve Redgrave, the five-time Olympic champion, came over to me.  Here I was - the humble Irishman - sitting down with my votes at the congress but the number of people who came up to me and asked about what we were doing in Ireland and how we were doing it was amazing because they know we work on a shoestring.  Of course, it is down to hard work.  In our high-performance director, Antonio Maurogiovanni, we have the Alex Ferguson of rowing and I hope we can keep him because he has been so phenomenally successful.  The committee has no concept of how hard the athletes train.  Why are they beating everybody else in the world?  It is because they train harder than everybody else.</p><p>There is no inspiration and it is not the air down in Cork, although Cork has a reputation for producing fabulous athletes.  They train harder than everyone else.  They are truly amazing people.  The demands placed on them are phenomenal.</p></speech>

I compliment Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh on inviting them to attend.  This meeting is an opportunity for them to highlight their needs.  I congratulate them on overcoming the obstacles to bring so much success and glory to the country.  Everyone is there to greet the athletes at airport arrivals, but it is the dark days and difficult training that goes on behind the scenes that no one sees that need to be supported.</p> <p>  The sports capital grant for facilities comes in at some stage, but what funding does Rowing Ireland get as the governing body?  When the Olympic Federation of Ireland or Sport Ireland appear before us, we hear of how targets are always set for the number of medals to be won at Olympic Games.  Some of us made a suggestion a number of years ago.  Britain had targeted cycling at some stage.  In this case, Rowing Ireland has broken through the glass ceiling in terms of performances and medals.  Surely there is a case to be made - I would support this committee making such a recommendation - to view rowing as an opportunity to win more medals.  After the few weeks of each Olympic Games, we all look at the medals table.  Poor old Ireland might have done well in boxing and so on, but we have an open opportunity in this case.  A discrimination needs to be made.  As the witnesses stated, they find it difficult to attract large sponsors.  I have been a member of the GAA for years and I know the great work it does, but there is a need for us as a country to target those areas where we can be successful.  Rowing Ireland has demonstrated success in recent years, which has bounced up on our radar.  Now, we need to grasp the opportunity in whatever way we can to support Rowing Ireland in continuing its great work.</p> <p>  The Australian Prime Minister's comments about sport inspiring people were mentioned.  I happened to be speaking at a summer school this year and my theme was how sport could unite and inspire in a way that politics and other activities could not, especially these days.  In preparation, I switched on the "Nine O'Clock News" the night before.  Apart from the sport news, everything shown was a bad news story: a mass murder in the US, a dissident attack in Northern Ireland, Brexit and so on.  Suddenly, the programme went over to the sport.  Rowing Ireland had many successes over the summer months, and one of the items on the segment was rowing.  There were other successes in golf.  As such, the only good news stories in that news programme had to do with sport.  It was the only inspiration.</p> <p>  This presents an opportunity.  Rowing Ireland mentioned that its sport did not get media coverage, although I hope that is changing, particularly in the context of 20X20 in respect of female sports.  There needs to be increased media coverage of minority sports.  The majority sports will always get coverage.</p> <p>  I compliment the witnesses.  Whenever the Olympic Council of Ireland or Sport Ireland appear before us, I will push so that minority sports that have proven themselves via medals get positive discrimination in the form of extra funding.</p></speech>

In New Zealand, which is a country of the same size, the budget is equivalent to &euro;3 million.  Out of the &euro;600,000, we also run the National Rowing Centre.  Using some other core money, we run programmes like the Get Going, Get Rowing programme and support clubs.  Funding the National Rowing Centre costs us &euro;100,000 out of that pot of money.  The athletes here will testify as to how it can be a cold place in the winter, as we are trying to save the pennies.  Much of our budget goes on camps, which are important.  Ireland is an island on the west coast of Europe, on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.  Since mileage is key with rowing, it is important that we get to sunnier climates.  It is similar to what is done with cycling in Majorca.  Our camps can take up a sixth of the budget in the blink of an eye.</p></speech>

Ms Carpenter referred to Irish rowing punching above its weight.  We all have to acknowledge that.  Rowing Ireland even punched above its weight in getting to appear before this committee.  It was only March 2018 when its former CEO, Mr. Hamish Adams, presented to us on behalf of minority sports.</p> <p>  The topic of national television coverage was mentioned.  When I was a young man, we always used to watch swimming, gymnastics, rowing and perhaps one or two other sports at the Olympics outside of the field and track events.  Coverage has grown immensely since.</p> <p>  I wish to clarify something that was said about participation in the upcoming Olympics.  Is Rowing Ireland limited by the number of boats or by time qualification?  If each of its athletes achieved a qualifying time for the Olympics, how would participation be limited?  It was mentioned that, owing to the increase in the number of athletes going to the Olympics due to an increase in the number of sports, Rowing Ireland was being forced to reduce its participation at a time when it was becoming more successful in terms of qualification times.  Ms Carpenter might elaborate on that point.</p> <p>  I am a Corkman and the most well-known rowing club near to me is in Fermoy.  I will not go into the water difficulties it faces because of the problem with the weir, but it puts on a tremendous show, has great volunteers and supplies good athletes.  Famous names down through the years include Mr. Gear&oacute;id Towey and Fr. Pat Rice.  A great deal of work has gone into it, as has capital investment.  It is okay for the athlete, but the rowing club has to pay for the boats.  Submissions have been made to the Government, including by representatives on Rowing Ireland's behalf, about getting a VAT reduction on equipment.  That would be a major plus.</p> <p>  Another issue is funding.  I note Rowing Ireland's concerns about sponsorships going to larger sporting events.  There is a suggestion that philanthropic bodies be given a tax exemption to supply it with funding.  That has been advocated for by one of the umbrella organisations, the Federation of Irish Sport.</p> <p>  The Government launched its sport policy document just over 12 months ago.  Everyone signed up to it.</p><p>Is Rowing Ireland happy that it is going the right way from its perspective?  Could it go faster?  Should more be done within that policy document to enable Rowing Ireland's support to progress further?  I acknowledge Rowing Ireland's point about regulatory compliance.  As that causes enormous expense for Rowing Ireland, has it been taken into account when funding is being allocated by Sport Ireland and other bodies?  I wish Rowing Ireland every success.  I am delighted to see the witnesses in attendance.  We have many aspiring rowers for the years ahead present.  Maybe some of them have medals already in juvenile competition.  We wish them all the best.</p></speech>

He has a small bit of bother at the moment and he said there is only one man who can save him before he is sent on a further journey and that is the Chairman of the Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p> <p>  I wish to pay tribute to the athletes.  I know they are not in it to participate.  They are in it to win and that is made all the harder by the lack of funding.  We saw what happened when hockey had its tremendous success when the silver medal was achieved in the world cup.  That was a similar story of an underfunded organisation.  Then there was the promise of funding, when it was given &euro;1 million, but it was not quite as it had been initially portrayed.  Rowing Ireland outlined the issue that it is operating on a budget that is a fraction of that of New Zealand.  The figure of &euro;1 million per boat and the requirement for one-to-one coaching is quite stark.  Luckily enough, we are in pre-budget season so this is the right time for Rowing Ireland to be asking for money.  As Sport Ireland will be before the committee on 16 October, what change can this committee ask of Sport Ireland, on Rowing Ireland's behalf, that is available and can be done?  I agree with my colleagues that those who are excelling should get a bonus because of the hard work they have done over the years.  I also wish to hear from the rowers themselves.  I thank them for their attendance but we did not ask them to be here just for the photo opportunity.  We also want to hear their points of view because it is they who must get up in the dark mornings in the cold winter.  We can imagine how difficult it is but we would like to hear from them on what they would like to see changed in the system that would assist them to achieve their full potential.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.1079" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phil Doyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019092500002#P00700"><p>I will respond to Senator Mark Daly on one thing we could change for the athletes.  As well as receiving funding from the Government, Rowing Ireland receives separate funding on our performances throughout the year from Sport Ireland.  This funding runs from January to January.  It starts on 1 January when one becomes a carded athlete.  One then receives one's first payment on 1 April and there are three-monthly payments ranging from &euro;12,000 to &euro;20,000 and up to &euro;40,000, depending on performance.  For example, there are certain people who have won the world championships in September and now they are expected to not be in university and to be funded by parents, family and friends.  Commercial sponsorship is difficult to get.  I was such an athlete last September and there are athletes in the same position now.  There is no review of funding and performance between January of one year and January of the next year.  These individuals are expected to fully fund themselves in Cork during an accommodation crisis.  I am a Northern athlete from Belfast and the rent prices are extortionate in Cork.  Getting rental accommodation is difficult.  Putting down a deposit, paying the first month of rent and all the additional costs are also difficult.  Athletes are expected to do that without receiving a penny until April.  That is seven months of athletes fully supporting and funding themselves while rowing full-time.  Feeding a rower is difficult as well and it costs a lot of money.  My mum has been complaining about it non-stop for the last month because I have moved home after the world championships.</p> <p>  Something in the system that could be looked into is to reassess funding requirements and to make changes to it throughout the year.  For example, because I am from the North, I get access to Great Britain and Ireland.  I have made my decision and am very happy with it but I have a lot of contacts over there and they get funding reassessments three or four times per year.  As athletes move in and out of the squad and the system, and as they perform or do not perform, they have their funding adjusted according to their needs.  That would be massively helpful, especially in getting people onto the programme.  For example, I am qualified as a doctor so last year I had to go back to work for four months over Christmas because I could not afford to row full-time coming out of university with no money, savings or job.  As my parents could not afford to keep me down in Cork full-time, I had to take time out of the boat, which meant my doubles partner, Ronan Byrne, was on his own in Cork and I was training on my own in Belfast while working a full-time job in a hospital to try to get through because there was no way to reassess my requirements or funding needs during that time.  Eventually, when I knew the money would be coming in on 1 April I had some savings and was able to make the transition down to Cork.  I do not know how people do that without having a job to go to in the middle of Christmas.  It must be very difficult.</p></speech>

Rowers have to take in many calories every day and the cost of that alone is enormous.  Some sports require larger calorie intakes than others and I presume Sport Ireland does not take account of that.  The grant is literally a one-size-fits-all operation.  Sport Ireland will be in front of the committee but the budget planning is also ongoing and I know everyone is in agreement with the proposals that when one is excelling, one should get more and there should be a bonus payment.  We would like Rowing Ireland to write to us after this meeting outlining what it is asking for, especially in light of the fact there is such a gap of over half a year between becoming eligible for funding and the cheque coming in the post.  That is when performance will dip because if one has to go back to work's performance will decrease as a result of not being able to train full-time.</p></speech>

The athletes pay 23% of the overall cost of these vital camps out of the funding we receive.  A person who is not receiving that funding is charged &euro;600 to go to Italy for three weeks and to kill himself or herself in a boat.  It is difficult to come to terms with that.  For the camp before the recent world championships and the world championships themselves, we received a bill for going.  It is pay-for-play for medals.  That is something that could be looked at and changed to provide additional funding to cover the athlete's payment for going to the competition.  I know some athletes in other sports and they have never heard of this idea of paying a levy.</p></speech>

Does it not matter if it is an Olympic year or not?  Does Sport Ireland not see one year as any different to the other?  That does not make a lot of sense.</p></speech>

They only came on the scene this year and some of them had been developmental athletes.</p><p>They would not have been on the carding criteria or were only on a small amount from the carding criteria.  They will have to wait until next April to receive it, which adds to the stress and strain.  When one should be focusing on one's boat and being the person in the mirror, one is instead focusing on how to pay one's rent.</p></speech>

There are few sports globally where one has to pay to represent one's country, one comes home with a medal and that is it.  That should be looked at.  We have to do it this way because of the way the funding is divided.  We have a programme in place, a dream and a strategy to have far more crews at the Olympic Games and world championships and to win many more medals than we are talking about here today.  All we need is the funding.  The athletes are in clubs around the country.  They are looking at the people here today, having seen them on television, and want to achieve and emulate what the people here have done.  We are showing them how to do it but we need more people to coach them and to look after them.  We need to have a system in place where they can come down to Cork and train or train in different centres around the country.  We have a good blueprint that we are not showing to any other country.  It is our secret but we have a great attitude among our athletes, volunteers and coaches.  We are like a start-up business at present.  We need the funding to grow this.  Our target for 2024 and 2028 is far beyond what we have done so far this year.</p></speech>

Ultimately, it comes back to the number that Ms Carpenter mentioned earlier, of &euro;690,000.  We won four world championship medals, three of them in an Olympic category this year alone, but we are significantly underfunded as a sport relative to our peers in other countries.  Imagine what we could do if we had double or triple the funding.</p></speech>

In an Olympic year, why would an organisation be paid in October when it needs funding in the run-up to the Olympics?  We need to ask Sport Ireland why it is not making the sensible decision in that regard.  Athletes who have qualified for the Olympics should be peaking in the run-up to the games.  We need to establish why Sport Ireland does not front-load the money in Olympic years for people who qualify for the Olympics and appear out of nowhere; although I know nobody really appears out of nowhere when qualifying for the Olympics.  We seek solutions.  If the witnesses identify the problems and solutions, we would like to propose those to Sport Ireland, including asking the Minister to bring forward its budget.  The money will still have to be spent and allocated but there is no point in giving Rowing Ireland money between October and December when the Olympics is now another three and a half years away.  We wanted the witnesses to raise those issues and the practical day-to-day problems with rent and accommodation, and a person having to wait for seven months for the money when he or she is a qualifier.  If the witnesses come up with any other solutions between now and 16 October, please bring them to us and we will be able to raise them with Sport Ireland and the Minister.</p></speech>

I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off.  This is important as it causes serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p><p>I welcome all our witnesses from key parts of the transport sector to update the committee on the implications of Brexit for the transport sector and preparations for Brexit.  In May and June 2017, we had valuable engagements with these key organisations: the National Transport Authority, NTA, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and the Irish Rail and the Freight Transport Association, IRFTA.  It was clear even then that transport links for individuals and freight would be one of the major challenges.  Whatever happens in the next couple of weeks, transport links will be one of the most immediate and visible impacts of Brexit.  We very much appreciate all these experts making time to be available to us again today.  We look forward to learning from them as much as we did on the previous occasion.</p><p>Before inviting the witnesses to make their remarks, I remind everyone of the rules on privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I reiterate my appeal to members and witnesses about switching off their mobile phones.  Before inviting our guests to make their remarks, I must point out that the Seanad is sitting and we are subject to votes being called.  If we are called to a vote, we will suspend briefly.

I understand that the committee wishes to focus on the impact on transport of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  To assist me in dealing with the committee's subsequent questions, I am joined by Ms Anneliese Jones, public transport regulation manager with the NTA.</p> <p>  Before dealing with the specific area of focus, I would like to set the context by providing a brief overview of the remit of the NTA in the provision of public transport services.  The remit of the authority is to regulate and develop the provision of integrated public transport services - bus, rail, light rail and taxi - by public and private operators in the State, to secure the development and implementation of an integrated transport system within the greater Dublin area, and to contribute to the effective integration of transport and land use planning across the State.</p> <p>  In addition to its statutory responsibilities, the NTA has various arrangements with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to discharge functions on its behalf.  These include the assignment of responsibility to the authority for integrated local and rural transport, including provision of the rural transport programme.  The authority is, therefore, an agency that implements Government and departmental policy in line with its legislation.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport plays a key role in managing any change in legislation or regulation required for the management of cross-Border public transport services.</p> <p>  The NTA is responsible for securing the provision of public transport services through two specified mechanisms, namely, public service contracts, where services cannot be provided on a commercial basis, and the licensing of public bus services, which is operated on a commercial basis.  The main relevant legislation is the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, as amended by the Vehicle Clamping Act 2015 and the Public Transport Act 2016.</p> <p>  The focus of my statement today is on the regulation of cross-Border bus services and to give the members an update since my previous statement to this committee.  I believe my colleagues from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will update them on cross-Border rail services.</p> <p>  Regarding cross-Border bus services, currently, all bus and coach traffic to and from the UK is regulated by Regulation [EC] No. 1073/2009 on the common rules for access to the international market for coach and bus services.  This regulation applies to regular, special regular, occasional, and cabotage operations.  The NTA is the designated competent authority to issue authorisations and control documents and to authorise cabotage operations under this regulation.  The Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland is the competent authority for Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  Once the UK leaves the EU, it will automatically become a third country.  In the longer term, the Interbus Agreement is the legal framework that will provide a basis for the carriage of passengers by bus and coach between Ireland and the UK after the withdrawal date.</p><p>At present, this only applies to the international occasional services between certain non-member states and member states.  It does not apply to regular international services, national services, the use of buses and coaches designed to carry passengers for the transport of goods for commercial purposes or to own-account occasional services.  A protocol to the Interbus Agreement covering regular passenger transport services was negotiated between the contracting parties, but it is not expected to enter into force in time to be a viable alternative.  To cover this gap in regular international services, as well as allowing for any delay in the accession of the UK to the interbus protocol, Regulation [EU] 2019/ 501 was adopted by the EU on 25 March 2019, to ensure the continuation of regular authorised services.  As a further contingency measure, the Government enacted in March 2019 the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019.  Once commenced, that will amend both the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 to enable the authority to authorise and regulate services with third countries.<br/><br/>However, neither the current or proposed Interbus Agreement provides for cabotage operations as part of a regular service.  The withdrawal Act could not provide for cabotage operations, as that is within the European Union's exclusive competence.  Member States &quot;may negotiate or enter into such commitments only if empowered to do so by the Union&quot; in line with Article 2(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU.  Article 2(1) provides for the Union to empower member states in respect of areas in which the Union has exclusive competence.<br/><br/>The EU has recognised:</p><blockquote>Cross-border coach and bus services between Ireland and Northern Ireland are of particular importance for communities living in the border regions, in view of ensuring basic connectivity between communities inter alia as part of the Common Travel Area.  The picking up and setting down of passengers in regions on either side of the border supports the viability of those services.  Therefore, the picking up and setting down of passengers by United Kingdom coach and bus service operators should continue to be authorised in the border regions of Ireland in the course of international passenger transport services by coach and bus between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</blockquote><p>Regulation [EU] 2019/501 ensures the continuation of regular, authorised services up to 31 December 2019 and cabotage operations up to 30 September 2019.  These dates were based upon a withdrawal date of 30 March 2019.  The authority is strongly in favour of the proposed amendment to Regulation 2019/501 to extend the applicable dates to potentially allow for regular services to continue until 31 July 2020 and cabotage in the Border region for six months after the regulation comes into force.  Furthermore, the authority would be supportive of permission at an EU level that would enable Ireland to put alternative arrangements with the UK that would permit cabotage in the Border region.  That concludes my introductory presentation.  I trust we will be able to answer any queries that arise.</p></speech>

I am a member of the DAA executive team.  I am here today in my capacity of DAA executive Brexit lead and I am speaking on Brexit planning for both Dublin and Cork airports.  I thank committee members for the invitation to attend and for facilitating the important discussion on the implications of Brexit for Irish aviation and for the wider transport sector.</p> <p>  DAA is a global airport and travel retail group which operates in 13 countries.  In Ireland, DAA manages and operates the country's key gateways at Dublin and Cork airports, which welcomed a combined 34 million passengers in 2018.  DAA's airports at Dublin and Cork are uniquely exposed to Brexit in a European airport context, given the significant traffic flows that exist between Ireland and the UK.  To put it in context, research by our industry body, Airports Council International, ACI, Europe, published in October 2018, shows that UK passenger traffic accounted for, on average, 12% of total traffic flows across EU 27 airports in 2017.  In contrast, UK traffic amounted to 38% of total Irish traffic, which emphasises why we are uniquely exposed.</p> <p>  Given these unique challenges. Brexit has, over the past three years, been a critical and ongoing area of focus for our business.  DAA has established an internal Brexit planning team, which has been focussed on identifying and understanding all of the potential impacts which Brexit could bring for our airports, passengers, and customers, as well as for our wider business.  We have put in place robust contingency measures to effectively minimise these impacts.  In our planning, we worked closely with Departments such as Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, key State bodies such as Revenue and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, as well as customer airlines and a range of other key operational and commercial partners at our airports.  We have also participated in key industry fora such as the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, NCADF, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland's Brexit readiness group and the Irish Institute of European Affairs Brexit readiness grouping.</p> <p>  I would like to provide the committee with a brief overview of the implications of a no-deal Brexit for Irish aviation and DAA's airports, as well as the steps that have been taken to manage these impacts.  First, this is categorically important in terms of our own business, I reassure the committee that we expect flights to continue to operate as normal at Dublin and Cork airports in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, emergency regulations will come into force at EU level to protect air connectivity for passengers and freight between the EU and the UK.  Regulation EU 2019/502 on common rules ensuring basic air connectivity with regard to the withdrawal of the UK from the Union will take effect immediately in the event that the UK exits the EU without a deal on 31 October and will apply until October 2020.</p> <p>  It will bring into force a range of provisions to ensure that UK air carriers can continue to provide basic air transport services between the UK and the 27 remaining EU member states, including Ireland.  The UK has confirmed that it will mirror the provisions set out in the EU regulation in respect of the rights of EU air carriers within the UK.  For example, the regulation will, in a no-deal Brexit scenario, give UK air carriers the right to continue to perform scheduled and non-scheduled international air transport services between any point within the UK and the EU.  It will also allow UK carriers to continue to engage in co-operative marketing arrangements such as code-shares under certain conditions and will allow further traffic freedoms for all cargo services for a limited period.</p> <p>  In addition, the regulation also states that if airlines can, within two weeks of the no-deal legislation taking effect, provide proof to the European Commission that they have robust plans to ensure compliance with EU ownership and control rules within the subsequent six-month period, these airlines would in effect be entitled to a six-month grace period, during which their EU operating licences and associated rights would remain unaffected.  For information, I have supplied a copy of the regulation, as well as recent amendments to it, to all members.  Given these important provisions, and given the current traffic profiles at our airports, it is critically important to emphasise that flights into and out of the UK and feeder flights through the UK will continue to operate in a no-deal Brexit scenario.  It is important that we all get this message out to the travelling public.</p> <p>  The next key area I will address relates to the passenger journey, and the key implications Brexit will have within our airports from a passenger viewpoint.  First, I will address the implications of a no-deal Brexit for passengers departing at our airports.  Regarding security processes, there will be no changes or additional requirements for UK-bound passengers departing from Irish airports, as a result of a no-deal Brexit.  UK-bound passengers will simply continue to comply with all current security processes and requirements, with no change anticipated from existing processes.  Furthermore, the Government has now confirmed that duty-free shopping will return on alcohol and tobacco products if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.  This means that passengers departing from Irish airports to UK airports will be able to purchase these products at duty-free prices, but only in the event of no deal.  Other than that, we do not anticipate any other significant implications for passengers departing through Irish airports.</p> <p>  Second, I will address the implications of a no-deal Brexit for passengers arriving at our airports from the UK.  At airport immigration, UK passport holders arriving at Irish airports are currently processed through the European Union, European Economic Area and Switzerland, EU-EEA-CH channel.  If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, INIS has confirmed that UK passport holders will continue to be processed through the same channel.  However, the channel will be redesignated as an EU-EEA-CH and UK channel.  There will be no additional or onerous immigration checks applied to UK passport holders at Irish airports.  It is important we all get this message out as there is likely to be confusion and uncertainty, in particular with UK tourists considering coming to Ireland.</p> <p>  DAA has identified all relevant signage that will need to be changed within our airports in this scenario.  The new signage has been printed and is currently being held in storage, on standby, to be switched over, if and when required.  In the event of no deal, additional customer services staff will also be deployed in immigration areas at the airports, for a period, to advise passengers, and to deal with any queries or confusion which could arise.</p> <p>  At customs points in the arrivals hall, Revenue has confirmed that all passengers arriving at Irish airports from UK destinations, including all Irish and EU passport holders, will be required to use the green channel in a changed scenario.  We will simply use a different channel from that we use now; rather than using the blue channel, we will use the green channel.</p><p>Again, we will have customer services staff on hand to help passengers and to deal with any queries or confusion that may arise during the transition period.</p><p> Furthermore, UK arriving passengers will need to ensure that they are aware of allowances applicable to duty-free and tax-free goods and that they are in compliance with these allowances.  If they are carrying goods in excess of these allowances, they will need to make a declaration at the red customs channel.  Generally, UK passengers arriving in Irish airports who have not made purchases exceeding their allowances will have the normal smooth experience, except that they will use the green rather than the blue channel.  Random checks will continue to arise.</p><p> Another area which will be impacted at Irish airports in a no-deal Brexit scenario is bulk cargo, as a result of the additional paperwork and inspections which would be required for UK cargo on both sides of the Irish Sea.  Airports will be far less impacted in this area than ports, given the relative scale of freight handled by airports compared with ports.  Dublin Airport handled 143,000 tonnes of freight in 2018, while Dublin Port handled more than 26 million tonnes of freight in the same period.  Notwithstanding this, we in the DAA have been engaging closely with Revenue and customs for a no-deal scenario.  Revenue and customs have confirmed that their preparations are now well progressed, with an additional 40 customs officers in place at Dublin Airport to meet increased requirements.  Similar preparations have been made by customs with respect to Cork Airport.  On this basis, no material impacts are currently anticipated for DAA airports by Revenue and customs in this area of bulk cargo, though there will be significant additional paperwork.</p><p> Finally, like all businesses in a no-deal scenario, DAA could potentially face disruptions, delays, and interruptions to its own supply chains.  To this end, detailed and comprehensive risk assessment and contingency planning has been completed with respect to DAA&rsquo;s supply base, and mitigating actions have been undertaken where necessary to protect ongoing supplies, such as chemicals and equipment from the UK.  Beyond the operational impacts that I have outlined, it is also very important to add that, ultimately, the greatest risk for Irish aviation from a no-deal Brexit is the wider macroeconomic impact that such a scenario would bring to Irish tourism and business.  Inevitably, with sterling predicted to fall further in the event of a no-deal Brexit, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has indicated that at least 10,000 jobs would be at risk in the tourism sector in Ireland.  Estimates vary but F&aacute;ilte Ireland believes there could be a loss of more than one million British tourists each year, resulting in the loss of &euro;380 million per annum.  To put this in context, 3.5 million visits from Britain were recorded in 2018, contributing around &euro;1 billion to the Irish economy.  For this reason, we in the aviation industry strongly believe that everything possible should be done to avoid a no-deal Brexit to safeguard tourism and all the jobs throughout the country that are dependent on it.</p><p> Our expectation is that the operational impacts for Irish aviation and Irish airports will be relatively minimal in a no-deal Brexit scenario and, where impacts will be experienced, I believe that the DAA and its key stakeholders are taking all reasonable measures to minimise any negative effects that could be experienced.  However, I cannot emphasise enough the macroeconomic damage that will arise to tourism and travel in the Irish economy from the currency and other effects of a no-deal Brexit.  I look forward to any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

Our chief executive, Jim Meade, apologises for the fact that he is unavailable to be here today.  I will address our readiness for Brexit in the context of the operations of Enterprise services, and Mr. Carr will do so in the context of our role as port authority for Rosslare Europort.</p> <p>  The Dublin to Belfast Enterprise service is jointly operated by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and our colleagues in Translink in Northern Ireland.  Since the committee last considered the impact of Brexit on transport services in 2017, we have continued to work jointly with Translink to understand the potential impact of Brexit on Enterprise services and to ensure, particularly as a no-deal Brexit has become a more likely possible outcome, that we undertake the necessary measures to mitigate that impact and to ensure we continue to offer a seamless service to Enterprise customers.  This has been done with the support and guidance of officials of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and with the invaluable regulatory input and oversight of the Commission for Railway Regulation, CRR.</p> <p>  I am pleased to confirm to the committee that from a customer point of view, under all models of Brexit, Enterprise customers will see no change to the service we jointly provide with Translink.  In terms of European Directive 2012/34, as reflected in SI 249 of 2015, the CRR is the regulatory body, licensing authority and independent monitoring body for the heavy rail sector in the State.  In addition to the regulation of rail safety, its functions include the licensing of railway undertakings, more simply described as train operators, wishing to access the network.  Currently, EU regulations allow Translink to operate south of the Border based on the UK&rsquo;s EU membership and train drivers holding EU-compliant train driving licences.  Translink is well advanced in the process of obtaining approval from the CRR to be licensed as a railway undertaking in Ireland should a no-deal Brexit materialise.  If, for any reason, the licensing of Translink as a railway undertaking in Ireland is not completed by 31 October, we have developed proposals under which Enterprise services south of the Border would operate under Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s operating arrangements and licences, pending the finalisation of Translink&rsquo;s status as a railway undertaking in Ireland.  As detailed, this understanding and progression of the licensing arrangements could not have been achieved without the practical and solution-based approach taken by the CRR and Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the partnership ethos between ourselves and Translink.</p> <p>  Regulatory matters will have been resolved in a manner that will protect the seamless service we provide with Translink, and which both companies have been proud to deliver.</p> <p>  Before I hand over to Mr. Carr to discuss Rosslare&rsquo;s preparations, I would like briefly to reassure the committee on the issue of fuel supply in the event of a hard Brexit.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, on behalf of the three CI&Eacute; operating companies, keeps defined minimum fuel supply levels, as provided for under the National Oil Reserves Agency standards, as part of the State&rsquo;s fuel security measures.  This equates to approximately two months' supply for the operation of all rail and bus services across the CI&Eacute; group.  We currently hold in excess of this level, with approximately three months' supply, and intend to increase these levels further to ensure security of fuel supply for rail and bus services as contingency for any issues that could arise in the early weeks of Brexit.</p></speech>

Rosslare Europort is the second busiest roll-on, roll-off, ro-ro, port in the country.  On average annually, the port handles up to 120,000 freight trailers, 800,000 passengers, 20,000 trade cars and about 50,000 tonnes of bulk.  The port enjoys the advantage of having capacity, space and surrounding land availability to both ease the possible disruption of the Brexit process and to attract new business.  As the closest port to mainland Europe, Rosslare Europort offers the quickest direct sailing times to key European ports, offering an alternative to the current use and dependency of the UK landbridge.  Opportunities for new routes are being explored with French, Belgian, Spanish and Dutch ports as well as with various shipping lines operating the ro-ro market.  Working closely with Government and State agencies, shipping lines and haulage industry, Rosslare Europort will be ready for both a no-deal and transition deal on 31 October.</p> <p>  Rosslare Europort was recommended and approved for significant facility upgrades as part of the Government central case to meet customs, Revenue, agriculture and immigration controls post Brexit.  A 16-acre temporary border inspection post, BIP, and facilities have been designed and built by the OPW which will help ensure that freight and passenger traffic will be efficiently discharged from the berths to the BIP away from the port, which will help ensure any issues in the event of no deal will be managed in an orderly fashion as best as possible.  The longer-term central case designs for permanent facilities are under way and will link in with the master plan designs for the development of the port and incorporate further improved road access and connections.  Additional resources in customs, Revenue, agriculture and health have been recruited and trained by the relevant agencies to provide the necessary support and to ensure the efficient movement of freight and people through the port.  Through ongoing engagement with a stakeholder group with Government agencies, shipping lines and industry, both transition deal and no-deal scenarios are finalised, with workshops and exercises having taken place and more planned in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  Rosslare Europort would like to acknowledge the positive engagements and ongoing support throughout this process from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>A no-deal Brexit will bring fundamental changes and challenges regarding how the movement of freight and people between the UK and Ireland will operate at ports.  These changes and challenges will be managed to ensure the efficient movement of trade and people between both countries through ongoing contingency planning, communications and investment in infrastructure, resources and facilities at Rosslare Europort.  We are happy to address any questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.1131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Flynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019092500002#D00300"><p>I am delighted to present to the committee today on issues of major concern to our members.  The Freight Transport Association Ireland, FTA Ireland, is a not-for-profit membership trade association representing some of the largest freight distribution, logistics and passenger operators in Ireland, with more than 25,000 employees and 12,000 commercial vehicles operating between them.  From our establishment, our members have demanded that FTA Ireland develop and implement an industry-wide standard called TruckSafe.  That facilitates a path to continuous operational compliance, but also provides recognition for commercial fleet operators in the so-called own account and haulage sector who meet their minimum legal operational obligations.</p> <p>  Brexit has mandated that we define and appreciate the supply chain in all its efficiencies and complex distribution channels and relationships.  Key to the challenge of dealing with change such as will be caused by Brexit is to stay competitive, develop strategic plans and implement these plans with confidence to pre-empt and manage the change.  A core objective of FTA Ireland is to provide our members with up-to-date guidance and information on operational compliance and standards that make this process easier.  Promoting the highest standards of compliance and professionalism through our TruckSafe standards help drive this culture within our membership.</p> <p>  In 2017, FTA Ireland published our Brexit position paper.  Its key recommendations are still relevant today.  These include avoiding checks at the Border, preserving the Common Travel Area, ensuring seamless transport links between Ireland and the UK, preserving mutual recognition of documents, qualifications and licences to limit disruption to road transport and logistics operations and, most important, ensuring a seamless transition to the post-Brexit era.  We commend and support the Government for the work done to date on ensuring Irish interests are heard and understood in the UK and at EU level.</p> <p>  Uncertainty remains the main cause of concern for the freight, distribution and logistics sector as Brexit day, 31 October, gets ever closer.  FTA Ireland continuously and consistently engages with our members through briefings, seminars, meetings.  We have also developed publications and guidance notes to raise awareness of the implications of Brexit, with emphasis on encouraging the development of contingency plans.  Due to the uncertain and protracted political situation in the UK, the costs, in both resources and monetary terms, to develop contingency plans create a challenge to keep industry focused on preparing for the post-Brexit trading environment.  According to the recently published Managers Guide to Distribution Costs 2019, respondents estimated that they allocated 606 hours per company to preparing for Brexit in 2018, equating to taking one person out of their business for more than 75 days or 15 working weeks.  Companies anticipate the number of hours allocated will increase to 720 in 2019 or the equivalent of 18 working weeks.  This, however, is more complicated for the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector, which includes the majority of haulage businesses.  Approximately 13,500 trucks operate an international haulage licence out of a haulage fleet of 18,000 heavy goods vehicles in Ireland.  The average fleet size is slightly more than five vehicles.  The sector is driven by high-volume, low-margin business and is struggling to allocate time and resources, which operators do not have, to prepare for Brexit.</p> <p>  Ireland stands to be affected the most due to our geographic location and reliance on the UK, not just as a trading partner but as a link to continental Europe.  While the focus has been on looking to new markets, we must not negate the importance of the UK as a market for Ireland.  In 1973, almost 55% of the total value of exports from Ireland went to Great Britain.  By 2018, according to data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, this reliance had reduced significantly to 11% of total exports, worth approximately &euro;14 billion.  It is not all about exports, however.  Imports are vitally important to the Irish economy.  Some 22% of imports, worth &euro;18 billion, came from the UK in 2018.</p></speech>

I have noted where Mr. Flynn has stopped in his presentation, however.  If Mr. Flynn will extend us the courtesy, we will go to vote.  The process will only take about ten to 12 minutes and we will then resume this meeting at the exact point where we left off.  Members have questions for the witnesses, as do I, so I ask for their patience for a short time.  The situation may change if Senator Craughwell calls a walk-through vote.</p></speech>

The complexity of the issues faced by traders in a post-Brexit world in getting goods to market cannot be underestimated.  Understanding customs union issues and Single Market issues is critical in developing effective contingency plans.  The supply chain, as it currently stands, has incrementally adapted to the efficiencies the Single Market has afforded, however, a sharp shock like Brexit will have the consequence of creating significant friction in the supply chain that will result in increased costs, reduced product choice and loss of jobs.  Being prepared and having flexible contingency plans will be very important in dealing with and mitigating risk in the changing trading environment.  Time is also vitally important for business to prepare and adopt to the future trading environment.  The EU and Ireland have publicly highlighted that protecting the integrity of, and competition within, the Single Market are of vital importance in any deal.<br/><br/>Future arrangements must deal not only with customs issues but with regulatory requirements such as mutual recognition of licensing for the movement of goods by road, driver licences, qualifications and insurance requirements.  UK nationals living and working in Ireland are encouraged to transfer their driving licence to an Irish one, swap their UK issued driver certificate of professional competence, CPC, card for an Irish one prior to 31 October 2019 or face the prospect of driving illegally on our roads.<br/><br/>While road transport within the EU is harmonised and, thus, based on common EU rules, road transport between EU and non-EU countries - third countries - is still largely based on bilateral agreements between individual member states and third countries.  That harmonisation will expire once the UK leaves the EU, unless and until there is an agreement between the UK and the EU.  Currently, the movement of goods is taken for granted in that it happens seamlessly.<br/><br/>In the event of no deal, the EU Commission has agreed to extend access to the EU transport market for an additional seven months until the end of July 2020.  However, cabotage will be phased out over this period.<br/><br/>Efficient logistics are derived from industry finding the path of least resistance to markets.  The cheapest and the quickest route to the EU market that supports the just-in-time model of logistics is known as the landbridge.  It involves a journey duration of 20 hours versus 40 hours on Ireland-EU direct routes and it is also three times quicker than container shipments.  This is by no means the only route to market, but it relies on access to continental Europe via Great Britain.  The Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, published a report in 2018 entitled, The Implications of Brexit on the Use of the Landbridge, which highlights that 150,000 trucks use the landbridge each year moving more than 3 million tonnes of product.  Post-Brexit the landbridge will be compromised because of multi-agency checks at ports and new administrative red tape which, ultimately, will lead to increased costs and delays.  In addition, Operation Brock, a newly proposed traffic management plan to reduce congestion at southern UK ports will further complicate the viability and efficiency of the landbridge.<br/><br/>To use the landbridge, hauliers will have to operate under the common transit convention, CTC.  It requires a guarantee-bond to cover VAT and excise duties and will ensure that import and export declarations do not have to be completed while entering and exiting a third country - Great Britain - <i>en route</i>to continental Europe.  The CTC is closely aligned with the simplification process encouraged by Revenue for businesses to be authorised economic operator, AEO, accredited.  To date, there are only 230 AEO registered companies, which is only up by 90 companies since the start of the Brexit process.  Furthermore, it is taking more than nine months to attain AEO status.<br/><br/>There are more than 80 ferries per week between Dublin Port and Great Britain and an additional 28 per week from Rosslare to Great Britain.  This compares to 17 ferries per week between Ireland and continental Europe for roll on-roll off and lo-lo.  An issue for consideration post-Brexit in the event of no deal is the scheduling of ferries, particularly in Dublin Port.  Currently, ro-ro ferries are arriving into Dublin Port with up to a 9.5 km lane of trucks starting at 5 a.m. every morning.  The ferry companies in most instances are arriving in convoy with 30 minutes separating four ferry arrivals from time to time.  In a post-Brexit world this will add strain on the system as all these drivers and trucks will have to be processed at the same time.  This has implications for everyone, including the development of logjams in the system that perhaps could be avoided if the arrivals were staggered.<br/><br/>The importance of having contingency plans cannot be denied but this in itself will not result in 100% compliance at ports.  The reality is that planning, training, upskilling, better procurement practices, consignor liability, shared responsibility and increased awareness of one's supply chain is a start in determining the best way to get goods into and out of the country as efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>FTA Ireland welcomes the supports for industry, such as the Clear Customs initiative, and Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland supports.  These solutions only cover some of the industry's needs.  A more all-inclusive approach needs to takento support all in the supply chain, and one sector, in particular, that has been overlooked is the haulage sector.  The burden of compliance will be levelled at the haulage operator which is at the mercy of its clients and consignors.  Help and assistance need to be provided for hauliers as a matter of urgency to aid their Brexit preparations.  Without hauliers, goods will not get moved and without compliance, hauliers goods will not get delivered on time.  All must be working together to ensure the realities of a no-deal Brexit are understood.<br/><br/>Revenue advises that only 2% of vehicles will require physical checks and only 6%  will require documentary checks, which will not take as long.  This is predicated on there being 100% compliance with declarations and documents for the loads on the vehicles.  Irish business will go from making 1.7 million declarations per annum to making more than 20 million declarations per annum.  Revenue will be available to work 24-7 but it will expect to have access to customs agents 24-7 in the event of errors with declarations.  That will be problematic as there is a lack of agents available and working in Ireland with the necessary resources and competencies at the moment.  The burden for agrifoods is much more pronounced with 100% documentary checks and between 20% and 50% mandatory physical checks for meat, poultry, eggs, fish and even honey.<br/><br/>To assist industry preparation, regulatory bodies must consider doing dry runs in the ports to trial the new post-Brexit requirements of customs checks, driver routing - for instance, drivers need smart phones to access a Revenue routing site 20 minutes from docking at Dublin Port - and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks.  Publication of routing and traffic plans in and around ports are long overdue and engagement with all stakeholders, including representative associations, is of vital importance to ensure industry has all the necessary information.<br/><br/>The recently announced Operation Purge, where in the event of congestion in Dublin Port trucks will be directed to park up at service stations and other areas off the motorway network that they normally use until congestion at the port eases has a sense of a half-baked plan.  Given the fact that trucks travel from all over Ireland to Dublin Port, one would expect a more detailed and thought-out plan to take account of the lack of facilities currently available for drivers.  Consideration should be given to how to communicate to the haulage sector effectively to notify drivers that the port is closed and to park up in designated parking areas until further notice.<br/><br/>Given the inevitability of delays on arrival at ports from Great Britain, welfare facilities and rest areas are needed for drivers.  Drivers need to understand and be advised of the length of delays to expect from the outset and communication between regulatory authorities and drivers is very important to ensuring speedy processing and aid the efficiencies in getting products to market.<br/><br/>All Brexit preparation-related training should benefit from increased support through the likes of Skillnet.  FTA Ireland calls on Government to categorise all Brexit training to include customs courses, preparation for distribution of agrifoods, supply chain adaptation and preparation for the haulage sector to receive up to 80% funding through Skillnet.  This can be done by designating this training under the employment activation funding.  Given the critical nature of Brexit and the implications for the Irish economy, designation through the employment activation fund will enable the level of funding required that will act as a vital incentive to aid the freight distribution and logistics sector to upskill, as necessary, in preparation for Brexit.</p><p>With regard to infrastructure, over 90% of all trade with the UK transits via Dublin Port.  There is an over-reliance on Dublin for connectivity with the UK.  FTA Ireland is calling on the Government to support investment and planning in our other strategic ports, such as Waterford and Rosslare, as this will result in reduced congestion in Dublin and facilitate rural economic development and new routes to market.  It is vital that the obvious future pinch points are assessed now and that pre-emptive measures are taken that will facilitate dynamic growth and opportunity for both import and export activity in Ireland.</p><p> There will be many Government agencies charged with checking goods, paperwork and people.  It is very important that there are inter-departmental synergies in areas such as shared intelligence, a pragmatic approach to dealing with traders, and even a helpful demeanour.  Fact sheets and information and guidance must be produced for industry to aid engagement with these bodies.  This will raise levels of awareness and help with the flow of traffic.</p><p> Ports must reach out to all stakeholders to communicate more effectively their plans for preparedness and to look for reasonable input in providing the best possible solutions.  Space is an issue for most ports, with a finite amount of space available for parking and checking trucks.  However, the haulage sector must be engaged to fully understand the new checking facilities and traffic management so they can plan for them efficiently.  The infrastructure must take account of tachograph rules, welfare facilities must be provided for drivers in the event of delays, and the ports must be adequately staffed to manage traffic and traffic flow.</p><p> Finally, it is vital that there is a period of transition to the new trading environment.  While we are working hard as an industry to prepare, the reality is there will be significant learning once Brexit happens.  We need to respect the fact that the transition to the new training environment will not be easy for industry or for regulatory bodies.  Mutual respect, clear communication, and stakeholder engagement will be vital in adapting to the new post-Brexit trading environment.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

I thank the delegations for being here today and taking the time to make their presentations.  In 2016, I spoke about the need to recover the corporate knowledge we had with respect to managing borders, managing freight, and so on.  Sitting here today, a number of days out from what is supposed to be the day on which the UK crashes out with or without a deal, we still do not know how people in Border areas are going to manage.  We still do not know what is going to happen.  I have just come from a briefing with the German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce.  A person involved in distribution and logistics spoke.  He put on the record some of the problems that lie ahead.  I am not 100% sure how to put all these problems before the witnesses, but I will try to work my way through them.</p> <p>  I will deal with Mr. MacCarthy first.  I compliment him on the work he does with the airport in Cork.  I am desperately sorry the airport lost the transatlantic flights but I met Mr. MacCarthy some years ago and I know that he will drive ahead and find somebody to fill that niche.  It is a wonderful airport; fair play to Mr. MacCarthy.  I have discussed the issue of the common travel area at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement on a number of occasions.  The common travel area as we know it has no legal underpinning.  It is, for all intents and purposes, a gentleman's agreement.  Given the way things are going in the UK, nothing is guaranteed.  We have no idea where we are going.  If I land at Cork Airport, Dublin Airport or Shannon Airport on 1 November, will I find EU-only and non-EU laneways for arriving passengers?  Will I be subjected to all the customs checks and everything else?  Does Mr. MacCarthy believe that the Government has the structures in place the DAA will need to operate?  </p> <p>  I will move past Mr. MacCarthy and speak about Rosslare.  The first thing that always bothers me about Rosslare relates to the amount of importing and exporting that goes on there.  We have a railway line right to the port and we have hundreds of 40-foot trucks coming off ships all day, every day.  The Germans in particular have expressed that there is a need to develop the Port of Cork, Rosslare Europort and, possibly, the Port of Waterford for deep-sea roll-on, roll-off freight on the seabridge route.  That brings with it its own problems.  If we are using the landbridge, we will have drivers sitting idle for a short period of time.  If we use the seabridge route, we will have a driver sitting on a ferry for 30 hours.  I do not know what sort of negotiations have taken place on that issue.  With regard to Rosslare - and I am addressing Mr. Flynn with this as well - the issue of split loads going out on trucks came up this morning.  A truck can take a load, half of which is for delivery to the UK and half for transport on to Europe, which could result in problems.  </p> <p>  The central problem discussed this morning was customs and customs clearance.  Three years ago I recommended that universities or institutes of technology establish courses in customs clearance and logistics management.  I am not aware of any now in place.  I do not know where we will get the corporate expertise to manage borders both within the island of Ireland and those encountered when moving through the UK landbridge or the seabridge to Zeebrugge or Doesburg.  I have serious concerns.  Even in respect of simple things like the description of goods for customs purposes on a T2 form, we are now a little bit loose on the descriptions used.  One can just put in a part number and move on.  Under customs rules, one will have to give detailed descriptions.  Even the invoicing documentation used in the country at the moment is not suitable for inter-customs movement where goods are moving across the UK.  </p> <p>  We are still not sure what will happen to a truck leaving Dublin Port to arrive in Liverpool or Holyhead before moving on to Dover to cross the Channel.  We are not sure how that will be dealt with from a customs point of view.  One particular transport company up in the Cushendall area that transports the raw materials for Coca-Cola and pharmaceuticals has informed me that, if the door of the trailer is opened, the entire contents of the trailer have to come back; they cannot continue through.  Can we honestly expect UK customs and border security to turn a blind eye to every truck and to say "Drive on lads, you are from Ireland"?  There are some in this organisation who believe there will be a laneway from Holyhead to Dover dedicated to the Irish market.  These people should wake up.  I do not believe the Mr. Flynn believes his drivers will be given priority over UK drivers as they try to make their way across the country.</p> <p>  I am asking for the witnesses' professional opinions.  We had them before the committee some time ago.  The clock is now ticking very rapidly and I am of the view that we are in no way prepared.  Mr. Flynn spoke about trial runs a little while ago.  I am not aware of any trial run having taken place anywhere in the country.  More importantly, I am not aware of any trial or training programme having taken place for customs personnel.  I am just not aware of any.  Going back to Ms Graham of the National Transport Authority, there is the issue of buses crossing over the Border and back.  I remember the days when we would go to Jonesborough to buy our Christmas shopping and so on.  People were marched off the buses and everything they had was checked.  I remember one dear lady wearing two overcoats to avoid whatever taxes or duties were due and dying with the sweat as she got off the coach.  I can see no problem with the transport of people, but I see a problem with what people carry.  I do not see the UK authorities doing anything with the Border.  I see a Turkish-Greek solution.  From Finland to Greece, there are 11 countries in the European Union with external borders.  None of those countries has a derogation with respect to cross-border activity.  It could be argued that their borders are all with the countries of eastern Europe and that there would not be the same level of trade, but I am aware of no derogation for the Irish with respect to Northern Ireland.</p><p>I was there two weeks ago for a weekend, and I met many people on the ground, including ordinary people who cross the Border for GAA matches and members of the DUP, the Orange Order and the manufacturing community.  I did not meet members of the agricultural community because I had met them before.  These people are petrified and nobody is giving them an answer.  The speaker at the German event this morning contacted the Irish Government about border movements and movement across the UK, and was given information on transport moving from the Republic of Ireland into the UK, across the UK and into Europe.  He then asked about Northern Ireland and was told that we do not talk about that.  Is that good enough at this stage of the game?</p><p> My final point is on the issue of migration, which also relates to buses.  I am not going to get into whether these people are refugees or economic migrants because that is not the issue.  The issue is that the European Union has a migration policy.  How are we to implement a migration policy if we have freedom of movement across the Border in buses with nobody checking who is on board or where they came from?  Migration was a major factor for the British in deciding to pull out of the European Union.  Ireland will now be a gateway to the European Union from Britain if people wish to travel through Northern Ireland.  This will also apply to Mr. MacCarthy because people arriving at his airports will come under closer scrutiny and may need to be repatriated to wherever they came from.  I have thrown many questions at the witnesses but these are the things I am hearing from experts and people on the ground.  Many people in Mr. Flynn's industry are also beside themselves because they do not know where they are going. </p></speech>

As he is aware, roving immigration checks are already conducted on buses and trains along the Border, on a cross-Border basis, regardless of the common travel area.  That will not change.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell has already asked about Rosslare, so I only have one question.  I refer to Ms Graham's remark on cabotage and seeking what I would interpret as a bilateral agreement between Ireland and the UK.  How would that be done?  Would it not be in breach of European rules?  From which directive would we need a derogation in order to achieve that?  Is this aspirational or is it a genuine request?  I open the floor to all the witnesses to answer the various points and questions that have been raised.</p></speech>

His question related to the common travel area not being set down in legislation, and whether we have doubts or concerns on the immigration process post Brexit.  The common travel area predates our entry into the EU and has been respected since the foundation of the State.  In more recent years, people have been required to carry a passport for aviation, which happened irrespective of the common travel area.  That requirement continues.  The day after the referendum in the UK, we realised Brexit was going to be significant for Ireland and our business, so we mobilised a part-time team which deconstructed all aspects of aviation, such as the journey, freight and security.  We began with pilots' licences, the regulation of aircraft and security processes.  One by one, we contacted the Department of Justice and Equality, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, the UK Airport Operators Association, and the British Embassy, and started to tick through all the concerns we had.  We are absolutely confident that the common travel area will be respected.  We have engaged with the Department of Justice and Equality, INIS and the GNIB as recently as today.  The process for British passport holders coming into Ireland will be unchanged and will respect the common travel area.  Non-EU citizens such as Americans or Asians are subjected to some questions when travelling here.  They go into a non-EU queue and are asked the duration of their stay and where they are staying to establish whether they have the economic capability to remain in the country for the relevant period.  British passport holders will not be subject to such questions.  There will be a sign change and passports will be checked for validity and scanned, as they were before.  We are confident of that.</p> <p>  The second part of the Senator's question related to refugees, asylum seekers and illegal immigration.  These are people whose status the Garda or INIS are not satisfied with.  They will sometimes present themselves without proper documentation or declare themselves to be refugees.  All airports have passport checks before one leaves, where one is obliged to show a valid travel document and passport.  These can sometimes be bogus passports, but we are not expecting a significant increase in those through the airports.  It may be an issue in ports, but I can only answer for airports.  We are printing leaflets in which we tell passengers not to panic because people are questioning whether they should books flights to the UK.  We are concerned about the impact people panicking would have on businesses, aviation and tourism.  The leaflet is headed "Do not panic in the event of a no-deal Brexit" and has six points.  We also have frequently asked questions, FAQs on our website.  To answer the Senator's question, we are not worried about the status of the common travel area.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.1142" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Glenn Carr" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019092500002#H00500"><p>The Senator asked about the current infrastructure in Rosslare.  As well as being the general manager for Rosslare Europort, I am also the general manager of rail freight for Irish Rail and I am often asked about the development of infrastructure for Rosslare.  Rosslare Europort is a roll-on, roll-off port.  We currently run freight trains into Dublin Port and Waterford Port.  Waterford Port, which is in the south-east region with Rosslare and New Ross, is a lift-on, lift-off port.  Rail connectivity and the movement of bulk or containers are more traditional with lift-on, lift-off ports than roll-on, roll-off ports.  That is not to say that trucks or trailers could not migrate directly on to freight trains in the future, as happens in parts of Europe.  I have been working with Waterford Port and Wexford County Council to promote the south-east region as an alternative to Ireland's tier 1 ports.  It is very important that investment plays to each port's strengths.  There is little point, from a business case point of view, in putting a railway connection for freight into Rosslare when a neighbouring port in Waterford already has that facility.</p> <p>  Investment in the lift-on, lift-off service should be developed for Waterford Port and investment for Rosslare should concentrate on roll-on, roll-off and some additional bulk.  The two ports could then jointly bring together a mixture of service offerings in the intermodal section that could compete with Dublin or Shannon Foynes, the latter in essence being a collection of ports offering different modes of transport.</p> <p>  The other challenge for a rail connection from Dublin into Rosslare is that it is a single line passenger service which would require significant investment and upgrades in order to accommodate freight.  We would have to double the track all the way to Dublin.  We should also bear in mind that due to the M11 and N25 upgrades, road connectivity to Rosslare Port has been greatly improved, which has been very well received.  People can now travel from Dublin to Rosslare in 90 minutes, where they might previously have spent 90 minutes caught in traffic on the M50 or trying to access a port in Dublin city.  Rosslare Port should be seen as a release valve for Dublin.  It will never compete with Dublin but it can certainly take away some of the current congestion in Dublin.</p> <p>  I mentioned earlier that one of Rosslare's advantages is its capacity.  We can currently take in additional ships and have space to handle additional sailings.  There is also land availability around the Rosslare region.  Rosslare, Kilrane and Wexford need industrial development, and we can use the port as the gateway to drive that development.</p><p>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has committed to an initial investment plan of just over &euro;25 million for the port.  That will improve the length of berths and the size of ships which we will handle in future, additional quayside space and technology to move trade efficiently and seamlessly through the port.  Our focus is on developing the roll-on, roll-off business and on working with Waterford and New Ross in developing the south-east region and those ports.  </p><p> From the rail freight perspective, we are driving that agenda forward.  There are plans to connect into Shannon Foynes Port.  I believe the Port of Cork is now looking again at the possibility of rail connection.  Particularly in the context of the climate action agenda, and the shortage of drivers in future as Mr. Flynn would say, we strongly believe that rail freight has a role to play alongside road freight.  We currently operate about 1% of rail freight in Ireland.  Typically across Europe it would range between 12% to 17%.  We are putting a plan in place over coming years to help drive that agenda forward.  It does require investment and significant movement of freight, which justifies the business investment.  Currently, rail freight and Rosslare Europort operate on a commercial basis and must stand alone on their own feet in relation to investment and growing the business.  There is no direct subvention into either rail freight or Rosslare.  However, freight can benefit from the use of a track that is there for passenger purposes and can be used and developed on existing lines, particularly those connecting into major cities around the country.</p></speech>

We are now talking about lean just in time, LJIT, systems rather than the just in time, JIT, system.  There will be a need for warehousing.  I understand there is land outside Rosslare which would avoid the 9 km tailback and do some customs clearance before arriving at the port.  Is all that in train?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.1145" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Glenn Carr" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019092500002#J00300"><p>The temporary border inspection post which is being acquired, and will be ready for 31 October, deals primarily with the clearance of imports into the country.  If the UK leaves it will be a third country.  We should bear in mind that we already trade with third countries.  There is nothing new in the documentation; it is just the scale and amount of documentation that will present the challenge.  One of the real advantages that we see for Rosslare it that our facility is just outside the port.  That means we are in a position to discharge from the berths. For those who are red or green, in the event of a no-deal scenario, the red will present to the border inspection facility, which is outside the port.  For those coming into the port, it is critically important that everyone has his or her paperwork in order.  Post Brexit they will require a movement reference number, MRN, to book or travel on a ferry.  The onus is on the transporter to ensure that the MRN is in order.  One would not arrive at an airport without a passport and nor should one arrive at a port without the MRN documentation in place.  To keep the ports moving and keep traffic moving, we will not allow trucks to enter the port without their MRN number in place.  This has been widely communicated.  The documentation can be uploaded quite well in advance.  It is worth bearing in mind that in Rosslare Europort, as in Dublin, some 60% of trucks going through contain some sort of an agricultural or food product.  Consequently, it is critically important that paperwork is in place to access the port, board the ferry and depart.  Similarly for imports, the challenge will be on checks on agrigoods and food because of the scale of those checks.  I was at the site on Monday and walked through it.  It is well adequate to handle current and future additional traffic in Rosslare.  Previously, Dublin was the only port which had that recognition as a border inspection post.  Now that Rosslare has also been designated a border inspection post, traffic that currently could only go through Dublin can come in through Rosslare as an alternative.  The other advantage of Rosslare is that it provides direct sailiings.  Currently the market is waiting to see.  The situation is very fluid with Brexit and the shipping lines are waiting to see its outcome.  Our plans are not based on Brexit but on future growth.  We see opportunities for direct sailings, purely based on current congestion in Dublin, Holyhead and elsewhere on the road.  There is also a shift in traffic due to the shortage of drivers.  Much of it is going unaccompanied.  Ten years ago that market would have been 70% accompanied and 30% unaccompanied, where the market is now 70% unaccompanied and 30% accompanied.  There is a need for more direct sailings to mainland Europe.  We are working with ports to put together a package to attract shipping lines to avail of the connections from Rosslare to ports such as Zeebrugge, Le Havre, Rotterdam and so on.  Rosslare port has a plan, with or without Brexit.  We look forward to Rosslare growing and to delivering on the investment plan.</p></speech>

I have followed as much as the debate as possible on the monitor.  I wish to link in with Mr. Carr.  I have a particular interest in the Shannon Foynes Port Company, having been a director for many decades.  Mr. Carr referred mainly to Dublin and Rosslare but he did mention Shannon Foynes in relation to the rail connection.  Am I correct in assuming that because of its western location, Shannon Foynes will not be impacted as much by the Brexit situation as the other major ports?</p> <p>  Another question, which is not as related to Brexit, but will Mr. Carr give a brief update on how he sees the rail link in Shannon Foynes developing?  It is one of the biggest bulk cargo handlers in Europe.  Much of it is hitting our roads and we hear anecdotes about ridiculous things, such as material being imported from Australia and being taken by road to the midlands for energy production.  One would wonder where the gain is.  Has anything real been firmed up on rail connection?  </p></speech>

Those dates have moved now that we are looking at 31 October.  We expect those dates will be extended by the EU to cover cabotage for at least six months after the UK exits the EU.  The EU has recognised that cabotage is an important part of cross-border services.  We would expect that an agreement will put in place similar to the Alpine agreement between Switzerland, Italy and Germany, which allows cabotage across those borders.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-25a.1150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Flynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019092500002#J00800"><p>To paraphrase "Star Trek" the supply chain will go on but not as we know it.  That is the reality of Brexit.</p><p>In terms of understanding of what we discussed about the complexities of the integrated supply chain, indeed for all-island trade, it is vital in terms of movement of people over and back across the Border, through importing raw ingredients or parts for goods that are then exported and so on.  As Mr. Carr said, agrifood in particular will be heavily impacted upon by future arrangements, particularly in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Over 60% of goods consignments coming into the ports include some sort of food.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's advice to industry would be preferably to have one product, one load.  The reality is that just-in-time logistics are reliant on groupage where operators would effectively describe having the kitchen sink on a trailer.  Indeed there could be 200 or 300 products on the back of a trailer.  The new environment requires them to have safety and security declarations that could cost &euro;40 or &euro;50 per declaration.  The added cost to industry and business on that point alone is phenomenal.</p><p> I had a meeting today with insurance underwriters for carrier's liability insurance.  Another complexity particularly for perishable goods would be significant delays at ports that are out of the control of the haulier.  The new trading environment dictates that the haulier and the consigner or consignee need to have very robust partnership relationships, new contractual arrangements perhaps.  All of these things should be forming part of the contingency planning.  In the instance of a haulier being significantly delayed, it is easy to understand that perhaps the consignee would transfer responsibility for the load to the haulier and perhaps withhold payment for the delivery.  They might say they could not accept it because it is perishable, there is a reduced shelf life and all that type of thing.  These are realities where businesses need to build trust within their supply chain and have new types of conversations about the reality of the situation.  Carrier's liability insurance does not necessarily cover that.  Consigners need to have cargo insurance to be able to deal with those type of things.  These are real issues that will inevitably arise because of all the multi-agency checks in terms of efficiencies.</p><p> As stated earlier, this is going to be a learning experience.  One would expect that there would be a pragmatic approach taken for sure, but there are obvious issues.  Colleagues of mine spent a day going over and back between Dover and Calais yesterday with a main shipping operator on a trial run.  Some 10% of the throughput at Calais is Irish-registered business.  It is significant.  Calais is quite concerned at losing that business should the landbridge become unviable.  As Mr. Carr mentioned, there is undeniable opportunity and we have submitted proposals under the realignment of the Mediterranean TEN-T proposal in terms of trying to link Irish ports with more continental ports.  The other reality for the international haulage sector is that business may become untenable because there is an automatic shift from that landbridge to direct routes.  They cannot put a driver on a ferry for 40 hours.  It just does not work out.  That is why there is a shift to unaccompanied transport and so on.</p><p> On customs and training, one of the great pleasures I had in the past couple of years was to be involved in a programme called the logistics associate apprenticeship.  We are linked in with Technical University, TU, Dublin's school of management in Aungier Street as the lead proposer.  We had 90 apprentices start the programme last week, 70 or so in Dublin and we have started it in Cork Institute of Technology, CIT.  Customs is a module on the programme.  Also very welcome is the clear customs arrangement where there is support for a significant five-day customs training programme.  However, to become a customs agent or broker requires years and years of education.  That is the quandary we find ourselves in as regards the aid and support we need for that.</p><p> Another issue concerning drivers is that we found 30% of international drivers do not hold Irish passports.  That could create problems under the common travel arrangements in terms of accessing the UK.  There could perhaps be additional checks which is of concern to us.  Again as part of an operator's contingency plan, these are all real issues that need consideration.  There are over 200 transport managers in Ireland who have a UK-issued transport managers certificate of professional competence, CPC, qualification.  Those guys need to start the process of getting an EU or Irish-issued transport manager CPC so they can continue to fulfil their duties after the Brexit date.</p></speech>
