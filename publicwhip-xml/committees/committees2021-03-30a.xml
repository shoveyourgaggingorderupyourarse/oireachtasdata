    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#A00200"><p> Apologies have been received from Deputies Nessa Hourigan and Sean Sherlock.</p> <p>  I welcome everyone to our online meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.  I ask that committee members confirm their location before contributing in order to ensure that they are adhering to this constitutional requirement.</p> <p>  Today we engage on the topic of bogus self-employment with Mr. Martin McMahon, who appeared before the Joint Committee on Social Protection of the previous D&aacute;il to discuss this matter.  We requested submissions from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, in advance of this meeting.  I welcome Mr. McMahon.  When we begin to engage, I will ask members and the witness to mute their microphones when not contributing in order to ensure that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are in silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  If, therefore, their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.    In that regard, I have reviewed the opening statement and note that there are some instances where there are references to unlawful acts on the part of the State.  I would assume that, in making such references, Mr. McMahon was in fact referring to a misinterpretation of the law by the various parties rather than deliberately stating that they were unlawful acts.  Allegations of deliberate illegal activity are not in order and not to be permitted during the course of the engagement.  It is on that basis that we will proceed.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister, or of the objectives of such policies.  They are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  We are operating on the basis of limited time because of Covid-19.  We are tied to two hours so, as detailed in the invitation, Mr. McMahon has five minutes to make an opening statement.  We welcome that he sent in a concise one to the committee.  I will give him a reminder of the time after four minutes.  He is very welcome and I ask him to proceed with his statement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#A00400"><p>Go ahead.</p></speech>

Normally, when we have witnesses before us they are from agencies of the State and we question them in a fairly robust way to try to expose things we believe need to be exposed.  Mr. McMahon is here before us not in that capacity and, as a result, I imagine that our questioning will not be in that same vein.  Unfortunately, we have rebuttals from a number of State bodies and two member organisations which have different views.  We are in the uncomfortable situation whereby we almost have to present the rebuttal that has been put before us and I am not sure any of us want to be in the business of putting forward the case of State agencies.  That is for them to do.  Will the Chairman clarify if a number of those agencies will be before the committee or is this the only opportunity we will have to discuss this matter?  I am uncomfortable with having that rebuttal in writing but not having people here to allow me question them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#A00600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will answer the last question first.  It is entirely in the hands of the Committee of Public Accounts to decide if it wants to call some of those agencies to appear before it.  On the first question, we ask the Deputy to use his discretion.  He is entitled to put the points made by Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and ICTU to Mr. McMahon but I ask him to do it in a respectful and constructive way.  It is a matter of treating the witnesses with respect, as is normal.  The Deputy is entitled to ask those questions and is welcome to do so.  With regard to whether this is the only opportunity to discuss the issue, I am entirely in the hands of the committee on that one.  If the Committee of Public Accounts decides to bring in some of those bodies, which I hope we will do, that is entirely in our hands.  Is the Deputy okay with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#A00700"><p>I suggest that we do not treat the witness as normal, particularly as we are usually quite robust with our witnesses.  Mr. McMahon is raising genuine concerns and he is presenting his view on the matter we are here to discuss.  It is up to us to then question the agencies on it.  I do not believe us questioning Mr. McMahon in a robust way is the way to deal with a whistleblower or somebody who is trying to raise those issues.</p></speech>

Employment status must always be decided on the applicable law and the individual circumstances of each case.  Despite agreement from the Revenue Commissioners that each case must be taken on its own facts in accordance with case law, the Revenue Commissioners have openly admitted to the Committee of Public Accounts that this is not what happens in practice.  This contradiction between what case law demands and the State's misclassification, which in my opinion is contrary to existing law, was perfectly highlighted by the Revenue Commissioners in its reply, which states: "Revenue&rsquo;s position is that each case is individual and needs to be considered on its own merits."  Yet, what Revenue has told the committee it has been doing for more than 30 years is that "In the interest of uniformity Revenue decided to treat those couriers as selfemployed."</p> <p>  In my opinion, the State is granting illegal state aid, in the form of a PRSI exemption, to selected employers based on a misinterpretation of the law.  It is a tax break which puts compliant employers at a distinct economic disadvantage and denies employees all their rights as employees.  The mechanisms used by the Department of Social Protection and Revenue are unlawful test cases.  That a number of these group-class test cases exist was confirmed in writing by the social welfare appeals office on 9 January 2019 when it wrote: "On occasion over the years the approach of having 'test cases' has been taken or considered by the Social Welfare Appeals Office."</p><p>That test cases are unlawful was acknowledged by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection on 25 March 2019 in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which stated:</p><blockquote>	The Minister is also looking at changing legislation to permit deciding officers to make determinations on the employment status of groups or classes of workers. </blockquote><p>That test cases are unlawful was further confirmed in a letter dated 9 May 2019 from the Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the Committee of Public Accounts, which stated: </p><blockquote>	There is no legislative provision which provides for appeals officers to make decisions on the employment status of groups or classes of workers who are engaged or operate on the same terms and conditions.  </blockquote><p>In September 2000, the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts wrote to the Secretary General of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and requested to know why all couriers were classified as selfemployed by default by the Department.  In his reply, the Secretary General stated: </p><blockquote>	A number of representative 'test cases' were selected in 1993/94 for detailed investigation and formal insurability decision under social welfare legislation.  This process resulted in a decision by an Appeals Officer of the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 12 June 1995 who decided that a courier was selfemployed.  The Appeals Officer's decision established the criteria in relation to the employment status of couriers that has, since then, been generally accepted throughout the industry and also by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes </blockquote><p>The Department, in accepting the unlawful precedential test cases, which are specifically precluded by case law but that were created by the social welfare appeals office, and in using those precedential test cases to classify thousands of workers as selfemployed by default, is the biggest creators of bogus selfemployed workers in the State.  Both the current Minister for Social Protection and the former Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection have stated on record that the use of test cases was replaced by a code of practice that issued from an employment status group in 2000.  Former Minister, now Senator Doherty, in a reply to a parliamentary question, stated:</p><blockquote>	The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that the discussion in relation to the use of 'test cases' before the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection on 5th December 2019 related to a particular set of circumstances dating back to the early 1990s where a number of cases involving a number of employers in a particular sector were selected as so called 'Test Cases'.  This approach was a precursor to the subsequent development on a tripartite basis of the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or SelfEmployment. </blockquote><p>As proven in the reply from the Revenue Commissioners to the Committee of Public Accounts, the use of test cases never stopped.  The true factual position is that the decision from the employment status group, ESG, as recorded by the Communications Workers' Union, which was present in the ESG, was that it was the view of IBEC, the Department of Finance and Revenue that the <i>status quo</i>should prevail.  The <i>status quo</i>was that where a worker had a disagreement over his or her employment status, he or she can take a case to the High Court.  It does not matter what case a worker makes to the scope section, the defined policy of the State is to overturn any scope section decision that threatens test cases, regardless of evidence and case law, and to force the worker to go to the High Court to challenge his or her employment status.  At the same time, wealthy industrialists can classify workers as selfemployed, <i>en masse</i>, in private hearings, in free secret courts such as the social welfare appeals office or over lunch in the Burlington Hotel, as happened with couriers.  This is the code of practice that IBEC took back to its clients.  This is the code of practice Revenue enforces on workers to this day.  It is also the code of practice that the social welfare representative at the ESG took personally to the social welfare appeals office.<br/><br/>The <i>status quo</i>is the use of test cases continues to this day.  ICTU has calculated the loss of PRSI and taxes to the State from the construction industry alone at approximately &euro;240 million per year.  Extrapolating from this figure across all sectors results in an annual loss to the Exchequer in excess of &euro;1 billion every year.</p></speech>

The first thing I want to ask relates to test cases.  Mr. McMahon's submissions to committees over the years seem to have focused on test cases and it has been apparent for some time that the Revenue and the Department of Social Protection have denied that these cases existed.  Now that they have acknowledged that these cases did exist, they suggest that they are no longer in use, having been replaced by this charter.  Can Mr. McMahon indicate whether those historic cases have been implemented and are they still, in effect, being developed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin McMahon" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#B00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  Case law specifically precludes test cases.  Each case must be taken on its own merits.  Revenue has agreed that is the case.  It has also agreed to label all couriers as self-employed based on a decision from a social welfare appeals officer in 1995.  That decision was further clarified to the Committee of Public Accounts in 2000 where the Secretary General stated that a number of test cases were selected.  Revenue has told the Committee of Public Accounts that is why couriers are classified as self-employed to this day.  Are they still being implemented?  Yes, they are.  In 2016, a group of 16 construction workers took cases to the scope section where they were all classified as employees and not self-employed.  That was then appealed to the social welfare appeals office, which voiced its intention to use those 16 cases as test cases.  The 16 individual workers protested profusely that the State could not do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#B00500"><p>Mr. McMahon mentioned the scope section and its cases.  Do we have any idea how many workers win cases in the scope section and how often that happens, once a final decision is made and the employer does not appeal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin McMahon" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#B00600"><p>The Department of Social Protection has not given us any specific number of the number of cases that are overturned by the scope section.  We are told that it is approximately 30%.  We are told that a very small number of cases come through the scope section to the social welfare appeals office.  That is true, as was discussed in the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection in 2019.  There is a reluctance on the part of employees or workers who claimed to be employees to use the scope section because they are afraid of being victimised at work.  That was acknowledged by the Department of Social Protection as the overriding reason workers will not come forward.  The Department uses test cases and it stated as much in the article in <i>The Irish Times</i>to which I referred.  The former Minister, Senator Doherty, went on to say that the Department uses test cases with the agreement of employers and workers.  It is hard to see how one can get agreement from an entire industry of workers from 1995 and apply it to workers right across the board today.  These workers have no idea why they are self-employed and none of them are informed as to why that is the case.</p></speech>

He had seen a draft of a social protection committee report.  Can he give us an indication as to what he thought about that report?  Was it accurate?  Did it acknowledge failings?  Did it give recommendations as to how this matter could be rectified?  Did it give him confidence?</p><p>The report I think Mr. McMahon refers to is the draft report of another committee.  It would be confidential, as of now, but I think Mr. McMahon received a copy.</p></speech>

A number of meetings were held between 2018 and 2019.  I was the penultimate witness at that committee.  I told the committee pretty much what I have told this committee today about the use of test cases.  That does not appear anywhere in the report.  I gave that evidence despite the fact that the social welfare appeals office was asked in afterwards to explain the use of test cases.  None of that made it into the report, it was as though I was never there at all.  Am I satisfied with the draft conclusions?  No, I am absolutely not.  I have until 9 April to send a submission, which I will, to say that I am extremely dissatisfied with its report.  All the people who appeared before me from Revenue, the Department of Social Protection to Scope, none of them told the committee that there were test cases as Revenue has now told the Committee of Public Accounts.  As far as I am concerned, everything that went before my telling that committee that there were test cases is null and void.  It did not tell the full truth and the full truth, as this committee now knows, is that it used test cases.</p></speech>

From the Revenue and Department of Social Protection submissions, it seems they still fail to see there is an issue with the current system.  The question is where we go from here.  ICTU's statement said that the only effective resolution to this long-standing matter is the introduction of legislative measures whereby all workers are classified as direct employees in the first instance until proven otherwise by an employer.  Would Mr. McMahon agree that is really the only way that this can be rectified?</p></speech>

The Department of Social Protection and Revenue are specifically precluded from making group and class decisions by case law.  In the Denny case, a seminal case on bogus self-employment, Mr. Justice Keane was very clear that each case must be taken on its own particular facts; just because one is a courier one cannot say that all couriers are self-employed no more than one can say that of a journalist or doctors.  The Department has admitted that it is doing test cases and using the precedents to label entire industries as self-employed.  Where ICTU is saying that they should be employees by default and the employer should have to prove if they are self-employed, the way it works now is that the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection are classifying workers as default self-employed.  If the worker wants to appeal that decision he or she must go through a process, and that process relies on a worker not being able to overturn the decision.</p></speech>

The definition of self-employment has been an issue on these islands going back to 1860.  Undoubtedly, there are contracts for service which should be contracts of service.  In some cases that suits a worker who should be a direct employee because they perceive an incentive where they might pay less tax in the short term, but what they are doing is depriving themselves of employment rights and PRSI entitlements over time.  I have come across this on many occasions.  There has to be a bigger discussion beyond the view of the Department of Social Protection or the Revenue Commissioners.  There needs to be education on this too.</p><p>I talked about case law.  I take Mr. McMahon's points on the way the Department or Revenue operates.  Regardless of that, common law also applies.  If we look at the definition of a contract of service, and the appalling term, the law of master and servant, all that case law allows a person to raise an issue in the courts.  Mr. McMahon is correct, they say it should be done on a case-by-case basis and they use legal tests, the control test, the integration test and so on.  We know all the famous cases involving the <i>Sunday Tribune, </i>Readymix and so on.  Would it be fair to say that regardless of how agencies operate, it is open for any employee to take a case through the legal process to prove that he or she has a contract of service in the same way as the Uber case in the Supreme Court in the UK, which is likely to be a precedent that we would also recognise here?  That is an option, although expensive, perhaps prohibitively so.  </p></speech>

The way the process here works, as laid out by the Department of Social Protection, is that a worker must make his or her case first to the Scope section of the Department of Social Protection.  Then the employer, and it generally is the employer, can appeal a decision by the Scope section which says that the worker is an employee, to the social welfare appeals office.  If the social welfare appeals office overturns the Scope section decision, which it has done with every single courier case since 1993, then the worker's access to the courts starts at High Court level.  Before the social welfare appeals office existed, Scope decisions were appealed to the Circuit Court directly.  By using the social welfare appeals office, which is acting outside the legislation, it has raised the bar of access to the courts for workers.  It is prohibitive for a worker to take a case to the High Court.</p></speech>

That case was not overturned by the social welfare appeals office.  It was appealed from the social welfare appeals office to the High Court.  It was the State that paid.  That is an important point.  If the social welfare appeals office overturns the decision, it is the worker who must pay in the higher courts, not the State.  That is the basic problem with all this.  It is prohibitive.  It took six years and hundreds of thousands of euro in legal fees for the State to defend the Sandra Mahon Denny case.</p></speech>

If one goes through them, some employees, particularly couriers, fall into the category of direct employees.</p><p>They do not control how, when or where they do their work, they supply labour only, they are paid in fixed hourly rates, they cannot subcontract out their work, they do not supply materials etc.  It appears that some categories of worker meet the test of a direct employee.  We cannot assume, but seeing as how it is likely that that would be the court's conclusion, perhaps Revenue and the Department of Social Protection should recognise the fact now and prevent those within the industry from having to take a long test case.  It was clearly indicated in the Uber case in the UK that the drivers were direct employees.</p></speech>

I believe committee members have with them correspondence from the committee to me.  It says that the code of practice came from the employment status group, which was set up in a rush after I requested a scope section decision on my insurability of employment.  My case was specifically discussed by the group while it was <i>sub judice</i>.  The decision of the group, as recorded by the Communication Workers Union, which was present at the time, was that the<i>status quo</i>had to remain.  The <i>status quo </i>is test cases, which are prohibited by the higher courts.  The code of practice that was mentioned is a voluntary one, not a statutory one.  It has-----</p></speech>

It does not decide case law.  It does not decide insurability of employment.  Only case law does.  The code of practice is a box ticking exercise.  As the committee has seen in ICTU's submission, employment status is not decided by a box ticking exercise.  That is complete nonsense.  The code of practice can mean whatever one wants it to mean.  That the Revenue Commissioners have told this committee that it is on a par with, if not superior than, case law is outrageous.  It is not on a par.  Only case law applies.</p></speech>

Actually, it is the afternoon.  I am an hour behind.</p> <p>  One must ask what happens when things go wrong and people do not have their rights.  We saw much of that after the economic crash, particularly in the construction sector where people had spent their whole lives working, many of them self-employed.  It is only when one sees people reaching their 50s or approaching pension age and finding themselves out of work without an entitlement to a contributory pension that one realises how precarious this situation is for what is a large number of people.  Astonishingly, we have seen a growth in the number of people who are categorised as self-employed even though it is known that their work is precarious.  Do people believe that they really have a choice?  Are the courts a choice?  What should be done?  There will always be some degree of self-employment, but the extent of it now is out of kilter.  Solutions already exist in legislation.  Can they be implemented immediately and how would Mr. McMahon go about doing so?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.49" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin McMahon" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#D00600"><p><i>Cui bono</i>?  That is an important question.  Who benefits from the fact that the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection, while admitting that bogus self-employment exists, cannot and will not quantify it?  It is not the worker, it is not the pension fund into which employer's PRSI should be going but is not, and it is not the Exchequer, given that less tax is paid by the self-employed.  Only employers are benefiting from this.  If the Department can send social welfare inspectors to look through the knicker drawers of lone parents, it can look through its own data.  It has all of the data.  It simply does not want to look at them.<br/><br/>If the worker has a choice to go to the courts, why do the scope section and the social welfare appeals office exist at all?  They are meant to take the expense away from the worker.  If they cannot do that, they should not exist.  It is as simple as that.<br/><br/>The only solutions are laid out in legislation.  Anything else would require new legislation.  Any decision that is considered unsafe by the chief appeals officer can be set out.  Any use of a test case or any scope decision that has been overturned by the social welfare appeals office on the basis that a pre-existing test case exists is demonstrably unsafe.  It cannot be done.  This means that every case dating back to 1993 must be set aside.  The old process that existed before the social welfare appeals office was set up saw a decision of the scope section being appealed by the employer to the Circuit Court, which was a lesser bar and less expensive for the worker.  We should return to that situation immediately.  All existing and future cases on the insurability of employment that would have been appealed to the social welfare appeals office should be appealed to the Circuit Court.  Under current legislation, if the appeals office finds a case to be too complicated, it can refer the case to the Circuit Court.  Obviously, a case is too complicated for the social welfare appeals office if it does not understand that it cannot use test cases.  Therefore, all existing and future cases must automatically be referred to the Circuit Court.  That is provided for under law.<br/><br/>There are solutions, but these are the ones that must be implemented immediately if we are to be fair to workers.  We cannot have test cases and decisions arising from other test cases.</p></speech>

That would make a difference.  If the Department of Social Protection has stated that it does not feel compelled to act within the legislation, though, what would be the point in making more legislation that it could simply ignore?  The Department, the social welfare appeals office and the Revenue Commissioners have to accept the supremacy of case law.  They cannot ignore it.  Once they accepted it, there would be a purpose in creating legislation.  Until they do, however, there would be no purpose and it would be a waste of time.</p></speech>

I would like some clarification.</p><p>When Mr. McMahon says that the Department is using test cases and a decision is made on a test case, how many people could that test case affect?  If it is a substantial number, is it available to that group for one person to go forward to the court, for instance?  On test cases, there was recently a case in the High Court about the leaving certificate grading system, where many people had issued proceedings but just one case was taken to court for a hearing.  A decision was made on that and that dictated the outcome of the other cases.  Will Mr. McMahon outline examples of where a substantial number of people were expected by one test case?</p></speech>

The Department of Social Protection, Revenue and the social welfare appeals office are making group and class decisions.  They determine employment status by group and-or by class.  No legislation exists to allow that.  Therefore, no legislation exists to allow a group of workers to overturn that case or to appeal that case by group or by class.  There is simply no legislation to allow workers to do that.  This affects thousands of employees.  If one looks at all couriers going back to the origin of couriers as a type of work, going back to the early 1980s, from that time up to the present, all of those thousands of people have been classified as self-employed.  If one looks at construction, where the employer gets to designate employment status and the Department sought to have test cases in 2015, hundreds of thousands of workers are involved, past, present and future.</p></speech>

If there is a group of 100 people, I accept fully what Mr. McMahon is saying that they cannot take a class action, but there is nothing preventing all 100 from filing a High Court writ.  It is not the way I would like to go if there was a better appeals process, which obviously needs to be done by way of legislation.  There is nothing preventing all 100 people in a group entering a writ and one person going forward with a test case, which will dictate the outcome for the remaining people.

I gave the example of the leaving certificate grading system where quite a number of people issued High Court writs but only one case went forward.  In the scenario that Mr. McMahon is talking about, there is nothing preventing a group from issuing individual High Court appeals itself and for one person to then go forward to court with the case.  What is needed is a process to deal with the appeals process rather than having to go into the High Court.  That mechanism is there.</p></speech>

This involved ESB meter readers.  There were five of them and the judge consolidated the case.  That is as close to group or class decisions as one gets.  He made the decision that these workers were not self-employed, as the ESB claimed, and that they were employees.  That was in 2006.  To this day, Revenue and the Department of Social Protection are still ignoring the High Court decision, even though meter readers are in fact and in law employees, they are still classified as self-employed by Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  The problem is that they are simply ignoring the courts and case law.  One can do that, namely, put a group of workers together and get them to go one at a time, and they will still ignore it.  It does not get one anywhere.  They simply choose to ignore it.</p></speech>

Regardless of what the Department of Social Protection and Revenue might outline about the cases, which is not to disparage their specific responses, the issue of bogus self-employment is real.  Anybody who has been out in the real world knows that there are people who are classified as self-employed who, under any basic rationale, clearly are not.  They are working for one employer on a full-time basis for a prolonged period.</p> <p>  I refer to one case that I am aware of.  I have a report here from a person who won a case.  This person was working for a meat processing plant in Cork.  The report states that the person is a line worker for a specific employer so he regards himself as an employee of an agency.  He works for eight to ten hours a day.  He was subject to control and direction.  He is not free to take up similar work at the same time.  It goes further to highlight how this individual was clearly an employee.  However, his employment situation was that he technically worked for a company registered in his name in Poland, despite that he had never been to Poland.  It took six months for this person to get his Scope decision and a further six months to have his decision regularised.  Even then, his PRSI payments were apparently not backdated.  The Department of Social Protection referred to its method, which it is confident in, of catching bogus self-employment through inspections.  In the case I have outlined, there were not any follow-up inspections of that person's colleagues, who one would have to imagine are in the exact same position.</p> <p>  Representatives of Meat Industry Ireland attended the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  They spoke of the use of agency workers and they indicated that the use of agency workers in that sector was actually declining at the moment.  Does Mr. McMahon get a sense that the number of workers who are entrapped into this type of employment situation across all sectors is declining or increasing?</p><p>How many people are involved?  Is the emergence of new types of companies, such as Deliveroo, and workers associated with such companies contributing to an increase in such employment or is it a type of employment practice that is in decline, as stated by Meat Industry Ireland?  </p></speech>

I will take it from the start, and again the question here is <i>cui bono</i>?  Who benefits from this situation?  It is not the State and not the workers.  It is the employers who are using this practice of bogus self-employment to save themselves circa 30% on labour costs.  That is who benefits.  If the Revenue is saying that bogus self-employment is not an issue, it should prove it.  If it is saying it is an issue, it should quantify it.  Otherwise, it is not at this game at all.<br/><br/>On meat processing, what the Deputy is referring to with the agency are intermediary-type set-ups.  Those are what we call the workplace with no employees.  They are moving or being moved to intermediary-type set-ups, as would be used by the likes of Ryanair.  A company with six directors, all of whom are pilots, supplies services to Ryanair exclusively.  As the pilots association will confirm, as far as it is concerned, the pilots concerned are employees.  The practice of setting up an intermediary company to disguise the reality that people are employees is on the rise.  The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has said there are many thousands of these companies out there.  Some of these companies have even received awards from the State for what they are doing.  It is ridiculous.  <br/><br/>On inspections, this is very interesting.  Figures from the Revenue Commissioners on inspections show the number is in the low thousands.  Back in 1998, the Comptroller and Auditor General sent officials from the Revenue out to inspect 60,000 employment situations within the construction industry and they found 12,000 of them to be misclassified.  Two years later, the Committee of Public Accounts, under the chairmanship of the late Deputy Jim Mitchell, did the same thing.  Some 60,000 employment roles were examined and 12,000 were found to be misclassified as self-employed.  That is a huge number.  It was 18% or 19% back in 1999 and 2000.  Now, Revenue is doing at most a couple of thousand inspections per year and is saying it is capturing all the bogus self-employment.  How could it?<br/><br/>What changed was the employment status group.  A decision was made that the <i>status quo</i>must remain and those wide-scale investigations stopped completely.  They have never been repeated in any sector.  The level of bogus self-employment within the construction sector according to ICTU is now 23% so it has not decreased over the 20 years since this last came up in this committee.  It has increased.  </p></speech>

I referred to the meat processing sector because it is often the case that employees or self-employed people in that area happen to be independently working through an agency for a factory, for example, while also renting their accommodation from the same source.  It is not just that these workers' jobs are at risk but also their homes.  Does Mr. McMahon have any evidence or reportage regarding the type of means by which blacklisting occurs?</p> <p>  It occurs to me that-----</p></speech>

I say that because I understand how there could be an element of self-employment in the construction sector.  In many cases, we are talking about small, independent contractors which might need carpenters or labourers for a defined time.  It would not make sense for either party to be involved in an employment contract <i>per se</i>.  However, if we were to set out in legislation conditions to clarify when an obligation falls on an employer to consider someone an employee, for example, a defined period of time, number of hours or number of contracts in an employment, that could provide a means to easily resolve a large proportion of these cases.  Does Mr. McMahon have a sense of what those definitions should be regarding periods of time, lengths of contracts and numbers of hours worked?</p></speech>

It is not just me saying this because the Department acknowledges it and ICTU have stated this in the committee.  Fear of being blacklisted is the major concern.  It has happened in construction and in the case of the 16 workers I represented in the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2016.  I take the Deputy's point on whether some indicator could trigger employment status.  Really and truly, as the Revenue Commissioners have stated, it does not matter whether people want to be self-employed.  The only question is whether the legal criteria apply.  Nothing else matters.  People cannot choose not to pay tax just because they do not want to.  The State is entitled to its cut.  Everybody who gets paid has a contract.  The payer has a contract and it is the State that is entitled, as part of the social contract, to deduct taxes and PRSI.  Just because people do not want to pay tax and PRSI, they cannot use self-employment or bogus self-employment as the out.  It is not as simple as a tick-box exercise, even if Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the Social Welfare Appeals Office are using a tick-box exercise.</p></speech>

I have some questions now but I will allow a second round of questions.  I had to cut some members short to keep the meeting moving but I hope we will get to a second round.</p> <p>  On Mr. McMahon's submission and the matters detailed in the correspondence we have to hand, my concern is that we have one of the lowest rates of employer PRSI contributions in the European Union.  While that is fair enough, if there are discrepancies and the State is not getting its full whack, that is obviously a concern.  There are also concerns about precarious employment.  Some of my acquaintances have been caught in these bogus self-employment situations in construction and it is not very nice.</p> <p>  Most of what is happening seems to rest on the test case in 1995.  I will outline what I know about the case and Mr. McMahon can correct me if I am wrong.  The case in 1995 was taken by a courier who believed he was an employee.  He was classified by his employer as self-employed.  He then appealed that judgment to the scope section of the Department which upheld the decision.  The case was then to go to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  In the interim, the individual in question emigrated because his employment status was precarious at that stage.  At that point, the company, which I will not name although I am aware of the name, stepped in and produced another person who was counted as a worker.  My information is that this person may not have been an actual motorcycle, bicycle, van or lorry courier and may instead have been a director of the company.  His case was put forward to the scope section and it went through to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Subsequently, it was determined that person was self-employed.</p> <p>  I want to be careful here as I do not want anyone named but my understanding is that this is the test case on which rests all the later goings on regarding bogus self-employment and what is being used to explain and defend it at times.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

As the Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection has told the Committee of Public Accounts, a number of test cases were selected.  They do not explain how they were selected.  They do not explain who was involved in the selection process.  They do not explain what safeguards were taken to make sure these were actually representative test cases.  It was not the courier.  The courier went looking for a decision, from the scope section, because he was put forward by the courier industry as a test case.</p> <p>  The question arises whether he was actually representative of couriers.  The courier, who was meant to have been there, has put on record that he was not in the country and had emigrated.  It was confirmed by the general manager of the company that the worker had emigrated.  That begs the question, who actually was in the test case in the social welfare appeals office in 1995 if it was not the courier who was found to be an employee by the scope section?  Who actually appeared?  Because of this secrecy, we do not know.  We do not know which self-appointed spokesman for all couriers past, present and future stood in the social welfare appeals office and said they were happy to be called self-employed.</p></speech>

There is correspondence from the head of Revenue, dated March 1997, which was circulated to all known courier firms, particularly those which were represented at a meeting in the Burlington Hotel on 3 March 1997.

There is no reference other than the Chief Inspector of Taxes at the time asking the company to inform the courier companies to inform the couriers that this was going to go through.  They were not represented nor can anybody say they were represented nor can anybody say a single courier could speak for all couriers past, present and future for evermore.

The first part of the sentence is significant, which says because that person proposes to treat couriers.  We have heard many times this is not a matter for Revenue but one for the Department, yet here is Revenue setting out its position.  It was a participant in the meeting that was held in the Burlington Hotel on 3 March 1997 and there is correspondence from it afterwards that set out its position.  By any fair reading it would seem to me from those pieces of correspondence that Revenue was involved in this process of coming to this agreement, that it was setting out its interpretation of it afterwards and that it was central to it.  That is a concern because, from our point of view on the Committee of Public Accounts, there is the matter of whether the State got what was due to it in terms of the proper classification of PRSI.  Obviously we are also very concerned that the proper PRSI contributions for workers were not clocked up.</p> <p>  If a person who is a courier, who is on a building site or who is in journalism who is classified as self-employed were to a case, there is always a fear of being blacklisted, which happens across society and not just in this country.  It is very much a notable practice in England in the construction industry.  The route people here must go is through the scope unit in the Department of Social Protection, which in general seems to form an objective view.  When a case is lodged with social welfare appeals, however, the problem is an applicant seems to lose due to the 1997 agreement.  Is that the correct analysis of what is happening here?  The scope section may look at it objectively, declare that a person is an employee and is not self-employed, but when a case goes to the appeals section in the Department, that section refers back to the 1997 deal.  Is that what is happening?</p></speech>

Revenue has told the Committee of Public Accounts it is nothing more than a collection agent for PRSI on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  Revenue should not have a view other than it is a collection agent for the Department of Social Protection, but Revenue has told the committee it does have a view, and an historical view, that couriers are self-employed.  That is not Revenue's call.  Revenue does not get to make that call.  That is a social welfare call.  Revenue has overstepped the mark in even having an opinion on whether couriers are employed or self-employed.</p> <p>  Revenue says that for tax and PRSI purposes it has labelled them all as self-employed.  There is no other purpose to be self-employed.  It is only for tax and PRSI purposes.  A person is not self-employed for the purpose of telling bedtime stories.  It is for tax and PRSI.  Revenue has labelled them as self-employed, full stop, regardless of tax and PRSI.</p> <p>  The failure to collect PRSI is what now has us in a pensions crisis.  It is my opinion there is no pensions crisis.  There is a failure to collect employers' PRSI crisis going back over 40 years, which has never been resolved.</p> <p>  I have seen 19 decisions from the scope section.  Of those 19 decisions there is only one that I would say was questionable.  From the social welfare appeals office I have seen 19 decisions.  There is only one of those where I would say it was not questionable.  There is only one where it literally refused to hear the case.  Even though it was appealed, it literally refused to hear the case.  Once it gets into the social welfare appeals office, it is using test cases and precedents set by test cases.</p></speech>

Revenue has distilled all case law and legislation down to four what it calls tick box indicators, which have already been rejected by the courts.  It has set up a parallel system to the courts which does not pay any attention to case law, as we have already seen, and by which literally anybody can be classified as self-employed, and that is what it is doing.</p></speech>

He has interesting observations.  I understand from his opening remarks that he has been dealing with this issue for quite a number of years, so I admire his persistence on the issue.</p> <p>  In terms of the bogus self-employed, Mr. McMahon mentioned couriers, meter workers and journalists, for example.  How prevalent does he believe the overall issue is in society?</p><p>I looked at the NESC report from November of last year and it says it is about 10% of those who were declared self-employed in Dublin and elsewhere, yet in Kerry for example, it was higher, at around 21%, which might tally with Mr. McMahon's earlier remarks about farm labourers, etc.  I am interested in his opinion on the NESC report from November 2020.  I have heard him refer quite a bit to couriers today, but in which other sectors and areas does he believe bogus self-employment is very prominent?  How many workers are we talking about?  He referred to pensions or, in his opinion, the lack thereof, but how many employees are we talking about across the State at any given time?</p></speech>

We also know from ICTU that in construction self-employment is running at 23%.  Construction was at 19%.  We know from the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association that self-employment is rife among some airlines and it is becoming rife among other airlines.  That comes back to the point that it gives a competitive advantage to some companies over others not to have to pay PRSI, holiday pay, taxes or maternity pay.  It is driving down standards.  One cannot compete against these people, so therefore one must do as they do.  It is driving down standards right across the industry.  In a previous meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts when the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, was the Chairperson, he asked the National Transport Authority, NTA, what percentage of its workers were classified as self-employed.  It replied that 50% of its workers were classified as self-employed.<br/><br/>It is very important to understand that the State is the biggest creator of bogus self-employment status and the biggest abuser of existing case law.  If one includes, for example, intermediary set-ups like personal service companies, as they are used in RT&Eacute;, one is looking at many hundreds of thousands of workers.  It is retrospective.  It goes back 40 years.  If it keeps going the way it is going, it will be going for another 40 years.<br/><br/>In terms of what kind of money is being lost, as ICTU told the social protection committee, in construction alone it is &euro;240 million a year and that is a very conservative estimate of PRSI and taxes forgone to the State because of bogus self-employment.  If we extrapolate that across all sectors and include intermediaries such as IT companies then one is easily talking &euro;1 billion a year.  That is a very conservative figure.  Again, it comes back to <i>cui bono</i>, who is benefitting from this, because it is not the State and it is not the workers.  Why can Revenue not quantify it or prove it does or does not exist?  Why is Revenue not doing anything about it?</p></speech>

I look at it from country to country.  I have looked at it in various countries.  If one takes Germany, for example, it has a rate of self-employment which is half our rate while Greece has a higher rate than ours.  Self-employment rates in a country are not an indicator of an entrepreneurial country, having a higher rate is an indicator that there is something wrong in the system.  Nobody is going to tell us that Greece is the best in the world.</p></speech>

Revenue has access to all these figures.  The Department of Social Protection has access to the amount of PRSI taken by each person, so it could tell what company has taken PRSI at what rate and for how long.  There are the indicators.  If one wants an indicator of how many people are bogus self-employed, one can just look at that.  It is a little indicator.  If somebody had been working for two years and his or her 4% of PRSI has amounted to &euro;50 every week, that is a very good indicator that he or she is not self-employed.  It is the same person paying him or her for two years what amounts to a weekly wage, regardless of what way it does the matrix or how the company works this, it amounts to a weekly wage.  They are the indicators.  These bodies can look at all of this information, but they simply do not want to.  That is the problem.  Nobody has a clear picture, although there are indicators of what the picture is.  As the Deputy said, it is up to 25% and as the NTA said, it is up to 50%.  We know it is 100% for couriers and that 23% of construction workers are self-employed.  It is literally all over the place.</p></speech>

They can indicate if they wish to come back in and I will let them speak in that order.  I will ask a question while members are trying to decide on their questions.</p><p>In a reply to the Committee of Public Accounts from Revenue on 3 February, following its appearance before the committee to a question on the basis, legal or otherwise, for couriers to be deemed self-employed, we were informed it is primarily if they work for one company.  We received a long reply which included the lines:</p> <blockquote> 	However, case law has established tests to determine whether contracts are contracts for service (i.e. self employed contractor) or contracts of service (i.e. employee) and generally, these tests are applied to determine employment status along with a review of the evidence available regarding the nature of the relationship.  Revenue&rsquo;s position is that each case is individual and needs to be considered on its own merits. </blockquote> <p>The reason I read that out is that it seems to significantly at odds with the situation in the courier industry where the default position is that couriers are considered as self-employed in the first instance.  Could Mr. McMahon comment on that?</p></speech>

The system is rigged so that the worker simply cannot overturn the decision.  As we have seen, if worker wants to do so, it is a significant and costly process which starts in the High Court and will go to the Supreme Court, because that is what happens.  Is there a remedy for being labelled as self-employed?  No, in practical terms there is no remedy.  It does not exist.</p></speech>

Please provide further details in relation to this case including detailing any associated costs. </blockquote> <p>The reply stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Reference to a &ldquo;test case&quot; regarding bogus self employment amongst couriers had been raised at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Employment Affairs in 2019.  There is no one specific &quot;test&quot; case.  However, couriers were regarded as self employed for PRSI purposes as a result of a Social Welfare Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision. </blockquote> <p>As I understand it, that is one case.  It does not refer to &quot;decisions of&quot; but to &quot;a decision&quot;.  I take that to mean a single case.</p></speech>

How can the Revenue Commissioners say each case must be taken on its individual merits, but they have decided to label them all as self-employed, based on this test case from an appeals officer in the social welfare appeals office?  Both things cannot be true at the same time.  The evidence shows that the actual truth is that they have labelled all couriers as self-employed based on a social welfare appeals office decision.  That decision is clearly described by the Secretary General as a test case.  Both things cannot be true.  Somebody needs to nail the Revenue down on this.  It cannot be true.</p></speech>

It is up to the organisation to decide whether it is retrospective and whether there are tax liabilities.  I am using RT&Eacute; as an example.  Is there any kind of a sanction where misdesignation occurs?  That seems to be something we need to focus on.  Let us suppose the committee arranged a series of hearings to deal with this issue comprehensively, find the source of the problem and get to a point where we actually count because if we do not count, we do not deal with things.  What would be the ideal list of witnesses to get to the heart of the issue and what should be the pecking order?</p></speech>

The director general of RT&Eacute; brought in a private company - not the Department of Social Protection, Social Welfare Appeals Office or the Revenue - to do a scoping exercise because of decades of complaints from within RT&Eacute; that workers are misclassified as self-employed.  More than 81 situations were investigated.  The exercise was limited in scope, only looked back over a short period and those who were looked at were also limited.  Regardless, 81 of those workers were found to have been misclassified as self-employed.  Had the Department of Social Protection done what it should have done and carried out the investigation, no Statute of Limitations provision would have restricted how far back the Department could look.  It could look back to the year dot and declare that a person owes X amount in PRSI.  Eighty-one people in one company is a clear indicator that bogus self-employment is being used as a business model in RT&Eacute;.  Yet, it was only when the Committee of Public Accounts said it would investigate bogus self-employment that the Department of Social Protection issued a statement that it was looking at RT&Eacute;.  It is late it the day to be looking at it now.  Since the State has not looked at it and the Department of Social Protection has not carried out an inspection, there has been no sanction.  These workers, who had been deprived of their rights going back years, were then offered derisory employment contracts that made them worse off than being bogus self-employed.  That should never happen.  A notice should have issued to RT&Eacute; for all back payments to the year dot.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners have told the Committee of Public Accounts that they have no look-through power for intermediaries.  I am not sure whether the Department of Social Protection does.  It may be the case that it does.  I remember something from 20 years ago to the effect that personal service companies had come up 20 years ago and some provision was made so that the Department could look through personal service companies.  I believe there is already some provision in place.  It may not be with the Revenue but with the Department.  If not, I would start with intermediaries.  That is where the big money is in the information technology sector and the multinationals.  The question of construction and couriers is simple.  We should stop using test cases.  We should set aside those sectors where test cases have been used.  They are simple to solve.  However, the intermediary sector is one where there is a vast amount of money and no one can quantify it.  It does not form part of the &euro;1 billion loss.  That is why I take the view the figure would be far larger if we were to look at intermediaries.  I would start with intermediaries.  Construction and couriers are real low-hanging fruit.  That could be done straightaway or overnight.</p></speech>

Should reviews be done of all decisions that were made by the appeals office?  Is that an avenue worth chasing?  Let us assume we are trying to tackle this issue, deal with it with some finality and correct all the failings.  If the Minister is unwilling to champion it, would that warrant an investigation to examine what has occurred historically?</p></speech>

That should happen immediately.  This is a huge amount of money.  This affects our pensions.  We are now being told we have to work two or three extra years for our pensions but the State has not been collecting employer PRSI.  I will say it again.  There is no pensions crisis; there is a crisis arising from a failure to collect employer PRSI, yet we are paying for it.  Does there need to be an investigation?  Yes, absolutely.</p> <p>  Should the Department of Social Protection be involved in insurability of employment decisions at all?  I believe the Department has proven that it is not capable of doing this and I believe it should be removed from the role completely.  The scope office at the Department is the only office that is acting exactly as it should be.  Nothing is perfect but that office is 99% of the way there.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office should have nothing to do with it.  That office has already proven that it is incapable of dealing with these cases according to case law.  The Revenue Commissioners are collection agents.  They should do what they are told and not have opinions on whether people are employees or self-employed.  It is not their place.  The Revenue Commissioners should not be sitting down in the employment status group arguing that historically couriers have been self-employed.  That is neither here nor there and it has nothing to do with them.</p> <p>  We should take this away from the Department of Social Protection because it has a conflicting interest.  The Department wants to reduce the numbers on the unemployment register and will do it by any means necessary, including by making people work as bogus self-employed workers.  The Department has a conflict so we should take the conflict out and give this matter to someone else to address.  Before we do that, we must overturn what those responsible have already done wrong.  I have no objection to the Workplace Relations Commission taking over this role but it cannot be done in private.  That the WRC is doing this in secrecy is allowing an office of the State to make million and billion euro decisions over which no one has any oversight.  It is not done in the public domain, but it should be.</p></speech>

No one from ICTU is here but it sent a submission, in fairness.  The submission states that in the absence of legislative provision, unfortunately, individual workers will be forced to pursue costly civil cases.  Mr. McMahon has outlined that some of these workers would have to go to the High Court rather than the Circuit Court because these cases go to the appeals office in the Department of Social Protection.  Has anyone ever taken a case to the High Court?</p></speech>

In the ESB case, despite a High Court ruling that those involved were employees, the decision was simply ignored.  They have taken it upon themselves to decide that the Department is the sole arbiter of who is employed and self-employed and they do not have to listen to case law.  They are saying it straight up.  They maintain they are not compelled or bound by case law and they have said that clearly multiple times.</p></speech>

Until one can compel it to be bound by the legislation then it is actually a waste of time.  It is admirable and something which should happen but as it is using test cases, which are outside the law and are specifically prohibited by existing case law, how does one make legislation work when it will not use the legislation?</p></speech>

I count myself as a whistle-blower.  As a whistle-blower, there is no forum in the State where I can sit down and explain in detail from start to finish exactly what is happening and all the nuances involved.  This is a very brief meeting.  It is two hours long with five minutes for an opening statement.  It is not just an issue for me, but it is one for all other whistle-blowers.  No forum exists within the State where we can sit down and tell our stories, our way, without fear of reprisal.  It does not exist and that is not accidental.  That is on purpose.  They do not want whistle-blowers blowing the whistle and that is what I am doing.  I am blowing the whistle on bogus self-employment.  In the absence of a forum in which I can sit down and tell the story from start to finish, the Committee of Public Accounts is the only forum.</p></speech>

Obviously, we try to deal with meetings in a certain way but due to the Covid regulations it is a bit disjointed.  Sometimes we find ourselves talking over each other because we do not have the same benefits we would have if we were all in the same room.  We are doing our best with it and I thank Mr. McMahon for being patient with us.</p> <p>  We really appreciate the work Mr. McMahon has done on this.  It is a very important piece of work and he referred to the pension pot which is one issue of concern.  That is made up of PRSI contributions and if correct contributions are not going in, there will not be enough in the pot.  Another important point is the conditions for workers.  I know one of the Deputies mentioned earlier that anyone who thinks there is no bogus self-employment has not been out in the fresh air, and has not been out in the world.  I say that having been out in the fresh air because I have certainly seen it going on and am aware of it going on.  People involved in and working in those industries are in a very difficult precarious situation.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to try to do what we can.  Our role here is to make sure the public accounts are in order but by virtue of that, it will help in some way to protect those workers as well.</p> <p>  That was a good exchange.  I thank the members of the committee.  I know they asked questions and looked into this before.  They asked thoughtful questions and I thank them for that.  I also thank the committee secretariat.  The information has been provided to us.  I understand the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands intends to examine and report on the issue of bogus self-employment.  I propose we forward the information gathered on this matter to that committee for any action that is deemed appropriate.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

I remind everyone that, apart from me and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and all members are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Shanahan.  Senator Ahearn is running late.</p> <p>  Today we are carrying out pre-legislative scrutiny on the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Amendment) Bill 2020.  The Bill provides for the treatment of Covid-19 as an occupational illness by employers and requires them to report any occurrences of the disease in the workplace to the Health and Safety Authority.  The Bill was introduced in the D&aacute;il last year by Deputy O'Reilly, who is also a member of our committee.</p> <p>  To assist the committee in its consideration of this matter today, I am pleased to welcome from the Health and Safety Authority, Dr. Sharon McGuinness, chief executive, and Ms Yvonne Mullooly, assistant chief executive in the chemicals and prevention division.  From the Health Service Executive, I welcome Mr. Nick Parkinson, head of the national health and safety function; Dr. Lynda Sisson, national clinical lead for workplace health and well-being; and Professor Martin Cormican, national clinical lead for the antimicrobial resistance and infection control team and for the vaccine roll-out.  From the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I welcome Mr. Frank Vaughan, congress health and safety consultant, and Mr. David Hughes, deputy general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.</p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations on parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding the reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  However, today's witnesses are to give evidence remotely from a location outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Opening statements and other documentation have already been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite Dr. McGuinness to make her opening remarks on behalf of the Health and Safety Authority.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Yvonne Mullooly.  In the interests of time and with the committee's understanding, I do not propose to read the detailed statement and will instead concentrate my comments on the specifics of the proposed amendment, which are detailed from paragraph 16 of my written statement onwards.</p> <p>  In considering the amendment, the authority would state first that the protection of workers and the prevention of accidents, injuries and illness is always our primary goal.  To achieve this, we need to have robust and reliable information and data.  With regard to Covid-19, I would point out that the authority already has a significant level of information available to it in respect of cases of the disease in the workplace.  This information comes from both public and occupational health and safety reporting systems that are already in place and operating.  These include the requirement, under the biological agents regulations of 2013 to 2020, for an employer to report to the authority if an employee contracts Covid-19 as a result of occupational exposure from working with the virus.  The public health computerised infectious disease reporting system, CIDR, is managed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and the national incident management system, NIMS, collects data on incidents from the public healthcare sector.  All of these reporting systems are important sources of information not just for the authority but for public health authorities.  We have access to the data available on all three systems.</p> <p>  In addition, we have initiated the preparation of a regulatory impact analysis, RIA, on foot of a request from the board of the authority.  The intention of the board is to ensure the authority has comprehensive and immediate data to support the protection of workers from Covid-19.  The purpose of the RIA is to identify a range of possible options for the potential achievement of this objective and to provide detailed information on the costs, benefits and impacts of each option.  The RIA will provide our board with a basis for recommending the most appropriate way forward and will be considered by the board in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  I will now return to the specifics of the amendment, and I again refer members to paragraph 16 onwards of the written statement provided.  As I have already said, the authority would point out that the protection of workers and the prevention of accidents, injuries and illness is always our primary goal.  Covid-19 is an infectious disease which has caused a public health pandemic, and an individual has the potential to be infected by contracting it in or out of the workplace.  The most reliable data on Covid-19 in the workplace are the data collected in the infectious disease database known as CIDR, as these data are medically validated and confirmed by a Covid-19 PCR test.  The CIDR data are provided to the authority by the HPSC every week and give details of all cases of Covid-19 in all workplaces.  This allows the authority to identify quickly the workplace, its geographical location and the number of cases associated with it.  The information provided for in this Bill is, therefore, similar to that already supplied directly to the authority by the HPSC every week and, as such, there may be no additional benefit in the proposed amendment.</p> <p>  The Bill may be contrary to the scope of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 as the Act only provides for an occupational illness or disease that is attributable to work.</p><p>The wording in the Bill would in essence make Covid-19 an occupational disease if any worker in a workplace were to contract it, irrespective of where he or she caught the disease.  As Covid-19 can just as easily be acquired by employees outside of work and subsequently brought into the workplace, such circumstances would not be considered "attributable to work" under the Act.</p><p> The Bill needs to consider the implications on all employers of imposing a Covid-19 reporting obligation on them.  Most employers would not be in a position to assess or attribute Covid-19 infections to their workplace with any degree of medical or legal reliability, since Covid-19, as I stated already, can be acquired in community, domestic and workplace settings.  The amendment may leave employers with an obligation, which they may not reasonably or legally be able to fulfil, as there is no counter-obligation on the employee to provide detailed confidential medical information to his or her employer.</p><p> The Bill may introduce a significant administrative burden on certain employers, particularly those in the healthcare sector, to report information that is already reported to CIDR, and in certain circumstances is also reported to NIMS, as well as reporting requirements under the biological agents regulations directly to the Authority.  In that regard, information is already available through these three systems.</p><p> Employers who have a due to report to the authority under the biological agents regulations are saying that it is difficult to determine if cases of Covid-19 amongst their workers are occupationally acquired or have arisen outside the workplace due to community transmission.  Determining the source of Covid-19 infection in an individual can require detailed medical assessment by both public and occupational medical professionals.</p><p> There are, as has been stated, three reporting requirements in the State related to Covid-19 in the workplace &ndash; CIDR, NIMS and the reporting under the biological agents regulation.  A fourth is also under assessment by the authority, that is, the regulatory impact analysis noted earlier.  The added value in creating a fourth or possibly a fifth reporting system in Ireland for the infectious disease Covid-19 is questionable, as it may not provide any additional public or occupational health assurance or relevant policy-making information on Covid-19 in the workplace.</p><p> Guidance from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform requires the preparation of an RIA to support significant legislative developments which is why the authority initiated the RIA development process to consider options for reporting of Covid-19.  The authority believes that the RIA should be completed before any amendment is made to the 2005 Act or, indeed, any other occupational health and safety legislation.  Any regulation for Covid-19 reporting needs to be made on both a sound legal as well as a medical basis.</p><p> The authority's RIA development process involves consultation with a range of parties, including employee and employer stakeholders as well as Departments and agencies.  It is nearing completion and will go to our tripartite board for its consideration and recommendations.  We feel, therefore, amending the 2005 Act at this juncture may be premature.</p><p> To conclude, there are already three reporting systems in the State for cases of Covid-19 in the workplace.  The authority has access to all three and is currently completing a regulatory impact analysis, which is looking at options for a possible fourth system.  Worker protection is already well served by all these reporting systems and by the work that the authority is doing in relation to the work safely protocol and specific occupational health and safety legislation such as the biological agents regulation.  Worker protection is also at the forefront of all the engagement and supports the authority provides to public health, which is ultimately responsible for addressing this global pandemic.  The key to managing Covid-19 ultimately resides with all of us adhering to public health advice, guidance and regulations.</p><p> On behalf of the Health and Safety Authority, I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to present to the committee today and I look forward to answering questions in due course.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Dr. Lynda Sisson and Professor Martin Cormican.</p> <p>  As the members will be aware, the HSE made a submission to the committee and we will be happy to take questions on it.  I will, therefore, confine my opening statement to some general points.</p> <p>  At the outset we would like to emphasise that the HSE views the health, safety and welfare of its staff and service users as being of the utmost importance.  Our position on, and dedication to, securing safety, health and welfare at work is demonstrated through our corporate safety statement and suite of supporting policies.</p> <p>  The past 12 months have been a challenging time for the health service, as a front-line service.  They have brought new health and safety management challenges and the organisation, its managers and staff have been required to adapt to a very rapid pace of change.  We have worked hard to manage the health and safety issues and we would like to strongly acknowledge the support and dedication of all the staff of the HSE in meeting the best possible standards under the unique circumstances presented by the pandemic.  We would also like to acknowledge the support and assistance received through our collaborative relationships with key stakeholders, such as our union colleagues, the Health and Safety Authority and the State Claims Agency.</p> <p>  One of the areas in which we have adapted, is that of Covid incidence reporting.  We have strongly encouraged and seen a high level of reporting via three channels: first, via public health and the computerised infectious disease reporting, CIDR, system; second, internally, via the national incident management system, NIMS; and, finally, externally, to the HSA under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Biological Agents) Regulations 2013 (as amended).  Following changes to the biological agents code of practice, external reporting to the HSA of cases of the disease considered to have arisen from occupational exposure commenced in November last.</p> <p>  The information gleaned through these approaches is regularly analysed in the HSE and action is taken, as necessary, to respond to any significant findings and trends.  The public health CIDR system takes a broad approach, and records all cases including those affecting healthcare workers, regardless of whether they are in active HSE service.  It does not specifically determine occupational causality.  NIMS collects cases relating to active HSE staff and seeks information on whether there is an occupational or workplace link.  Similarly, the current external HSA reporting requirements apply to cases that are work-related, that is, resulting from occupational exposure.  In both cases the relevant manager, potentially with medical, occupational health and contact tracing or public health assistance, makes an analysis as to whether the case is work related.  We have developed documentation to support managers in the decision process.</p> <p>  The current reporting structure provides for a nuanced approach to Covid incident reporting, which aligns well with the systems already in place for the statutory reporting of other incident types.  Potential issues with a broad-brush reporting requirement arise from categorising Covid-19 as an occupational illness.  Covid-19 is significantly, perhaps predominantly, transmitted in the community, with a consequent impact upon people who work - observed patterns in reported incidents suggest that cases within the organisation follow community trends; healthcare consists of many professions and work activities and cannot be considered homogenous in terms of exposure to Covid.  While a causal relationship may be demonstrable in some situations, for example, unprotected exposure during laboratory work with the live infectious agent, this would not be the case across all areas of the organisation; and the requirement could lead to the extensive and unfiltered reporting of many thousands of cases across a workforce the size of the HSE - hence the pool of cases received by the HSA may be clouded by community transmitted cases, potentially making it harder for the enforcement authority to target action.</p> <p>  It is often very difficult to identify where and when a person acquired an infection, such as Covid-19.  This is because at the point in time when infection occurs, the person catching infection is generally not aware that anything has happened.</p> <p>  If the person develops symptoms it is usually five-to-six days after he or she became infected, but the symptoms can develop after one day or can take up to 14 days.  This means that a person who develops Covid-19 could have become infected in any of his or her interactions with another person anytime during the previous 14 days in any setting.</p> <p>  For people, including healthcare workers, who move between different settings such as home and work, it is difficult to say where they acquired infection.  It is sometimes possible to link a healthcare worker infection to the workplace with reasonable confidence based on all the circumstances.  Sometimes it is possible to link a healthcare worker infection with the workplace with great confidence, based on sequencing of the genes of the virus from the worker and others linked to the same workplace.</p><p>The circumstances of infection also make it very clear that healthcare workers become infected outside the workplace because they have become infected during periods of leave and in other circumstances in which their infection was linked to an outbreak in a non-healthcare setting.</p><p> It is noted that occupational illnesses or diseases are specifically excluded from the reporting requirements under the safety health and welfare at work general application regulations, as amended, potentially due to the clear reporting requirements for specific cases or circumstances arising under the social welfare (occupational injuries) (prescribed diseases) legislation.  This legislation lists or prescribes specific examples of occupational injuries and diseases and, in the case of the latter, the industries or activities they are associated with, and the circumstances under which a case may be considered to have been work-related.  The ethos underpinning the legislation is essentially echoed in the approach taken in the biological agents regulations and associated HSA code of practice, that is, occupational injuries and diseases are reportable where there is a clear, demonstrable and epidemiologically sound association with a given type of work or workplace and it can clearly be differentiated from cases where there are other, additional or alternative causes or contributing factors.</p><p> The HSE is enthusiastic about, and embraces, any new and enhanced legislation that furthers the safety, health and well-being of our staff and service users.  Assuming robust application, the current systems should provide quality, targeted data upon which the HSE can review its approach to Covid occupational safety health risk management while also allowing the enforcement authority to respond to cases or clusters of occupationally acquired Covid-19 infection in a focused manner.  In addition to considering potential further legislation, perhaps the committee would also consider the role further guidance and instruction might play.  I thank the members of the joint committee for the opportunity to present the HSE&rsquo;s views on this important Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.132" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Vaughan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021033000002#C00200"><p>ICTU welcomes the opportunity to have made a submission on this matter and we are pleased to accept the invitation to join the committee in its discussions this morning.  As the representative body for trade unions and their members, the congress has always taken the lead in seeking to create safer workplaces and we see occupational safety and health as a key concern of unions.<br/><br/>We know that wherever people congregate there is a risk of catching or spreading Covid-19.  Workplaces, regardless of sector, are potential vector points and this is explicitly recognised in public health advice that as many people as possible work from home.  It is in the interests of workers and society as a whole that all cases and clusters in workplaces are reported.  Workers must be protected and reporting is a small but important part of our legislation which triggers the protections provided in law to mitigate the risks and protect us from workplace hazards.  The current Covid-19 pandemic is such a hazard and infections must be considered as a reportable workplace incident.  The EU has recognised this by expediting the revised biological agents directive and amending it to include SARS-CoV-2 within its ambit.  The EU recognised it from June last year and set a deadline for states to enact it on or before 24 November 2020.  Ireland enacted it on that day and now must explicitly extend the reporting it provides for to encompass all workplaces.<br/><br/>The amendment under discussion is to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  We think it is useful to reflect on some aspects of the existing legislation which help to inform our perspective and which we detailed in our earlier submission.  The Act defines the term &quot;accident&quot; in section 2 as meaning &quot;an accident arising out of or in the course of employment which, in the case of a person carrying out work, results in personal injury&quot;.  The term &quot;personal injury&quot; is then defined by the same section as including &quot;(a) any injury, disease, disability, occupational illness or any impairment of physical or mental condition, or (b) any death, that is attributable to work&quot;.  Our primary legislation would seem to be clear that an occupational illness is covered by the Act and is, therefore, reportable to the HSA, which has statutory responsibility &quot;to promote, encourage and foster the prevention of accidents, dangerous occurrences and personal injury at work in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions&quot;<i>, </i>as per section 34(1) of the Act.<br/><br/>Some years ago, a report entitled A Review of the Occupational Diseases Reporting System in the Republic of Ireland was prepared for the HSA by Professor Anne Drummond of UCD.  The report recommended:</p> <blockquote> 	[A]<i></i>review [of] the requirements of the Notification of Accidents Regulations to require that employers report accidents resulting in personal injury (including disease and illness) or death, and record occupational diseases and work-related illnesses contracted as a result of an exposure over a period of time to risk factors arising from work activity, and report to the HSA when requested. </blockquote> <p>Notwithstanding this, a position was adopted regarding the reporting of accidents in an amendment to the general application regulations in 2016.  These regulations were made pursuant to section 58 of the 2005 Act and impose an obligation on employers to report accidents and dangerous occurrences in the workplace.  However, unlike the Act and the recommendations from the report, the regulations, at regulation 224, define the term &quot;personal injury&quot; as not including &quot;any disease, occupational illness or any impairment of mental condition&quot;.  In other words, disease and illness were specifically excluded.  It is not entirely clear why this view was adopted, but the effect of the provision is that employers are not obliged to report occurrences of occupational disease or illness.  This is in contrast to accidents whereby employers are obliged to report to the HSA any accidents resulting in more than three days' absence from work.<br/><br/>The Bill seeks to address this deficiency in workplaces incidences of Covid-19 and would assist in protecting all workers by requiring all workplaces to comply with the minimum requirements of the biological agents directive.  While some might contend that this directive applies only to a restricted range of workers, such as those in laboratories, there is no such stipulation in the legislation.  We would maintain that the legislation clearly covers all contexts in which workers might be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and thus at risk of infection and Covid-19 disease.  There is no justification for making a distinction between workplaces in a pandemic of this nature.<br/><br/>The suggestion that reporting would expose employers to litigation has been advanced by some in government as a concern.  Such a concern is misplaced and is a conflation of two entirely different legal consequences.  The HSA inspects, advises, recommends and issues advisory notices.  Only in cases of absolute non-compliance does it prosecute.  Litigation is reliant on proof of negligence.  The requirement to report is a long way short of admission of negligence.  The argument is a diversion from the absolute responsibility of the Legislature to protect workers in their workplaces.  We believe it is important, therefore, that there be a direct reporting requirement to the national authority charged with responsibility for health and safety in our workplaces.  Workers want nothing more than a safe place to work and, therefore, ICTU supports the Bill.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for their submissions and contributions.  This proposed legislation is sponsored by me.  I will not say it close to my heart, but it is a little bit.  The Bill, as we know, arose from conversations during April and May last year regarding a request made by ICTU to introduce an amendment to ensure that Covid-19 becomes a notifiable disease.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses for their views on the previous situation.  I will refer briefly to a contribution from another Deputy to the Covid committee.  He referenced the previous regulations from 2007.  We know that in 2016 a change was made to remove infectious diseases from the regulations.  Do the witnesses have a view on why that was changed and what the potential implications would be if we reverted to the pre-2016 situation?  I am easy about who goes first.  Perhaps they can go in the order in which they spoke earlier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sharon McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021033000002#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  The pre-2016 regulations were introduced when we amended the general applications regulations for the purposes of the reporting of accidents and incidents.  At the time occupational illnesses were not included as part of the definition of "personal injury".  One reason for that was that we introduced the amendment to put a stronger emphasis on the reporting of accidents and incidents at that time and made sure that people reported them to us so that the regulation had that particular driver.</p> <p>  At the same time, there was no defined list of occupational illnesses at national or European level.  In terms of the intention of the board when it reviewed the regulatory impact analysis at the time and made the recommendations to the Minister regarding the legislation, it was felt that without a defined list, it would be difficult for employers to identify with any degree of certainty an occupational illness.  The key point regarding personal injury and the definitions used in the Act is that they must be attributable to work.  It is not simply the case that somebody has an occupational illness; it has to be attributable to work.  That is a key factor in that regard.</p> <p>  Part of the current regulatory impact analysis involves an option that might include an amendment to section 224 of the 2016 regulations.  We are examining that, and that could come forward in due course.  It would require reporting.  However, the challenge will still remain as to whether an employer can, with any degree of certainty, confirm that Covid-19 was caught by a worker in a workplace and attributable to the work activity that was going on.  That remains a challenge if the legislation is changed or that definition is introduced.  </p> <p>  We get notice of all of the cases and outbreaks of Covid in workplaces.  We are part of a number of outbreak control teams established by public health.  Ultimately, public health manages an outbreak and we are there to support and guide.  While there is an absolute priority for worker health and safety, and the protection of that, when there is an outbreak we are very much mindful of that.  Equally, it is important to manage an outbreak because we do not want the disease to move out to the community.  There is a higher public health requirement.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

In my opening remarks I mentioned that we were not entirely clear why the amendment was introduced in the way it was 2016.  I have no particular insight on that, bar the fact that there seemed to be resistance to doing that.</p> <p>  A couple of speakers have remarked on the fact that we have a community incidence of Covid-19, and that is probably the preponderance of cases we have the State.  Nobody is denying that.  Clearly, we have had clusters of infection in workplaces, not only necessarily in the highlighted areas such as healthcare, but also last year, tragically in a number of our meat factories.  Sometimes I suspect that the concentration on such cases mitigates the occurrences in other sectors.  Cases are happening across the board.</p> <p>  With all occupational diseases, not just Covid-19, there can be difficulties in determining precisely what has occurred in an occupational context as opposed to some other source, be it wider environmental factors or whatever.  It seems to be the case that many other jurisdictions have come up with ways of dealing with that, and an evidence-based approach is taken.  Over the past year various other countries have adopted essentially a basis of likelihood with regard to Covid-19.  The argument that one cannot determine the source of the infection brings us into a blind alley.  There are ways of determining probability and likelihood.  I do not think that is a sufficient reason to refuse to-----</p></speech>

It is not credible to say that the amendment is not required purely and simply because it might place an administrative burden on someone or might be hard to prove, because the systems can be put in place to determine what has happened.  We know, for example, that community transmission is a significant factor, but it would be foolish to pretend that it is only community transmission.  There are people who have acquired this infection in their workplace, and I do not think anybody would contradict that.  In a scenario whereby they had contracted Covid-19 in the workplace, their employer is currently not obligated to deal with that.  We need to place that obligation on the employer.</p> <p>  The purpose of this engagement is to tease out the potential implications of the passage of the legislation and to ensure that we robustly engage with any of the issues identified.  I ask Mr. Vaughan to outline his opinion on the notion that somehow the possibility that an administrative burden might be placed upon an employer would be sufficient reason not to proceed with this.  I do not accept that.  Employers would not necessarily be resistant to an administrative burden if it improved the health and safety of their staff.  In my experience, and as a former union official, the vast majority of employers want their workers to be safe.  Not only that, they want to be able to loudly proclaim that and have it on the public record.</p> <p>  There is a reason some workplaces have been singled out for special attention during this pandemic, with meat factories, nursing homes and hospitals being the top three.  Nobody is suggesting that the reason they were singled out for special attention was they happen to be located in areas where there is a high level of community transmission.  In fact, the reason these workplaces have been singled out for specific and special attention is they have become sites of transmission.  I contend that where this has happened and infections have been acquired in a workplace, that should be treated as an occupational illness purely and simply because it is an illness a person acquired in the conduct of his or her work.</p> <p>  The point made by Congress is important.  That is not an admission of or proof of negligence on behalf of any employer, in the same way that any workplace injury or illness is not negligence.  Negligence is not automatically assumed.</p><p>I was alarmed to read some of the submissions where the two were linked in that this will automatically mean that negligence is proven.  This is not the case as negligence is proven in many forums.  In the opinion of our witnesses, it is true to say that Covid-19 is acquired in the workplace?  If one does not call it an occupational illness or workplace injury, what would one call it if it is contracted in the course of one's work?  I am aware that in the regulations, diseases like contact dermatitis are mentioned.  Again, one has to prove that it was contracted in the workplace and it could have been contracted elsewhere.  In all likelihood this is probably a good enough definition but I am interested to hear the views of our witnesses on what we should say when someone contracts the disease in the workplace because people do and it has been happening.  The proof of that is the fact that we have had several types of work singled out for particular and special attention.  Could I have our witnesses views on that point starting, perhaps, with the Health and Safety Authority, the HSE, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, if that is okay?</p></speech>

The idea of an occupational illness acquired in the workplace is one thing but being attributable to work is another aspect of all of the considerations we have regard to in the Act.  Even the HSE in its earlier statement said that certain cases can be attributed directly to work and that is what should be reported and recorded.</p> <p>  On the data that we receive through the public health computerised infectious disease reporting system, CIDR, we already have the high level element of what is happening in a workplace in the numbers of workers who will have contracted Covid-19.  This allows us to respond appropriately in those aspects.  In that respect we are supportive of looking at and ensuring that employers and others are clear as to what is attributable to work and how they can report that fully and legitimately.  That is already in play in the biological agents regulations, as I have already said, but equally, we are looking at it in the wider context for other workplaces through the regulatory impact analysis that is ongoing.</p></speech>

The issues around administrative burden, etc., will apply in the circumstances where a fourth set of information is introduced.

It is an important feature.  Reporting is not necessarily just about the individual cases but is about surveillance.  We know, for example, that in the last week the epidemiology reports are indicating that although most of the economy is closed, there were 19 outbreaks in workplaces.  If one considers hospitals, healthcare facilities and residential facilities, there were 16 outbreaks.  That is where the health service is fully operational and where workplaces are practically closed.  We have an issue with clusters in workplaces and the surveillance that a requirement to report would give would assist the public health authorities, but as importantly from the point of view of workers, would demonstrate that this State is taking seriously its responsibilities to protect workers in their workplace.  The arguments that have been made, it seems to me, are that workers must wait.  That is a familiar argument.  Workers cannot wait as their health, safety, welfare and their very lives are at risk when the economy opens up if there is not a proper reporting mechanism to deal with outbreaks in workplaces.</p> <p>  The other argument that has been suggested is that the information is already available.  Perhaps it is already available but there is no requirement to drill down into that information.  For example, we can say that it is in particular sectors but we cannot get to the meat, and more particularly the workers or their representatives do not find out the actual locations unless it becomes public knowledge.  The information being available and a requirement on the State to act are not the same thing and in this case they definitely are not.  </p> <p>  A further argument that is being made is that, essentially, a worker has to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that they got it in their workplace.  That is surely too high a standard in a pandemic.  The number of healthcare workers who have currently contracted the disease is 28,038, as reported yesterday.  The majority of them were not reported to the Health and Safety Authority because there was no requirement to do so until the 24 November 2020, when the European directive became enforceable in every country.  </p> <p>  We have a problem here and it is putting our heads in the sand to say that taking the requirement to report disease in 2016 was appropriate when we are now in a pandemic.  This amendment would put this requirement back there and it should be back there.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I am not opposed to enhancing reporting requirements when the added value is clear but I believe that the added value is lacking in this Bill.  Both Dr. McGuinness and Mr. Parkinson have made it clear to me that the reporting systems which are already in place are significant.  Strengthening those systems by providing additional resources to ensure that they are fully implemented seems to me a more prudent route than creating more layers within the system.  My colleague from Kildare North, Deputy Lawless, spoke previously in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the Bill.  Members of all parties and none have broadly agreed during this pandemic that our path must be shaped by expert advice so the very clear reservations that both Dr. McGuinness and Mr. Parkinson have outlined this morning should give us all food for thought as to what exact benefits will derive from the Bill.</p> <p>  I recognise the point made by Dr. McGuinness that it could prove very difficult for employers to judge whether an employee contracting Covid-19 did so in his or her workplace and therefore should be reported.  Obviously, there have been some clear cases of workplace outbreaks that we are all aware of but of the people I know who have contracted Covid-19, the vast majority have no idea where it was transmitted to them.  Their employers, therefore, would not have been in a position to judge in a majority of cases.</p> <p>  We should also note that the vast majority of businesses have acted responsibly throughout the pandemic by following all public health advice, despite the crippling impact on their businesses.  Too often businesses are spoken of in extremely negative tones on the basis of actions by a small minority or handful of businesses in the entire country.  Having been an employer for most of my life, I would be very conflicted if an employee advised that he or she had contracted Covid-19 but did not wish me to inform anybody else.  On the one hand the Bill would require me to do so but on the other hand I presume doing so against the express wishes of an employee may cause a breach of GDPR requirements.</p><p>These are issues that large companies with expert legal advice may be able to find the right solution for.  However, for the sector that I represent, the SMEs, which are the backbone of the Irish economy, such a scenario would be challenging and adds considerable cost and burden.  These companies need clarity from State bodies as to their requirements and this is lacking from the Bill in its current format.</p><p> We all want to protect workers and we all agree that under no circumstances should anyone work in an unsafe workplace or in a workplace that causes significant risks to one's health.  We need to equally ensure that the administrative, and potentially the financial burdens placed on employers by the State do not result in workers no longer having a workplace.  Businesses up and down the country are battling to survive a crisis that, as we are all aware, is not of their own making.  The last thing they need is additional burdens being imposed on them by the State, particularly where the added value is "questionable", which is what we heard this morning on the basis of expert views.  Having said that, if the Bill is to progress I suggest that we may be better served by considering the broader category of infectious diseases, rather than limiting the matter to Covid-19.  I appreciate, as we all do, that Covid-19 is a challenge we are currently facing but a broader Bill may leave us in a better position in the long term.</p></speech>

That is an obligation in the public health regulations.  The idea that an employer would be breaching GDPR regulations is stretching it.  The reality is we are dealing with a pandemic and with something that is conveyed from one human to another.  We must all work to ensure that wherever there are outbreaks, be they in households, workplaces, hospitals or institutions, they can be dealt with in a way that suppresses the virus.</p> <p>  I agree that the wider question of removing regulation 224, as the Senator has suggested, is a bigger issue and that needs to be dealt with.  The 2007 report by Professor Anne Drummond of UCD did not suggest that it should be withdrawn from the Act.  It was an original requirement in the Act that disease would be reportable.  That requirement was taken out in 2016 and the HSA is conducting an RIA on that.  The reality is that Covid is rampant.  Lots of workplaces are looking to get staff back in and if we do not get a reportable system then our ability to control this disease is lessened and workers are less protected.</p></speech>

A reporting system of any sort will support that goal but it does not prevent us going ahead and making sure there are other systems in place to support and protect workers, particularly in relation to Covid-19.  We inspect and provide advice, support and guidance directly to employers and employees.  We have a workplace contact unit that is available to all employees if they have any concerns about their health and safety in the workplace.  That is still our driver and that will continue whether we have two systems, one system or five systems.  That will always be our ultimate driver.</p> <p>  On the wider context of that, we are looking at occupational illness in a general sense.  We have been looking under our current strategy to have better recording and reporting because it is something that needs to be addressed in the wider context.  The decision around the 2016 regulations was taken by our tripartite board, which is made up of employer, employee and other stakeholders and the board made a recommendation to the Minister in due course.  We have done a lot of consultation, we will continue to do that consultation and whatever the outcome from the discussions here is, we will take that on board and implement it when and if necessary.</p></speech>

Was it based on the evidence that is being suggested, that the three existing systems are a better way of tracking this or what was the background to that decision?</p> <p>  Perhaps additional reporting restrictions or obligations by employers are not the way to go here.  As we start to reopen the economy - and as other speakers have said, most of the economy is closed - what are the new expectations of employers?  Is the HSA modifying its guidelines in respect of antigen testing, for example, which seems to be on the verge of being accepted as a tool?  Is the HSA offering new advice to employers?</p> <p>  On the other side, the profile of risk from this virus changes significantly as we vaccinate those over 70 and those who are vulnerable to illnesses.  How will this change the HSA's view towards workplaces and the safety of opening workplaces?</p> <p>  Does the HSA have adequate experience with employers in respect of cases that are unearthed?  If the HSA is not finding it adequate, is it due to deficiencies in its powers or what is the situation?</p></speech>

I mentioned the 2016 regulations and we made that particular amendment because there was a low level of reporting of workplace accidents in general at that stage under the 2011 regulations.  We needed to make sure that was increased so we had proposed an amendment.  A regulatory impact analysis was completed as part of that particular legislative process.  At the time of the RIA, we identified that there were difficulties for employers in assessing and attributing disease or illness to a workplace activity and that there were concerns there.  Therefore, at the time the board of the authority decided, after all the considerations, not to put in the requirement for the reporting of occupational illness onto the issues where it developed it at a national and EU level.  We have kept and will continue to keep that under review as matters go forward.</p> <p>  On new advice, the HSA has a responsibility under the work safety protocol.  We have worked closely with colleagues on the employee and employer side in the initial development of the return to work safely protocol and then the later work safety protocol.  Together with a range of other inspection bodies, we are involved in the inspection and checking of adherence to the work safety protocol.  The detail in that protocol is at every stage predicated on the public health advice.  As that changes, the advice in the protocol changes.  The general premise and framework is for employers and employees to work together to make sure: there is a Covid response plan in place; people are informed and trained; and there is a lead worker representative in place to support the employer and other workers.  This is done in order to protect and prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace.</p><p>That is very much there and obviously any changes to the public health advice would be reflected in that particular document.  Obviously, as more people are vaccinated in the wider community - it is not an area for which we have responsibility - the case numbers go down generally.  That can have a beneficial effect in the workplace.  Likewise, when workers in particular sectors such as healthcare also get vaccinated, that also protects them.  Ultimately, we are still very much minded to continue our roll-out of the advice, support and inspections that we do for Covid, whatever stage the vaccination programme is at.  The important thing is to maintain keeping Covid out of workplaces but, equally, supporting public health in the wider community response to outbreaks of it.</p><p> Our general experience with employers and our inspections has all been positive.  Employers are happy to see us when we check protocols.  They are pleased to show us how they have done the job and how they are putting in place the necessary public health measures.  When there are specific outbreaks of Covid in a workplace, we support the public health management of that outbreak.  Sometimes we go in as the boots on the ground into particular workplaces such as the meat processing, retail, manufacturing or construction sectors.  We go in to support the public health officials to ensure their recommendations are put in place.  It has been a positive engagement.  Throughout this, all of the discussions between public health and occupational health have been done generally with employee and employer considerations on board.  Both sides have been supportive and engaged in those discussions throughout the process of managing Covid.</p></speech>

I also thank Deputy O'Reilly for putting forward this matter as it has provided us with an opportunity to examine and tease out this issue.</p><p>Who is doing the RIA, and when will it be finalised?  Dr. McGuinness said the Health and Safety Authority receives weekly data reports on Covid-19 workplace outbreaks.  These are based on medically confirmed and validated data.  How does that work?  Will she talk us through exactly how those reports get to the authority?  Who is responsible for informing the authority and where do they get the information?  Is there any obligation on employers to report Covid in the workplace?</p><p>There is a small contradiction in some of the evidence.  I apologise if I am misquoting him but I think I heard Mr. Hughes say that employees have an obligation to tell an employer if they have Covid-19.  In the Health and Safety Authority submission, however, it is stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The amendment may leave employers with an obligation, which they may not reasonably or legally be able to fulfil, as there is no counter-obligation on employees to provide detailed confidential medical information to their employer.  Creating a requirement for employers to capture and report alleged incidents of COVID-19 to a third party may also have GDPR implications. </blockquote> <p>There is a contradiction.  I am not sure which of the two is correct.  Does an employee have an obligation to tell his or her employer that he or she has Covid-19?  In that instance, I am also aware of the advice we all have heard that, if a person thinks he or she has the symptoms, then that person is asked to stay at home and get a test by the public health people.  If somebody has the symptoms, are they obliged to tell their employer about it?  How is Covid-19 reported to the Health and Safety Authority?  Is it from the public health people, the employer or the employee?</p><p>Should the employer have permission from the worker to report he or she has Covid-19?  For example, say I am working in a particular facility and I contract Covid-19.  Should the employer simply report a case of Covid-19 in the workplace or go further to report David Stanton has Covid-19?</p></speech>

An employee in the original Act cannot put colleagues at risk.  They are obliged to avoid putting their colleagues at risk.  Labour lawyers and trade union officials of experience take the view that such an obligation in a pandemic requires Covid-19 to be reported to a person's employer.  If a person is symptomatic, if a person suspects he or she has it or if the public health authorities say he or she has it, that person would be obliged to report it.  By not doing so, that person would be putting his or her colleagues at risk and an employer would be entitled to move against such an employee in that situation.  There is an obligation without doubt to report to one's employer.</p> <p>  On the question of permission to report, given the employee has an obligation to tell his or her employer, the employer then would not have to seek GDPR concerns in respect of reporting it to a State authority where the obligation would be there to do so.  I do not believe these are real issues.  As we are dealing with a pandemic, these matters have to be addressed with a level of urgency not there at the moment.</p></speech>

One comprises the reporting regulations from the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application)(Amendment)(No.2) Regulations 2016.  This deals with the reporting of accidents and incidents to the authority.  The other one is the reporting under the Safety Health and Welfare at Work (Biological Agents) Regulations 2013, amended in 2020 to include the virus SARS-CoV-2.  It is specific to Covid-19 because it requires reporting by the employer to the authority where there is occupational exposure and it is attributable to the individual worker who has contracted Covid-19.</p> <p>  There is also separately the public health system.  Covid is an occupational issue and is ultimately a global public health pandemic.  The driver for Covid comes under the public health infectious disease regulations, which have been amended to require the reporting of Covid as an infectious disease.  Every time somebody gets tested, that detail is put into the computerised system, CIDR, established and run by Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  Those are the data everybody sees daily and weekly with facts and numbers.  The information in that database comes from the public health medical side.  Everybody who has a positive PCR test would be reported to that system.</p> <p>  We get that directly from the HPSC every week.</p><p>The HPSC updates the information up to the previous weekend, and we get it every Tuesday meaning that it is live and realistic.  There is also other reporting.  We are a member of the national standing oversight committee on high-risk sectors, which include construction, meat processing and food manufacturing as well as some other manufacturing plants.  A number of employer groups and ICTU are also members of that committee.  We get data from it on particular cases in those workplaces.</p><p> The third system I mentioned was the national incident management system, NIMS, which was set up by the State Claims Agency.  It is effectively a system for the public healthcare system to report incidents.  We have access to those data if and as required in that context.</p></speech>

I support the Bill.  Workplace infections are a driving factor in Covid, but that has been hidden by the inadequacies of our testing and tracing regime.  If one looked at current Covid hotspots geographically, one would find that they map fairly well onto geographical centres with meat plants.  There is a more general point to be made, though.  According to traffic data, it looks like twice as many people travel to work now as did during the first lockdown.  It is the main reason people are leaving their houses and interacting with others, thereby getting and spreading the virus.  The Government has been at pains to underplay this element.  At some stage, the T&aacute;naiste told our committee - he later retracted this - that people were safer at work than they were at home, the idea being that the virus somehow generated by itself at home.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for Dr. McGuinness.  If I am a worker and I consider that my employer is not essential but is open nonetheless, can the HSA do anything for me in terms of getting the employer shut down?</p></speech>

I am sorry, I was expecting a list of questions and to respond at the end.</p> <p>  What is an essential service is listed by the Government as part of the various roll-outs and plans.  We do not have a specific role in determining what is open or not at any one time.  That is a Government decision based on public health advice.  If a business is open but is not essential or providing an essential service in line with the list provided, the Garda has responsibility for closing it down.  Obviously, we get complaints in this regard.  We advise people in response and engage with the Garda as appropriate, but we do not have a duty in respect of what is open or deemed essential.  However, we would inspect any open business in terms of its Covid responsibility under the protocol.</p></speech>

During the first lockdown, I was able to work from home safely and was permitted to do so.  During this lockdown, however, I am being compelled by my employer to go to work, as is the case for many workers.  If I approach the HSA and say that it is not right, fair or in line with the Covid guidelines, can the authority do anything for me?  Can it investigate whether I could be safely working from home and the employer was getting me to travel unnecessarily?</p></speech>

That has been the advice throughout the pandemic.  Any worker who has concerns can get in touch with our workplace contact unit.  We will respond to any complaint and provide support as appropriate.  If a worker has a concern, we can examine the matter and contact the employer to reflect that concern.  Ultimately, however, it is a discussion and, aside from contacting us, the worker may be able to bring it to the attention of the lead worker representative and others in the workplace.  The decision as to what is open or essential is not one on which we have the ability to make a call.  However, we can support the worker through advice and guidance.</p></speech>

Let us forget about the question of essential.  The issue is that I as a worker was allowed to work from home during the first lockdown and can safely do so, but as appears to be the case for many workers, I am being compelled this time around to go into work.  The HSA has advised workers that it is at their employer's discretion whether they return to work, given that the Return to Work Safely Protocol has been developed to ensure a safe return to work for all staff.  Is it not the case that the HSA can effectively do nothing for me?  It cannot force, fine or inspect an employer that is not allowing workers to work from who could be safely doing so.</p></speech>

As such, we would have to consider that.  If we receive a complaint about issues in a workplace that is open and operating but where the worker feels he or she should not be there, we can carry out an inspection to determine whether systems are in place to enable the worker to work safely.  The question of whether the employer should be open or making people come to work is for the employer and the employee.  We and the Government are requesting those conversations to be had and all sides to support that process.</p></speech>

I very much support the Bill.  The INMO, Congress, SIPTU and others made clear last year their express desire for this amending legislation and they indicated there is a serious deficiency with regard to the reporting legislation.  I have three specific questions.  The first is for the representatives from the HSE.  I want to understand better what happens when there is a report of Covid-19.  What are the criteria for deciding to assess the sequencing of the genes where there is a presentation with Covid-19?  It was stated it is sometimes possible to link a healthcare worker infection with the workplace with great confidence based on the sequencing of the genes.  In what cases does this happen?  Does it happen for all workplace outbreaks?  Does it happen for outbreaks in the community?  Are there set criteria?</p> <p>  My next question is specifically for the representatives from the HSE.  Is the reluctance on the part of the HSE with regard to this Bill related to the resources required to undertake the additional work on gene sequencing of the virus?</p></speech>

I might hand over to my colleague Professor Cormican to provide further information on this.  The Senator stated she wants to gain a better understanding.  Safety and the reporting of incidents are matters we take very seriously.  We have strongly promoted this within the HSE because we find information is power and that the more information we have, the better we can manage the risk.  We treat Covid not necessarily as an illness but as an occupational hazard.  We manage it in the context of health and safety legislation as well as infection control legislation.</p> <p>  Regarding the reporting procedure where there is a case, we first get the full details of the case.  The manager would get the details to fully understand what has happened and report them on the national incident management system, which is our internal reporting system.  As part of the data-collection and investigation process, the manager would refer to an algorithm we have developed to make a decision as to whether we feel the infection is occupational.  Once the manager has made that decision using the algorithm, we make a report to the HSA, if appropriate.</p> <p>  As I said in our opening statement, we do collect the data and we are certainly not resisting in any way the collection of data on the Covid incidence.  We feel there is good machinery already in place for the reporting of the Covid incidence.  I hope that answers the first part of the Senator's query.  If Professor Cormican is still on the line, could I hand over to him to discuss the question on gene sequencing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.182" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Martin Cormican" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021033000002#J00600"><p>Sequencing is resource intensive.  The capacity of Ireland to do sequencing has increased greatly over recent months but it does require resources.  At the moment, where there is an outbreak in a healthcare or hospital setting, we recommend that the sample from the first case be sent for sequencing if it is suitable for sequencing.  There are technical requirements to be considered.  Sometimes samples cannot be sequenced for technical purposes and then additional samples are used as required.  A judgment is made as to whether the sequencing is likely to be informative.  As Mr. Parkinson said, all the circumstances are taken into account, after which a question arises as to whether sequencing would be useful.  No country would have the capacity to sequence all the viruses at the moment, to my knowledge.  Our capacity is probably similar to that of other countries but it is used selectively where it is likely to be informative.  The comment made in our statement was more by way of explaining that in certain circumstances one can be very confident the virus was acquired at the workplace.  For example, if a group of patients in a ward or nursing home are all infected with virus with a specific genetic sequence and the exact same fingerprint is found in the workers on the ward, it puts it beyond all reasonable doubt that the infection is workplace related.  That, however, would not be done universally in any setting.  It is helpful in some cases and in others it is not.  Sometimes there appears to be a relationship with the workplace but when one looks at the genetic fingerprint, one finds out it is not connected to the workplace because the fingerprint is distinct.  Sequencing is not done routinely but selectively.  It is useful but not useful in isolation.  It is not used in isolation but it is used, as Mr. Parkinson said, in the context of all the other circumstances.</p></speech>

I am conscious that I probably have very little time left in my slot.  I have a question each for the representatives of the HSA and Congress.  With regard to the HSA, it was stated that a number of workplaces are open and that it is hoped a much larger number will be open in the coming weeks and months.  I note the representatives' concerns about the Bill and what they called the onerous responsibility on employers with regard to it.  I want to understand the sense that the HSA feels the legislation will be onerous on itself.  One inspector was taken on by the HSA in the second half of 2020 and one was taken on in 2021.  I understand two are being recruited.  Is there a resource issue in the HSA resulting in its reticence and concerns relating to this Bill?

The HSA has resources assigned for reporting under the biological agent regulations and, indeed, for assessment and analysis of the weekly reports from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  In that regard, we have assigned resources.  If any reporting system is put in place, we will make sure the reporting requirements are put into play.  For example, much of the current reporting on accidents is already done online.  We would be doing something similar to reduce the burden on both ourselves and others who have also to report.</p> <p>  We are in the process of recruiting.  We got &euro;4.2 million from the Government last year for additional resources and we have got sanctions for significant numbers of inspectors.  We are currently in the process of recruiting those.  Resources may be challenging in the short term but, as with every aspect of Covid, we have prioritised our work to make sure we are able to address Covid whenever and however we can in that regard.</p><p> I will hand over now as I do not want to go over my time.</p></speech>

That is the difficulty with it.  I think the regulatory impact assessment, RIA, going through the HSA will take so long that the Covid emergency may well have passed and workers will feel the Act will not have been used to protect them.  I think that opinion is fairly widespread within the workforce.  Remember, 19 workplace infections and the economy is practically closed.  The figure is 16 in healthcare-related activities and that is last week.</p></speech>

I thank all the speakers for coming here today, and for their presentations and comments on Deputy O'Reilly's Bill.  The Bill opens up discussion about the progress which needs to be made in reporting Covid cases, working conditions in certain workplaces, and the need for statutory sick pay.  I understand from the witnesses' presentations that there are three different ways of reporting cases for which the employer is responsible.  How quickly can an employer report a case and what is the actual process of reporting?  Reporting of Covid cases needs to be done in a time-sensitive manner and we need to ensure there is no unnecessary bureaucracy involved.</p> <p>  My main point is about sick pay.  The safety of workers and wider society is the priority here and I think we all agree on that.  However, it would be naive not to acknowledge many workers in workplaces, such as meat processing plants, do not have sick pay schemes, which could deter them from reporting their symptoms or getting tested for fear of being without a salary for weeks and not being able to make ends meet.  The solution is clearly the introduction of statutory sick pay, which I believe is currently being progressed and reviewed by the T&aacute;naiste.  However, I want to hear from the witnesses about their engagement with workers and whether they think this is a contributing factor to clusters and levels of Covid cases.  What can potentially be done in the interim period?  I invite the three witnesses to give their opinion on sick pay.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in that the absence of an immediate sick pay, particularly during the pandemic, is a real problem.  Workers on very low incomes are in a massive dilemma because they will be without income if they report symptoms.  There is a big problem with the suppression of the virus and the information that would lead to controlling the virus in the absence of sick pay.  We are long overdue a proper sick pay scheme for workers.</p></speech>

This is about anything that protects the workers and makes them feel comfortable not going to work.  The advice is that anyone who has symptoms of Covid should not go to work because it protects not only himself or herself but also the other workers.  That advice is very clear.  The systems in place to enable that and to protect the worker by allowing him or her to stay at home while sick are vitally important and obviously sick leave is part of that.</p> <p>  There were some comments made earlier and to be clear, the protection of workers is our ultimate concern.  We already have three reporting systems, which gives us quite a high level of information on what is happening in workplaces.  Not all of them are coming directly from the employers but that does not prevent our organisation from taking the necessary steps to support and prevent, and protect our workers from Covid-19 in the workplace.  We are mindful that any reporting system is just one part of our extensive set of approaches that we use at all times.  We are not waiting for a report in order to act at any stage in that regard either.</p></speech>

However, we actively discourage workers with symptoms from coming to work for the reasons outlined by the Deputy.</p></speech>

This is an important Bill.  Sick pay is really important in a general sense because there is much that can be done around sick pay.  In relation to this Bill specifically, Covid-19 is already a reportable disease under the biological agents regulations.  As the witnesses have said, there are a few different ways to report it.  Covid-19 can be acquired in any setting and it cannot always be reliably associated with a work activity.  In some cases, such as meat factories, it is clearly to do with the setting while in other settings it is not so clear.  What is the story with the regulatory impact assessment initiated by the board of the HSA?  I do not know where that sits at present  When will it be completed and when can we look at it?  It was on that basis of seeing what the outcome of that would be that they were going to wait and see about this Bill.  On its completion, it will be considered by the board of the HSA and the next steps would be discussed with the Department.  Do the witnesses know what is happening with that or have they answered that question already?  A regulatory impact assessment initiated by the board of the HSA to assist in the consideration of a potential amendment requiring employers to report cases of Covid-19 that are attributable to work activity, to the HSA is ongoing.  I wonder about its status..</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that, I believe there is value in this debate, and I thank everyone for participating this morning and in using this to move forward.  This was something that was raised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions with the Minister a year ago.  It has been raised again and again, repeatedly.  This proposed legislation ensures the change will be made rather than waiting, which is the alternative.  That indicates where it came from.  Obviously, we will consider any result from the RIA and all information is very welcome, but I felt there was a need, as others did, to progress this on the basis that there did not seem to be any progress being made.</p><p>From my perspective, the rationale was to ensure that it becomes a notifiable disease as quickly as possible.  We did not want to hang around or wait, but these things unfortunately take time.  Naturally, the result of the RIA will inform any future deliberations on this.</p></speech>

It has been a really useful discussion.  I will take up from where the previous conversation finished, that is, with the issue of why the regulations changed in 2016.  I think members of the general public will be genuinely quite shocked to hear that right now there is no obligation on employers to notify the HSA of Covid-19 cases.  I wish to drill down into this.  I will direct my first question to Dr. McGuinness.  I thank her for her presentation and her patience this morning.  She said that the issue with changing the regulations was the low number of accidents reported.  That was the HSA's understanding at the time.  The upshot of that issue was that the HSA decided to exclude disease from the definition of workplace accidents.  How was that supposed to improve the reporting of accidents?</p></speech>

To be clear, the amendment was driven primarily at the time by the low numbers of accidents reported.  There are two separate issues because we were looking not only at the accident reporting but equally at the reporting of occupational illness.  As for occupational illness, as I think I said earlier, there was no defined list of occupational illnesses either in European or national legislation and, therefore, it was felt there was a challenge.  As part of the regulatory impact analysis, which was considered by the board at the time, it was felt that it was not clear-cut that an employer would be able to identify with any degree of certainty what an occupational illness was.  Very often an occupational illness, and indeed illness or disease more generally, is referred back to the causative agent.  That can be a chemical or biological agent or whatever, which is why something like the biological agents regulation is important.  It identifies the causative agent of the disease rather than the disease itself.  It therefore protects the worker from the agent itself in the first instance in order that no disease is caused in that regard.</p></speech>

Again, however, if it had come in and there was just a prescribed list of occupational illnesses, it would have to be identified on that in order to give guidance and clarity to employers as to what is reportable and what is not, as the case may be.</p></speech>

They seem to have had no difficulty doing so.  Dr. McGuinness may have seen the addendum to the ICTU presentation, which showed the European Union of Medical Specialists making reference to the need to make Covid an occupational illness.  What is the particular difficulty Ireland has that we cannot adopt best practice being adopted across the rest of Europe, given the context of a pandemic and the more than 4,000 lives we have lost?</p></speech>

That is what all member states will put into force in their countries.  We have looked at this and have talked to colleagues across Europe because we are in various committees and working groups with them.  Many member states are doing similar in that they are identifying Covid as a specific illness for particular sectors.  That is derived directly from the biological agents regulations, which we all have to transpose and implement in that respect.  It is a challenging one, and across European countries very often the issue is still driven by public health.  Again, the nature of the reporting systems in place in countries is driven by the fact that there are different systems in place, not just necessarily under occupational health but in general reporting as well, so they are all interconnected.  We are very much in line with the majority of the member states that have looked at this as a specific illness in the context of specific sectors such as healthcare.</p></speech>

Let us take a meat factory and two workers.  The first worker contracts Covid in the community, at home.  He goes to work because he is asymptomatic and then, unfortunately, passes it on to a second worker.  What are the obligations of the employer in this example?  Does it have to report both people to the HSA as having had a workplace illness of Covid, neither or one of the two?</p></speech>

That would all be done as part of the public health regime and would be reported as part of the CIDR database through the medical officer of health in that regard.  In respect of reporting, meat plants are not working directly with viruses as it is and, therefore, the reporting would not come necessarily directly to us.

What Dr. McGuinness is actually saying is that in a case in which one worker introduces Covid into a factory unknowingly and a further worker then gets it - and that, of course, is how clusters build - at the moment there is no obligation on the employer to report that to the Health and Safety Authority.</p></speech>

If it is an outbreak, very often in meat plants we will be involved in the outbreak control team set up by the departments of public health to support them in the management of the outbreak.  In addition, as part of the national standing oversight committee, we get the list every week of all the outbreaks in meat plants, construction sites and other high-risk sectors.</p></speech>

What Dr. McGuinness told us two minutes ago is that there is no obligation on the employer to report the two cases in the example I gave her.  That appears to me to be a major gap.

The most robust system, therefore, for tracking Covid in anybody, whether a worker or someone else, is the public health infectious diseases requirement and reporting through the CIDR database.  Even if an employer does not report directly to us and whether there is legislation requiring that, we still have access to all of that information to enable us to identify particular workplaces and sectors where there are issues arising.</p></speech>

We have a system in place for that under the biological agents regulation.  We have allowed people to report issues in as streamlined a manner as possible.  Again, they would have to get all of that detail together and put it in one place.  The driver for anybody in the midst of an outbreak or case of Covid in a worker is to suppress and prevent the further spread, not just in the workplace but also in the community.</p></speech>

I am not in any way convinced that this will place a massive administrative burden on employers.  I am a small bit concerned that perhaps the HSA would come in and say this on the basis that employers can answer for themselves.  Indeed, they have made a submission.</p> <p>  In terms of the practicalities of the administrative burden, there is already an online system.  Reporting a Covid case would feed into the same system.  When one thinks about what is considered an administrative burden, one probably thinks about people drowning in loads of paperwork.  In fact, it seems that the HSA has gone to considerable effort to streamline this process, and fair play to it for that.  Presumably if the amendment was passed, it would mean that another illness would be added to an existing process.  Am I correct in thinking that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.255" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sharon McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021033000002#M00800"><p>As I said, we use an online process.  The administrative burden is not solely somebody entering data on a sheet of paper or sending them into us; it is in addition to that.  Every case of Covid has to be looked at in the context of it being attributable to a workplace.  Even if there is an amendment, as we have discussed, the reality is that it still has to be attributable to work.  The employer needs to be assured, therefore, and perhaps take the time to assess, whether an employee contracted Covid in the workplace as part of his or her work activity rather than contracting it outside of work and bringing it in.  That is probably where the bulk of the administrative challenges lie for employers.</p></speech>

It does not appear that the administrative burden would be so large as to discourage an employer from doing that.  The information and exercise of collating that information would be extremely valuable.</p></speech>

As I have said, public health has the duty, first and foremost, to manage that outbreak, wherever it is, and work with an employer and representatives, as appropriate, to suppress the outbreak.  That has and is being done as part of that work.  The data that come to us have been through that process.</p></speech>

It crosses over with the argument that this is an additional administrative burden if Dr. McGuinness is in a position to say it is already being done.  She can see why we are struggling with that concept.  Employers will have to do something they are already doing.  She said all of the information is already available, albeit without an obligation to report directly to the HSA, and, on the flip side, there is an additional burden.  That argument seems to be counter-intuitive.</p></speech>

Who is preparing the RIA?  Is it somebody in the HSA?</p> <p>  I want to go back to the point I made on what the HSA said, namely, that there is no counter-obligation on employees to provide detailed confidential medical information to their employer.  Congress officials seemed to contradict that and have said there is.  If the HSA is correct, an employee could be in the workforce with Covid.  As Deputy Duffy said, he or she might not want to tell people he or she has it and could be spreading it.</p> <p>  I would like to get to the bottom of an important matter, namely, whether there is a legal obligation on employees to tell an employer or their colleagues that they have Covid.  The HSA might say a bit more about the GDPR implications in that regard.</p> <p>  Something struck me.  The reports from CIDR and the HPSC are issued weekly.  Is that a long period before information is received?  We get daily reports from the Department and others.  The HSA receives information on a weekly basis, but an awful lot can happen in a week.</p> <p>  As far as the HPSC reporting is concerned, can Dr. McGuinness tell me exactly how a workplace is  identified?  Are those data captured initially from the person who presents to a doctor and then has a positive Covid test?  Does the workplace information state that a person works in a particular workplace?  Is the information passed on at that stage?</p></speech>

KPMG has supported us in the development of the RIA process.</p> <p>  In terms of the report, we receive that information on a weekly basis.  In terms of weekly reporting it involves about five working days and is fairly flexible.  We also continue to have access to what is online, etc.  Numbers across the board are published on a daily basis for workplaces and community transmission.  The HPSC reports, which anybody can view on its databases or website, show that it breaks down cases across nursing homes, hospitals, education, etc., and there is then a catch-all group called "workplaces", which is broken down into construction, food and meat processing.  We get all of that information.  Within each of those categories the specific location of the outbreak is identified, whether that is the name of a hospital, factory or whatever.  We have that information alongside the caseloads in that regard.</p> <p>  I refer to the point about the worker.  There is an obligation in that regard.</p><p>Obviously, we are all duty-bound when we work with each other to work safely and healthily together and to inform people if there are any measures in respect of which, perhaps, the group health and safety would be at issue.  However, as we all know, when it comes to medical issues, people perhaps want to keep some of that information to themselves and there is a level of sensitivity in personal information in that regard, so it is challenging.</p><p> The other point is that Covid is a challenging disease.  We all know that.  However, we can see, through the numbers and reports by NPHET on many occasions, that the reality is that there can be as many symptomatic as asymptomatic people in the workplace.  That is a challenge because in essence the reporting and identification will only happen with those who are symptomatic.  Again, that could be equally challenging.  We would say that through engagement between employers and employees, everybody should be working to prevent Covid coming into and spreading in the workplace.  Those who are in any way sick should stay at home to stop the spread and should inform their employers.  The other point is that if a worker is tested, the information goes into the public health CIDR system.</p></speech>

I welcome Leo Bollins and Margaret O'Donnell from the secretariat.  I thank the Business Committee for agreeing to this public meeting of the Committee on Public Petitions during the level 5 restrictions.  We have made every effort to mitigate the risk of the new variants of Covid-19 to members, witnesses and staff.</p> <p>  The first part of our meeting with the European Ombudsman is in public session.  At the conclusion of the public session, we will suspend the meeting until 12 noon, at which time we will resume in virtual private session.  Apologies have been received from Senator Warfield.</p> <p>  I will read some formal notices.  Members, witnesses and staff are requested to use the wipes and hand sanitiser provided to clean seats and desks that are shared so as to supplement regular sanitation.  This will help to mitigate the risk of Covid-19 spreading among the parliamentary community.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the places in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  I ask that members make the secretariat aware of whether they are within the precincts of Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.</p> <p>  I wish to explain to the witnesses some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to Ms Emily O'Reilly, the European Ombudsman, who is joining us from Strasbourg.  She is joined by her head of cabinet, Mr. Aidan O'Sullivan, who is in Brussels.  Ms O'Reilly is no stranger to the committee.  In fact, on 20 July 2011, when she was the State Ombudsman, serving a population of 4.6 million people, she was the first witness to address the first Committee on Public Petitions.  Here we are, ten years later, and she has been twice elected as European Ombudsman, serving a population of 448 million people.  Whether we are dealing with a large or a small population or working at local, regional, state or European Union level, we are all facing the same pandemic of Covid-19 and the new devastating variants.</p> <p>  The committee would like to hear about the European Ombudsman's findings on how EU institutions have responded to the Covid-19 crisis, the transparency of the information provided by the institutions and how they have communicated with the public.  The committee is aware that she has been monitoring EU institutions such as the European Council and the European Commission and agencies such as the European Medicines Agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Investment Bank in terms of how they have responded to the pandemic.  The committee would like to discuss how greater transparency could be achieved to maintain the trust of the public.  As EU member states continue to roll out Covid-19 vaccines, the committee looks forward to engaging with Ms O'Reilly on these initiatives and other works carried out by the European Ombudsman on pandemic-related matters.  </p> <p>  I invite Ms O'Reilly to make her opening statement.  She is welcome to the committee.</p></speech>

Members do not need me to tell them how challenging this past year has been for everyone.  Those challenges are set to continue for much of 2021 despite the miracle arrival of vaccines developed and authorised with unprecedented speed.  As national politicians, members have had the unenviable task of monitoring life-or-death decisions made by the Government and the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, with no comparable situation in recent memory to guide them.  The balancing of risks and needs has had to be done with little time fully to reflect on outcomes and consequences both short and long term.  I wish members well as they continue that arduous task while also striving to keep themselves and their families safe.</p> <p>  Covid-19 continues to have devastating consequences across Europe and the world and continues to monopolise the attention of governments and public administrations, as well as the societies they serve.  Shortly after the World Health Organization, WHO, declared Europe to be the epicentre of the pandemic, it was obvious that this virus, which has no respect for borders, would be a major challenge for the EU.  For my office, as the watchdog of the EU administration, it was clear that a transnational crisis of this scale would severely test the capacity of the EU institutions, and I began to monitor their response early on, using my powers of own-initiative investigation.  In addition, I also began to receive complaints related to the pandemic and to the EU&rsquo;s response to it. </p> <p>  In April last year, I wrote to the Presidents of the European Commission and the European Council with proposals on how to maintain high transparency standards during the crisis, and especially in the context of emergency or accelerated decision-making procedures and derogations from standard rules on meetings.</p><p>I made the point that during such a major crisis it is even more important that public authorities are open about how they operate and take decisions.  Transparency helps to ensure public trust in, and reinforces the legitimacy of, decision-making processes. <br/><br/>I am sure members are all acutely aware of how during this terrifying time people will constantly seek assurance about what the Government is doing and whether they are being given all the facts necessary to make decisions about their lives and the lives of their families.  Any sign that facts are being hidden, provokes not just distrust but also increased mental stress.  <br/><br/>I received encouraging replies from both institutions that they would indeed prioritise transparency.  However, as the crisis evolved, I considered it important to look in greater detail at some more specific aspects of the EU response and the roles of particular institutions and agencies.  In July, I launched a series of inquiries and initiatives to this end.  One of those concerned the work carried out by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, in gathering and assessing data linked to the pandemic.  As members are likely aware, the ECDC was set up in 2004 in the aftermath of the SARS outbreaks, essentially to help to co-ordinate the EU response to a future and more serious epidemic.  Approximately 30 people in Europe were infected by SARS, a tiny number compared to Covid-19, which may have led to a certain complacency in relation to the necessary powers to be granted to this new agency.  Making it work was not helped, of course, by the fact that the member states retain power over health policy and not the EU.  While the ECDC was gifted a flattering title and lofty ambition, it was not given complementary powers, emerging rather as a weak agency with little independence of action.  It can request health and other data from the member states, but there is no legal obligation on them to supply it.<br/><br/>My inquiry highlighted shortcomings in how the data is communicated to and gathered by the ECDC, both in terms of timing and completeness, and how the centre presents this information to the outside world.  I raised issues, for example, <i>vis-a-vis </i>changing advice on the wearing of face masks and why certain surveys of member state capacity to deal with the crisis were published and others were not.  I made a series of suggestions aimed at promoting greater transparency and better means to enable greater scrutiny of the data and assessments compiled by the ECDC.  Ultimately, however, if the EU wants an agency that can live up to the title of pan-European disease prevention and control, EU legislators will need to reflect on the centre's founding mandate.  Without specific new powers to ensure the completeness and quality of the data it receives from national authorities, it cannot effectively fulfil this role.  It remains to be seen how the proposal from the Commission in this regard will develop.<br/><br/>The second inquiry I opened concerned the Council of the European Union and the transparency of its decision-making.  My inquiry assessed the decision by the Council to derogate temporarily from its rules of procedure during the crisis and the implications this has had for its decision-making process and the transparency of that process.  As members may also be aware, the Council shifted to meeting by videoconference and to taking all decisions by written procedure.  My inquiry found that there was a considerable lack of transparency in how the Council made this fundamental shift to its way of operating.  While the meetings of preparatory bodies in the Council are now more accessible to the public, there are still areas in which the Council should improve and I concluded this inquiry just last week with some suggestions.<br/><br/>In addition to those inquiries, I also engaged with the European Medicines Agency, EMA, the Commission and the European Investment Bank, EIB, about their roles.  I also received a number of complaints related to the transparency of the negotiations for the vaccine procurement scheme, as well as public access to the so-called advance purchase agreements - the contracts that have been subject of so much debate, as member are well aware.  While my inquiries into the requests for public access to the contracts were under way in the form of freedom of information requests, the Commission decided to publish most of these contracts.  As is often the case, it belatedly realised that transparency was not just in the public interest, but in its own interest.<br/><br/>Another recent inquiry concerned a request that the Commission disclose details about the negotiating team in charge of the vaccine contracts.  Given the blame game around vaccine procurement and roll-out, I consider that it is in the Commission's interest to provide greater transparency about the negotiations, including this team, since it is made up predominantly of representatives of national authorities in the member states.  EU citizens need to know the extent to which their governments are involved in the contract deals and that the work is not solely carried out by the Commission.<br/><br/>I hope that my opening statement has provided members with some insight into my work in the context of the Covid-19 crisis.  In the case of Covid-19, it is clear that there is a negative perception of how the EU has responded to the crisis to date.  While the institutions were undoubtedly unprepared for dealing with a health crisis on this scale, it is possibly too easy to blame Brussels without acknowledging that often the real decision-makers reside in the national capitals and not in the so-called Brussels bubble.  The crisis has cast a spotlight on decision-making at EU level and may, in time, influence the future direction of the Union itself as the debate over what should best be done at national level, and what could better be done at Union level, continues with the Covid-19 backdrop as a guide.  As I noted earlier, the EU has no real competence in the area of health policy, which made it very difficult for the institutions to play any role in co-ordinating a response, something my inquiry into the ECDC laid bare.<br/><br/>The joint procurement scheme for vaccines was not without flaws, as we know.  However, it was a first of its kind, with the Commission constrained by the demands of member states concerning which vaccines they wanted and at what price.  The negotiating team was clearly also a joint effort, with national administrations having been active members.  I expect there to be more twists and turns before we finally emerge from this crisis and, as ombudsman, I will likely deal with more complaints.  However, my overriding message to the institutions will remain that conducting their tasks in as transparent a manner as possible is both in the public interest and, as the Commission found out <i>vis-a-vis </i>the vaccine contracts, also very much in its interests.<br/><br/>I look forward to our discussion. Thank you all for listening.  Go raibh maith agaibh.</p></speech>

I agree that there will be many more twists and turns before this awful pandemic is finished.  We have heard terrible stories from all over Europe.  I thank her for her contribution.  Before I allow members in, I would like to ask a couple of questions.</p> <p>  I would welcome Ms O'Reilly's views on the importance of the relationship in ensuring effective collaboration between Ireland and the EU on the EU issues that matter to them most.  This is important in the fight against Covid-19, but it is equally important in other areas of public concern such as the Mercosur trade deal talks, which affect Ireland.  How could this committee and her office could work together for the mutual benefit of the people of Ireland and the EU?</p> <p>  Since the pandemic struck, Ms O'Reilly has examined various aspects of the EU response, including the initial assessment of the threat of Covid to public health.  She has also, to some extent, looked at the EU's negotiations with pharma companies and called for more transparency on both counts.  I am interested in hearing about here findings in regard to the ECDC's initial assessment of the threat of Covid to public health.  Did the fact that the EU institutions have little power in respect of health matters make the pandemic worse in the Europe and did the lack of transparency during the early days of the pandemic, especially in the Council, create problems for the EU?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.276" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021033000002#B00300"><p>The links between the EU and Ireland are incredibly important and they have always been very good.  We saw that during the Brexit negotiations.  It was interesting to note last week when there was some talk of the EU adopting a more protectionist attitude in regard to the export of vaccines and so on that Ireland was to the fore in warning against that because there have been some short-term benefits.</p><p>Ireland was fairly quick to see the medium-term and long-term difficulties that might pose.  As well as this, since the UK left the EU, although Ireland and the UK would have always partnered and been allies on many issues of mutual importance in the EU, there is the issue of new alliances emerging.  Ireland is part of that.  Before the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a sense that Ireland was cleaving more towards some of the Nordic countries, such as Denmark, and the Netherlands and so on.  It will be a while, however, before those alliances form themselves in a stronger way.</p><p> I cannot stress enough the importance of engagement in Dublin, the capital, with Government and the Oireachtas in the room members are in now.  People think the EU happens in Brussels.  It does not; it happens in all the member states.  Committees such as this and other relevant committees have a huge role to play in bridging that gap between the two settings.  I know that sounds almost like a clich&eacute; but I really cannot emphasise it enough.  The messaging from the EU needs to happen in the member states.</p><p> The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, was where the EU came up against its own internal contradictions, in a sense, in that it was an EU solution to an EU problem.  On one hand, the member states did not want to concede any of their competence with regard to health.  The ECDC, therefore, was given few powers and little independence of action.  Therefore, although it was given a title that mimicked that of the centre in the US and other places, it certainly did not have the capacity to do what it was intended to do.  The pandemic certainly exposed that.</p><p> The issue now is for the EU if it wants to have a powerful agency in future pandemics, or even in the current one, which does not seem to be going away any time soon.  If it really and truly wants an agency with power and with the capacity to co-ordinate all the responses from the members states, then it must have a big discussion and debate with the member states to see whether more power should be ceded to it.  It is a sort of sleight of hand.  When most citizens hear of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, they think that is exactly what it does.  It actually does not, however.  In a way, it is a sort of post box for information that may or may not come, or may not come at the right time, for member states, which it puts together and sends it out, usually belatedly.</p><p> I will finish on this.  Quite early on in the pandemic, in January and February when the first cases started emerging in European countries, particularly France, Germany and Italy, the ECDC suddenly almost had an existential crisis.  Its instinct was to say that everything will be fine and we can cope with this.  Within a few weeks it was forced to say that it could not.  The EU, and member states in particular, had to learn from that and really ask what they wanted.  Did they want to hold on tightly to their powers with regard to health policy or cede them for the greater good?</p></speech>

I thank her for attending.  It is much appreciated.  The European Ombudsman has been very busy in the past 12 months looking into the EU's response to Covid-19.  I will try to focus on some of the investigations that are still ongoing because I know some have concluded.  Perhaps I could get some clarification.  An investigation into the European Medicines Agency, EMA, in 2019 has been concluded and published.  Is it correct that the European Ombudsman is still looking into aspects of the EMA's work today, however?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021033000002#C00400"><p>Yes.  We continue to monitor the EMA.  The investigation we concluded in 2019 concerned the way in which it held pre-planning meetings, with which we in Ireland are all familiar, that can be held between developers and local authorities on possible developments they want to do.  Equally, the EMA had pre-regulatory decision meetings with pharmaceutical companies, which would say they were thinking of looking for authorisation on certain things.  They asked what the EMA thought and there would be a discussion.  There were, therefore, concerns around that so we looked at it.  Basically, we made recommendations to the EMA, which it accepted.  This meant the people who were involved with the pre-authorisation meetings were not really the ones ultimately making decisions on that.</p> <p>  We knew at the beginning that the EMA was going to be the focus of much attention because of the power it has.  The member states, of course, form the board of the EMA and are the ones that ultimately decide or agree on any recommendation it makes regarding the authorisation of vaccines.  We were, therefore, looking very carefully at its transparency in that regard.  There is still much anti-vaccination opinion.  It is not even people who are anti-vaccination ideologically but those who are genuinely nervous about vaccines.  We knew, therefore, that everything the EMA did had to be really open and transparent.  So far, we have been happy with the response.  It has spoken about fast-tracking certain procedures into the future.  Sometimes when people hear the term "fast-track", they think about skimping on important bits of the process.  I am sure that is not what the EMA is thinking of.  It is an agency which, from my experience, takes its responsibilities incredibly seriously.  Nonetheless, we will be keeping an eye on that to see its intent and how things are panning out.</p></speech>

That recommendation or investigation that was under way in Ms O'Reilly's office has, therefore, concluded, although it continues to look into the procedures that were adopted in improving the vaccines.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.282" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021033000002#C00600"><p>One of the access requests we received was about a team that deals with these vaccine contracts, which is made up of members of the Commission and members from seven member states, not including Ireland.  That is not particularly relevant but I want to make it clear that Ireland is not involved.  That is the core team but then it would go back to all the member states.</p> <p>  A request was received from an MEP seeking the names of the civil servants from the member states on that committee.  We agreed with the EMA that there were data protection issues and there was no overriding public interest in knowing who precisely the civil servants were.  The Commission refused to actually publish the names of the member states that were doing this, which to my mind was quite extraordinary.  Its reasoning was that if people knew, for instance, that Italy was one of those member states then somebody would be able to join the dots and locate the civil servant, which to my mind, although I did not say this at the time, was ridiculous, really.  When things like that happen, one gets a little bit frustrated; let me put it that way.  Some people, although not everybody, have a tendency to think that if the Commission is hiding that, what else is it hiding?  With something as simple as that, therefore, the heavens were not going to fall if people knew who the member states were.  Most people know who they are anyway.</p> <p>  We continue to get access to documents requests regarding the EMA.  We have had a very long relationship with it going back even before my time.  Certainly, it is a priority of my office to keep an eye on that because so many people are keeping an eye on the EMA and must put their trust in it with regard to vaccines and their authorisation.</p></speech>

Is it the view of Ms O'Reilly's office's that this led to a delay in the European Union procuring the vaccines that were needed and then in their roll-out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.284" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021033000002#C00800"><p>It is not something we have specifically looked into, although we may.  I believe there will and must be investigations in many sectors in every member state.  I am sure in Ireland this will also occur as to how things happened.  At the moment, I do not believe it is an exaggeration to say things are happening at a frantic pace.  I know it has been stated, reported and commented on that one of the reasons for the slowness in the vaccine roll-out in the EU was because of this haggling over pricing, for one thing, and that the EU and the Commission, perhaps, took a traditional conservative approach, which in times of crisis is probably a good thing.  People will demand that they get good prices and so on.</p> <p>  The other approach was to just throw everything at it and say we are in an emergency with this crisis; this is a war.  One might contrast the EU's response with those of the UK and US, which developed a warlike mentality.</p><p>This was evident even in the language that was used.  Operation Warp Speed was former President Trump's description of throwing money at the vaccine development and roll out.  We have seen what happened in the UK as well.  One could also say that there was a huge political imperative for both of those countries to do it, given the huge and appalling number of deaths that had happened on those Governments' watch.  Nonetheless, while I have not investigated this and do not have facts to hand that I can stand over, there does appear to have been a classically bureaucratic, conservative approach taken by the EU.  That said, we must also remember that there are 27 member states involved.  Austria, for example, now wants more of the available vaccines but the other member states have said that it did not do its homework at the beginning, did not order enough doses and was a little bit frugal.  The EU also has to consider poorer countries and it has been to the fore, beyond anything that the UK or US has done, in giving vaccines to other countries.  The figures in that regard are quite impressive.  </p><p> When this calms down, we will be able to make definitive judgments about this but we must all recognise that this was an unprecedented situation.  There was no play book for this.  Obviously mistakes were made but good things have been done as well.</p></speech>

Does she see herself looking into the decision-making process around enforcing the export protocol which is still being discussed?</p></speech>

In the event that we did decide to look at that - although this is not something I am contemplating at the moment - it would have to meet the three criteria for initiating any investigation.  One is that it is in the public interest and clearly, something like that would fit into that category; two, that it is doable, that we would get a result and that we would not be over-promising; and three, that we are not doubling up on investigations that are being done elsewhere.  If a committee of parliament, for example, or some other agency was doing an investigation that was likely to yield as good as, or better, an outcome as us, then we would not do it.  As I said already, the pace of events is significant.  We continue to look at the EMA and it is possible that in time we will look at the procurement process, particularly if complaints come in.  However, I must emphasise that we would not be looking at member state actions but at the actions of the EMA.</p></speech>

I listened very attentively to her opening remarks and noted with interest her contention that transparency helps to ensure public trust and reinforces the legitimacy of decision-making processes and that any sign of facts being hidden provokes not just distrust but also increased mental stress and mental health issues.  She said that EU citizens need to know the extent to which their own governments were involved in the contracts and so on.  She mentioned that there are lots of people out there who are very sceptical about the vaccines and that it is important to get those people on board.  I was extremely impressed by the honesty of Ms O'Reilly's report and very interested to hear that the ombudsman's office does not have any real competence in the area of EU health policy, which strikes me as strange.  If the EU is supposed to work for the good of all of its members, that should include their financial, mental and physical good.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy referred to the EMA and possible investigations by the ombudsman's office.  Let us say the ombudsman conducts an investigation and issues a final report, including recommendations.  Have such reports or recommendations ever been challenged by any EU member state?  Has anybody ever questioned the recommendations of the European Ombudsman's office?  Has anyone ever asked whether it would be prudent to go that way or suggested that her office should stay away from an issue because of possible implications by way of court cases and so forth?  Does the ombudsman ever feel compromised when she issues her reports?  She spoke earlier about investigations that her office has conducted pretty rapidly, considering Covid has only been with us for 12 to 18 months.  Has she ever been challenged in terms of the EU not doing something on foot of her findings or recommendations or choosing to ignore them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.290" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021033000002#D00600"><p>Being an ombudsman in the European context is more challenging than being one in the member state context.  When I was the Irish Ombudsman I could rely on across-the-board parliamentary and Government support for what I did and there was a very high acceptance of my recommendations.  It is a little more challenging at the European level because of different cultural views of issues around administration, data protection, freedom of information and so on.  In addition, one important country does not have a national ombudsman, namely, Germany.  It has a petitions committee but does not have an ombudsman so the Germans do not quite understand or get the role of the ombudsman.  There have been issues, particularly in relation to the work I have done on transparency at European Council and EU ministerial level.  There has been push back with some people saying that my office is going beyond its mandate and so on.  When I hear that, it suggests to me that I am doing my job but people are not too thrilled about the fact that I am doing it.</p> <p>  Regarding the ECDC report, part of my rationale for doing that was to make my office as useful as possible during the pandemic.  By highlighting the lack of health competence and the fact that it is member states who decide on their health policies and not the EU, we showed how that became a huge problem during the pandemic.  Italy was in a terrible state at the beginning and there were moves by certain countries to protect their own equipment and supplies until the Commission basically got everyone to calm down and start sharing.  It was, in a way, the EU confronting its own contradictions and the ongoing debate around a more united Europe versus a Europe in which member states have more control.  The ECDC was created precisely to assist with what started to befall us last year but it did not and could not assist because the member states did not have to, and therefore did not, play ball.  For example, in the years leading up to the pandemic the ECDC would have carried out surveys on Ireland's ICU capacity, the way Spain looks after elderly people in care, what levels of PPE the Netherlands has in stock and so forth.  The responses the ECDC got were very piecemeal and the member states did not want them to be published.  Even when member states gave information to the ECDC, they did not want that information published because they did not want to appear in a league table showing, for example, that Ireland is fantastic in relation to ICU capacity, Denmark is a disaster, Germany is in the middle and so on.  Therefore, the capacity of the ECDC to war game, to ask what would happen if a pandemic were to happen, how prepared we are and who needs what was compromised.  The ECDC could not war game and therefore, when the pandemic reached our shores, there was no plan.  There was chaos.  People have learned an awful lot over the last 12 months, obviously, but the only way chaos is going to be prevented in future is if member states decide that the EU should have a health competence and cede more of their control over public health.</p><p>That is a political issue.  It is for the member states to decide among themselves but what my investigation did was point out what happens when one creates a body of the kind in question.  It does not seem appropriate, perhaps, to call it a pretend agency but in a way it is.  First one hears about the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and then about the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC.  One believes the ECDC must have the same powers as its counterpart but it does not.  The point of my investigation was to feed into the debate that has to take place.  It has already started.  Members will have heard the Commission talking about a health union and so on.  It was to assist in that debate.</p></speech>

Having been a member of the petitions committee, I am aware of its potential.  There is obviously great potential but there is also potential to work with our European counterparts and, more importantly, Ms O'Reilly, in addition to our Ombudsman in Ireland.  That is one part of my question.</p><p>My other question concerns the only point that really worries me.  I am asking for Ms O'Reilly's opinion more than anything else.  Where the final recommendations of an Ombudsman are received by our petitions committee, would Ms O'Reilly find it prudent if we were to challenge them and say that, as members of a petitions committee, we did not agree with the decision?  Would that be a good idea?  Would it be outside the remit?  I want to try to touch all bases here.  I would like Ms O'Reilly's opinion on the matter because we want this committee to work properly and do not want to be setting off on the wrong foot.</p></speech>

I well remember the history of the petitions committee because there was not a petitions committee when I dealt with a quite famous case, the lost at sea case, several years ago.  It was the first time that a recommendation had been rejected so I decided to submit a special report to the Parliament.  The then Government decided not even to have a committee discuss it.  Anyway, the case became politicised, not because of anything my office had done but because we had, unusually, looked at the actions of a Minister in regard to the development of the scheme.  Naturally, that gave rise to political sensitivities, which had an impact.  Then the committee that investigated or considered the report split on party lines, which was a pity because I believe an Ombudsman's report should be dealt with in an impartial way insofar as that is possible in a political community like the Oireachtas.  Arising out of that, the petitions committee was created.  Deputy Charles Flanagan was the Minister who was at the first session, I believe, and he said that, to the greatest extent possible, the committee would not split along party lines on Ombudsman reports.  That does not mean one cannot reject them; of course they can be rejected.  If an Ombudsman makes a recommendation, it does not mean it is necessarily going to be accepted, but it is critical that it be evaluated impartially and that the way the Ombudsman &mdash; currently Mr. Peter Tyndall &mdash; goes about his work also be evaluated impartially and independently.</p> <p>  I welcome what the Deputy said about greater liaison between my office and the Petitions Committee, which is the committee to which I report within the European Parliament.  I said earlier but cannot emphasise enough how important it is that the work of the EU and communication thereon take place not in Brussels but exactly where the members are all now.  That is so important.  A petitions committee has great potential to achieve that.  Arguably, there are foreign affairs and European affairs committees and so on but this committee is the link to the people, just as my office is, and that is where our complementary roles lie.</p></speech>

Many questions on the EMA have already been asked so I will not refer to it.  On Ms O'Reilly's inquiry into the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, I was taken with her reference to the gathering and assessing of data linked to the pandemic.  She stated issues arose over the changing advice on face coverings.  We saw this here at home when we changed tack on that front, arguably ahead of many of our European colleagues.  Ms O'Reilly mentioned there was a survey of the capacity of a number of member states to deal with the Covid-19 crisis.  Having regard to that and the face coverings issue, she might elaborate a little more on the inquiry.  Has it concluded completely?  Are there still elements being dealt with?  I am not prying but just wondering whether Ms O'Reilly could elaborate a little more.</p> <p>  I have a question that is similar to those of Deputy Buckley on Ms O'Reilly's office's engagement with us.  How many complaints or inquiries does she deal with annually?  How many staff are in her office?  If I could ask Ms O'Reilly those questions-----</p></speech>

That is the critical thing.</p> <p>  On face masks, I was always fascinated by the face masks issue because, to me, it seemed blindingly obvious that we should be wearing them.  I looked at my Amazon bill for last year, which was distressingly large, to see when I first bought face masks.  I first ordered them on 28 February, which was before we were advised to do so.  I am not saying I am a genius and prescient but, to me, as a reasonably intelligent human being, it seemed obvious that we should have been wearing face masks.  I was always puzzled as to the approach.  At the beginning, NPHET, the WHO and the ECDC were almost counter-indicating their use, suggesting they do more harm than good.  The ECDC was effectively saying "No" at a certain point and three weeks later it was saying "Yes", and now we are all wearing masks.  I am in Strasbourg, where they are worn on the street.  One wears them all the time.  People talk about the science.  The science on the virus was really simple: it is spread by aerosol, it is in the air, one breathes it in and gets the disease, and what happens, happens.  Therefore, face masks were obvious.  When the ECDC changed its advice it did not say why, and that is why we made the recommendation that, in future, it explain to people why it is changing advice on certain matters.  I tune in to Irish media regularly and I quite frequently hear the ECDC being referred to.  People understandably and rightly trust it but to really earn that trust, the advice it is giving and the decisions it is making have to be justified.</p> <p>  On the question on my office, it has approximately 70 staff.  It is a tiny office.  We get roughly 2,000 complaints every year.  Many of them are not within our mandate but within that of the relevant member state's public administration so we would advise people accordingly.  We open approximately 350 to 400 inquiries each year.</p><p>Some of those follow complaints and others are own-initiative systemic investigations.  A recent one we carried out related to the ECDC.</p></speech>

There is a sort of a newsfeed on the ECDC website and in the part relating to March and April of last year, one can see quite clearly what might be called the contradictory advice on that and the speed at which it changed.  I suspect that part of the reason the WHO, the ECDC and NPHET at the time were not suggesting that people should wear face masks and, in fact were discouraging them, related to the fear that there would be huge demand and that the supply that was necessary for medical and healthcare workers would be diminished.  The ECDC in its response, if I recall correctly, almost agreed with the point that if the authorities had started telling everyone to wear face masks, there would have been a run on them.  The Senator might recall that there was a severe lack of them and the EU, and I think Ireland as well, had to seek airlifts of personal protective equipment, PPE, from China.</p> <p> The issue is interesting in an almost philosophical way.  If I knew that face masks were a good idea, surely the WHO and the ECDC did too.  Similar to the point I made earlier when talking about politicians and their role in finding that balance of risk, was it riskier to tell everyone to get face masks or to do it the other way?  All these matters will be analysed after the fact.</p> <p>  On the Senator's first question, I do not recall that particular issue, although it may just be something that has not yet come across my desk.  I will follow up on it for him.</p></speech>

I thank Ms O'Reilly for her excellent presentation and her ongoing work.  When she was based in Ireland, I dealt with her office on a number of occasions and her staff were fantastic.  I thank her for her communication with me, as a parliamentarian.  She might comment on the impact of the virus on the work of the European Union and on its future.  She spoke about the European Union not having a competency in health policy and the area of transparency.  How does she foresee the European Union moving forward in its work?</p></speech>

It will be interesting to see how that goes because the first big argument was over who should chair it.  Instead of having one chairperson, it will now have three presidents, as well as deputy presidents and further layers &ndash; gang loads of them - involved.  There are also different views as to what outcomes people can expect.  Ireland was, if I recall correctly, one of 12 member states that wrote a letter last week warning not to raise expectations and saying that nothing should come out of this that will involve treaty change, whether major or minor, although obviously that is a political issue.<br/><br/>As anyone who has read about historical events of this nature will know, whether it be a world war, a famine or even the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>, curiously, which led to all sorts of social change, huge change comes out of them.  I think that what will happen because of this will be the future direction of the EU will be greatly influenced, and the debate between those who think there should be more Europe and those who think there should be less will be influenced by this.<br/><br/>One could argue that because of what has happened to Europe and the issues with vaccine contracts and what I have said about the ECDC and so on is an argument for more Europe.  On the other hand, what has happened in the UK, as committee members will be aware if they can bear to read some of the press there, has convinced people they did the right thing.<br/><br/>As for the impact, I was reading earlier that one step the UK is going to take, because the EU threatened the supply chain, is to attempt to decouple itself from the EU supply chain and become more self-sufficient.  The impact of this on the UK, ironically, might even be that it has a better Brexit.  Part of the power of the UK and the British Empire over centuries was based on innovation, whether it was the quality of its armadas, the steam engine or any of the other amazing innovations that came from and fuelled the empire.  I think this will give an impetus to the UK to become more self-sufficient and to increase its use of innovation.  As for how far that will go, I do not know but one can see how this will, perhaps, change the direction in which one might have thought the EU, or the UK post Brexit, was going to go.</p></speech>

Obviously, I am aware that civil rights issues have been raised.  The question always concerns appropriateness and balance and ensuring that measures that are introduced for a certain reason will not continue into the future if the reason they were introduced is no longer relevant.  Frontex, as the agency is also known, has been very well resourced, including through soon having recruited 10,000 border guards, some of them armed.  The implications for fundamental rights, if they are not monitored adequately, are significant.  Many investigations, therefore, are ongoing into Frontex by the European Parliament.  We are examining its complaints mechanism to ensure that it works and is real.</p><p>In a way, it could be seen as a proxy for the EU's attitude to fundamental rights, migration, asylum seekers and so on.  It is the agency charged, in one way, with dealing with part of that problem.  People might say it is the most acute one.  Some member states or people might think that keeping people out, or the protection element, is emphasised and others want more emphasis on fundamental rights.  It must be remembered that irrespective of people's opinions on what should be done, there are laws and regulations that govern its operation.  It is also bound by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p></speech>

It is great to have this conversation with Ms O'Reilly this morning and it is fair to say that since she became Ombudsman in 2003 and European Ombudsman in 2013, she has really been to the fore in finding the truth in terms of ethical standards and trust.  She spoke about trust today and there is much conversation about how transparent Europe was in dealing with the pandemic.</p> <p>  Politicians are not held in very high esteem by the Irish people.  I heard a conversation on the radio this morning indicating that a very low number of people trust politicians.  Ms O'Reilly made some very open and frank comments about how we do our business in Europe.  How does she find the institutions react when she might be telling them to get their act together, for example, or be more ethical in what they say to people?  In dealing with European Medicines Agency or the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, does she find that people acknowledge her role, respect it and try to correct what she sees as inadequacies when giving a truthful position to European citizens?  I have other questions but members have asked them already so I will not repeat them.  I thank Ms O'Reilly for being with us this morning.</p></speech>

They are very much appreciated.  In general, my recommendations are well accepted by the institutions.  The only place I get pushback tends to be in respect of transparency or freedom of information.  In Ireland, which has an Information Commissioner, there is an Ombudsman to make binding decisions.  In Europe, we make recommendations so the institutions still control the tap.  Sometimes it takes a while for recommendations to be accepted; we are trying to influence a cultural change or shift so that something that might have been recommended a couple of years ago might only come to fruition a few years afterwards.</p> <p>  We have done much work on the transparency of the European Council, the ministers from member states who make law with their co-legislators in the European Parliament.  I have been trying to show the real-life impact of this.  There is the example of two current pieces of advice.  One relates to bees, pesticides and advice from the European Food Safety Authority.  Advice was given to member states in 2013 but it has been stuck, with no decision made as to whether it would be implemented by member states.  The problem is that we cannot know which member states are holding up matters.  We do not know if it is the Irish, the French, the Germans or whomever who might be under pressure from constituencies at home and who do not want to go along with the advice as a result.  As citizens do not know that, they cannot therefore influence their own member state.  If we knew Ireland was blocking a particular regulation that some constituents may favour, the only way the Senator could influence this is if he knew in the first instance who is blocking the process or how it is being blocked.</p> <p>  This goes back to what happens in the Oireachtas and the extent to which it holds the Government accountable.  I remember that people from a parliamentary committee in the UK came over before Brexit and the chairperson complained that ministers went to Brussels but people did not know what they were doing or agreeing.  I asked the chairperson to ask the ministers because the accountability lies not with Brussels but with the relevant national parliament, which, in the case of Ireland, would be the Oireachtas.  That is very important.</p> <p>  In general, my recommendations are accepted but I have also learned to play the long game, knowing that sometimes baby steps are required.  Sometimes a recommendation is made and we can go off to do our shopping for a long time before it might be agreed.  Since I took office, we know that relatively few citizens, going on the basis of the number of complaints we get, need the European Ombudsman because their daily needs are taken care of by people like the members at this meeting, the relevant ombudsman and all of that.  At a European level, there is a different type of issue.  Whether it is a big investigation into the ECDC, the transparency of trade deals or similar big matters, I seek to do work that if done and accepted will have a trickle-down effect on many citizens, even if they have never heard of the European Ombudsman.</p></speech>

We really appreciate the contribution she is making today.  I am interested in the pressures of the pandemic and the fear of diminishing checks and balances on the basis of those pressures.  I will ask about two specific cases that came across her desk.  These are allegations that Frontex was complicit in illegally pushing back migrants in the eastern Mediterranean in order to stop them from entering the European Union.  There are also allegations of physical altercations between migrants and Frontex personnel and that the agency also operated outside the European Union.  Has Ms O'Reilly concluded her investigations into Frontex?</p></speech>

As I said, there are quite a few investigations into Frontex, including by ourselves.  We are looking at the complaints mechanism introduced in respect of Frontex a few years ago under a new regulation after it had for a long time refused to accept a complaints mechanism or the need to have one.  Its point of view is that any abuses or violations of fundamental rights or any problems that arise in the context of a Frontex operation are the responsibility of the member state and that the agency is just there to co-ordinate and help.  We disagreed with that and pointed out that Frontex is a European agency.  The uniforms of Frontex guards have the EU logo on them so the agency has to take responsibility or to forward complaints if they are made.  I made a special report to the European Parliament in that regard, which it supported, and there is now a complaints mechanism.  However, the extent to which that is known about or used is contested.  We are looking quite forensically at this, asking very basic questions such as how many complaints there have been, how many were admitted or dealt with and what was the outcome.  This is simple stuff.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned other issues.  We would not look at alleged pushbacks in a particular state or so on, including what a member state did.  We would look at how Frontex acted.  We are going through in fine detail with Frontex the protocols it uses in cases such as those outlined by the Senator.  This takes in decision-making, how it deals with collaborators in member states and so on.  We can go through what is almost an administrative checklist of what is supposed to be done versus what is done.</p></speech>

It is critical and important to climate change and what regulations will come to deal with it.</p> <p>  There was an allegation of a conflict of interest.  Our finding was that there was not maladministration because, according to the tight rules of the Commission on what constituted a conflict of interest, to our mind it was not fair to suggest that the people who looked at this did not follow the rules.  What we did say was the conflict of interest did not encompass the issue posed by BlackRock.  A company, on the one hand, was advising and dealing in energy products while, on the other hand, it was helping to make the rules in a way or advising on rules that could be made in climate change regulation.</p> <p>  Our recommendation was for the Commission or the Legislature to look at the guidelines for what constitutes a conflict of interest.  The overarching point I made on that was that one had to join the dots.  On the one hand, the Commission comes up with a good vision as to what it will do to prevent climate catastrophe.  The Commission President, Madame von der Leyen, described what could be done as the EU's moonshot moment.  One has to link those big statements, however, with the smaller steps taken in other places.  A small step is to give a contract to a particular company that may have a conflict of interest in those matters.  It is all part of this which has to be recognised by the institutions.</p></speech>

Was the European Commission in the best position to carry out advanced procurement?  Is it the best administrator to make key decisions in that kind of a crisis?  When it comes to the negotiations between the European Commission and pharmaceutical companies, especially AstraZeneca, is Ms O'Reilly in a position to say there was more transparency with the public?  Could the deals have been more effective?  Could they have inspired more confidence in the EU's ability to roll out such programmes?</p> <p>  A significant amount of public money was given to the pharmaceutical companies to develop these vaccines.  The pharma companies, however, then kept the patents and intellectual property rights.  Ms O'Reilly said earlier that this was causing problems in Europe in getting the vaccines manufactured.  Developing countries are now relying on big pharma for these life-saving vaccines.  There is a possibility that Third World countries will be left behind in this process.</p> <p>  I agree with Ms O'Reilly on transparency.  If there is transparency from the start, it does away with social media doctors and people getting their information from unreliable sources.  That is where an awful lot of problems have arisen.</p></speech>

However, it is not just those countries that will be left behind if they do not get their populations vaccinated.  It will be all of us who will be left behind.  We know enough about this clever virus now to realise that, if people are allowed to go unvaccinated, it will allow mutant variants to arise which could be far more deadly than the ones we are dealing with now.  If large populations around the world are left unvaccinated, that is where those variants will thrive.  Eventually and inevitably, they will come into our own countries.  It is not just altruism that should encourage us all to help in the vaccination effort in poorer countries.  It is actually self-interest.</p> <p>  At the moment, everybody is stuck in this self-interest mode, although it should be recognised that the EU is contributing a lot of vaccines and funding to enable vaccine programmes to take place in developing and poorer countries.  At the moment, however, it is very m&eacute; f&eacute;in.  There was a story last week that the UK would give people in Ireland vaccines.  I do not see that happening anytime soon.  In fact, the UK has denied it as well.  Equally, the US is far more protectionist than the EU.</p> <p>  Once that panic has abated, it would be morally irresponsible, at the very least, and stupid not to make sure as many parts of the world are vaccinated as well.  If not, it will all come back to haunt us again.</p> <p>  On the vaccine contracts, we have looked at access to documents but we have not looked at the way these were negotiated.  It is not Madame von der Leyen who signs off on these.  It is the member states which all sign off on decisions made about these contracts with this special committee which comprises the Commission and seven member states at the centre.  It is something obviously that we might look at.  We might get complaints about it.  However, our focus and my mandate concern solely the actions of the Commission and not necessarily the member states.</p> <p>  One of the reasons there continues to be pressure on the pharmaceutical companies to be open, as well as on the Commission to ensure transparency about these contracts, is precisely because the companies in question got a lot of European money to develop those vaccines.  Accordingly, they are our vaccines and our transparency.</p><p>I have followed some of the debate on the patents and I am not sure where that is at and I cannot comment with any great insight into it.  What I do know is that one of the revolutionary parts of the vaccine creation has been the open access to scientists and the incredible unprecedented collaboration that has taken place among scientists of the world.  It has not happened before.  Before, there were particular sectors of the population who needed the vaccine and now everybody needs it.  The imperative to throw everything at it is huge.  As I have said, we are far from being out of this.  We are still learning.  There is still this frantic pace of events.  It will be a while before we have the time to examine this.  At the same time, I do not think we should wait forever or wait for another few years before we start looking at this because even now we can put into play some of the lessons we can learn now from how the pandemic has been managed.  Inquiry is very important, and not just, or not even, for the blame game but just so that we can learn from it.  It is a matter of protecting our health that we look into the decision-making at all levels.</p></speech>

I had to step out of the committee for a few minutes so if one of these questions has already been asked please indicate and I will move on to my next question.  With regard to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, investigation, am I right in saying Ms O'Reilly was critical of the interaction of the ECDC with the Chinese authorities?  If so, will Ms O'Reilly elaborate on this?</p></speech>

I was a bit surprised at this because I had read a lot about this and we all read about what happened in China.  The WHO is still wrestling with finding out its exact origins.  People have read all the speculation and the reports about what happened at the very beginning.  I found it a bit puzzling as to why the ECDC would say everything was fine with the Chinese authorities.  I asked my colleagues to ask again or find out the reasons.  I do not have the report in front of me so I cannot exactly detail it but my impression was that the ECDC stated that insofar as the authorities they were dealing with were able to give it certain information, they gave it that information but the issue was the chain of command.  The Chinese centre for disease control could not independently give the information.  It had to go up to the very top to get authorisation for the release of information.  Insofar as it shared the information it was allowed to share, it did so but the question remains as to what had happened at the other level and what was kept back.  It is a bit of a subtle distinction but I think I get what they were talking about.  I felt this needed to be explained, given all of the speculation and negative reports on how the Chinese communicated about the virus from the start.  It was right to be a little bit questioning on it.</p></speech>

It was not something we investigated.  I am not sure we even received complaints about it.  The way I saw it, if we want to use an analogy, is that if three people are on site building a house it will get built in a year but if 100 people are on site building a house it will get built in a few months.  Everything that had to do with the creation of a vaccine or the authorisation of a vaccine was speeded up because there were simply more resources being put at it.  If normally on a Friday afternoon people would close the files and go off for the weekend people continued to work on the files over the weekend.  I have found nothing to suggest that the authorisation was done rapidly.  The European Medicines Agency has a good reputation.  It is headed by an Irish person at present.  I am sure it was under pressure . I have no doubt about that.  From what I have seen, however, it did not cut corners on the authorisation of vaccines.</p></speech>

These were general letters asking for transparency on what they do, especially at a time when people's processes, including this committee's, have changed or are different and there is not the same access or access pathways.  The EIB is responsible for a huge amount of money and will be responsible for the distribution of future funds, whenever that is signed off.  It will play a key role on where investments are made.  We keep an eye on this.  We have dealt with a number of complaints over the years about investments made by the EIB with regard to procedures, its handling of complaints and conflicts of interest at member state level.  It is a body with which we have quite a lot of contact.  I can arrange to send the Deputy an update on our investigation of the EIB.</p></speech>

Something Ms O'Reilly has spoken about today, and something she speaks about quite a lot in public, is the blame Brussels culture and the ease with which individual member states try to make the EU an unknown or faceless bureaucrat to blame for decision-making at member state level.  If I am correct, is the criticism under way of the EU procurement process on the vaccine an example in Ms O'Reilly's mind of the blame Brussels culture?  At the same time, earlier in the meeting she spoke about the ECDC not wargaming Covid properly.  The US and UK treated it like they were facing a war and mobilised their resources.  Ms O'Reilly feels Europe has not done this.  Am I correct that this is her view?</p></speech>

That is it.  The Commission does not make the decisions, it is the member states that decide.  If we look at the various ways in which the vaccines have been rolled out, I am in France, which was a bit reluctant about AstraZeneca from the start, and when particular issues emerged, one minute it was giving AstraZeneca only to those aged over 60 and the next minute it was giving AstraZeneca to those aged under 60.  Those figures are not quite right but France changed its decision-making on who should get it very quickly and completely.  It did a 180&deg; turn.  That was not the Commission, it was France making up its own mind.  There was a very interesting long article in <i>Le Monde</i>yesterday about President Macron's attitude to vaccination generally.  Initially, he was of the view that no vaccine would come on track until the end of this month, so he devised his policies around this.</p><p>He is under pressure now in relation to lockdowns and so on.  The point I am making is that, for all that Brussels proposes and negotiates certain things, ultimately it is the member states who are proposing them.  The way the pandemic has been handled and the vaccine has been rolled out is completely different in every member state.  I was talking to an MEP from Malta the other day and asking how things were among that small population and he told me they took an aggressive approach &ndash; "aggressive approach" was the term he used - at the beginning.  I think they now have one of the highest levels of vaccine take-up.  It will be a while.</p><p> We hear anecdotally about France, which has a fantastic health system and so on.  If I wander around Strasbourg, on virtually ever other street corner there is a place I can go in, get a free Covid test and get the result within 12 hours.  They do certain things well, so I expected the roll-out of the vaccine to be at a similar level to the UK but it has not been.  There are all sorts of cultural and political issues relating to that.  That is the point I make about blaming Brussels.  It is the individual decisions made by the member states that to a large extent - we can argue about that and we will find out empirically what that is - have dictated the play in each member state.</p></speech>

Austria was not one of those.  Austria took what one could describe as a frugal approach and now they want more and the other member states are saying, "No, you didn't ask for them in the first place."  Then they are saying they will block this, that or the other.  It is borne out of panic, fear and who the heck knows.  I do not envy any politician having to make choices based on, as I said before, a playbook that was not written and is not there.</p></speech>

If a straw poll were taken of members of the public, they would say unambiguously that their confidence in the European institutions as a consequence of what happened with the vaccine, when they see what happened in the UK and under the Biden Administration in America, is low.  I am not interested in the blame game.  Rather, as a pro-European, I am interested in seeing the institutions strengthened.  If we are talking about transparency and accepting there is no playbook, how do we avoid in future what has happened with the vaccine roll-out?</p></speech>

Certain countries refused to export their personal protective equipment, PPE, to hoard it and all of that.  Certain countries, particularly the bigger ones, wanted to go their own way on that, which obviously was going disadvantage other countries which did not have the same capacity or resources.  It was the Commission and other leaders that persuaded the member states to take a different approach and to try to take a joint approach, if possible.  That led to a fairer distribution of PPE and other health resources.</p> <p>  On the joint vaccination procurement, it was done with the same intention that it would not be the states who could afford it that were going to buy everything up and that we would jointly agree this.  That is what happened; it was jointly agreed.  People see the Commission, Madame von der Leyen and so on, but sitting around the table with Madame von der Leyen are the Irish representatives as well as the Spanish representatives, the Polish representatives and everybody else.  It could be argued the Commission is doing the work, has the information and is ultimately more influential than an individual member state, but the fact is the member states were all involved.</p> <p>  On the Senator's question of how to avoid this in the future, the member states have to learn the lessons of this.  Do member states want more Europe and a more centralised European response, which would be significantly better than what we have seen, or do we want a go-it-alone strategy, which will inevitably disadvantage smaller countries, including our own?  Those are big political decisions but people need forensically to analyse what went on, to be honest with the public about where responsibility lay and to put forward proposals which would avoid this happening so the next time one person, and it always starts with one person, in, say, Ireland emerges with a potentially lethal virus, the wargaming has been done and there is a united approach to it.</p></speech>

Ms O'Reilly made a recommendation, I think it was in January, to the European Commission about creating an online portal for funding.  Was that recommendation taken on board and implemented?  Second, there was a previous inquiry conducted by Ms O'Reilly relating to the EU Presidency and the corporate sponsoring of same.  Have there been any breaches of that since?  I presume not.  My final question concerns the award for good administration.   I want to end on a positive note.  The deadline for that award was the end of January.  How many organisations have been put forward, given the year it has been?</p></speech>

On corporate sponsorship, I regard that as a successful initiative for us.  It was a complaint we got relating to the fact that when new EU member states hold a council, which can be an expensive process for them, they invite corporate sponsors to sponsor them.  The concern was they would be given privileged access to the Commission, to regulation-making and so on.  Initially, the Council said it was nothing to do with it and that it had to do with the member states.  We disagreed because people see the member state acting as President of the Council.  Latterly, the Council has accepted our view that it has a role.  We did not recommend that sponsorship should end but that the Council should develop guidelines on what is and is not acceptable.  The Council has accepted that.  Germany did not have any sponsorship.  Portugal has sponsorship but we await the Council guidelines on that.</p> <p>  I can get back to the Deputy on the portal but I think it had to do with the fact that a lot of money is about to be put into the member states.</p><p>People need to know where that money is going, who is getting it, who is accountable and so on.  It was in that context that we suggested a portal to the Commission.  This would allow us to easily see what Ireland or any given company got.  I am not sure where we are on that but we will certainly get back to the Deputy on it.  I thank him for raising the nice, happy friendly thing I do, which is the awards system.  We are now on our third iteration.  We did not know if anyone would enter this time but we got almost 40 applications from all over the EU, the agencies obviously being spread all over the place.  We are looking at those applications now and I believe we are to have the awards ceremony at the end of June.  The President of the Commission, Dr. von der Leyen, has agreed to say a few words at that.  I am sure she was delighted to be in a position to say nice things about the great things the EU administration does.  I thank her for that.</p></speech>

I do not see any other Members wishing to speak.  I thank both of the witnesses for attending virtually today.  I hope that, as we go down the road, they will be able to visit us in person.  The discussion has been very beneficial and informative to the committee and, on behalf of the committee, I wish Ms O'Reilly well in her future work as European Ombudsman.  I hope she and her staff stay safe and I wish them a happy Easter.  As I have said, I hope she will be able to appear before the committee in person in the not too distant future.</p> <p>  Before we suspend the meeting, there are some formalities to go through.  I propose that we publish the opening statement of Ms O'Reilly, the European Ombudsman, on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I also propose that we publish the submissions received from the Scottish Parliament, the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia and Mr. David Lowe on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  I propose that we again approve the minutes of the private meetings which we have already approved during virtual private meetings.  We must do this for procedural reasons.  The meetings in question were held on 10 December, 21 January, 4 February, 18 February and 4 March.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

They will provide us with a briefing on the operation of the medical card scheme.  From the Department of Health we have Ms Celeste O'Callaghan, director of model of care policy, primary care policy and eligibility policy, Ms Emma-Jane Morgan, principal officer, eligibility policy unit, Mr. David Noonan, principal officer, GP services and General Medical Services, GMS, contract unit, Mr. Finian Judge, principal officer, community pharmacy, dental, optical and aural policy unit, and Dr. Dympna Kavanagh, chief dental officer; and from the HSE, Mr. Joe Ryan, national director of national services, Mr. Shaun Flanagan, assistant national director, primary care reimbursement service, Dr. Joe Green, national oral health lead in the operations unit, and Ms Kate Halliwell, head of eligibility, national medical card unit.</p> <p>  Before we hear the opening statements, I point out to the witnesses there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege applies to evidence given from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  If, therefore, witnesses are directed by me to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  I invite Ms O'Callaghan to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.373" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Celeste O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021033000002#A00500"><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to update the committee on the medical card scheme.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Emma-Jane Morgan, principal officer, eligibility policy unit, Mr. David Noonan, principal officer, GP services, Mr. Finian Judge, principal officer, community pharmacy, dental, optical and aural policy unit, and Dr. Dympna Kavanagh, chief dental officer.</p> <p>  Eligibility for health services is determined in accordance with the 1970 Health Act.  The Act provides that if an individual who is ordinarily resident in Ireland is deemed unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP medical and surgical services for him or herself and his or her dependants, that individual is considered to have full eligibility and receives a medical card as evidence of that.  Guidelines are in place relating to the income level at which undue hardship would be expected to arise.  People whose income is assessed by the HSE as being at or below the thresholds receive a medical card.  This system of financial means assessment is considered to offer an objective and equitable approach to determining eligibility, ensuring those with the lowest level of means in society can access healthcare when needed.  More than 1.5 million people currently hold medical cards and the vast majority of these are awarded on the basis of a financial means assessment.  However, it is recognised that only looking at a person's income level might not provide a full picture of hardship, so where a person's income might be above the thresholds, if there is a significant cost or burden associated with his or her illness, that person may be awarded a discretionary medical card on the basis of undue hardship.</p> <p>  The provision of medical cards for those who are at the end of life is a particular situation where cards are provided on a discretionary basis.  Until recently, these cards were provided for individuals who were considered to have a prognosis of up to a year.  A clinical advisory group was established by the HSE in 2019 at the request of the Minister to consider the issues arising in extending medical cards for those with a terminal illness.  The report was published in November last year.  The group included both clinicians and patient representatives, and its report made a number of findings and recommendations.  In particular it affirmed that patients in the last 12 months of life are likely to have significant medical needs and to face undue hardship if they do not have a medical card.  It also found that patients with a longer prognosis may have medical needs, but those needs might not be at a level that would satisfy the legal test of undue hardship.  It identified that estimating a prognosis is challenging and becomes more accurate when an individual's expected timeframe is, sadly, shorter.  The report also recommended that if the current prognosis timeframe were to be extended, it should be undertaken on the basis of legislative change rather than via the current discretionary process, but it also found, however, that developing a definition for that purpose would be challenging.  Following on from the report and related Government decisions, the Department is working on the development of legislation to underpin that extension but in the interim an administrative extension to award medical cards to people with a prognosis of 24 months or less has been implemented this month.</p> <p>  Legislation was enacted in 2020 to extend free GP care to children up to the age of 12.  In terms of considering a date for commencement of the measure, it is important as always to ensure that an expansion of free GP care does not limit the capacity of general practice to meet the needs of all patients in the community.  That is particularly important at this time given the impact of the pandemic in terms of increased demand on GPs.  For that reason, a suitable commencement date remains under consideration.</p> <p>  The Health Act 1970 requires the HSE to make dental treatment and dental appliances available for medical cardholders.  These services are provided under the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, by independent private dentists contracted by the HSE.  The Minister has acknowledged that the DTSS has not kept pace with today's preventative approach to dental intervention and he is committed to a root-and-branch review of the scheme.  A new national oral health policy was launched in 2019 and provides the policy context within which a review of the DTSS would be undertaken.  However, the pandemic and the immense disruption it caused to the work of the health services and of the Department of Health has caused the roll-out of that policy to be delayed and the proposed contract review to be deferred.  The Minister has acknowledged the challenges that contracted dentists have faced during the pandemic and the efforts of the dental community in continuing to provide services in a challenging environment.</p><p>He accepts that the profession has concerns about the current contract and is keen to ensure the sustainability and viability of contractual arrangements in order that all eligible persons can continue to receive the services to which they are entitled from their local dentists.</p><p> In conclusion, overall, the range of measures in place, including those that have been introduced in recent years to expand access to medical cards and GP care, means that today, 2.1 million people, or just over 42% of the population, have access to free GP care.  While every effort is made to ensure the medical card system is responsive to those who need it most, as challenges arise, and they do, the Department will continue to work in collaboration with the HSE to address these.</p><p> I thank the committee.  I am happy to address any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Shaun Flanagan, assistant national director of the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, Dr. Joseph Green, assistant national director and national oral health lead in HSE operations, and Ms Kate Halliwell, head of our national medical card unit in PCRS.</p> <p>  The PCRS is responsible for ensuring that eligibility is in place for qualifying persons for primary care schemes such as the general medical services scheme, the drugs payment scheme, the long-term illness scheme, the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, and other schemes and arrangements.  These schemes and reimbursement arrangements are essential to the operation of the health service.</p> <p>  PCRS is also responsible for making payments to primary care contractors, suppliers of essential high-tech medicines and acute hospitals and others across a range of schemes and arrangements.  The proportion of the HSE&rsquo;s budget for 2021 that PCRS is responsible for amounts to &euro;3.269 billion.  We constantly focus on patient and service user experience in using the services of PCRS.  It works hard to make the best use of its resources, and as a result, its administration costs represent less than 1.5% of all costs over the past decade.</p> <p>  The past 12 months have been unprecedented and Covid-19 has had major impacts across all sectors of society.  It is important to reference the challenges that Covid-19 has presented to the primary care reimbursement service and the efforts made to address those challenges.</p> <p>  Throughout the pandemic, PCRS has ensured that all necessary eligibility and reimbursement systems to underpin the arrangements for existing health services are in place and has sustained its performance in meeting key performance indicators.  Important new Covid-19 services, negotiated with and provided by our primary care contractors, have been put in place in a timely manner to enable key elements of the overall HSE Covid-19 response.</p> <p>  The staff of HSE PCRS have responded admirably throughout the pandemic to new needs and new work streams.  PCRS staff were called upon and responded to multiple other Covid-19 initiatives in support of colleagues.  This included the national ambulance service testing of patients and staff in nursing homes, co-ordinating the booking of Covid-19 vaccinations for GPs and their staff and providing pharmacy support to mass vaccination clinics.</p> <p>  Over the past 12 months, applications for new medical cards or new GP visit cards have remained reasonably consistent with historical patterns, with on average between 3,000 and 4,000 new applications being handled weekly.  In the early phases of the pandemic, while new applications continued to be processed, the HSE suspended reviews of existing cards.  This was because, first, PCRS staff were required to support multiple Covid-19 responses; second, PCRS wanted to reduce requests for GPs to complete the relevant sections of application forms; third, PCRS needed to be in a position to process the then expected large numbers of applications, which did not develop due to the significant economic supports put in place by Government, for new medical cards; and, fourth, PCRS staff needed to support new reimbursement systems such as the GP Covid-19 supports.</p> <p>  Reviews of medical and GP visit cards recommenced for cards that were due to expire from 31 August 2020 onwards.  Of those cards, up to 80% of expiring cards have been automatically extended without requiring individuals to engage with the application process.  Cards which are reviewed are those which are risk-assessed as more likely to not meet eligibility criteria.</p> <p>  As at 28 February 2021, 1,579,589 individuals held medical cards.  This has increased from 1,544,374 medical cards on 1 January 2020.  Some 531,121 individuals hold GP visit cards now compared to 524,494 individuals on 1 January 2020.</p> <p>  The PCRS is responsible for making payments to healthcare professionals such as general practitioners, dentists and pharmacists, for free or reduced cost services provided to the public.  In 2020, PCRS received in excess of 80 million reimbursement claims from more than 7,000 contractors.</p> <p>  With regard to terminal illness cards, on 9 February, the Government decided to extend provision of medical cards to individuals with a terminal illness who have a prognosis of 24 months or less and have been certified by their treating consultant.  It asked that the HSE put this in place as soon as possible.  The card will be awarded to the individual for his or her lifetime and will not require a means assessment, nor will the card be reviewed.</p> <p>  Adult medical card holders have access to dental services under the DTSS through care provided by private dentists that hold DTSS contracts with the HSE.  Medical card holders can choose which dentist they wish to attend.  In a typical year, just over 30% of the eligible population receive treatment through the DTSS.  In 2020, this level dropped to 22.4%, mostly due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Some 1,084,321 claims were received under the scheme in 2019, resulting in expenditure of more than &euro;56 million.  In 2020, 789,940 claims were received at a cost of &euro;40.57 million.</p> <p>  An electronic claims system was introduced in late 2017.  Currently, 67% of contractors claim online, with 74% of treatment items under the DTSS now claimed electronically.  The HSE is aware that some medical card holders have experienced difficulties in accessing treatment under the DTSS.  Wherever this is made known to the HSE, each inquiry and representation is followed up by local community services which seek to assist medical card holders.  As well as assisting medical card holders, the executive is working closely with the Department of Health on the operation of the scheme and difficulty faced by some patients.  The executive liaises with the Department on a regular basis.  This concludes my opening statement.</p></speech>

My team also finds that the staff on the Oireachtas hotline are very helpful.  I want to put that on the record.</p> <p>  As a starting point, do the witnesses have information on the 1.5 million plus medical cards?  How many of those medical cards are active and how many are inactive?  They might only be used perhaps once or twice a year compared to others that are used on a regular basis.  Do the witnesses have any percentage breakdown on the activity within that cohort of medical card holders?</p></speech>

I think that a medical card should specifically be for medical purposes.  I will move on because I have made that point.  Will the witnesses make those figures available, because we would be interested in developing that body of work?</p><p> I have spoken to John Wall about end-of-life care, as I am sure have many of my colleagues, on many occasions.  I welcome that the process in that area has begun.  We are talking about 24 months.  How many of those end-of-life medical cards have been issued to date?</p></speech>

We have received less than ten applications at this point but the system has only been in place since 12 March.  We would all have to be aware that hospitals have been especially busy over the last quarter with Covid activity.  As the hospital system is trying to catch up with that, I expect that number will grow significantly over the next while.</p></speech>

We have commenced work on the legislation.  That followed on from the publication of the report in November and the decision by the Government to proceed with this approach.  We are currently in the preliminary analysis phase.  We are doing a couple of strands of analysis to underpin the development of options relating to the legislation.  The clinical advisory group report set out some of the challenges that are likely to arise when we are trying to legislate for something like this.  In particular, there are challenges around defining what a terminal illness is.  That is one area that we are examining in order to do the preliminary analysis.  We are at that stage with the legislation.</p></speech>

I do not think that we have had a situation like that yet.  One aspect of this of which we are conscious is that it is a new scheme and works on an administrative basis.  There are challenges around areas such as making a prognosis.  It was flagged clearly in the report of the clinical advisory group that it is not a precise science and it is a clinical judgment at a point in time.  What we would expect is that over the coming months, while the new administrative scheme is in place, there will be lessons about some of those issues and these can be examined and incorporated into the work we are doing to develop the legislation.</p></speech>

It was work that the clinical advisory group tried to do but it was not able to provide a robust estimate.  This comes down to the challenge of prognostication: the longer the period of life that one is trying to estimate, the wider the confidence intervals.  For the 12 months we award some 3,500 cards in respect of that cohort, so one must assume it would be 3,500 when it gets up to full speed.  This is a plus, and it would probably be a bit more than that due to the wider confidence intervals.</p></speech>

The problem I have with Mr. Ryan's opening statement and the response I have received so far is that it puts it back onto the individual medical card holder.  What the Irish Dental Association has said is a world apart from what Mr. Ryan stated earlier.  The association has said the treatment scheme for medical card holders is in an unprecedented crisis and a full-blown resourcing crisis.  It used the words "complete chaos" and described it as a service on "the brink of collapse".  This is what the Irish Dental Association has stated.  Record numbers of dentists are dropping out of the scheme.  Is this Dr. Green's experience with regard to what the Irish Dental Association is saying?  Is this his experience of how serious the situation is with the scheme?</p></speech>

The majority of contractors have retained their contracts and continue to provide medical services to medical card holders.  I acknowledge them and thank them for doing that.

That reduction was significant.  The Irish Dental Association also said that some of the contracts are what it would call "inactive".  I have received many representations from patients who are medical card holders and who have had difficulties in this area.  It was characterised in the opening statement as some patients experiencing difficulties, and then put it back on the patients themselves to contact the HSE.  That is not the problem.  The problem is systemic and it goes back to the resourcing of the contract.  That is the problem.  It needs to be dealt with.  The Irish Dental Association is saying that we are facing an unprecedented crisis - a full-blown resourcing crisis - and that there is a real difficulty with this scheme.</p></speech>

We have been working with the Department to try to address the difficulties patients are experiencing.

The issues with this scheme are long-standing.  The crises that I have been hearing about in respect of public dentistry, orthodontic waiting lists, medical card holders' access to the scheme and the resourcing of the scheme are long-standing.  A recognition by the Minister in the Department's opening statement does not cut it.  We need a resolution in the same way that we need a resolution on the engagement with the IMO on expanding medical card eligibility, for which we democratically voted in the Oireachtas.  There does not seem to be an urgency around reviewing this scheme.   I ask again, through the Chair, that we write to the Minister for Health and state that we need urgent negotiation with the Irish Dental Association in order to resolve this issue.  It is unacceptable that public patients are not getting treatment they need or access to a service because the scheme is not fit for purpose.  I do not hear an urgency coming from the HSE or the Department.  I ask again that the members present at this meeting agree - we can discuss the matter later in private session - to write to the Minister to express concern for the operation of this scheme.</p></speech>

I am very pleased we are discussing this type of medical card, in no small part due to the efforts of activists in the area.  Deputy Cullinane asked my first question which was on the Irish Dental Association.  I echo some of his concerns and the need to address them.  We can deal with that in private session.</p> <p>  It is the early stages of this medical card and I acknowledge we are early in the process of formulating the legislation but cards have been given on that basis.  I wish to run through some of the parameters of what it looks like for people who are trying to access that card.  Where there is a dispute about prognosis, how is it envisaged that will be addressed?  </p></speech>

The HSE does not see itself as getting into dispute with treating consultants around prognosis.  We accept it is a fairly challenging issue to try to estimate a prognosis of two years or less, particularly for different diseases and so on.  If a treating consultant certifies that it is 24 months, we will accept that is his or her expert opinion.</p></speech>

Individuals can receive second opinions but it is not a part of the system as it has been built.  Against that, in terms of a treating consultant, whether it is a first or second opinion, the HSE will not get into a dispute with consultants on that basis.</p></speech>

There is a five-page form, and there is one section where he or she certifies that the person has a prognosis of 24 months or less.  The consultant provides very brief information to the HSE on the diagnosis and the disease.  That is more so that we can understand the groups who are accessing, and are able to access, the terminal card, in case we are missing a group.  We do not take detailed clinical information from the consultant.</p></speech>

I refer to medical cards for life-limiting conditions.  It is very welcome that the clinical advisory group recommended that those with 24 months or less would have access to medical cards.  I also commend John Wall who has campaigned on this tirelessly for years.  He has done amazing work for those who find themselves in this situation.  I spoke to John yesterday about any questions I should ask today.  He said that when anyone gets a prognosis, it is very traumatic.  He said the process is very good to get access to the card.  He said it usually takes less than 36 hours, so that is good.  The last two programmes for Government stipulated that those who have a terminal illness should have access to a medical card, without a time limit on their prognosis, without a means test as it is a very arduous process.  Is there any scope to expand it without a time limit in future?</p></speech>

At the moment, that is the basis on which we are working to develop the legislation.  On the difficulties of making a prognosis, the clinical advisory group was clear that as one moves further out and as a person is likely to live longer, making a prognosis becomes more challenging.  I am not a clinician but we are mindful that there is a crossover space between terminal illness and chronic disease which needs to be thought about.  As we are developing the legislation, we will look at all those issues to try to come up with a definition and an implementable model.  Within that context, we will inevitably acquire more information about what issues or challenges might arise if a decision was made by government in the future to go beyond the 24 months.</p></speech>

I am not sure if anybody can answer it, but hopefully somebody can.  It relates to those who have been granted a ministerial licence for medical cannabis products.  My experience from working with families trying to reimburse under ministerial licences has been extremely arbitrary and bureaucratic.  This has put families in a very difficult position in which some of them could not access reimbursements and, in one case, the family had to look at selling their home.  The situation is far from ideal.  The news that the medical cannabis programme will be up and running in the summer is welcome.  My experience and that of other families of getting reimbursement under the primary care reimbursement service has been haphazard.  Will the witnesses clarify why, in some cases, it takes up to nine months to get reimbursement for a medicine that works for children and why it is so difficult?  Meeting the criteria places a financial burden on families.</p></speech>

We will look to have that finalised and in place.  Regarding products sourced under licence, it is a slightly more complex arrangement and I ask Mr. Flanagan to describe that.</p></speech>

On that basis, the system fits in with the treatment abroad scheme.  As I understand it, applications have to be made by the clinician responsible for the care and, once received, the HSE tries to process them in as timely a fashion as possible.  There may be occasions where individual pieces of information are missing, which delays a decision.  There have been parliamentary queries on this which have been responded to in the last week or two.  As it is in the treatment abroad scheme, I am not 100% up to date on the licensing part of it.  The medical cannabis access programme will be run by the primary care reimbursement service.  That is what we are busy planning at the moment.</p></speech>

A couple of issues come to mind which I have had to deal with recently.  The first relates to discretionary medical cards and the medical cards issued on the basis of life-threatening illness.  I would have thought that, during the course of Covid, those who were about to lose their medical card or have it reviewed and who had obtained the card based on a diagnosis would have had a medical card reissued to them almost automatically because of the danger of causing stress and anxiety to them and their families at a critical time.  I have had some difficulty in that area.  We managed to resolve it but it took some time.  Is it possible, at this stage, to devise a system that is more conscious of the needs of the families affected by such a serious illness, including spouses and siblings, and to ask those who have the means of doing so if they can in some way alleviate the impact on those people at a vulnerable time?</p></speech>

Under the existing 12-month arrangement for emergency cards, where those are issued to people with terminal conditions, they are not reviewed either.  We suspended reviews of medical card at the start of the pandemic, which was around this time last year.  They were resumed at the end of August but in any month between 65% and 80% of cards would not require any further application process and would be automatically extended.  We risk-assess cards where they are unlikely to meet that threshold and we have to go through an application process with people in that regard.  To be clear, end-of-life cards are provided on the basis of end of life.  In relation to medical cards, they are provided on the basis of the person's means and residential status.</p></speech>

Where we are aware that a medical diagnosis has driven the award of a medical card, we have not reviewed those cards.  On occasion, people can have a diagnosis but may have secured a medical card on the basis of means and maybe it is in such scenarios that this issue has emerged.  We only know when a person has a particular diagnosis if that formed part of a previous application.  There may be scenarios where someone got the card on the basis of means but then-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021033000002#F00900"><p>The problem I am concerned with is the emphasis on a number of occasions on the reference to end of life.  My response to that is that people who have a life-threatening diagnosis have enough to be worried about without trying to determine whether they can get a letter from somebody to say they have two or three months to live, or whatever the case may be.  They are suffering enough already.  I presume the services would be sufficiently sympathetic to their position to take on board what has been said to them in good faith, knowing there will be some other time for review in any event.  I would like much more emphasis placed on that part, in other words, on sympathy with the patient who has a serious problem on his or her hands.</p><p> Another issue that has come up on a few occasions recently concerns an application for a medical card from a person whose income is over the limit but who has a serious diagnosis.  A letter from the GP is not sufficient.  It has to be a letter from the consultant.  Due to the general data protection regulation, GDPR, the consultant will not send the letter to the advocate.  Incidentally, all public representatives are advocates and we should not forget that.  Our job is advocating on behalf of our communities, and we are not always wrong.  The point at issue is that after much toing and froing, with a lot of stress on the patient, the spouse had to go to the consultant to get the letter.  Otherwise, it was going to go into the mix and might not come out of the system for five or six weeks.  Five or six weeks is a long time to somebody who is in pain and concerned about their health and their financial position.  I would like to see more sympathetic processing of medical cards in those particular instances.</p><p> Regarding the points raised by a number of speakers, generally speaking, the health services are supposed to respond to the needs of the people as and when the needs arise.  Ninety per cent of the time members of the public do not have to rely on the health services but when they do, they anticipate a sympathetic response.  I repeat the words "sympathetic response" again and again.  If they do not get that they feel ignored.  To be ignored at any time is a serious issue.  To be ignored at a time of health-related stress and pain is a very serious issue.</p><p> Deputy Cullinane raised a question about orthodontic treatment.  The position has not changed one bit in the past 20 years.  The system has avoided the issue when it should have been simple to refer children for treatment at an early age.  Instead of creating two or three categories, in one of which they will never receive treatment, and pushing as many people as possible into that particular category, we should be doing it in a different way.  We should deal with the cases on the basis of their necessity and severity and not presume that they will be all right in any event.</p><p> The new reimbursement system and the authorisation of new and orphan drugs has been an issue for a long time, continues to be an issue and will remain an issue.  I appreciate the fact that drug companies should not be allowed to charge what they wish.  That has to be dealt with at a different level but we need to be mindful of the need to respond to the particular drugs that are required by the patients and prescribed by a medical doctor.</p></speech>

With regard to the diagnosis and the consultant not sharing the data with an advocate, the Deputy referred to public representatives.  As Deputies and Senators are covered under the GDPR and the Data Protection Act, a consultant should be in a position to seek those data once the permission of the patient has been given to that particular person.  We would be more than happy to deal with any specific incidents on a case-by-case basis as they arise.</p> <p>  In terms of responding sympathetically, we try to be sympathetic with everybody.  That is part of the way in which we are trying to drive the culture of the HSE.  Part of the transformation of the health services is about ensuring that we have a caring and considerate approach to everybody.  When we fail in that, we are particularly keen to know about that and to try to address it.  Everybody in the HSE goes to work every day with the best of intentions to give the best service they possibly can to the patients and citizens of the country.</p> <p>  In terms of new and orphan drugs, in the letter of determination in the service plan this year we have &euro;50 million allocated for new drugs.  So far this year, in the order of 25 to 28 new drugs have been approved and there are more to be considered.  There is a long list of new drugs that are always coming up and we have to assess them rigorously for all the elements of value in terms of their efficacy and the cost.  We have to strike that balance.  We have processes in place and we have our drugs group, as well as Dr. Barry and his team, who assist us in assessing all new drugs.</p> <p>  With regard to the orthodontic treatment, I ask Dr. Green to give a short response on that.</p></speech>

With regard to the orthodontic question, I think the Deputy referred to the assessment system indirectly.  The type of cases that are up for treatment by the HSE are very complex cases.  The system we use, which is known as the modified index of treatment need, is an international grading system.  The two categories within that system that are offered treatment in the HSE are grade 4 and grade 5.  Typically, those cases would take at least two to three years to treat.  Orthodontic treatment is not a single episode of care.  As well as the active treatment, which as I said could take approximately two years, there would be at least another year in retention where the patient will be wearing retainers.  The patient is within the system for a lengthy period, usually during the teens.  There is huge demand on our services and the need that is being expressed has exceeded the capacity that has been available.</p> <p>  Over the past four years we have had a procurement arrangement in place where we have managed to place just under 2,000 patients with private service providers.  That recently expired and currently there is an invitation to tender in place through eTenders.  That will close in the next couple of weeks and we hope that the successful arrangement will start to allocate patients who are the longest waiting from the end of the second quarter or early in the third quarter.  Currently, the capacity of that system is uncertain because it will have to await the outcome of the tender response process.</p></speech>

Many of the questions being asked by members are questions that require political answers and it is unfair to take it out on some of the people today who are administering the schemes.  The decisions with regard to who gets a medical card or a GP visit card are essentially political ones and it is important to bear that in mind.  We are told that 42% of people have free GP care.  That leaves a very large number of people who do not have access to subsidised or free GP care.  It is important to bear in mind that we are very much an outlier in European terms in that the majority of people in the country have to pay to see a GP.  That does not make any sense from a health perspective, an equality perspective or anything like that.</p><p>We have a very long way to go in providing access to primary care.  It is also worth pointing out that if Sl&aacute;intecare had been implemented in the timescale it was supposed to be, there would now be access for the population to free or subsidised GP care.  We have a very long way to go and we must always keep that in mind.</p><p> What is the position with the increase in medical cards for people who are unemployed, given the huge increase in the unemployment rate over the past 15 months or so?  What number of people have come into the scheme?  There was a proposal where if people were unemployed for six months or more, they would retain their medical card when going back to employment.  Not many people have gone back to employment but is that still operating?  When is the review of the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, likely to take place?</p><p> I note what Ms O'Callaghan has said about the legislation with respect to the extension of medical cards to more children but my understanding is agreement had been reached with GPs in the context of an overall agreement with them last year taking in the reinstatement of pay by unwinding financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation and so on, as well as various practice supports.  Part of that agreement was that GP visit cards would be extended to children.  What is the exact problem with doing that and why have we not seen it happen?  What is the timeline for the permanent scheme to provide medical cards to people with terminal illnesses?  Has there been movement on the question of people who are over 70 having means assessed on the basis of gross income rather than net income, as it applies to people under 70?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the timing of legislation for providing medical cards to people with a terminal illness.  The administrative scheme has been put in place for an initial 12 months to allow time for the legislation to be developed.  We want to do a fairly robust analysis at the policy end as we develop the heads because it is a tricky area.  We do not anticipate producing the heads before the summer but we anticipate having them for the autumn session.  I suppose the period to allow this to pass through the Oireachtas depends on other factors, including the overall legislative schedule.</p></speech>

As she might recall, we launched a new Government-approved national oral health policy, Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte in 2019.  That policy was meant to provide the context for the review of the dental treatment services scheme.  It was always the intention that the scheme would be aligned with the policies, principles and goals outlined in that new policy approved by the Government.  As members know, the roll-out of that policy has, unfortunately, been delayed because of Covid-19.  The review of the scheme has also been postponed because particular personnel resources have been assigned elsewhere.</p> <p>  The Deputy would know from responses given to the House by the Minister that he is fully committed to the review and our intention is to commence it as soon as resources can be freed from Covid-19 work to allow us do significant preparatory work before we even sit down with the representative organisation about the review.  It is a scheme that goes back to the 1990s and we all accept it is very much out of date with the principles contained in the new policy.  There is much work to be done there and our intention is that as soon as resources are freed, we can begin that work.</p></speech>

A national clinical guideline group has been established and a chairperson has been appointed to look in particular at background to ensure when we are ready to do the review, we know what the packages will contain.  We will look at all the infrastructure and the appropriate management and guidelines for clinicians.  That time will not be wasted in future.  There are other aspects relating to the Dental Act etc. and they are ongoing in the background.</p></speech>

The back-to-work scheme is still in place.  The Deputy referenced the numbers and we expected when the Covid-19 pandemic started that there would be a massive increase in new applications for medical cards but that did not emerge.  One of the reasons we suspended reviews in the first few months of the pandemic was that we thought we would get a major influx of new applications for medical cards.  That has not emerged and I presume that must be down to the pandemic unemployment payments and maybe the age of the cohorts that are unemployed.  Perhaps they are not pulling on the health service.  The Deputy asked about assessment of means for those over 70.  There is a gross system for those over 70 but if an individual makes a net application, we will also look at that.</p></speech>

It did not have any detailed proposals or there certainly was not a specific agreement on how anything would be rolled out.  It was always the intention that whereas the 2019 agreement included a general commitment to move in that direction, implementing such a provision would require much detailed negotiation on how the service would be structured, the costings and so on.  What is in the agreement, as such, is not sufficient to deliver a service.</p></speech>

Regarding the review of medical cards, a letter is sent and in certain cases I have come across the individual does not respond.  The people involved might be elderly and if they do not have family or a carer keeping an eye out for post sometimes these letters go unanswered.  They are quite simple, asking whether the person's circumstances have changed and if the details correct.  Are these followed up with phone calls?  Very often in the cases I have dealt with, these people do not know they have lost their medical cards until they go to the pharmacist to get a prescription.</p><p> Why do those aged over 70 who want to be considered for a full medical card based on a medical, and who have already been granted a GP card, have to submit their financial details again even though they have already been submitted?  It is very stressful.</p><p> When we know someone is going to fail the financial test and is looking to get a discretionary card based on a medical is there a way to bypass the financial test when going through the process?</p><p> With regard to dental services, I am led to believe there has been a reduction of assessments in school settings over the past decade.  I am dealing with the case of an individual who has a rather severe underbite that was not picked up in primary school.  The person is now over 16 and does not qualify for care.  This means the parents will have to go private, which will place a huge strain on them.

We allow for a three month period prior to the card expiring.  At the end of the second month, the individuals receive a second piece of correspondence advising them the cards are due to expire and asking them to engage with us.  At present, we do not correspond over the phone with these individuals due to volume, as Mr. Ryan has said.  Generally, we review up to 15,000 cards a month so the capacity to undertake that role would be huge.  We could pull the figures on non-response rates for the committee because it seems quite low at present.  People are engaging with us.  We can provide a written submission if that would help.</p></speech>

Ms Halliwell said that non-response rate is quite low.  Could these individuals be followed up before the card is finally pulled to ask them whether they received the correspondence and if they need help in answering the questions?  Very often it is quite simple because circumstances have not changed and neither have the details, and it is just a case of signing the form and returning it.</p></speech>

We review a minority of the people whose cards expire and we are progressively trying to make it more and more sensitive.  We have tried to put in place a team that reaches out in difficult cases where people are not engaging or where there a lot of calls to our contact centre.  We have tried to put in place a team that reaches out to people, almost like a case manager if we want to put it like that.  We are always open to seeing whether we can improve.  We can look again at the phone calls to see whether there is a possibility of doing something if we are down to a very small number of non-responders.</p> <p>  I may not have fully understood the question with regard to those aged over 70 who apply for a full medical card when they already have a GP visit card.  If somebody gets a GP visit card because they are aged over 70 it is without a means test.  It is automatic eligibility.  We would probably not have a means test in this circumstance.  If somebody has been through a means test in the past it may be out of date if it had taken place a good number of months previously.  I may have misunderstood the question.</p></speech>

If there was a change in circumstance obviously the means test would recommence.  If there is a specific case where the Senator feels we have been awkward or inappropriate we would be quite happy to look at it to try to learn from any mistake we might make.  Generally we do not try to put people through multiple means tests if we can avoid it.  We try to be as efficient as we can.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about discretionary medical cards.  We must remember that the discretion relates to how we apply the means and financial thresholds.  It is not that we decide that individuals get a medical card purely on the basis of a disease.  The system is based on means.  We manage the means and look at people's expenses.  Then we look at their medical expenses.  As part of this process we use a burden of illness questionnaire to try to maximise or capture medical costs.  This is what the discretion relates to.  It relates to how we apply the financial thresholds, taking into account the costs of the disease and the challenges for the individual of paying for the treatment that arises out of it.  I hope this answers the question.</p></speech>

In fact, the most recent letter I received from the HSE was to the effect that the people being treated at present have been on the list since 2016.  Can someone give me an explanation as to why people who require orthodontic treatment in Kerry are referred to private practitioners under a scheme, and I am not sure which one, but in Cork we just leave people on a list?  Can people apply under the National Treatment Purchase Fund for orthodontic treatment?  If not, why not, particularly with this waiting time period?  Perhaps someone might clarify this issue for me please.</p></speech>

We do not have enough orthodontists employed in the public service to deal with it but there are people working in the private sector who could provide the service.

It will involve the longest-waiting patients, including those the Deputy mentioned who are waiting up to five years.  They will be the first to be allocated to service providers.

One is that we have pulled all the hospitals together under a common procurement framework that allows them to work together to put the best possible arrangement in place nationally.  They still have the capacity to do things locally where they have their own local requirements.  Second, there has been excellent work delivered, even throughout the pandemic, by consultants in a number of hospitals in replacing some of the originator high-tech drugs with biosimilar drugs.  They are slightly different from generic drugs but the same principle applies that they tend to be less expensive.  That has driven much more competition in the market for those very complex drugs and significant savings have been made in this regard.  That is helping us to contribute to the cost of new drugs.</p></speech>

A large number of people travel to the North to access orthodontic treatment through that scheme.  It requires payment upfront before being reimbursed by the HSE.  Information on the scheme is available from the HSE's treatment abroad scheme, TAS, office.  I hope that is of use to the Deputy.</p></speech>

It is directing people to the treatment abroad scheme when this service could easily be provided under the NTPF.  I do not accept that we should be requiring people to travel long distances to access treatment.  This is especially the case with orthodontics, which usually does not involve once-off treatment but, rather, a series of treatments over a period of time.  I am absolutely appalled by the suggestion that people from Cork should travel to Northern Ireland for treatment.</p></speech>

A total of &euro;110 million has been released to the HSE for waiting list initiatives.  Our HSE colleagues can bid into that funding for such initiatives.  Separately, Sl&aacute;intecare, working with our colleagues, is looking at a considered approach with the NTPF, not just for acute services but also for community services, which would include the 17,000 people on the orthodontic waiting list.</p> <p>  A number of key points have emerged from the initiative so far.  Fifteen acute specialties have been looked at to date and the evidence that has emerged shows the numbers on the waiting list can be reduced by as much as 20%.  It is proposed that a very specific clinical assessment should be taken of cases to see what would give the most value.  That effort has just commenced and it involves a three-week, intensive approach.  A plan has to be produced at the end of it to provide clear guidelines for both acute and community services, including dental services, to bid in for that waiting list initiative.</p> <p>  The Department is liaising with the NTPF specifically around dental provision because there is concern that some of those services are not being considered by the NTPF, notwithstanding the services, such as dental extractions, that are taking place in public hospitals.  Thus far, the information the NTPF holds on dental services is that there are 3,363 surgery cases being dealt with under the fund.</p><p>There are 352 that have not been clarified<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>their condition but the Department is liaising with the NTPF to look at those figures and to expand on what is being recorded in the future.  As I said, that waiting list initiative is intended to extend to community services and &euro;110 million has been released for waiting list initiatives.</p></speech>

What we are looking for in Cork is  action.  We do not have orthodontists employed by the HSE so the HSE must consider alternatives but the response is not fast enough.  It is not good enough that I would have to go back to a parent today and say that I do not have any further information and there is a chance his or her child will still be on the waiting list in four years time.  That seems to be the answer I am getting today.</p></speech>

As with any public service, if a large proportion of people submitted applications as Gaeilge, we would probably be somewhat challenged but would do our best to respond.  Currently, the vast majority of people make their applications in English and on the basis of current patterns, we can manage and have sufficient capacity.  I do not have the exact number of Irish-language applications that we would have received in the last year.</p></speech>

A lot of Irish speakers who have the right to deal with the State in the Irish language are opting to fill out applications and have them processed in English because they fear that the capacity does not exist to process them quickly in Irish and that they will be held up.  I ask the witnesses to provide data on the numbers employed currently who would be able to process applications in Irish if so demanded.  If everybody who requested an application form in Irish went ahead and submitted their application in Irish, what kind of delays would we see?</p></speech>

Several members have expressed frustration this morning regarding access to services for medical card holders.  Earlier we heard about a crisis with regard to the number of dentists in the GMS.  Do we know exactly how many dentists have left the scheme?  What do patients of dentists who have left the scheme do?  Do they move to another dentist or do they contact the Department to alert them to the fact that their dentist is not operating under the scheme?  Do the witnesses have any advice for people who are in that situation who may be listening this morning?  A similar situation pertains with chiropodists, apparently.   We have been told that a lot of chiropodists are leaving the scheme.  Do we have exact numbers in that regard?</p> <p>  A number of years ago ease of access to medical cards depended on geographical location, for historic reasons.  Has that changed?  In 2014 an expert panel conducted a review of medical card eligibility under the GMS and made several recommendations.  Were those recommendations fully implemented?  </p> <p>  Another area of concern relates to medical cards for those who are terminally ill.  Thankfully, the number of such people making applications is low but is there a red-flag process or any way within the system of fast-tracking those applications?  </p></speech>

On access to medical cards based on where one is in the country, we have put significant work into centralising the medical card process.  Equity is crucial and we do not want postcode lotteries to apply to access to healthcare.  All the applications are now handled centrally and supported by a proper appeals process.  We have taken away the notion, which was a reality some years ago, that where one was in the country determined how difficult it was to get a medical card.  When someone is entitled and eligible for a card, we make sure he or she gets it as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  A specific team is in place to handle applications for end of life and terminal illness cards in order that they do not get caught up.  We realise how important it is for somebody in that position not to be put through any unnecessary or undue stress.</p> <p>  I am not sure about the 2014 report.  I will refer to Mr. Flanagan on the implementation and recommendations of the report, as the PCRS predates me. </p></speech>

Crohn's disease, coeliac disease and asthma were referred to, as were older people and persons with mental health issues such as schizophrenia, and it was stated that medical card eligibility should be based on medical need rather than specific medical conditions.</p></speech>

The group came up with three reports on identifying and being more responsive to need.  One report assisted the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in designing a burden of illness questionnaire to maximise the capture of cost and challenges in relation to medicines.  The findings were addressed.</p> <p>  The Keane report also flagged that the means assessment worked grossly for many people but the need base had to be better managed.  The burden of illness questionnaire was a key change suggested but the clinical advisory group reported other changes to the HSE and the PCRS implemented most of the recommendations.  Some of the report was made up of commentary rather than recommendations.</p> <p>  I flag the emergency application system which the Chair is probably aware of.  It has a separate application form and is designed to fast-track individuals who urgently need a medical card and may not be in a position to submit a means test application.  In the scenario in which there is a clear, medically defined requirement for an urgent medical card, a healthcare professional makes the application on his or her behalf which sets out the need and provides a medical report.  We suspend the means test for six months.  The system is for documented issues in which there is a medical need for a card but the person cannot engage with the process.</p></speech>

One of the members quoted some figures on the number of active contracts.  In late 2017, there was an exercise to deal with inactive contracts and we are going through a similar exercise, with three CEOs yet to complete it.  There are approximately 100 additional inactive contracts which happens when a dentist moves on from a practice without letting the HSE know.  We are therefore not in a position to put an exit date against the contract.</p> <p>  We share the Chair's concern about frustration experienced by patients.  We do not want anyone to be left without an essential service and dental treatment is one such service.  We follow through on each concern made or representation raised with us.  If a patient makes a complaint about not being able to access a dentist, we follow through on that as well.  We assist medical card holders, when we can, with lists of available contractors.  Sometimes we must go beyond that and assist a vulnerable person with making contact with the dentist.</p> <p>  We operate the scheme within the parameters set out in the legislation and regulation that governs the scheme.  As I said, we work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Health on the operation of the scheme.  We are bringing the difficulties some medical card holders experience to their attention.</p> <p>  As our Department colleagues said, we expect to see a shift from a diagnosis and treatment approach to a preventative approach in a revised scheme.  We look forward to that.</p></speech>

On the GMS scheme and the contracts in place with GPs, as I am sure the HSE staff here are aware, due to the huge demands on GPs in rolling out Covid-19 vaccinations, many levels of healthcare cannot be provided for.  Most people understand and accept that.  That is a reality as mass vaccination is rolled out but I am concerned by a few scenarios I would consider essential.  Recently, the GP of a young man who had been accepted, in principle, to the Air Corps could not do the required final assessments as he or she was too busy.  Are the witnesses aware, as the administrative body for the GMS, of shortcomings during Covid-19 vaccination roll-out in terms of the level provided by GPs?</p></speech>

The way GPs operate has had to change for reasons such as the need to use PPE and separate patients to avoid them having to queue.  This has affected their overall capacity.</p><p>There is a return to services plan.  Obviously, it is completely contingent on what the virus does, which is contingent to some degree on how we quickly we can roll out vaccines.  I do not know the specific case but we are aware that across our system, be it with regard to GPs, hospitals or our primary care or social care side, we are challenged in terms of being able to deliver all of the services we had been delivering.  There is a plan to get us back to a level of service.  </p></speech>

As a Deputy, I am aware of a significant number of people behind the scenes who are crisscrossing by phoning GPs asking whether they can take them in because they cannot get to their local GP.  We appreciate there is significant strain but as the administrative body for the GMS, I want the HSE to get that picture as well, namely, that it is not all just essential healthcare and that people are losing out on some employment opportunities because their local GP is unable to take them.</p> <p>  In general terms, I always was of the view that someone who had a medical card would, by and large, receive a free hospital stay or that it would be largely subvented.  However, it has come to my attention that in St. Camillus's hospital, Limerick, to where many people from the southern part of my home county of Clare occasionally have to go as patients, medical cardholders are being charged a weekly stay rate of &euro;179.  That might not sound too high compared to other hospitals but it is rather high when one factors in other things.  One constituent with whom I am dealing had to stay there for three or four months following a stroke.  This person is on a low income and has a medical card but he left hospital facing a mammoth bill that he and his family do not know how to pay.  Are there many cases like that where there is still a payment for hospital stays, regardless of whether or not the person has a medical card?  </p></speech>

It is of key importance to people in the mid west that some clarity is brought to bear on this because it is quite a hefty fee to face after a hospital stay in St. Camillus's hospital, which has been there for over two centuries.  It took a lot of us by surprise to hear that a charge has been set for people when they are discharged.</p> <p>  I know that earlier in the meeting, Mr. Ryan outlined the review of medical cards.  Is there an algorithm for the sample of medical cards - the 20% or so that the HSE reviews each year?  Some cases merit review because people's health situations or incomes may change but is there an algorithm or trigger that initiates a review?  For many people, it is fine but for others, certainly people of a certain age category, it can be a huge stressor to find out that the medical card upon which they lean so heavily is under review and is under threat of being taken from them.  What are the criteria or what is the algorithm used to select the 20% of cards that are reviewed each year?  </p></speech>

We do not review cards <i>per se</i>.  It is a very small random sample of cards of the order of 100 per month.  We review cases where there have been protected disclosures in the same way as would the Department of Social Protection when information is sent to us as a protected disclosure.  Other than that, when cards are due to expire, we go through them.  We have data sharing agreements and legislative underpinning for the sharing of information with the Department of Social Protection and Revenue and we try to identify from those systems people who will clearly hold their cards.  We also try to identify all the individuals who got a discretionary card and we try to exclude them from reviews.  I would say that we select out 80% of what we are left with, rather than selecting 20%.  That will obviously vary month on month.  Between 64% and 80% would be selected out depending on the month of the cards.  We try to avoid reviewing people who are over 80 because we do not want to upset that cohort and most of those individuals will have had their medical cards for a long time so we age stream it as well.</p></speech>

It might be in the review correspondence people receive but it needs to be explained a bit better.  In normal times when politicians are holding clinics, people appear saying that they have received a letter from the HSE telling them that their medical card is under review, telling us that their situation had not changed income or health-wise and asking how on earth it could be up for review.  It needs to be a lot clearer.</p></speech>

Ms Halliwell and I have a small team working on our communications.  There was a time when the vast majority of reviews were actually reviews.  As time has moved on, we only review a small proportion so we are planning to change the communications we send to take some of the threat component out of it.  They should be more along the lines of telling people their medical card is due to expire and to prevent their medical card from expiring, they should please make sure they have submitted the following information.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for all their contributions.  They were really helpful.  The witnesses heard many members express their concerns regarding backlogs, waiting lists and the frustration of many people with a medical card due to the difficulties they have in accessing services.  The message from the committee would be that if at all possible, we should take steps to reduce waiting lists, address some of the concerns that medical card holders have and look at those who feel let down by the system and that they are outside or in the grey area where they are not eligible to apply.  I thank the witnesses and all their staff for all the work they have done, particularly during this difficult time.</p></speech>

We have been used to seeing each other on screens for a long time, so it is great to have the opportunity to meet face to face in public.</p> <p>  Today, we are continuing our pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Electoral Reform Bill 2020.  After this meeting we will suspend for 15 minutes for our private meeting on correspondence.  Apologies for his absence have been received from Deputy Duffy.</p> <p>  We are joined remotely by the witnesses, Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin, head of public policy in Facebook Ireland Limited, and Mr. Ronan Costello, senior manager of public policy in Twitter.  Their opening statements have been circulated to members.  I will invite our witnesses to make their opening statements and then members will be invited to ask questions.  Members' questions and answers will be limited to five minutes.</p> <p>  On privilege, members attending from their Oireachtas offices are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their participation in this meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines or place at which Parliament has chosen to sit, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  Witnesses and members are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. &Oacute; Broin to make his opening statement on behalf of Facebook Ireland Limited.</p></speech>

I am head of public policy for Facebook Ireland Limited.  I will start by saying that Facebook very much welcomes the Government&rsquo;s intention to establish an electoral commission and its objectives of modernising electoral law and safeguarding election integrity.  As members may be aware, Facebook has made significant changes to its services to increase transparency, to prevent interference and to remove misinformation in the context of elections.  In addition, Facebook continues to collaborate with organisations worldwide that are working to strengthen democracy, good governance and election integrity.</p> <p>  We recognise that the desire to introduce greater regulation and transparency in online political advertising has been a focus in Ireland for several years.  The introduction of the Private Members&rsquo; Bill on the subject in 2017 led to the Open Policy Forum on Political Advertising in 2018, in which we were very pleased to be invited to participate, in addition to the consultation at the time.  It is also important to highlight the role which Irish parliamentarians have played on the International Grand Committee on Fake News and Disinformation, working for the past few years with colleagues in parliaments across the world to identify solutions.  From an Irish perspective we were particularly pleased that our vice president of content, Monika Bickert, was invited to attend the session held in the Seanad in November 2019.</p> <p>  Facebook has reviewed and analysed the general scheme with great interest but also, at times, with some concerns.  Our detailed written submission was provided to the committee on 23 February.  In that submission, we summarised Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to protect democracy and election integrity, before noting our views on the draft provisions concerning online political advertising.  In this statement, as requested, I will focus only on the regulation of online political advertising, which is dealt with in Part 4 of the Bill.  For ease of reference, we have included a summary table of our position on the heads in Part 4 in annex 1 to this document.  In addition, as it is likely to be of interest to the members, we have included the executive summary of our submission to the media committee on the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2020 as annex 2.  Given the amount of engagement that has taken place on the issue in Ireland, we would be interested to see the regulatory impact assessment which was prepared on this aspect of the Bill and, in particular, the reasons the approach outlined in Part 4 of the general scheme was deemed optimal.</p> <p>  As an overarching point, it is Facebook&rsquo;s belief that online political advertising rules and standards should be harmonised across the EU to the extent possible.  We are concerned that enacting these provisions at this time will lead to a lack of alignment between the requirements which exist during electoral periods in Ireland and the year-round EU wide rules for political advertising which the European Commission intends to introduce via the European democracy action plan and the Digital Services Act.  We understand that the Commission intends to publish a legislative proposal for political advertising in the next six months.  There is, therefore, a real possibility that online platforms could find themselves under two inconsistent regulatory regimes and placed in the undesirable, and avoidable, situation where they would have to choose between violating Irish law or violating EU law.</p> <p>  Second, if the committee is of the view that this part of the general scheme should rapidly progress, despite the concerns expressed by Facebook and others, we strongly recommend that a principles-based approach is adopted.  This would give the electoral commission the power to engage with companies and other stakeholders to promote ongoing innovation and improvements, while at the same time delivering on the Government&rsquo;s stated objective of achieving transparency in online political advertising.</p> <p>  Regarding the specific wording of the proposed legislation, it seems appropriate to start with the definition of a political advertisement.  Facebook recommends a more objective definition of online political advertising.  At a minimum, the legislation should take account of what online intermediaries such as Facebook can and cannot do.  In  short, we can identify whether an advertisement contains certain content, but we cannot divine the intention that an individual has in placing an advertisement.  The reference to "political purpose" should be replaced with a far more objective test.</p> <p>  Moving to the actions required of online platforms, we have a broad range of concerns with the requirements set out in respect of the transparency notice.  These include privacy concerns about the scope of information regarding an individual which is intended to be shared and the impact of disclosing specific micro-targeting criteria.  We also have practical concerns about the appropriateness of online platforms collecting information about the amount spent on content creation and the requirements for advertisers to provide an end date for a campaign.  Finally, we have concerns about the reporting obligations set out in this head and question whether they are proportionate or indeed necessary in all circumstances.</p> <p>  The appointment of a responsible person deserves significant attention.  The general scheme provides for a complex system of oversight to be overseen in the first instance by a responsible person appointed by the online platform.  The appointment of the responsible person moves the responsibility and onus of providing accurate and complete information away from the buyer, who holds the information, and onto the online platform.</p><p>Our concerns in this regard are far-reaching.  It seems far more straightforward for the relevant regulatory body to have the power to simply engage with the online platforms and directly investigate any and all of the issues which these heads appear to be attempting to resolve.</p><p> As a final point, I know that a broad range of issues which are not currently captured by the general scheme, such as misinformation and cybersecurity, have been discussed during the deliberations of the committee.  In light of the volume of regulation for online services which is emerging at EU level and the existing and new Irish regulatory bodies which may be required to implement these measures, it may be of benefit to consider how the proposed electoral commission would interact and engage with some of these, including the digital services coordinator which will be required under the digital services Act, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s existing cybersecurity agency.</p><p>I again thank the Chair and members for inviting me to speak.  I look forward to the discussion and hope to be able to answer as many questions as possible from members.</p></speech>

I am a senior public policy manager for Twitter in Europe.  I will first provide our observations on the general scheme of the Bill and then outline some key elements of our election integrity work.</p> <p>  Twitter is an open and public platform.  Our singular mission is to serve the public conversation.  The public conversation on Twitter is never more important than during elections.  We are a global service and we strive to think globally, so every year is an election year.  We take what we learn from each election cycle and use it to improve our election integrity work worldwide.  Policies that were developed prior to the European Parliament elections in 2019 were improved for the US Presidential election in 2020, and on it will go through 2021 and beyond.  We daily build on our efforts to protect the public conversation and enforce our policies against deliberate attempts to mislead people and manipulate our platform.  Partnerships with industry peers and civil society, as well as political parties and government officials, are critical to our success and it is in this context that we welcome today&rsquo;s dialogue.</p> <p>  Twitter shares the fundamental objective of the Bill.  We want to make elections more transparent, encourage accountability and promote an honest and informative civic conversation.  We welcome the proposed establishment of an electoral commission.  In countries where we have worked with such a commission, such as the UK, our experiences have been very positive.  Having a single point of contact is helpful for everyone involved.  During the European Parliament elections, we channelled our engagement through a dedicated election team.  When the process concluded, the director-general of the directorate for communications in the European Parliament reached out to express appreciation of this work.  </p> <p>  As regards the definition of "political purpose" currently provided in the Bill, there is a remote chance that the day-to-day campaigning of non-profit organisations and NGOs may be captured in the scope of the legislation.  Additionally, this definition may capture apolitical voter education and engagement campaigns that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the newly-established electoral commission would seek to run.  We respectfully submit that such categories of promotion should not be subject to the requirements set out in the draft legislation.  This would likely bring unforeseen and unintended consequences.</p> <p>  In October 2019, Twitter decided to prohibit political advertising outright.  We took this step based on a belief that political reach should be earned, not bought.  We cautioned that the effects of algorithm-optimised and micro-targeted political messaging present new challenges to civic discourse which are not yet fully understood.</p> <p>  As regards Twitter and elections generally, prior to an election the public policy team co-ordinates a period of preparation.  We connect with political parties to provide an overview of our policies.  We work around civic integrity, as well as sharing practical tips with them for staying safe on Twitter.  We also engage with parties and the relevant electoral authorities to ensure the right support channels are in place to escalate concerns and report any perceived violations of our rules.  This external outreach is complemented by the gathering of a cross-functional internal team of experts who work on elections.  </p> <p>  Our civic integrity policy is a recognition of the responsibility to protect election conversations from interference and manipulation.  Under the policy, we prohibit attempts to use our service to manipulate or disrupt civic processes, including through the distribution of false or misleading information about the procedures around voting.  Core to our work around civic integrity are our efforts to strengthen Twitter against attempted manipulation, including malicious automated accounts and spam.  The fight against malicious activity and abuse has been significantly augmented by our continuously improved capacity to leverage machine learning to recognise these harmful practices.  Through machine learning, we can detect behaviour-based signals that help to scale our moderation efforts.  Our capacity to deploy these techniques now means that more than one of every two Tweets that is removed for violating our rules has been proactively identified without requiring user reports. </p> <p>  We also recognise that addressing harms associated with misinformation requires innovative solutions.  Content moderation in isolation is not particularly scalable.  This is why we have sought to be creative in pioneering new approaches to labelling harmful content and experimenting with community moderation.  Labels help us to clarify that a claim may be disputed and then we can link to more authoritative sources. </p> <p>  Finally, Twitter supports regional and global regulatory alignment around technology legislation.  We urge consideration of existing initiatives that have provided a structure for regional standard-setting and co-operation, including the EU code of conduct on disinformation, the upcoming democracy action plan and the digital services Act.   As debate around the world focuses on how to solve public policy challenges related to our online environment, the approach of Twitter to regulation and public policy issues is centred on protecting the open Internet and we welcome any dialogue with policymakers that advances this goal.</p></speech>

The Bill seeks to regulate political activity during election periods.  My first question is for Mr. &Oacute; Broin in particular as Facebook permits political advertising.  Does it believe that a year-round system would be more appropriate?  I ask Mr. &Oacute; Broin to address the creation of custom audiences and the SIPO requirement to apportion costs spent during the year in terms of being reused during a campaign.</p></speech>

The rules we have in place apply all year round.  We try to provide as much transparency as possible.

Through micro-targeting and spending on advertising pre-election, it is possible to create custom audiences within Facebook which then can be used during the election period.  As such, in reality, unlike other media such as print advertising or radio advertising which have their benefits immediately during the campaign, online advertising offers a different opportunity to create audiences that then can be used during a campaign.</p></speech>

It is the case that one is able to create a category of interest that one would use to target specific advertising.  However, coming back to the point around spend, etc., what we show on the ads library is the amount that is spent on the ad in delivery, that is, when it is being seen by people on the platform.  We do have a point around the whole issue of content creation which seems very difficult to capture for us as a platform.  That may be something that individuals or political parties could report directly to SIPO.</p></speech>

My argument is that it would strengthen the Bill if the regulation were year-round because of the nature of it.</p> <p>   Mr. &Oacute; Broin raised concerns regarding privacy, the collection of data and the engagement of the commission with Facebook rather than it being transparent.  I would argue that a voter has not just the right, but the responsibility to see what is happening during an election, and that it would not be enough for the commission to be able to engage with Facebook.  It needs to be something that is visible.  If I see a leaflet with which I disagree, I should have the right to see the source of the leaflet.  Equally, the same should apply for Facebook.</p><p>Does Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin agree that the personal details of anyone participating in an election campaign should be displayed?  </p></speech>

That is why we have built the ads library that applies year-round.  In respect of the detail about an individual, it raises privacy concerns.  I know that the deputy commissioner appeared before the committee last week and he said it would be possible to build a system that was safeguarded and put processes in place to mitigate the risk.  That work on the data impact assessments required may be ongoing in the Department.  Based on what we can see in the general scheme, it raises privacy concerns.

We are saying there is a more straightforward way of doing it.  We will provide the name of the person and all the details regarding the ad, but it may be more appropriate to provide an individual's home address directly to the regulator.  We have seen examples in recent referendums where there have been highly emotionally charged debates where it might not always be in the public interest to have an individual's home address available online.  It is just a question of balance and we are just saying that the home address issue raises privacy concerns.  It obviously it will be a matter for the legislators to decide where the balance is in that instance.</p></speech>

This Bill permits providing online political advertising to a content provider, which clearly states it is not in the news space, yet we ban political advertising on radio stations, which are often very good-quality local and authoritative sources of news.  I believe there is a discrepancy there.  Following what Twitter has told the committee, does Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin believe there is an argument to ban online political advertising?</p></speech>

We do not believe that banning political ads is the answer.  We believe that greater transparency in political advertising is the answer.  Can an argument be made regarding radio and television?  They are different types of media and perhaps the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland would have a view on that.</p></speech>

Facebook's submission to the committee is very disappointing.  The proposition in the legislation is incredibly modest.  All it is proposing is that for the three or four weeks of a general election campaign, election ads or ads that are designed to have an impact on the electoral outcome should be designated as such; information about the way in which those ads are being targeted and funded should be made public; and there should be an onus on the platform that publishes these ads to take responsibility and ensure that the advertiser is compliant with the law.  Those are basic propositions.  I am concerned that Facebook is proposing to the committee watering down what is already a very weak proposal.  I want to put that on the record.</p> <p>  I agree that we need to get the definition of political advertising right, as NGOs and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties have highlighted.  I do not see how Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin's definition addresses any of those issues.  In fact, subsection 3 includes most of the areas about which NGOs and human rights organisations would seek to be able to advertise.  Why does he believe his definition, as outlined in annex A, is better than the Government's?  In other words, what could the Government's definition capture that his does not?  </p> <p>  At no point in the general scheme are data protection concerns mentioned, nor does it mention anybody's home address.  It refers to a name and postal address, but election agents and election posters often use an office address.  Some of us might have used our county council addresses when we were elected councillors.  In the same way that candidates' and-or election agents' information is made public, I do not see why it should not be the case here.  </p> <p>  Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin made a spurious argument by stating that the regulations on postering are different and less onerous than microtargeting.  However, when a candidate spends five times more money on posters than anybody else, we see the posters on the streets and the lampposts whereas there is not public visibility on microtargeting.  Therefore, I do not see how that is a valid concern.  I ask him to give a bit more detail on that.  </p> <p>  My biggest concern relates to Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin's comments about head 122.  He seems to suggest that rather than Facebook having a responsibility to ensure that people, who place ads on its platform and from whom it profits, comply with the law, it should be the responsibility of the electoral commission.  Only when there is - I quote the Facebook submission - "persistent refusal or non-compliance with warnings" would it reach an escalation.  That suggests that people would be able to break the law and persistently be non-compliant.  Facebook would profit from it but at some point, because of its warnings, it would escalate to the electoral commission.  That seems to absolve Facebook of any responsibility for the content on its platform.  I do not see how having a person responsible is anything other than a natural safeguard.</p> <p>  Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin keeps describing Facebook as an intermediary, but ultimately his company is profiting from the ads that any of us places.  Like Deputy McAuliffe, I place ads on Facebook.  As Facebook is profiting from the ads we place, there should be an obligation.  I ask Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin to address some of those concerns and I may come back in the next round if there is time.  </p></speech>

I think we are arguing that the provisions should be more effective and should give the regulator the appropriate tools with which to engage with companies such as ours to establish the practices that are in place and also to be able to react and adapt to any new threats coming down the road.</p> <p>  Regarding our approach to the definition of social issues and electoral political ads, I had a quick look at the ads library this morning.  It contains ads from NGOs and from companies dealing with sustainability, sustainable energy etc.  We believe all that influences the democratic process here and that is why we require those individuals and organisations to go through those steps and measures to put it into the ads library so that everyone can see what the ad is, who is paying for it, the categories of targeting that were used, what the spend range is and other details on the ad.  </p> <p>  That is the point on definition.  How that is different from what the Government is suggesting?  It is not clear to us what a political purpose ad is.  It is one thing to say it contains content about social issues, electoral issues or political issues and that is a far more objective test than trying to figure out what the intention of somebody behind the advertisement is.  That is the point we are making.  It is moving from the subjective to a more objective test. </p> <p>  On the point of microtargeting, the releasing of the targeting criteria is the main thing academics have been calling for since 2016 or 2017.  We have real privacy concerns over releasing the targeting criteria within the EU.  However, we are not saying that we have privacy concerns, and that we are just throwing our hands up and saying we can do nothing about it.</p><p>We have been engaging with the European Commission in recent years and with academics at a European level to figure out what would work-----</p></speech>

At a high level, that is what the concern is.  We are working with the European Digital Media Observatory, which was set up by the European Commission as part of its efforts regarding the code of conduct on disinformation, to figure out what a code of conduct would look like under the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  To return to what the deputy data protection commissioner, Dale Sunderland, asked last week, what are the frameworks, protections, risk mitigation measures and processes that need to be in place to release this information?  That work is ongoing.  We are not averse to doing it.  We have released the data in the US and I can share the link for that, but we have a concern about privacy.</p></speech>

I have read with interest, as I am sure all members have, the points made by the witnesses in their submissions and there are some good ones in respect of harmonising EU and Irish law in this area.  While that should certainly be considered, it is not a reason not to have more transparency in regard to online advertising and to where the money for that advertising comes from.  In an earlier response, Mr. &Oacute; Broin stated that greater transparency is the answer.  I compliment Facebook on its ad library because it introduces an element of transparency to political advertising in this country by identifying where individuals or organisations that run adverts on behalf of parties or politicians are located.  Although we know the location of these administrators, however, we have no idea who they are, how much they spend on behalf of parties or politicians or where the money comes from.  As we heard at last week's committee meeting, the Facebook ad library was designed for the US, where it is okay for individuals or organisations to spend unlimited sums on behalf of politicians or parties, but that is not okay in our jurisdiction.  I do not believe that spend is being captured on the ad library.</p> <p>  I have a few short questions on which I would appreciate yes-no answers.  Will the representative from Facebook confirm that if I approve an individual or organisation to place adverts on Facebook on my behalf, this ad spend is not accounted for on my ad library but only on the ad library of the person I have approved?</p></speech>

We know that these platforms are in demand.  I will not share too much detail with the committee, but I took the time to check out the Twitter and Facebook accounts of all Oireachtas Members.  What I found is very interesting.  Many members will be familiar with the type of engagement that happens and many people will have been impacted upon negatively by that engagement.  It is significant that representatives of Facebook and Twitter are with us this morning.</p><p> The public conversation regarding Twitter and Facebook, particularly in the context of elections, is fundamental.  Content influences decisions, be they good, bad or indifferent, based on misinformation, false news or wrong motives.  That is the reality.  While Facebook and Twitter are unique and powerful, they are also potentially very powerful instruments to be used to abuse people and the political process.  That has to be a concern for anyone who represents the democratic parliament.  Every day, we are having these conversations, but particularly in an election, they determine the outcomes.  That is a really important point.</p><p> I would like to ask two questions because I want to hear more from Facebook and Twitter.  They arise on foot of the opening statements.  My first question is to Mr. &Oacute; Broin.  He mentioned the danger of online platforms such as Facebook finding themselves under two inconsistent regulatory regimes in terms of EU and Irish law and stated that Facebook has been dealing with this issue in the context of Brexit.  I am familiar with Brexit and the challenges it poses for the North, the South and the Border area.  Surely, Facebook has found itself in a similar situation in the past.  If so, how did it handle it?</p><p> My next question is to Mr. Costello.  He rightly stated that we have not fully realised the dangers of the algorithm-optimised and the micro-targeted political messaging on social media platforms, as referenced by previous speakers.  In Mr. Costello's opinion, what steps could a body such as the proposed electoral commission take to offset some of these negative affects and the phenomenon in an Irish context?  I would appreciate it if the witnesses could give me relatively concise responses.</p></speech>

Given that it is only six months away, it seems more prudent to us to hold off to see what the requirements at EU level will be.  At that point, the electoral commission or the Houses of the Oireachtas could decide whether they go far enough.  Electoral law will always be a member state competence.  It is that question of alignment, particularly in view of the fact that the European Commission has said it proposes to provide for transparency in political advertising across the EU.</p></speech>

Part of it is to counter the proliferation of disinformation with respect to the electoral process.  If the electoral commission is the entity for Ireland that verifies results, counts and so on, Twitter would, for example, take its lead from the commission if someone were to tweet that a count had gone one way when it had actually gone the other or that a result had been declared in favour of one candidate, whereas the electoral commission had declared in favour of another.  Based on the electoral commission's determination, we could then take it as an authoritative source in considering whether to label tweets and, through that labelling, whether to direct our users to more authoritative sources such as the electoral commission or a credible news platform.  That is one way we could foresee Twitter working with the electoral commission.  Another parallel might be the work we are doing with health organisations around Covid-19, where we have escalation routes for them to send us links to content that they believe is violating Twitter policy on harmful misinformation with respect to Covid-19.  An electoral commission could have a similar relationship with Twitter, where it would have an escalation route to us and could share with us what it believes to be violations of Twitter civic integrity policy around information that is misleading people in the context of how they engage with the electoral process and the outcome of electoral votes.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions arising out of submission from Facebook, in particular annex 1.  Mr. &Oacute; Broin said Facebook has difficulty with the definition of "political advertisement" and it is seeking a stricter definition to be applied to it.  I note from the Twitter submission that it has a comprehensive definition of "political content". Would a tightening up of the definition of "political advertisement" satisfy the concerns of Facebook in that regard?</p></speech>

Facebook could apply that same objectivity based on the definition applied by Twitter and inclusive of the suggested definitions of what it should include, as set out by Mr. &Oacute; Broin.  It is an issue that can be overcome in the context of this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.651" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021033000002#E00800"><p>Absolutely.  As an overarching point, we believe the Bill should progress and the electoral commission should be established.  I do not think there is anything insurmountable in the concerns we have in regard to online political advertising.  We can come to a solution on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.652" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021033000002#E00900"><p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; Broin.  We will now move to head 122 and the concerns regarding the appointment of a responsible person.  The term "responsible person" as set out in the in the heads of the Bill is a term already provided for in the Electoral Act as being a person in authority within either a third party or the accounting unit of a political party.  Its inclusion in this Bill may be considered necessary to ensure consistency with the existing electoral code.  As I said, the term "responsible person" already exists in the Electoral Act.  The concern of Facebook appears to be that there are substantial privacy and commercial confidentiality issues with the appointment of that responsible person if it is a third party.  It could be included in the contract advertisement that the responsible person will be appointed and it may be a third party?  It is possible to overcome this issue as well.</p></speech>

Where an advertiser provides information to us, we can provide that to the regulator, and if there is any question or cause for concern on the part of the regulator it can follow-up and investigate with the advertiser.</p></speech>

If we were to go with Mr. &Oacute; Broin's suggestion that a responsible person should be just a point of contact, namely, a mere conduit that bears no responsibility.  There has to be a responsible person appointed.  Mr.&Oacute; Broin spoke about developing a reporting mechanism where persistent refusal or non-compliance would trigger greater enforcement.  He must be aware of the timeframes involved here.  Surely, we would be outside of the electoral cycle if we were to go with what is suggested by Facebook.</p></speech>

We have touched on that already.  It comes back to the question of providing the transparency and putting the material into the ads library such that not only the regulator but all stakeholders can engage with it and see what is taking place.  We are happy to report to the regulator as required.  When it comes to any question on inconsistencies or, as mentioned by others, sources of funds and so on, we see that as a role for the regulator to play, not the platforms.</p></speech>

He is concerned about what happens if he already has a business relationship.  If there is an existing business relationship, which then tries to submit political advertising, that would trigger this aspect of the Bill.  There can be an existing relationship but if it gets into political advertising, as defined, then it would trigger that aspect of the Bill.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Broin think that is a way of dealing with this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.657" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021033000002#F00200"><p>To come back to where we are coming from on these provisions, if the principles are set down in the legislation for what the regulator is tasked with doing, the regulator is then empowered to engage with platforms such as ourselves to ensure we are complying with those principles.  For example, the legislation provides for transparency in online political advertising.  Many of the issues that arise in heads 121 to 125, inclusive, are then avoided, but two things are still ensured.  The objectives of the State are met because one is ensuring there is regulatory oversight of the transparency of online political advertising but also that the regulator can evolve its approach, and can require companies to evolve their approach, in the face of emerging threats.</p></speech>

Like other committee members, I read the book by Christopher Wylie, who was a whistleblower for Cambridge Analytica, <i>Mindf*ck</i>, a couple of years ago.  He clearly detailed his experience working for Cambridge Analytica in respect of misinformation, voter turnout suppression, campaigns and the targeting of sections of society already under-represented because of voter suppression campaigns, which is a terrible use of technology and social media to target people who are already disempowered.  The end result of that misuse of technology and social media platforms is that people were less empowered again following the electoral process.  Mr. Wylie was doing this work in 2013 and 2014, so it is not particularly new.  He went through the detail of how micro-targeting was used to build audiences and heighten their fears, anxieties and prejudices over time.  I recommend that anyone who has not read the book read through it or even read <i>The Guardian</i>articles he wrote about it.</p><p>My question is specifically for Facebook.  Given there have been terrible consequences from the misuse and abuse of micro-targeting, which has been done through social media platforms, is the cleanest, safest way to deal with safeguarding electoral processes, and safeguarding against manipulation and voter suppression campaigns, to simply ban micro-targeting during political debates, campaigns and elections?  What is Mr. &Oacute; Broin's view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.659" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021033000002#F00400"><p>As a company, we have learned an enormous amount since the timeframe referenced by the Deputy.  We do not agree that banning micro-targeting is the correct approach.  We agree that ensuring there is transparency in what is happening in spending on political advertising and, in our case, social, electoral and political issues, is the correct approach to take.  As I mentioned in a previous response, we are committed to finding a way to work with academics to release more of that data once a framework has been established to do so within the EU.</p> <p>  Much of the discussion on targeting is on the negative side.  I ask that consideration be given to the upsides of targeting in political campaigning.  We have seen incredibly positive uses of our tools and services across the world through ensuring that all players have access to tools to spread their messages to interested audiences.</p></speech>

Some of the very sinister practices that have occurred over previous years have been around micro-targeting.  Mr. &Oacute; Broin referred to the positives of micro-targeting in identifying specific audiences and giving them specific information and messages that other audiences cannot see.  He might elaborate on why he feels there are positives in micro-targeting and why transparency alone is enough to deal with that.  Can he give some positive examples of micro-targeting because I have outlined some of the negatives around it?</p></speech>

At a geographic level in Ireland, we have constituency boundaries.  It is obviously of benefit for candidates to be able put a message into a particular constituency.  That is just one example.</p></speech>

If I take out a targeted advertisement in my local newspaper, it can be seen by anyone, from a small child starting to read up to the oldest voter.  It is targeted but it is not micro-targeted.  I am not picking people out based specifically on age, demographics, class, different interests and so on.  There is a difference.  I have no issue with targeting.  Of course, it makes sense for people to get an advertisement in the Dublin region, or in a Dublin or Waterford constituency, but there are concerns about the picking out of particular segments, and the manipulation and lack of transparency around that.</p></speech>

If one takes the health messaging at the moment, different messages are appropriate to the over-75s compared to the under-25s when it comes to Government messaging on the health measures currently in place.  There are positive, totally appropriate ways of using targeting based on demographics.</p></speech>

From the perspective of the social media companies, Liz Carolan, who was in front of the committee last week, and academics such as Dr. Jane Suiter, the one issue that comes across is that the Bill is, perhaps, too limited and too prescriptive.  We need a dynamic electoral commission, involved and able to keep up with technology and the different methods more nefarious actors involved in online advertising will be able to exploit going forward.  In that respect, the heads of Bill are perhaps too limited.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin stated, it is quite a conservative change.  I am not sure it will be able to keep up with the changing face of online political advertising.</p> <p>  I agree with Facebook when it states the Bill is not fit for purpose, but perhaps not for the same reasons.</p><p> Within the longer submission supplied, there was talk of privacy concerns about identifying natural persons.  Last week, we questioned the deputy Data Protection Commissioner who said he considers that the definitions involved in that do not give rise to any privacy concerns.  Perhaps Mr. &Oacute; Broin can outline why he thinks that is the case.  I am not sure if he saw the representatives from the Data Protection Commission.</p><p> In terms of aligning this legislation with the European Commission's regulations that are coming down the road, what parts do the witnesses think we should include in the Bill?  Can they suggest a type of electoral commission that is outside the terms of this Bill?  What principles would they prescribe in the Bill for an electoral commission?   I ask because people across the board have identified the necessity for the electoral commission to evolve as opposed to how it is in this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.666" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021033000002#G00200"><p>On the privacy point, yes, I had the opportunity to see the session last week, and we both have had the opportunity to see previous sessions as well.  As a general point, I thank the members for the amount of time that they are giving to the pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation.  To come back to privacy concerns, we are looking at a general scheme which we believe requires identification.  We said there are privacy concerns in terms of that, and we outline that it is not, in our view, appropriate to legislate in this space until all of these issues have been taken into account.  I refer to the evidence from the Data Protection Commission last week.  The witness phrased it as &quot;not <i>per se</i>&quot; and that it would be possible if one put all of the appropriate safeguards, data protection impact assessments and all of the requirements around those provisions.  That is fine but what we are saying is that there would seem to be a more straightforward way that would not figure the privacy concerns on that particular point in terms of the address.<br/><br/>Overall, the first point is to make sure the office of the regulator is appropriately staffed and resourced.  I think that is very important and should not be lost sight of.  It is possible to set down in legislation that the role of the regulator in this space will be to ensure transparency in online political advertising and not, as I said previously, go into the level of detail that is currently provided for in the general scheme.  For example, one could have a statutory code, in that once there has been engagement with online platforms, academics, etc., the electoral commission would codify it in statutory code, which sets down the requirements that online platforms should meet.  That would allow the online platforms to build, and to continue to build and innovate, the products and services that we have, and that are different, right across our own platforms and the other platforms that would be involved in the space.<br/><br/>In terms of the point made about what the European Commission is doing, it may be that what is announced by the European Commission in six months is not satisfactory to the legislators here or to Government.  That is okay as Ireland, as a member state, has the power and competence to legislate for electoral law.  Is it just a case of asking, given that that is only six months away, would it be more prudent to wait to see what is in that legislation before progressing with these measures as they are?  There are a number of things in there.  Ultimately, what we want in this space is an effective regulator to engage with and to continue to innovate and improve our services and provide transparency.  That is the objective here.</p></speech>

I know that it is not easy, especially when doing things virtually but such is the world.  The witnesses are probably more used to interacting online than we are.</p><p>I share the concerns as expressed by most members and witnesses here today about the online political advertising element of the electoral reform Bill being just limited to the election period.  The media commission and EU laws will regulator year-round content.  I also appreciate that, from the perspective of the witnesses, it would be an awful lot easier if there was seamless alignment between what we propose here, through the electoral reform Bill, and the media commission and EU regulations.  From our perspective, what we are tasked with is what is in the interest of the common good and not what is necessarily easiest.</p><p>As both Facebook and Twitter have their European headquarters in Dublin, there is a huge opportunity for us to be the leaders on this issue.  I wish to acknowledge the leadership shown by Facebook when it comes to transparency through its own public ad library.</p><p>I have a question for both of the witnesses.  From a Twitter perspective, I ask Mr. Costello to talk us through Twitter's engagement with the EU electoral commission during its election cycle and perhaps, in part, any learnings that he thinks Ireland could benefit from.</p><p>I seek an assurance from Facebook that it will be able to respond to this legislation from a workforce management perspective.  Last week, the vice-president of integrity at Facebook said on his blog:</p> <blockquote> 	To address this challenge, we&rsquo;ve built a global network of more than 80 independent fact-checkers ... When they rate something as false, we reduce its distribution so fewer people see it. </blockquote> <p>That is 80 out of 52,000 employees worldwide or 0.15% of the workforce who are currently tasked with fact checking.  I am quite concerned that this law will place additional responsibility on Facebook to monitor political advertising.  That is money being spent by political parties and politicians to shape and influence democracy so this is extremely serious.  I seek an assurance from Facebook that it will be able to respond appropriately and that it will be able to flex its workforce management plans so that it not just reduces content that is illegal but removes it.</p><p>I would like to pick up on a question asked by my colleague, Senator John Cummins.  Perhaps Mr. &Oacute; Broin might shed some light on the matter.  The Senator asked about Facebook page managers.  The example was given of a page with 11 Irish managers, seven managers from the UK, two from Serbia and one from Germany.  It would be helpful if Mr. &Oacute; Broin indicated what Facebook managers can do with political pages.  Can they administrate discussions on the forum?  Can they post on behalf of people or are they in control of advertising?</p></speech>

The elections in 2019 were in late May and we started talking to the Parliament team in September of the previous year.  The team is apolitical.  It is tasked with ensuring that the elections go off without a hitch, that the process is constructive, and that the dialogue is as informative as it can be.  The benefit is that it is one project team speaking to another project team.  Each of us has a single point of contact.  We both know who to contact so there is an escalation route.  In September, we began a conversation.  Around November, a cohort from Dublin, including myself, went to Brussels to join our colleagues who work in Brussels full-time, and we gave a training session to all available MEPs and their staff on Twitter safety, trust and safety expectations that they could have, and our rules, policies and escalation routes, etc.</p><p>That work continued from there, right through from November 2018 until the election concluded on 26 May 2019.  As I said, the benefit of that throughout was that there was no ambiguity as to who to reach out to in the event of X.  That would be the constructive advantage of an electoral commission in Ireland.  </p></speech>

We agree that Ireland has an opportunity to show global leadership in effective regulation, not just of online political advertising, but of a whole range of other issues.  Harmful online content is also central to that.</p> <p>  I want to make a few points.  Our strategy on misinformation is threefold: remove, reduce and inform.  What the Deputy has referred to concerns the reduce piece.  Those 80 she referred to are not Facebook employees.  They are 80 employees of third-party organisations that we work with to whom we refer content that has been flagged as possibly being false.  Those organisations carry out checks on whether the content is true.  In Ireland, Journal.ie is the third-party fact checker.  That is where that figure of 80 comes from.</p> <p>  Ensuring the integrity of democratic processes and elections involves a much broader group of people right across the company.  I believe there are around 40 teams involved in this work.  To give the committee a sense of the amount of content we remove, between October and December 2020, we removed 12 million pieces of content from Facebook that were misinformation which could lead to physical harm.  In that same period, of the content, 167 million pieces of content that was rated as false by fact checkers was reduced in its circulation. </p> <p>  On the issue of page administration, the central point is the person who is running ads in Ireland must be in Ireland.  There are other activities such as moderating discussions and using the safety tools we put in place for page administrators to moderate discussions on pages themselves.  The Deputy also mentioned commenting.  That is all possible as a page administrator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.671" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021033000002#H00300"><p>I will direct my questions to Mr. &Oacute; Broin.  It is important for committee members to be very clear.  The Digital Services Act does not deal with elections.  Elections are the exclusive preserve of member states.  Therefore, if I understand it correctly, the Digital Services Act provides the basic set of rules that should operate around digital transparency and accountability across the EU.  However, because each electoral process is different, every member state is absolutely within its rights if it wants to set a different, higher or specific set of requirements during elections.  I agree with Deputies Higgins and McAuliffe.  I would much prefer it if it was more than just the four weeks when it comes to the financing.  We agree on that.</p><p>Rather than, as Mr. &Oacute; Broin's statement disingenuously suggests, people having to choose between violating Irish law or violating EU law, because I would hope Facebook never chooses to violate any law, there would be compliance with both sets of laws - the general Digital Services Act as it applies in ordinary times and, in any individual member state, any specific additional requirements the legislators in that jurisdiction feel are necessary to protect the integrity of their state.  Just so we are clear, it is important for people to understand that the Digital Services Act does not actually deal with elections.</p><p>On the issue of microtargeting, the issue is not geographical targeting, just to go back to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's point.  It is data mining and the use of it without the knowledge of the people who are being targeted with the advertising.  For example, when I get microtargeted by Amazon, it is on the basis of the data it has mined from whatever books I have viewed and browsed on Amazon.  I have never knowingly consented to that data mining or indeed Facebook's use of that.  Obviously, when I signed the 75-page consent document when I signed up to Facebook, there was implied consent, but there are all sorts of problems with that.  That is why, for example, the European Data Protection Supervisor has argued for action on this and therefore greater scrutiny and possible banning.  I would be interested in Mr. &Oacute; Broin's view on that bit of it because I do not think anybody is talking about the geographical targeting of ads.</p><p>In Mr. &Oacute; Broin's comments on page three of annexe 8, my reading of what he is proposing in terms of the suggested change to head 122 is that Facebook would have no responsibility for ensuring those who are advertising during an election, and from which Facebook is profiting, are legally compliant.  All it would have is the responsibility, through a point of contact, to share information with the regulator and its job would be to enforce compliance.  Will Mr. &Oacute; Broin confirm that that is his position.</p><p>Some important points were made in our previous session about changes to the way in which online operators operate and the kinds of tools that are at their disposal.  There was an interesting article in <i>The New York Times</i>in December of last year that mentioned Facebook withdrawing what was referred to as its &quot;news ecosystem quality&quot;, or NEQ, which is an algorithm for prioritising more informed and reliable sources rather than less informed and reliable sources, which was in train during the election and withdrawn afterwards.  One of the big issues here is how we all will know if new tools are introduced or withdrawn and how they are captured.  They are also particularly relevant to electoral integrity.  What transparency mechanisms does Mr. &Oacute; Broin propose in respect of that?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct to state that the Digital Services Act, DSA, does not, as far as I know, seek to provide for transparency in political advertising.  What it will do is provide an EU-wide baseline for all advertising.  The European Commission has also said, however, that through the European democracy action plan, EDAP, it intends to introduce a separate legislative instrument which will provide for transparency in political advertising on an EU-wide basis.  We expect that to appear in the next six months.  The DSA provides the baseline for all advertising, but the EDAP will be a legislative instrument which introduces requirements for transparency in political advertising across the EU.</p> <p>  I accept the point that electoral law is a member state competence and the organising of elections falls under electoral law.  It would seem to us, however, given this instrument is just on the horizon, that we should at least wait to see what it is or what its scope is going to be before bringing in these detailed provisions at this time.  I do not want to suggest to the committee and I know it has spent a long time on this already, but it may be helpful - I do not know - to hear from the European Commission as to what its plans are in this space.</p> <p>  On responsibility and compliance, there is no issue with taking responsibility for getting details from an individual and putting them in the ads library.  It is once it gets beyond that into the sources of funds and all of the other matters which are considered beyond that that we will take information from the individual who is looking to run the ad and, if there are investigations etc. beyond that, that we see it as a role for the regulator to play.</p> <p>  On the point of tools and changes, we make announcements where there are changes to any of our tools which require notifications to the appropriate regulator  Obviously, we engage with the Data Protection Commission on an ongoing basis in respect of any changes we make to products and services, as appropriate in the EU.</p></speech>

Is Mr. &Oacute; Broin saying the platform should or should not have that responsibility?  The regulator obviously has its parallel responsibility, but should there not be some responsibility on Facebook to endeavour to ensure that an advertisement is legally compliant with the provisions of the Act?</p></speech>

I am saying there is a more effective and efficient way of doing that to ensure we take on our correct responsibility.  However, we also see that there is a crucial role for the regulator to play here rather than this third party model.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.675" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021033000002#J00300"><p>Just to be clear, Mr. &Oacute; Broin is saying Facebook's sole responsibility would be to furnish information to the regulator, which would then have sole responsibility to ensure compliance.  Facebook would have no responsibility to ensure compliance in the case of, for example, a politician placing a non-compliant advertisement on its platform.</p></speech>

If the law or the code requires us to check the identification or passport of an individual, we are obviously responsible for doing that.  It is the model of oversight that I am trying to make a point about.  I am not sure this third party model is fit for the online world.  It would seem far more appropriate to set down what our roles, responsibilities and obligations are under the law and that this third party would be replaced by more direct involvement by the regulator.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. Costello.  I appreciate that Twitter's has fewer users in Ireland than Facebook.  I understand the figure is less than 1 million people.  I also understand that in recent times Twitter has taken more direct action to remove bots and trolls.  How many accounts is Twitter removing in Ireland every month?</p></speech>

That would include all violations of Twitter rules and the information is broken down by rules.  If we were talking about platform manipulation and spam, for example, which would be co-ordinated inauthentic activity, bots if one likes, those kinds of figures could be found there every six months, depending on the nature of the report.<br/><br/>This figure is not up to date but as an example, around 18 or 24 months ago, we were challenging between 8 million and 10 million accounts globally each week.  Challenging means that something about the sign-up process with particular accounts was setting off flags.  I mentioned earlier that we are leveraging machine learning to be better at detecting behaviour-based signals.  Machine learning flags were tripped and an account would be challenged.  It is based on the suspicion that it is an inauthentic or spam account, which is likely therefore to engage in inauthentic behaviour on the platform, perhaps in co-ordination with other accounts and-or as part of a network.  If the challenge is not met by an account and it does not prove that it is being operated by a real individual and that person has not had accounts suspended previously, the account in question will be automatically suspended.  There was a significant volume of such actions globally around 18 or 24 months ago.  There is still a significant volume weekly but it is not as high as it was.  I suggest that is evidence of our enhanced capacity to deploy those machine learning techniques to address this sort of behaviour.</p></speech>

To put it simply, does Facebook fact-check political advertisements?</p></speech>

We believe it is right that political speech should be seen and should be scrutinised more than it already is by placing it in an advertisements library.  It is important to make the distinction, however, that this does not mean anything can be said by a politician in a political advertisement.  Hate speech, for example, is not allowed, nor is suppression of voting, election turnout or that type of behaviour.  A whole range of content is not allowed.  As a general point, we do not fact-check and we do not send political speech material to the network of fact-checking organisations I spoke of earlier.</p></speech>

It oversees the decisions made and it is the final arbiter of the decisions we are making regarding content.  The board is also going into other areas and recommendations, and we are engaging with it on those.  It comes down ultimately to the question of who should be the arbiter of what the truth is when it comes to political speech.</p></speech>

That is for another day, however.  I am going away now more uncomfortable than I was when I came in.  I say that particularly regarding Facebook and its representative.  I have two simple questions.  Whenever we talk about a fact-checking or watchdog-type body, individual or team, we must always ask who will watch the watchmen.  That is a profound question.  Who will watch the watchman?  What mechanisms do Twitter or Facebook have in place for oversight and accountability?</p><p>That is something about which we need to hear.  Have the witnesses individually, or the organisations they represent, in this case Facebook and Twitter, personally, professionally or as a collective in terms of those organisations, been involved in any lobbying in regard to this legislation?  If so, with whom?  They might share that with the committee.  I ask that question because it is important.  There is nothing wrong with lobbying and it is a regulated profession.  However, it is important, as a committee doing pre-legislative scrutiny in regard to this legislation, that we should know.  I would like to hear what views the witnesses have and what their engagement has been with lobbying the political institutions, in particular politicians in Leinster House.  I want to be specific about my questioning because I have thought about it and I have knowledge about it.   Specifically in regard to this Bill, can the witnesses share, either as individuals or on behalf of the organisations they represent, what lobbying they have been involved in?</p></speech>

For example, with regard to our innovations around labelling of harmful and misleading information, one of our motivations for doing that is to give primacy to, and to promote content from, authoritative sources.  For example, when we label content around elections and we say that this claim about the outcome of an election is disputed, we are basing that on the outcomes and the statements of the electoral commissions.  In the recent presidential election in the United States, for example, it could be a state or county board, or something like that.  One of the reasons we are doing that is not only to make the users&rsquo; experience on Twitter better or more reliable, so they are getting good quality information rather than poor quality information, but also because we would hope that it buttresses and reaffirms faith in those institutions that have oversight of these processes.  We are relying on their determinations and want to give them primacy on our platform.</p> <p>  With respect to our own oversight and accountability, I will give an example.  The policies we develop, be they around misleading information, abuse, harassment or hateful conduct, are developed in collaboration with our global trust and safety council, which is a collection of non-profit organisations, typically NGOs, expert groups and sometimes individuals who are experts in their respective areas.  They say to us, for example, that we do not have a policy on something and we should have a policy on it, or that our policy on it is lacking and it is not taking account of trends in this particular area, and that we need to do some development work on it.  That is an external body.  All of those engage with us independently and their feedback is very candid.</p></speech>

In addition, we realise that external oversight of our systems is incredibly important in establishing and building trust.  This year, an independent third party has responded to a request for tender to carry out an audit of our systems and services right across the world, the systems and services we have in place to protect and keep users as safe as possible on our platforms.  It is the first time it is being done. That might feed into the approach that is going to be taken under the digital services Act to establish whether, at the systems level, the company is doing what it should do.<br/><br/>In respect of lobbying in regard to this legislation, the first we heard of it was in<i>The Irish Times</i>article in early January.  We held a meeting with officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We had not established our position at that time and wanted to understand what was the timeframe.  We have since put together the written submission of 23 February, which all committee members have.  We sought to engage with members of the committee and to have individual meetings with members of the committee in the run-up to this.  We were not aware this hearing would happen but, obviously, the committee has our opening statements and all of the details.  That will all be reflected in the lobbying register the next time the reporting is due.</p></speech>

I have one remaining question.  European regulation of online political advertising would provide harmonisation, and I can see why multinational companies would rather have that framework than a different framework in each country, for operational reasons alone.  The difficulty is that different countries allow different levels of donations.  For example, on this island we have two different jurisdictions, one with almost an uncapped donations system and the other, in the South, which, to be fair, bans corporate donations above &euro;100 and caps personal donations.  When one limits the amount of money in politics, the exploitation of the tools becomes less serious but when there are uncapped resources, that is a difficulty.  I would argue that while European regulations are important, we need to specify for each particular country and each democracy.  Our voting system is unique, with the exception of Malta.</p> <p>  My question is for Twitter.  We have talked about paid political advertising.  I believe the allowing of anonymous accounts on Twitter also prevents transparency around the spending of money in politics.  Yes, that can happen on Facebook but it is far more obvious on Facebook when an account is fake.  I believe the anonymous accounts on Twitter allow a disgusting and horrible culture of trolling on Twitter, and I do not understand why Twitter would allow that to continue.  I have continuously called for anonymised accounts to be banned, and I do not know why Twitter allows it.</p> <p>  It would also prevent paid political operatives operating multiple anonymous accounts, which prevents transparency as well.  If I am paying for election posters to be erected or leaflets to be delivered, people can see that.  However, if I am paying people to troll other people on an account, that cannot be seen.  I am not saying that is happening but that it is very possible under the current system.  Anonymised accounts facilitate that, and I cannot understand why Twitter allows those anonymised accounts on its platform.</p></speech>

One of the reasons that has not changed is that the policy was developed and has evolved in consultation with human rights groups.  For example, groups like Civil Rights Defenders, Access Now and Front Line Defenders are based in Dublin and all of them represent human rights activists across the globe.  One of the reasons we allow the pseudonymous accounts, and one of the reasons I mention the human rights groups, is that that particular feature of the platform is vital in environments, contexts and countries where it is dangerous for that kind of activity to be carried under one&rsquo;s real name because one can be identified and may be apprehended, and so on.  We see this context and we see this use case arising more and more as the political situation in countries across the world deteriorates and regresses into a form of a illiberalism.</p><p>Pseudonymity on Twitter is one way for folks who oppose that developing illiberalism to push back on it and to do so not altogether with safety but perhaps in safer conditions than they would be able to otherwise.</p></speech>

I will look at the link that Mr. Costello referred me to by way of an answer to my first question, but I am concerned that it will not give me the answer I am looking for.  I will come back to Mr. Costello, if that is okay, because I would like specific answers on that.</p> <p>  My thanks to the Facebook representative for participating today and for making the submissions.  We need to recognise the big divergence between how Facebook is approaching this issue and how we are approaching it in terms of trying to protect the fairness and freedom of our electoral process.  Facebook has 2.4 million users in Ireland and the company is saying there is no fact checking.  The submission suggested Facebook did not want any responsibility in terms of compliance with advertising and regulatory standards for political advertising.  Facebook has the tools to demonstrate and contribute to making our democracy stronger.  I urge Facebook to work with us in the coming months to try to ensure that we can get the maximum out of the tools it has to enhance our democracy.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.707" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021033000002#L00400"><p>My thanks to the company representatives for being here today and for the answers we have received.  Last week we heard a good deal about the precautionary principle.  When it comes to this, I believe the horse has bolted with regard to the use of social media.  Advertising is no longer what influences political discourse.  Rather, it is the posts and the use of social media.  Where we increasingly regulate paid advertising, what we will see is an increase in the non-paid activities and activities that are encouraged by the platforms represented here today and other platforms.  The more outrageous content is and the more eyeballs the companies get on screen, the easier it is for them to make sellable advertising for micro-targeting, even outside of the political arena.  There is a business model at the back of all of this.  We have heard all the platitudes and the niceties about political discourse but behind all of this is a business model that drives as many eyeballs on screen as possible to sell advertising.  I believe that this section of the Bill is fiddling while Rome burns, to be honest.</p> <p>  Professor Nathanial Persily of Standard University has written extensively on the idea of the dangers posed by social media and the things valued by the companies.  Velocity, that is to say, the speed of communication is one.  This has a tension with democracy.  A well-timed lie immediately in advance of an election can gain a national audience long before it can have the opportunity to be rebutted.</p> <p>  The second is the idea of things going viral.  The primacy of what goes viral is what is emotive and outrageous.  Consequently, democratic discourse is not well served where there is a chase for the outrageous.  The outrageous is less well regulated, and positively encouraged in some instances by suggesting that people join other groups or join groups of similar interest.  We have incentivised eyeballs on screen and what we have overall is a coarsening of public discourse as a consequence.</p> <p>  Anonymity is another point.  It is some years since I set up my Twitter account so I had forgotten the process.  Last night, for the craic and to see how easy it was, I set up a Twitter account under a different name.  All that was necessary was a mobile telephone.  In doing that there is no accountability in place.  There is no obligation for me to identify who I am.  There is an opportunity to spread lies, misinformation and disinformation from within and without the jurisdiction and, consequently, influence political discourse in advance of an election.  The professor goes on to speak about the monopoly held by platforms and the challenge to the circumstances where social media posts are made worldwide.  We have seen that in social media being managed from other countries.  That is a problem for sovereignty and a problem of oversight and of governance.  In light of this, Twitter says it is encouraging civic participation and dialogue.  Facebook is a flag-waver for free speech.  To be fair, Facebook is taking positive steps.  However, cyber-scientists have shown maps of trolling and pile-on activity and have confirmed that there are instances where this is co-ordinated or orchestrated for political purposes with a view to suppressing content, silencing people and influencing discourse.  Both platforms represented before the committee promote that or sit by and allow it to happen.  How do the companies expect us to regulate that?  What are the comments of the company representatives in response to that?  The provision in this Bill is absolutely not fit for purpose.  It is too narrow and does not protect our democracy.</p></speech>

It is the case that a person can have a pseudonymous account.  A user need not use a real name on Twitter for the reasons I outlined in my first answer.  The second point is that, regardless of the name or handle of the account, the enforcement actions that we take against accounts is the same no matter what.  If a person is abusing or harassing someone under a pseudonym or engaging in a spam operation where a person is trying to develop momentum around a particular hashtag or topic such that it gains inorganic primacy on the platform, then we will enforce our rules in the same way against that pseudonymous activity as we would if the person was operating under a real name.  The enforcement outcome is the same no matter what.  I hope that it clarifies our approach on this.</p></speech>

The fact is that anonymous parties with no accountability or transparency in respect of who they are, their political leaning, where they are or otherwise get to influence the discourse.  We can look at anything that is trending in Ireland on any evening.  If we follow in through it, there are accounts and the promoting of particular hashtags that put out information that is false, that misrepresent how people are elected in Ireland and what is valued in people being elected or that misrepresent the proportional representation system.  There are people behind this who do not put up their names and who promote misinformation and disinformation about Irish politicians.</p></speech>

One of the benefits of Twitter being a public platform is that rebuttal can be done as publicly as the sharing of disinformation.  Someone can quote-Tweet in respect of a piece of disinformation that the person believes to be disinformation and say it is entirely wrong and include a link to the correct source, whether the Electoral Commission or a news organisation like Reuters or AP.  If that rebuttal is done using an account of a journalist who is verified and who has 20,000 followers, it will have a larger impact on correcting the record than an pseudonymous account that is part of a low-scale co-ordination network that may only have 50 or 100 followers.</p></speech>

It makes reference to watching social media companies talk about their content management and how they are so quick at removing posts while the person is constantly told that an anonymous troll account, which routinely calls the person a terrorist, has not broken any rules.  That same experience has been encountered by journalists and female politicians in particular.  I have had queries come back to me stating that the company will not remove the content or take action because it does not correspond with the values of the company.  All the while the misrepresenting of democracy in Ireland is continuing on the platform and the coarsening of public discourse is being facilitated.</p></speech>

The reason I am here today is that I have taken a great interest in transparency on these platforms since my election to the Oireachtas.  I wish to follow up on what my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, said.  With all due respect to Mr. Costello, under no circumstances do I accept the accept the excuse that Twitter is somehow liberating oppressed people in different parts of the world and that is why it is necessary to have anonymous accounts.  That is total and utter BS.  It is a nice, fluffy answer.  Instead, the anonymous accounts are dishing out some of the most horrific abuse on the platform.  Every time I pick up my telephone and see Twitter notifications I get pangs of fright and fear about what is next.  It is the same for every politician.  I would not be on Twitter if I did not need to be for work and politics reasons.  It has reached the stage where I believe it is beginning to undermine our democracy.</p> <p>  Twitter is 15 years old and I do not buy the case that this is how Twitter started 15 years ago.  Political discourse on Twitter has changed.  Ten years ago, Twitter was a wonderful platform where one could engage with people who had different viewpoints.  One could engage in and have respectful debates.  That is gone out the window now.  It makes zero sense to have anonymous accounts that can be set up with five different emails for five different accounts to target politicians, journalists such as Aoife Moore or members of civic society.  That is how pile-ons are orchestrated.  The point is that there are only so many times one can be called every word under the sun before it rolls off one's back.  It is different for some of us because we are used to it.  However, if social media companies are allowed to continue with this type of political discourse, we are going to lose some potentially really good young people from politics in Ireland.  An amount of people ask me why I even got into politics given the abuse I receive online.  They say they would run a million miles from it.</p> <p>  That is the problem with this, and it is why I believe platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are undermining democracies.  I do not buy their reasoning that they maintain anonymous accounts because they can unveil corrupt places in far-flung parts of the world.  I am referring to anonymous accounts in this country.</p> <p>  As regards Facebook, my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, is quite correct.  By the time disinformation spreads on Facebook, the horse has bolted and it is too late to rebut it.  If one tries to rebut something, there is the Streisand effect whereby one is making a bigger story of it by trying to rebut it.  When one of us rebuts something that could be completely false, that is then in the newspaper.  It is the Streisand effect, so it is not in our interests to try to rebut fake news about us as individuals or the like.</p> <p>  The other point is that there has been much discussion today about what we are doing to fact-check politicians and political parties, but what are we doing to try to fact-check the public?  What is becoming a thing now in elections is that in the seven days before an election, which could be a crucial or tight election, people are going on Facebook, Twitter and other online sites to undermine candidates.  The new form of online political campaigning is to try to smear candidates.  A former Deputy is now suing Facebook and Twitter for damages because of completely unfounded lies that were put forward about him in the lead up to the last general election.  Fair play to him for taking it to the High Court.  I commend him on that.  The point is, however, that the damage was done.  The issue is that people see it online and believe it, due to the age-old concept that there is no smoke without fire.  There should be a direct link whereby somebody can go to Facebook.  The person should not have to go through a lengthy court process, only for somebody to say that he or she put it up as a lie and did not mean it.</p></speech>

It is unacceptable in this day and age.  If online banking apps have the capacity to be able to verify identities, there is no reason that online platforms cannot do it.  To return to my original question to Facebook relating to advertising, what I am concerned about is outside interference in our democracy.

I agree with Senator Seery Kearney, but the responsibility to legislate is here.  If people want, for example, anonymised accounts or micro targeting ended and better regulation of these platforms, we legislate for it here.  There is no use in Government Deputies coming here and complaining that there have been 15 years of failure in self-regulation by the industry when we know self-regulation in many other areas has failed.  The challenge I put to the Deputies and Senators, and I accept their sincerity because I share many of their concerns, is to regulate.  If they will not do that, people will question their sincerity when they come here to rail at platforms for not regulating when that is our job.  Beyond this Bill, which we all have accepted is very limited in its regulation of online advertising, there is clearly a bigger job of work for this House to do.  I believe members would have willing partners across the Chambers to regulate platforms properly to deal with all these issues.  Let us go and do it.  Then we will not be asking industry to regulate itself because we will have taken our responsibilities as legislators seriously.</p></speech>

There are great positives with social media, but what has happened over time is that social media has been hijacked by bullies and organisations with hidden agendas and that want to attack people.  A party colleague of mine has been attacked constantly by one person on Facebook over a period of years.  She has not been able to do anything to stop these attacks.  As others have said here today, they are not the only people affected by this.</p> <p>  People should have the right to freedom of expression but they cannot be allowed to bully, harass and attack people.  Facebook must use its moral compass to do something to protect people.  Anonymous accounts are unregulated.  Facebook and Twitter are huge companies.  We have seen what has happened in the US.  Surely, they have learned lessons that they can put in place in a country like Ireland, where we have a much stronger democracy and people have the right to be protected. </p></speech>
