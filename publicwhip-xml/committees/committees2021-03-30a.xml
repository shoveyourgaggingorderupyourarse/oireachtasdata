    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#A00200"><p> Apologies have been received from Deputies Nessa Hourigan and Sean Sherlock.</p> <p>  I welcome everyone to our online meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.  I ask that committee members confirm their location before contributing in order to ensure that they are adhering to this constitutional requirement.</p> <p>  Today we engage on the topic of bogus self-employment with Mr. Martin McMahon, who appeared before the Joint Committee on Social Protection of the previous D&aacute;il to discuss this matter.  We requested submissions from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, in advance of this meeting.  I welcome Mr. McMahon.  When we begin to engage, I will ask members and the witness to mute their microphones when not contributing in order to ensure that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are in silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  If, therefore, their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.    In that regard, I have reviewed the opening statement and note that there are some instances where there are references to unlawful acts on the part of the State.  I would assume that, in making such references, Mr. McMahon was in fact referring to a misinterpretation of the law by the various parties rather than deliberately stating that they were unlawful acts.  Allegations of deliberate illegal activity are not in order and not to be permitted during the course of the engagement.  It is on that basis that we will proceed.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister, or of the objectives of such policies.  They are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  We are operating on the basis of limited time because of Covid-19.  We are tied to two hours so, as detailed in the invitation, Mr. McMahon has five minutes to make an opening statement.  We welcome that he sent in a concise one to the committee.  I will give him a reminder of the time after four minutes.  He is very welcome and I ask him to proceed with his statement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#A00400"><p>Go ahead.</p></speech>

Normally, when we have witnesses before us they are from agencies of the State and we question them in a fairly robust way to try to expose things we believe need to be exposed.  Mr. McMahon is here before us not in that capacity and, as a result, I imagine that our questioning will not be in that same vein.  Unfortunately, we have rebuttals from a number of State bodies and two member organisations which have different views.  We are in the uncomfortable situation whereby we almost have to present the rebuttal that has been put before us and I am not sure any of us want to be in the business of putting forward the case of State agencies.  That is for them to do.  Will the Chairman clarify if a number of those agencies will be before the committee or is this the only opportunity we will have to discuss this matter?  I am uncomfortable with having that rebuttal in writing but not having people here to allow me question them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#A00600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will answer the last question first.  It is entirely in the hands of the Committee of Public Accounts to decide if it wants to call some of those agencies to appear before it.  On the first question, we ask the Deputy to use his discretion.  He is entitled to put the points made by Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and ICTU to Mr. McMahon but I ask him to do it in a respectful and constructive way.  It is a matter of treating the witnesses with respect, as is normal.  The Deputy is entitled to ask those questions and is welcome to do so.  With regard to whether this is the only opportunity to discuss the issue, I am entirely in the hands of the committee on that one.  If the Committee of Public Accounts decides to bring in some of those bodies, which I hope we will do, that is entirely in our hands.  Is the Deputy okay with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#A00700"><p>I suggest that we do not treat the witness as normal, particularly as we are usually quite robust with our witnesses.  Mr. McMahon is raising genuine concerns and he is presenting his view on the matter we are here to discuss.  It is up to us to then question the agencies on it.  I do not believe us questioning Mr. McMahon in a robust way is the way to deal with a whistleblower or somebody who is trying to raise those issues.</p></speech>

Employment status must always be decided on the applicable law and the individual circumstances of each case.  Despite agreement from the Revenue Commissioners that each case must be taken on its own facts in accordance with case law, the Revenue Commissioners have openly admitted to the Committee of Public Accounts that this is not what happens in practice.  This contradiction between what case law demands and the State's misclassification, which in my opinion is contrary to existing law, was perfectly highlighted by the Revenue Commissioners in its reply, which states: "Revenue&rsquo;s position is that each case is individual and needs to be considered on its own merits."  Yet, what Revenue has told the committee it has been doing for more than 30 years is that "In the interest of uniformity Revenue decided to treat those couriers as selfemployed."</p> <p>  In my opinion, the State is granting illegal state aid, in the form of a PRSI exemption, to selected employers based on a misinterpretation of the law.  It is a tax break which puts compliant employers at a distinct economic disadvantage and denies employees all their rights as employees.  The mechanisms used by the Department of Social Protection and Revenue are unlawful test cases.  That a number of these group-class test cases exist was confirmed in writing by the social welfare appeals office on 9 January 2019 when it wrote: "On occasion over the years the approach of having 'test cases' has been taken or considered by the Social Welfare Appeals Office."</p><p>That test cases are unlawful was acknowledged by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection on 25 March 2019 in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which stated:</p><blockquote>	The Minister is also looking at changing legislation to permit deciding officers to make determinations on the employment status of groups or classes of workers. </blockquote><p>That test cases are unlawful was further confirmed in a letter dated 9 May 2019 from the Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the Committee of Public Accounts, which stated: </p><blockquote>	There is no legislative provision which provides for appeals officers to make decisions on the employment status of groups or classes of workers who are engaged or operate on the same terms and conditions.  </blockquote><p>In September 2000, the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts wrote to the Secretary General of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and requested to know why all couriers were classified as selfemployed by default by the Department.  In his reply, the Secretary General stated: </p><blockquote>	A number of representative 'test cases' were selected in 1993/94 for detailed investigation and formal insurability decision under social welfare legislation.  This process resulted in a decision by an Appeals Officer of the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 12 June 1995 who decided that a courier was selfemployed.  The Appeals Officer's decision established the criteria in relation to the employment status of couriers that has, since then, been generally accepted throughout the industry and also by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes </blockquote><p>The Department, in accepting the unlawful precedential test cases, which are specifically precluded by case law but that were created by the social welfare appeals office, and in using those precedential test cases to classify thousands of workers as selfemployed by default, is the biggest creators of bogus selfemployed workers in the State.  Both the current Minister for Social Protection and the former Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection have stated on record that the use of test cases was replaced by a code of practice that issued from an employment status group in 2000.  Former Minister, now Senator Doherty, in a reply to a parliamentary question, stated:</p><blockquote>	The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that the discussion in relation to the use of 'test cases' before the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection on 5th December 2019 related to a particular set of circumstances dating back to the early 1990s where a number of cases involving a number of employers in a particular sector were selected as so called 'Test Cases'.  This approach was a precursor to the subsequent development on a tripartite basis of the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or SelfEmployment. </blockquote><p>As proven in the reply from the Revenue Commissioners to the Committee of Public Accounts, the use of test cases never stopped.  The true factual position is that the decision from the employment status group, ESG, as recorded by the Communications Workers' Union, which was present in the ESG, was that it was the view of IBEC, the Department of Finance and Revenue that the <i>status quo</i>should prevail.  The <i>status quo</i>was that where a worker had a disagreement over his or her employment status, he or she can take a case to the High Court.  It does not matter what case a worker makes to the scope section, the defined policy of the State is to overturn any scope section decision that threatens test cases, regardless of evidence and case law, and to force the worker to go to the High Court to challenge his or her employment status.  At the same time, wealthy industrialists can classify workers as selfemployed, <i>en masse</i>, in private hearings, in free secret courts such as the social welfare appeals office or over lunch in the Burlington Hotel, as happened with couriers.  This is the code of practice that IBEC took back to its clients.  This is the code of practice Revenue enforces on workers to this day.  It is also the code of practice that the social welfare representative at the ESG took personally to the social welfare appeals office.<br/><br/>The <i>status quo</i>is the use of test cases continues to this day.  ICTU has calculated the loss of PRSI and taxes to the State from the construction industry alone at approximately &euro;240 million per year.  Extrapolating from this figure across all sectors results in an annual loss to the Exchequer in excess of &euro;1 billion every year.</p></speech>

The first thing I want to ask relates to test cases.  Mr. McMahon's submissions to committees over the years seem to have focused on test cases and it has been apparent for some time that the Revenue and the Department of Social Protection have denied that these cases existed.  Now that they have acknowledged that these cases did exist, they suggest that they are no longer in use, having been replaced by this charter.  Can Mr. McMahon indicate whether those historic cases have been implemented and are they still, in effect, being developed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin McMahon" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#B00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  Case law specifically precludes test cases.  Each case must be taken on its own merits.  Revenue has agreed that is the case.  It has also agreed to label all couriers as self-employed based on a decision from a social welfare appeals officer in 1995.  That decision was further clarified to the Committee of Public Accounts in 2000 where the Secretary General stated that a number of test cases were selected.  Revenue has told the Committee of Public Accounts that is why couriers are classified as self-employed to this day.  Are they still being implemented?  Yes, they are.  In 2016, a group of 16 construction workers took cases to the scope section where they were all classified as employees and not self-employed.  That was then appealed to the social welfare appeals office, which voiced its intention to use those 16 cases as test cases.  The 16 individual workers protested profusely that the State could not do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#B00500"><p>Mr. McMahon mentioned the scope section and its cases.  Do we have any idea how many workers win cases in the scope section and how often that happens, once a final decision is made and the employer does not appeal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin McMahon" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#B00600"><p>The Department of Social Protection has not given us any specific number of the number of cases that are overturned by the scope section.  We are told that it is approximately 30%.  We are told that a very small number of cases come through the scope section to the social welfare appeals office.  That is true, as was discussed in the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection in 2019.  There is a reluctance on the part of employees or workers who claimed to be employees to use the scope section because they are afraid of being victimised at work.  That was acknowledged by the Department of Social Protection as the overriding reason workers will not come forward.  The Department uses test cases and it stated as much in the article in <i>The Irish Times</i>to which I referred.  The former Minister, Senator Doherty, went on to say that the Department uses test cases with the agreement of employers and workers.  It is hard to see how one can get agreement from an entire industry of workers from 1995 and apply it to workers right across the board today.  These workers have no idea why they are self-employed and none of them are informed as to why that is the case.</p></speech>

He had seen a draft of a social protection committee report.  Can he give us an indication as to what he thought about that report?  Was it accurate?  Did it acknowledge failings?  Did it give recommendations as to how this matter could be rectified?  Did it give him confidence?</p><p>The report I think Mr. McMahon refers to is the draft report of another committee.  It would be confidential, as of now, but I think Mr. McMahon received a copy.</p></speech>

A number of meetings were held between 2018 and 2019.  I was the penultimate witness at that committee.  I told the committee pretty much what I have told this committee today about the use of test cases.  That does not appear anywhere in the report.  I gave that evidence despite the fact that the social welfare appeals office was asked in afterwards to explain the use of test cases.  None of that made it into the report, it was as though I was never there at all.  Am I satisfied with the draft conclusions?  No, I am absolutely not.  I have until 9 April to send a submission, which I will, to say that I am extremely dissatisfied with its report.  All the people who appeared before me from Revenue, the Department of Social Protection to Scope, none of them told the committee that there were test cases as Revenue has now told the Committee of Public Accounts.  As far as I am concerned, everything that went before my telling that committee that there were test cases is null and void.  It did not tell the full truth and the full truth, as this committee now knows, is that it used test cases.</p></speech>

From the Revenue and Department of Social Protection submissions, it seems they still fail to see there is an issue with the current system.  The question is where we go from here.  ICTU's statement said that the only effective resolution to this long-standing matter is the introduction of legislative measures whereby all workers are classified as direct employees in the first instance until proven otherwise by an employer.  Would Mr. McMahon agree that is really the only way that this can be rectified?</p></speech>

The Department of Social Protection and Revenue are specifically precluded from making group and class decisions by case law.  In the Denny case, a seminal case on bogus self-employment, Mr. Justice Keane was very clear that each case must be taken on its own particular facts; just because one is a courier one cannot say that all couriers are self-employed no more than one can say that of a journalist or doctors.  The Department has admitted that it is doing test cases and using the precedents to label entire industries as self-employed.  Where ICTU is saying that they should be employees by default and the employer should have to prove if they are self-employed, the way it works now is that the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection are classifying workers as default self-employed.  If the worker wants to appeal that decision he or she must go through a process, and that process relies on a worker not being able to overturn the decision.</p></speech>

The definition of self-employment has been an issue on these islands going back to 1860.  Undoubtedly, there are contracts for service which should be contracts of service.  In some cases that suits a worker who should be a direct employee because they perceive an incentive where they might pay less tax in the short term, but what they are doing is depriving themselves of employment rights and PRSI entitlements over time.  I have come across this on many occasions.  There has to be a bigger discussion beyond the view of the Department of Social Protection or the Revenue Commissioners.  There needs to be education on this too.</p><p>I talked about case law.  I take Mr. McMahon's points on the way the Department or Revenue operates.  Regardless of that, common law also applies.  If we look at the definition of a contract of service, and the appalling term, the law of master and servant, all that case law allows a person to raise an issue in the courts.  Mr. McMahon is correct, they say it should be done on a case-by-case basis and they use legal tests, the control test, the integration test and so on.  We know all the famous cases involving the <i>Sunday Tribune, </i>Readymix and so on.  Would it be fair to say that regardless of how agencies operate, it is open for any employee to take a case through the legal process to prove that he or she has a contract of service in the same way as the Uber case in the Supreme Court in the UK, which is likely to be a precedent that we would also recognise here?  That is an option, although expensive, perhaps prohibitively so.  </p></speech>

The way the process here works, as laid out by the Department of Social Protection, is that a worker must make his or her case first to the Scope section of the Department of Social Protection.  Then the employer, and it generally is the employer, can appeal a decision by the Scope section which says that the worker is an employee, to the social welfare appeals office.  If the social welfare appeals office overturns the Scope section decision, which it has done with every single courier case since 1993, then the worker's access to the courts starts at High Court level.  Before the social welfare appeals office existed, Scope decisions were appealed to the Circuit Court directly.  By using the social welfare appeals office, which is acting outside the legislation, it has raised the bar of access to the courts for workers.  It is prohibitive for a worker to take a case to the High Court.</p></speech>

That case was not overturned by the social welfare appeals office.  It was appealed from the social welfare appeals office to the High Court.  It was the State that paid.  That is an important point.  If the social welfare appeals office overturns the decision, it is the worker who must pay in the higher courts, not the State.  That is the basic problem with all this.  It is prohibitive.  It took six years and hundreds of thousands of euro in legal fees for the State to defend the Sandra Mahon Denny case.</p></speech>

If one goes through them, some employees, particularly couriers, fall into the category of direct employees.</p><p>They do not control how, when or where they do their work, they supply labour only, they are paid in fixed hourly rates, they cannot subcontract out their work, they do not supply materials etc.  It appears that some categories of worker meet the test of a direct employee.  We cannot assume, but seeing as how it is likely that that would be the court's conclusion, perhaps Revenue and the Department of Social Protection should recognise the fact now and prevent those within the industry from having to take a long test case.  It was clearly indicated in the Uber case in the UK that the drivers were direct employees.</p></speech>

I believe committee members have with them correspondence from the committee to me.  It says that the code of practice came from the employment status group, which was set up in a rush after I requested a scope section decision on my insurability of employment.  My case was specifically discussed by the group while it was <i>sub judice</i>.  The decision of the group, as recorded by the Communication Workers Union, which was present at the time, was that the<i>status quo</i>had to remain.  The <i>status quo </i>is test cases, which are prohibited by the higher courts.  The code of practice that was mentioned is a voluntary one, not a statutory one.  It has-----</p></speech>

It does not decide case law.  It does not decide insurability of employment.  Only case law does.  The code of practice is a box ticking exercise.  As the committee has seen in ICTU's submission, employment status is not decided by a box ticking exercise.  That is complete nonsense.  The code of practice can mean whatever one wants it to mean.  That the Revenue Commissioners have told this committee that it is on a par with, if not superior than, case law is outrageous.  It is not on a par.  Only case law applies.</p></speech>

Actually, it is the afternoon.  I am an hour behind.</p> <p>  One must ask what happens when things go wrong and people do not have their rights.  We saw much of that after the economic crash, particularly in the construction sector where people had spent their whole lives working, many of them self-employed.  It is only when one sees people reaching their 50s or approaching pension age and finding themselves out of work without an entitlement to a contributory pension that one realises how precarious this situation is for what is a large number of people.  Astonishingly, we have seen a growth in the number of people who are categorised as self-employed even though it is known that their work is precarious.  Do people believe that they really have a choice?  Are the courts a choice?  What should be done?  There will always be some degree of self-employment, but the extent of it now is out of kilter.  Solutions already exist in legislation.  Can they be implemented immediately and how would Mr. McMahon go about doing so?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.49" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin McMahon" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021033000002#D00600"><p><i>Cui bono</i>?  That is an important question.  Who benefits from the fact that the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection, while admitting that bogus self-employment exists, cannot and will not quantify it?  It is not the worker, it is not the pension fund into which employer's PRSI should be going but is not, and it is not the Exchequer, given that less tax is paid by the self-employed.  Only employers are benefiting from this.  If the Department can send social welfare inspectors to look through the knicker drawers of lone parents, it can look through its own data.  It has all of the data.  It simply does not want to look at them.<br/><br/>If the worker has a choice to go to the courts, why do the scope section and the social welfare appeals office exist at all?  They are meant to take the expense away from the worker.  If they cannot do that, they should not exist.  It is as simple as that.<br/><br/>The only solutions are laid out in legislation.  Anything else would require new legislation.  Any decision that is considered unsafe by the chief appeals officer can be set out.  Any use of a test case or any scope decision that has been overturned by the social welfare appeals office on the basis that a pre-existing test case exists is demonstrably unsafe.  It cannot be done.  This means that every case dating back to 1993 must be set aside.  The old process that existed before the social welfare appeals office was set up saw a decision of the scope section being appealed by the employer to the Circuit Court, which was a lesser bar and less expensive for the worker.  We should return to that situation immediately.  All existing and future cases on the insurability of employment that would have been appealed to the social welfare appeals office should be appealed to the Circuit Court.  Under current legislation, if the appeals office finds a case to be too complicated, it can refer the case to the Circuit Court.  Obviously, a case is too complicated for the social welfare appeals office if it does not understand that it cannot use test cases.  Therefore, all existing and future cases must automatically be referred to the Circuit Court.  That is provided for under law.<br/><br/>There are solutions, but these are the ones that must be implemented immediately if we are to be fair to workers.  We cannot have test cases and decisions arising from other test cases.</p></speech>

That would make a difference.  If the Department of Social Protection has stated that it does not feel compelled to act within the legislation, though, what would be the point in making more legislation that it could simply ignore?  The Department, the social welfare appeals office and the Revenue Commissioners have to accept the supremacy of case law.  They cannot ignore it.  Once they accepted it, there would be a purpose in creating legislation.  Until they do, however, there would be no purpose and it would be a waste of time.</p></speech>

I would like some clarification.</p><p>When Mr. McMahon says that the Department is using test cases and a decision is made on a test case, how many people could that test case affect?  If it is a substantial number, is it available to that group for one person to go forward to the court, for instance?  On test cases, there was recently a case in the High Court about the leaving certificate grading system, where many people had issued proceedings but just one case was taken to court for a hearing.  A decision was made on that and that dictated the outcome of the other cases.  Will Mr. McMahon outline examples of where a substantial number of people were expected by one test case?</p></speech>

The Department of Social Protection, Revenue and the social welfare appeals office are making group and class decisions.  They determine employment status by group and-or by class.  No legislation exists to allow that.  Therefore, no legislation exists to allow a group of workers to overturn that case or to appeal that case by group or by class.  There is simply no legislation to allow workers to do that.  This affects thousands of employees.  If one looks at all couriers going back to the origin of couriers as a type of work, going back to the early 1980s, from that time up to the present, all of those thousands of people have been classified as self-employed.  If one looks at construction, where the employer gets to designate employment status and the Department sought to have test cases in 2015, hundreds of thousands of workers are involved, past, present and future.</p></speech>

If there is a group of 100 people, I accept fully what Mr. McMahon is saying that they cannot take a class action, but there is nothing preventing all 100 from filing a High Court writ.  It is not the way I would like to go if there was a better appeals process, which obviously needs to be done by way of legislation.  There is nothing preventing all 100 people in a group entering a writ and one person going forward with a test case, which will dictate the outcome for the remaining people.

I gave the example of the leaving certificate grading system where quite a number of people issued High Court writs but only one case went forward.  In the scenario that Mr. McMahon is talking about, there is nothing preventing a group from issuing individual High Court appeals itself and for one person to then go forward to court with the case.  What is needed is a process to deal with the appeals process rather than having to go into the High Court.  That mechanism is there.</p></speech>

This involved ESB meter readers.  There were five of them and the judge consolidated the case.  That is as close to group or class decisions as one gets.  He made the decision that these workers were not self-employed, as the ESB claimed, and that they were employees.  That was in 2006.  To this day, Revenue and the Department of Social Protection are still ignoring the High Court decision, even though meter readers are in fact and in law employees, they are still classified as self-employed by Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  The problem is that they are simply ignoring the courts and case law.  One can do that, namely, put a group of workers together and get them to go one at a time, and they will still ignore it.  It does not get one anywhere.  They simply choose to ignore it.</p></speech>

Regardless of what the Department of Social Protection and Revenue might outline about the cases, which is not to disparage their specific responses, the issue of bogus self-employment is real.  Anybody who has been out in the real world knows that there are people who are classified as self-employed who, under any basic rationale, clearly are not.  They are working for one employer on a full-time basis for a prolonged period.</p> <p>  I refer to one case that I am aware of.  I have a report here from a person who won a case.  This person was working for a meat processing plant in Cork.  The report states that the person is a line worker for a specific employer so he regards himself as an employee of an agency.  He works for eight to ten hours a day.  He was subject to control and direction.  He is not free to take up similar work at the same time.  It goes further to highlight how this individual was clearly an employee.  However, his employment situation was that he technically worked for a company registered in his name in Poland, despite that he had never been to Poland.  It took six months for this person to get his Scope decision and a further six months to have his decision regularised.  Even then, his PRSI payments were apparently not backdated.  The Department of Social Protection referred to its method, which it is confident in, of catching bogus self-employment through inspections.  In the case I have outlined, there were not any follow-up inspections of that person's colleagues, who one would have to imagine are in the exact same position.</p> <p>  Representatives of Meat Industry Ireland attended the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  They spoke of the use of agency workers and they indicated that the use of agency workers in that sector was actually declining at the moment.  Does Mr. McMahon get a sense that the number of workers who are entrapped into this type of employment situation across all sectors is declining or increasing?</p><p>How many people are involved?  Is the emergence of new types of companies, such as Deliveroo, and workers associated with such companies contributing to an increase in such employment or is it a type of employment practice that is in decline, as stated by Meat Industry Ireland?  </p></speech>

I will take it from the start, and again the question here is <i>cui bono</i>?  Who benefits from this situation?  It is not the State and not the workers.  It is the employers who are using this practice of bogus self-employment to save themselves circa 30% on labour costs.  That is who benefits.  If the Revenue is saying that bogus self-employment is not an issue, it should prove it.  If it is saying it is an issue, it should quantify it.  Otherwise, it is not at this game at all.<br/><br/>On meat processing, what the Deputy is referring to with the agency are intermediary-type set-ups.  Those are what we call the workplace with no employees.  They are moving or being moved to intermediary-type set-ups, as would be used by the likes of Ryanair.  A company with six directors, all of whom are pilots, supplies services to Ryanair exclusively.  As the pilots association will confirm, as far as it is concerned, the pilots concerned are employees.  The practice of setting up an intermediary company to disguise the reality that people are employees is on the rise.  The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has said there are many thousands of these companies out there.  Some of these companies have even received awards from the State for what they are doing.  It is ridiculous.  <br/><br/>On inspections, this is very interesting.  Figures from the Revenue Commissioners on inspections show the number is in the low thousands.  Back in 1998, the Comptroller and Auditor General sent officials from the Revenue out to inspect 60,000 employment situations within the construction industry and they found 12,000 of them to be misclassified.  Two years later, the Committee of Public Accounts, under the chairmanship of the late Deputy Jim Mitchell, did the same thing.  Some 60,000 employment roles were examined and 12,000 were found to be misclassified as self-employed.  That is a huge number.  It was 18% or 19% back in 1999 and 2000.  Now, Revenue is doing at most a couple of thousand inspections per year and is saying it is capturing all the bogus self-employment.  How could it?<br/><br/>What changed was the employment status group.  A decision was made that the <i>status quo</i>must remain and those wide-scale investigations stopped completely.  They have never been repeated in any sector.  The level of bogus self-employment within the construction sector according to ICTU is now 23% so it has not decreased over the 20 years since this last came up in this committee.  It has increased.  </p></speech>

I referred to the meat processing sector because it is often the case that employees or self-employed people in that area happen to be independently working through an agency for a factory, for example, while also renting their accommodation from the same source.  It is not just that these workers' jobs are at risk but also their homes.  Does Mr. McMahon have any evidence or reportage regarding the type of means by which blacklisting occurs?</p> <p>  It occurs to me that-----</p></speech>

I say that because I understand how there could be an element of self-employment in the construction sector.  In many cases, we are talking about small, independent contractors which might need carpenters or labourers for a defined time.  It would not make sense for either party to be involved in an employment contract <i>per se</i>.  However, if we were to set out in legislation conditions to clarify when an obligation falls on an employer to consider someone an employee, for example, a defined period of time, number of hours or number of contracts in an employment, that could provide a means to easily resolve a large proportion of these cases.  Does Mr. McMahon have a sense of what those definitions should be regarding periods of time, lengths of contracts and numbers of hours worked?</p></speech>

It is not just me saying this because the Department acknowledges it and ICTU have stated this in the committee.  Fear of being blacklisted is the major concern.  It has happened in construction and in the case of the 16 workers I represented in the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2016.  I take the Deputy's point on whether some indicator could trigger employment status.  Really and truly, as the Revenue Commissioners have stated, it does not matter whether people want to be self-employed.  The only question is whether the legal criteria apply.  Nothing else matters.  People cannot choose not to pay tax just because they do not want to.  The State is entitled to its cut.  Everybody who gets paid has a contract.  The payer has a contract and it is the State that is entitled, as part of the social contract, to deduct taxes and PRSI.  Just because people do not want to pay tax and PRSI, they cannot use self-employment or bogus self-employment as the out.  It is not as simple as a tick-box exercise, even if Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the Social Welfare Appeals Office are using a tick-box exercise.</p></speech>

I have some questions now but I will allow a second round of questions.  I had to cut some members short to keep the meeting moving but I hope we will get to a second round.</p> <p>  On Mr. McMahon's submission and the matters detailed in the correspondence we have to hand, my concern is that we have one of the lowest rates of employer PRSI contributions in the European Union.  While that is fair enough, if there are discrepancies and the State is not getting its full whack, that is obviously a concern.  There are also concerns about precarious employment.  Some of my acquaintances have been caught in these bogus self-employment situations in construction and it is not very nice.</p> <p>  Most of what is happening seems to rest on the test case in 1995.  I will outline what I know about the case and Mr. McMahon can correct me if I am wrong.  The case in 1995 was taken by a courier who believed he was an employee.  He was classified by his employer as self-employed.  He then appealed that judgment to the scope section of the Department which upheld the decision.  The case was then to go to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  In the interim, the individual in question emigrated because his employment status was precarious at that stage.  At that point, the company, which I will not name although I am aware of the name, stepped in and produced another person who was counted as a worker.  My information is that this person may not have been an actual motorcycle, bicycle, van or lorry courier and may instead have been a director of the company.  His case was put forward to the scope section and it went through to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Subsequently, it was determined that person was self-employed.</p> <p>  I want to be careful here as I do not want anyone named but my understanding is that this is the test case on which rests all the later goings on regarding bogus self-employment and what is being used to explain and defend it at times.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

As the Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection has told the Committee of Public Accounts, a number of test cases were selected.  They do not explain how they were selected.  They do not explain who was involved in the selection process.  They do not explain what safeguards were taken to make sure these were actually representative test cases.  It was not the courier.  The courier went looking for a decision, from the scope section, because he was put forward by the courier industry as a test case.</p> <p>  The question arises whether he was actually representative of couriers.  The courier, who was meant to have been there, has put on record that he was not in the country and had emigrated.  It was confirmed by the general manager of the company that the worker had emigrated.  That begs the question, who actually was in the test case in the social welfare appeals office in 1995 if it was not the courier who was found to be an employee by the scope section?  Who actually appeared?  Because of this secrecy, we do not know.  We do not know which self-appointed spokesman for all couriers past, present and future stood in the social welfare appeals office and said they were happy to be called self-employed.</p></speech>

There is correspondence from the head of Revenue, dated March 1997, which was circulated to all known courier firms, particularly those which were represented at a meeting in the Burlington Hotel on 3 March 1997.

There is no reference other than the Chief Inspector of Taxes at the time asking the company to inform the courier companies to inform the couriers that this was going to go through.  They were not represented nor can anybody say they were represented nor can anybody say a single courier could speak for all couriers past, present and future for evermore.

The first part of the sentence is significant, which says because that person proposes to treat couriers.  We have heard many times this is not a matter for Revenue but one for the Department, yet here is Revenue setting out its position.  It was a participant in the meeting that was held in the Burlington Hotel on 3 March 1997 and there is correspondence from it afterwards that set out its position.  By any fair reading it would seem to me from those pieces of correspondence that Revenue was involved in this process of coming to this agreement, that it was setting out its interpretation of it afterwards and that it was central to it.  That is a concern because, from our point of view on the Committee of Public Accounts, there is the matter of whether the State got what was due to it in terms of the proper classification of PRSI.  Obviously we are also very concerned that the proper PRSI contributions for workers were not clocked up.</p> <p>  If a person who is a courier, who is on a building site or who is in journalism who is classified as self-employed were to a case, there is always a fear of being blacklisted, which happens across society and not just in this country.  It is very much a notable practice in England in the construction industry.  The route people here must go is through the scope unit in the Department of Social Protection, which in general seems to form an objective view.  When a case is lodged with social welfare appeals, however, the problem is an applicant seems to lose due to the 1997 agreement.  Is that the correct analysis of what is happening here?  The scope section may look at it objectively, declare that a person is an employee and is not self-employed, but when a case goes to the appeals section in the Department, that section refers back to the 1997 deal.  Is that what is happening?</p></speech>

Revenue has told the Committee of Public Accounts it is nothing more than a collection agent for PRSI on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  Revenue should not have a view other than it is a collection agent for the Department of Social Protection, but Revenue has told the committee it does have a view, and an historical view, that couriers are self-employed.  That is not Revenue's call.  Revenue does not get to make that call.  That is a social welfare call.  Revenue has overstepped the mark in even having an opinion on whether couriers are employed or self-employed.</p> <p>  Revenue says that for tax and PRSI purposes it has labelled them all as self-employed.  There is no other purpose to be self-employed.  It is only for tax and PRSI purposes.  A person is not self-employed for the purpose of telling bedtime stories.  It is for tax and PRSI.  Revenue has labelled them as self-employed, full stop, regardless of tax and PRSI.</p> <p>  The failure to collect PRSI is what now has us in a pensions crisis.  It is my opinion there is no pensions crisis.  There is a failure to collect employers' PRSI crisis going back over 40 years, which has never been resolved.</p> <p>  I have seen 19 decisions from the scope section.  Of those 19 decisions there is only one that I would say was questionable.  From the social welfare appeals office I have seen 19 decisions.  There is only one of those where I would say it was not questionable.  There is only one where it literally refused to hear the case.  Even though it was appealed, it literally refused to hear the case.  Once it gets into the social welfare appeals office, it is using test cases and precedents set by test cases.</p></speech>

Revenue has distilled all case law and legislation down to four what it calls tick box indicators, which have already been rejected by the courts.  It has set up a parallel system to the courts which does not pay any attention to case law, as we have already seen, and by which literally anybody can be classified as self-employed, and that is what it is doing.</p></speech>

He has interesting observations.  I understand from his opening remarks that he has been dealing with this issue for quite a number of years, so I admire his persistence on the issue.</p> <p>  In terms of the bogus self-employed, Mr. McMahon mentioned couriers, meter workers and journalists, for example.  How prevalent does he believe the overall issue is in society?</p><p>I looked at the NESC report from November of last year and it says it is about 10% of those who were declared self-employed in Dublin and elsewhere, yet in Kerry for example, it was higher, at around 21%, which might tally with Mr. McMahon's earlier remarks about farm labourers, etc.  I am interested in his opinion on the NESC report from November 2020.  I have heard him refer quite a bit to couriers today, but in which other sectors and areas does he believe bogus self-employment is very prominent?  How many workers are we talking about?  He referred to pensions or, in his opinion, the lack thereof, but how many employees are we talking about across the State at any given time?</p></speech>

We also know from ICTU that in construction self-employment is running at 23%.  Construction was at 19%.  We know from the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association that self-employment is rife among some airlines and it is becoming rife among other airlines.  That comes back to the point that it gives a competitive advantage to some companies over others not to have to pay PRSI, holiday pay, taxes or maternity pay.  It is driving down standards.  One cannot compete against these people, so therefore one must do as they do.  It is driving down standards right across the industry.  In a previous meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts when the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, was the Chairperson, he asked the National Transport Authority, NTA, what percentage of its workers were classified as self-employed.  It replied that 50% of its workers were classified as self-employed.<br/><br/>It is very important to understand that the State is the biggest creator of bogus self-employment status and the biggest abuser of existing case law.  If one includes, for example, intermediary set-ups like personal service companies, as they are used in RT&Eacute;, one is looking at many hundreds of thousands of workers.  It is retrospective.  It goes back 40 years.  If it keeps going the way it is going, it will be going for another 40 years.<br/><br/>In terms of what kind of money is being lost, as ICTU told the social protection committee, in construction alone it is &euro;240 million a year and that is a very conservative estimate of PRSI and taxes forgone to the State because of bogus self-employment.  If we extrapolate that across all sectors and include intermediaries such as IT companies then one is easily talking &euro;1 billion a year.  That is a very conservative figure.  Again, it comes back to <i>cui bono</i>, who is benefitting from this, because it is not the State and it is not the workers.  Why can Revenue not quantify it or prove it does or does not exist?  Why is Revenue not doing anything about it?</p></speech>

I look at it from country to country.  I have looked at it in various countries.  If one takes Germany, for example, it has a rate of self-employment which is half our rate while Greece has a higher rate than ours.  Self-employment rates in a country are not an indicator of an entrepreneurial country, having a higher rate is an indicator that there is something wrong in the system.  Nobody is going to tell us that Greece is the best in the world.</p></speech>

Revenue has access to all these figures.  The Department of Social Protection has access to the amount of PRSI taken by each person, so it could tell what company has taken PRSI at what rate and for how long.  There are the indicators.  If one wants an indicator of how many people are bogus self-employed, one can just look at that.  It is a little indicator.  If somebody had been working for two years and his or her 4% of PRSI has amounted to &euro;50 every week, that is a very good indicator that he or she is not self-employed.  It is the same person paying him or her for two years what amounts to a weekly wage, regardless of what way it does the matrix or how the company works this, it amounts to a weekly wage.  They are the indicators.  These bodies can look at all of this information, but they simply do not want to.  That is the problem.  Nobody has a clear picture, although there are indicators of what the picture is.  As the Deputy said, it is up to 25% and as the NTA said, it is up to 50%.  We know it is 100% for couriers and that 23% of construction workers are self-employed.  It is literally all over the place.</p></speech>

They can indicate if they wish to come back in and I will let them speak in that order.  I will ask a question while members are trying to decide on their questions.</p><p>In a reply to the Committee of Public Accounts from Revenue on 3 February, following its appearance before the committee to a question on the basis, legal or otherwise, for couriers to be deemed self-employed, we were informed it is primarily if they work for one company.  We received a long reply which included the lines:</p> <blockquote> 	However, case law has established tests to determine whether contracts are contracts for service (i.e. self employed contractor) or contracts of service (i.e. employee) and generally, these tests are applied to determine employment status along with a review of the evidence available regarding the nature of the relationship.  Revenue&rsquo;s position is that each case is individual and needs to be considered on its own merits. </blockquote> <p>The reason I read that out is that it seems to significantly at odds with the situation in the courier industry where the default position is that couriers are considered as self-employed in the first instance.  Could Mr. McMahon comment on that?</p></speech>

The system is rigged so that the worker simply cannot overturn the decision.  As we have seen, if worker wants to do so, it is a significant and costly process which starts in the High Court and will go to the Supreme Court, because that is what happens.  Is there a remedy for being labelled as self-employed?  No, in practical terms there is no remedy.  It does not exist.</p></speech>

Please provide further details in relation to this case including detailing any associated costs. </blockquote> <p>The reply stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Reference to a &ldquo;test case&quot; regarding bogus self employment amongst couriers had been raised at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Employment Affairs in 2019.  There is no one specific &quot;test&quot; case.  However, couriers were regarded as self employed for PRSI purposes as a result of a Social Welfare Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision. </blockquote> <p>As I understand it, that is one case.  It does not refer to &quot;decisions of&quot; but to &quot;a decision&quot;.  I take that to mean a single case.</p></speech>

How can the Revenue Commissioners say each case must be taken on its individual merits, but they have decided to label them all as self-employed, based on this test case from an appeals officer in the social welfare appeals office?  Both things cannot be true at the same time.  The evidence shows that the actual truth is that they have labelled all couriers as self-employed based on a social welfare appeals office decision.  That decision is clearly described by the Secretary General as a test case.  Both things cannot be true.  Somebody needs to nail the Revenue down on this.  It cannot be true.</p></speech>

It is up to the organisation to decide whether it is retrospective and whether there are tax liabilities.  I am using RT&Eacute; as an example.  Is there any kind of a sanction where misdesignation occurs?  That seems to be something we need to focus on.  Let us suppose the committee arranged a series of hearings to deal with this issue comprehensively, find the source of the problem and get to a point where we actually count because if we do not count, we do not deal with things.  What would be the ideal list of witnesses to get to the heart of the issue and what should be the pecking order?</p></speech>

The director general of RT&Eacute; brought in a private company - not the Department of Social Protection, Social Welfare Appeals Office or the Revenue - to do a scoping exercise because of decades of complaints from within RT&Eacute; that workers are misclassified as self-employed.  More than 81 situations were investigated.  The exercise was limited in scope, only looked back over a short period and those who were looked at were also limited.  Regardless, 81 of those workers were found to have been misclassified as self-employed.  Had the Department of Social Protection done what it should have done and carried out the investigation, no Statute of Limitations provision would have restricted how far back the Department could look.  It could look back to the year dot and declare that a person owes X amount in PRSI.  Eighty-one people in one company is a clear indicator that bogus self-employment is being used as a business model in RT&Eacute;.  Yet, it was only when the Committee of Public Accounts said it would investigate bogus self-employment that the Department of Social Protection issued a statement that it was looking at RT&Eacute;.  It is late it the day to be looking at it now.  Since the State has not looked at it and the Department of Social Protection has not carried out an inspection, there has been no sanction.  These workers, who had been deprived of their rights going back years, were then offered derisory employment contracts that made them worse off than being bogus self-employed.  That should never happen.  A notice should have issued to RT&Eacute; for all back payments to the year dot.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners have told the Committee of Public Accounts that they have no look-through power for intermediaries.  I am not sure whether the Department of Social Protection does.  It may be the case that it does.  I remember something from 20 years ago to the effect that personal service companies had come up 20 years ago and some provision was made so that the Department could look through personal service companies.  I believe there is already some provision in place.  It may not be with the Revenue but with the Department.  If not, I would start with intermediaries.  That is where the big money is in the information technology sector and the multinationals.  The question of construction and couriers is simple.  We should stop using test cases.  We should set aside those sectors where test cases have been used.  They are simple to solve.  However, the intermediary sector is one where there is a vast amount of money and no one can quantify it.  It does not form part of the &euro;1 billion loss.  That is why I take the view the figure would be far larger if we were to look at intermediaries.  I would start with intermediaries.  Construction and couriers are real low-hanging fruit.  That could be done straightaway or overnight.</p></speech>

Should reviews be done of all decisions that were made by the appeals office?  Is that an avenue worth chasing?  Let us assume we are trying to tackle this issue, deal with it with some finality and correct all the failings.  If the Minister is unwilling to champion it, would that warrant an investigation to examine what has occurred historically?</p></speech>

That should happen immediately.  This is a huge amount of money.  This affects our pensions.  We are now being told we have to work two or three extra years for our pensions but the State has not been collecting employer PRSI.  I will say it again.  There is no pensions crisis; there is a crisis arising from a failure to collect employer PRSI, yet we are paying for it.  Does there need to be an investigation?  Yes, absolutely.</p> <p>  Should the Department of Social Protection be involved in insurability of employment decisions at all?  I believe the Department has proven that it is not capable of doing this and I believe it should be removed from the role completely.  The scope office at the Department is the only office that is acting exactly as it should be.  Nothing is perfect but that office is 99% of the way there.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office should have nothing to do with it.  That office has already proven that it is incapable of dealing with these cases according to case law.  The Revenue Commissioners are collection agents.  They should do what they are told and not have opinions on whether people are employees or self-employed.  It is not their place.  The Revenue Commissioners should not be sitting down in the employment status group arguing that historically couriers have been self-employed.  That is neither here nor there and it has nothing to do with them.</p> <p>  We should take this away from the Department of Social Protection because it has a conflicting interest.  The Department wants to reduce the numbers on the unemployment register and will do it by any means necessary, including by making people work as bogus self-employed workers.  The Department has a conflict so we should take the conflict out and give this matter to someone else to address.  Before we do that, we must overturn what those responsible have already done wrong.  I have no objection to the Workplace Relations Commission taking over this role but it cannot be done in private.  That the WRC is doing this in secrecy is allowing an office of the State to make million and billion euro decisions over which no one has any oversight.  It is not done in the public domain, but it should be.</p></speech>

No one from ICTU is here but it sent a submission, in fairness.  The submission states that in the absence of legislative provision, unfortunately, individual workers will be forced to pursue costly civil cases.  Mr. McMahon has outlined that some of these workers would have to go to the High Court rather than the Circuit Court because these cases go to the appeals office in the Department of Social Protection.  Has anyone ever taken a case to the High Court?</p></speech>

In the ESB case, despite a High Court ruling that those involved were employees, the decision was simply ignored.  They have taken it upon themselves to decide that the Department is the sole arbiter of who is employed and self-employed and they do not have to listen to case law.  They are saying it straight up.  They maintain they are not compelled or bound by case law and they have said that clearly multiple times.</p></speech>

Until one can compel it to be bound by the legislation then it is actually a waste of time.  It is admirable and something which should happen but as it is using test cases, which are outside the law and are specifically prohibited by existing case law, how does one make legislation work when it will not use the legislation?</p></speech>

I count myself as a whistle-blower.  As a whistle-blower, there is no forum in the State where I can sit down and explain in detail from start to finish exactly what is happening and all the nuances involved.  This is a very brief meeting.  It is two hours long with five minutes for an opening statement.  It is not just an issue for me, but it is one for all other whistle-blowers.  No forum exists within the State where we can sit down and tell our stories, our way, without fear of reprisal.  It does not exist and that is not accidental.  That is on purpose.  They do not want whistle-blowers blowing the whistle and that is what I am doing.  I am blowing the whistle on bogus self-employment.  In the absence of a forum in which I can sit down and tell the story from start to finish, the Committee of Public Accounts is the only forum.</p></speech>

Obviously, we try to deal with meetings in a certain way but due to the Covid regulations it is a bit disjointed.  Sometimes we find ourselves talking over each other because we do not have the same benefits we would have if we were all in the same room.  We are doing our best with it and I thank Mr. McMahon for being patient with us.</p> <p>  We really appreciate the work Mr. McMahon has done on this.  It is a very important piece of work and he referred to the pension pot which is one issue of concern.  That is made up of PRSI contributions and if correct contributions are not going in, there will not be enough in the pot.  Another important point is the conditions for workers.  I know one of the Deputies mentioned earlier that anyone who thinks there is no bogus self-employment has not been out in the fresh air, and has not been out in the world.  I say that having been out in the fresh air because I have certainly seen it going on and am aware of it going on.  People involved in and working in those industries are in a very difficult precarious situation.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to try to do what we can.  Our role here is to make sure the public accounts are in order but by virtue of that, it will help in some way to protect those workers as well.</p> <p>  That was a good exchange.  I thank the members of the committee.  I know they asked questions and looked into this before.  They asked thoughtful questions and I thank them for that.  I also thank the committee secretariat.  The information has been provided to us.  I understand the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands intends to examine and report on the issue of bogus self-employment.  I propose we forward the information gathered on this matter to that committee for any action that is deemed appropriate.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

I ask members to turn off mobile phones.  They must sit in designated seats in the D&aacute;il Chamber or may join remotely from elsewhere in the parliamentary precincts.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  This meeting has been convened to consider the Revised Estimate: Vote 30 - agriculture, food and the marine, which was referred to the select committee by the D&aacute;il on 16 December.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and his officials, Dr. Kevin Smyth, assistant secretary general; Ms Rebecca Chapman, principal officer, finance division; and Mr. Tom Corkery, assistant principal officer.  It is a very challenging time for the agriculture, food and marine sectors, not least because of the impact of Covid-19, Brexit and climate action.  Today's meeting provides an opportunity to scrutinise the level of funding allocated for 2021 and a valuable opportunity to engage with the Minister.</p> <p>  We will deal with Vote 30 on a programme-by-programme basis.  Due to time constraints, the Minister will forgo making the opening statement which has been circulated to members.  There are four programmes.  We will consider each separately with questions from committee members.</p> <p>  The Department circulated briefing materials on the Revised Estimate to members in advance.  I ask the Minister to say a few words.</p></speech>

Members will have had a chance to read it and there will be an opportunity for members to come back with particular questions.  We had an 11% increase in the budget for agriculture, food and the marine, which was very significant in underpinning farm incomes this year.  It was important that we managed to ensure that the existing schemes under the outgoing CAP programme were continued in what we have now, a two-year transition period.  Coming towards the end of a CAP programme, the schemes tend to be at full tilt in the numbers of farmers participating and the cost of running the schemes.  It was significant in being able to continue those schemes.  I am grateful for the support of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, for funding that.</p> <p>  We also secured significant additional funding for this year with &euro;79 million for environmental measures.  There is &euro;10 million for a new agri-environment pilot.  We are engaging with the Commission in seeking approval for that.  We are also reopening the farm organics scheme and an European Innovation Partnership, EIP, on farm safety, led by the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon.  It is a budget which very much reflects the important role of agriculture, food and the marine to our economy and the very important role that the Government and I, as Minister, see the farmers as having.  We are doing everything in our power to underpin farm incomes in the budget.  I commend the Revised Estimate and look forward to the engagement with the committee.</p></speech>

It is a very busy day.  The committee has had some discussion on the TB eradication scheme.  The Minister's opening statement stated there was an increased provision for TB testing this year.  However, the detail of the programme suggests that the number of TB tests being undertaken is the same, so there is no additional output being achieved from the additional expenditure.  I take it that is because the EU has reduced the level of funding because our eradication programme has not been working in recent years.  Will the Minister clarify where he sees this programme going over the next 12 months?  The stakeholders forum is in place.  Can we get better value for money?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021033000002#G00500"><p>I hope that we make significant progress in the year ahead.  The Deputy is correct that part of the increased expenditure is due to the reduction in the European allocation towards the TB eradication programme.  The increased costs are also due to the additional reactor herds and there are increased costs around that because of compensation.  Broadly the number of tests remains similar even though there has been an increase in the number of reactors.  We agreed a new TB strategy working with the farm organisations in the last couple of months after much engagement.  There are three new working groups, including an implementation working group where all the stakeholders are represented to implement the TB strategy and address the situation where we have seen reactor rates go from 3.5% of all herd to 4.5% in the last 12 months, which is a really worrying trend and one which we must drive in the other direction.</p></speech>

How much of that shortfall is the Department making up?  Will there be additional farmer contributions next year?  Is there any discussion at forum level or within the Department to see if the meat industry, for example, would be asked to contribute toward the TB eradication programme, considering that if it is successful, it will be the chief beneficiary?</p></speech>

We would hope that over the course of the year we would be able to reduce the reactor numbers.  The finance group in the TB forum will certainly assess and monitor the cost as it evolves.  Primarily the increased cost has been borne by the Department.  It is primarily down to the cost of compensation.  I do not have the figure for the reduction in the EU contribution to hand but I will revert to the Deputy.  It has, however, increased the cost of the eradication programme from &euro;43.9 million last year to &euro;45.5 million this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021033000002#H00100"><p>On that &euro;8.9 million, my understanding is there will probably be the guts of 500,000 more cattle in the country.  I know the difference has to be made up with the EU but one would imagine we would have to pick up another bit there in terms of the percentage for a rainy day fund in case of extra TB problems and compensation.</p> <p>  Why is there a drop in expenditure for policy and strategy when agriculture is at a key road?  It is a sector that is in difficulty so one would imagine that policy and strategy would be important in that regard.  Is that drop solely related to the Department?</p> <p>  Pay in the Department seems to be gone up 11% and administration non-pay is down 4%.  Could the Minister give us a breakdown on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021033000002#H00200"><p>The figures there are broadly based on the number of animals in the country and the number of tests we project for the year ahead.  The significant change in the past year was the change in compensation.  We went from 3.5% to 4.5%, so in the initial budget last year that would have been &euro;37 million, whereas at the end of the year it was &euro;43.9 million and this year we have allocated &euro;45.5 million for it.</p> <p>  On administration and pay, the primary change around that is the Brexit costs and the cost of additional staff around Brexit.  That is where the bulk of that expenditure comes from.  If the Deputy looks across the four programmes A, B, C and D, he will see a similar increase.  There is a public expenditure and pay calculation that we follow across those, which balances expenditure out across the four programmes.  There is a similar dynamic there as a result of the fact we are seeing an increase across the four programmes but it is primarily down to the increased staffing allocation arising from Brexit.  Then there are increases coming from public sector pay increases being applied to existing staff as well.</p></speech>

The 2021 Estimate for badger vaccination is &euro;1.8 million.  That is up significantly.  Last year it would have been &euro;900,000 so that has doubled for the year ahead and it is covered by the Department's budget.</p></speech>

Does he have plans to spread the costs of TB testing to all those engaged in the food production system instead of the disproportionate burden that is falling on farmers themselves?</p> <p>  While the Minister says there is more money to be allocated to TB testing, is he sure that money is being well spent in terms of the eradication of the disease?  We have had a number of organisations before the committee and they have told us the programme is not effective in targeting the disease and in the methods being used.  Will the Minister give us some information on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021033000002#H00800"><p>Importantly, we have established a TB forum and, within that, we have three working groups.  One of those working groups is focused on finance and there is a lot of work ongoing on a report on the issue of finance and a report on the current cost incurred.  I will be informed by the work of that TB forum and by that report.</p> <p>  The significant burden and the largest part of the expenditure is being carried by the Department.  As the Deputy can see, over the course of the past year, there has been an increased cost to the Department associated with the programme in terms of compensation because of the reactor numbers.  Every farm that has a reactor has a massive implication for those herds and we have seen that increase.  Some 1% more farms went down last year than did the year before and that placed a significant burden on them.  While there is compensation available from the Department to address that, the best way we can try to address the issue overall is to drive down the numbers and to try to work towards the reduction and elimination of TB.</p> <p>  Ultimately, I want to get back on a course which is about eradication because it has not been going in that direction in the past year.  That is why everyone needs to work together, and I value the working engagement and relationship with the farm organisations in particular and their role in the TB forum because we all have to show leadership and work together to drive the strategy forward if we are going to see a reduction in the numbers.</p></speech>

Farmers also bear a cost for the annual testing of their animals, and for those farmers who suffer reactors, there is a tremendous disruptive cost, despite the compensation that is in place.  There is a new TB strategy in place and, as part of that, there is a finance committee on that in one of the three key working groups.  That finance group, which includes farmer representatives, has a role in advising how we can get the best impact and return on investment, both in terms of what the Department contributes, in what it costs farmers and in any other opportunities in funding.  I will work closely with it on its recommendations, outcomes and considerations in the next period of time.</p> <p>  The other consideration was the fact we have had an ongoing contribution from the European Union towards our eradication scheme costs.  However, that has been impacted because there are thresholds for that.  We have to show we are delivering progress.  Unfortunately, it has been going in the wrong direction in the past while so that has led to a reduction there.  That reduction from the EU Commission has been made up by the Department and by public funds.</p></speech>

I have a follow-on question on the new strategy.  One of the issues I come across regularly is where a young farmer has put a huge investment into his or her herd, stock, restocking and enterprise.  We need to look at the compensation provided for any farmer who is locked up with TB.</p><p>I recently raised this issue with departmental officials.  I am glad the working group involves many of the stakeholders.  I encourage the Minister and his Department to look at the issue very seriously.  Many people will not go into farming because this is a real fear for them, particularly if they are in a black area for TB.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021033000002#J00200"><p>This issue comes up regularly in engagements between the farm organisations and the Department.  Obviously, in addition to the immense stress and challenge an outbreak of TB raises for farmers, it also poses real financial difficulty for them.  The Department has a significant compensation scheme to support the farmers in covering the loss they experience.  Farming organisations regularly make the case that they feel this is not enough.  The finance committee of the TB forum will also assess and report on that.  I will be informed by the considerations on that.</p> <p>  Overall, the increase in numbers is putting significant pressure on the public purse in addition to the pressure on farmers.  Almost &euro;100 million a year is spent between what the farmers spend and what the Department spends, which is a very large amount to spend on something on which there is no productive return.  It is about trying to manage a challenge.  Ultimately, we need to see progress in reducing the numbers and work towards genuine eradication.  We need to focus our money and spend significantly on bringing those numbers down.</p></speech>

I ask him to give the percentage and absolute number for the increase in payments to farmers.</p> <p>  During his contribution to the debate on the Revised Estimates for 2020, the Minister said that approximately &euro;135 million was to be provided in targeted schemes to support sustainable beef farming.  That was the 2020 figure.  In his opening statement today, he said he is providing more than &euro;85 million to support sustainable farming.  It is the same sentence but with a &euro;50 million difference.  I note the beef sustainability schemes have decreased by &euro;50 million and the agri-environmental schemes have increased by about &euro;45 million, which are very close to the same.  Has the funding that has been allocated to the agri-environmental schemes just being taken from the beef sustainability schemes or am I misreading those two figures?</p> <p>  I will cover some of the details of programme B.  At the beginning of the year the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, lauded the organic farming scheme and said it would deliver 500 new places.  According to the figures before us, the Department is targeting 330 additional participants in the organic farming scheme, which comes nowhere near to living up to our obligations, considering the number of farmers who are interested in participating.  Is the organic scheme targeting numbers of hectares as opposed to numbers of farmers?  One can see where the concerns would arise that people with smaller holdings would be less attractive to the Department.</p> <p>  If it were not so serious, I am sure all members of the committee would have a good chuckle to themselves at the target for the number of hectares of new forestry plantings, which is 8,000 ha, the exact same as it was last year and which was missed dismally.  Considering this committee is still hearing evidence from people across the sector saying the problems they are encountering have not been resolved, how optimistic is the Minister of reaching that target this year?</p> <p>  On the sheep welfare scheme, the targeted output has been reduced both in the number of herds participating and the number of ewes paid for under the scheme.  Why does the Department envisage a reduction in participants in that scheme?</p> <p>  The committee has had considerable debate on the horse and greyhound funding scheme.  When we last spoke about it, the Minister told me approximately 60% of Exchequer funding goes towards prize money.  Whatever way the accounting is done, it works out within 1% annually.  Whatever the Exchequer gives is what is paid out in prize money.  We received confirmation from Horse Racing Ireland that of the &euro;66 million in prize money in 2019, about &euro;385 million was paid to breeders, on whom we depend to sustain the sector.  Considering the amount of debate, has the Minister evaluated whether the substantial level of Exchequer funding to that sector is being best utilised to reinvigorate the sector and to ensure the communities dependent on the rural economy are getting the most benefit from the substantial level of funding?</p></speech>

The previous beef emergency aid scheme was co-funded between the Department and the European Union.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the reduced numbers in the sheep welfare scheme.  I extended that scheme and it is very much down to the numbers applying and participating in it.  It is as open as it was previously.  I am trying to choose a reference year that will maximise the number of sheep that can participate in it, to give herdowners the option within the reference year to try to maximise the return for their flocks.</p> <p>  Obviously, there is ongoing engagement between the Department and Horse Racing Ireland over the course of the year, particularly in the run-up to budget time.</p><p>As with any organisation in any sector, Horse Racing Ireland will have to make a robust case in respect of value for money and how it benefits the sector, farmers, owners and those who breed across all types.  In particular, HRI will have to demonstrate how it impacts on those who are smaller within each sector.  That is looked at in detail and is subject to ongoing review.  I am open to ideas and suggestions from Deputies in respect of the structure and I have no doubt HRI would be too.  HRI is the stewardship body for the sector and is made up of a board of representatives representing different stakeholders within the sector.</p></speech>

There have been significant challenges in respect of the forestry programme, especially around the issuing of licences from the Department.  This emanated from a change in the level of ecological input required in licences compared with before.  This led to a significant logjam last year.  It became acute at the end of the year and is still acute although it is being addressed bit by bit.  We introduced emergency legislation at the end of the year.  All Deputies co-operated to facilitate this move to try to streamline the system and deal with the significant backlog before the forestry appeals committee.  We provided for the division of the forestry appeals committee into several subcommittees as opposed to having to meet in plenary.  That has resulted in significant progress on the appeals side.  The forestry appeals committee is now on course to have the backlog dealt with and cleared by June this year.  There is significant progress there.  We have also seen a significant drop-off in the number of appeals coming in following streamlining of the process.  There has been a significant increase in staffing.  We have gone from a situation where there was one ecologist to now having 20 full-time equivalents.</p> <p>  There has been also a significant initiative by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Hackett, in the past three or four weeks ago in respect of project woodland.  This has involved putting in place new work streams to try to streamline how the administration of licences is managed within the Department.  There are significant challenges.  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and I are working in every way we can to try to make progress.  We want to see the number of licences increased over the course of this year and we are working hard to ensure that happens.  The target is to see 4,500 licences issued by the end of the year.  We are determined that this will be the case.  We will continue to work closely to try to improve what has been a difficult situation.  It has led to immense challenges for the sector, especially for those working in the sector, including those in sawmills and contractors and foresters.  We want to resolve and address this.  We will keep pushing this in every way we can to try to resolve the situation facing us.</p> <p>  The programme for Government target is to achieve 8,000 ha per annum.  There is no doubt that will be a significant challenge this year.  Last year's effort came nowhere near close to it.  Yet, it is the objective.  We are looking to set up a structure within the Department in terms of licences and supports in place to try to encourage greater afforestation.  It has been a challenging story during the past year and we are still trying to work out and address it.  I am very much aware it has caused immense strain and difficultly for those working in the sector.  It is not acceptable and has to be sorted out.</p></speech>

Under the rural environment protection scheme, the average income was &euro;5,000.  By this measure in today's terms the average should be between &euro;10,000 and &euro;15,000 but that is not the case.  Farmers are highly dependent on the environmental schemes and whatever schemes come their way.  They are happy to work with the rules and regulations that must be adhered to.  Is there a possibility that schemes can be raised considerably?</p> <p>  What about the climate action Bill that has been brought before the D&aacute;il?  If it is agreed to by the Government and the D&aacute;il, it will bring major falls in the numbers of dairy cattle, cows and animals in the suckler herd.  That will have serious consequences.  Farmers will fall back on these schemes and will be more dependent on them.</p> <p>  I wish to comment on the environmental organic scheme.  A budget was set aside last year or the year before.  Many farmers did training for it.  They did everything they could but could not get into the scheme.  We are talking about providing plenty of money to have farmers on an organic scheme.  Yet, at the end of the day, even though they ticked all the boxes and did everything they could, they could not get on it.  I was talking to farmers who travelled the country to do courses over weekends so that they could qualify but they never qualified afterwards.  Most were left outside the scheme.</p> <p>  It is great to be able to come back and say there is plenty of money left in the budget because farmers did not take it up.  However, they cannot take it up if they are not allowed to qualify.  Are the qualification criteria the same?  Is there some easing of the qualification criteria whereby genuine organic farmers who want to join the scheme could at least be allowed avoid a situation where an announcement of 500 might result in only 200 taking up the scheme?</p> <p>  I would appreciate if we could focus in on the environmental schemes and the schemes coming forward.  At the least they should compensate farmers correctly, something they have not been doing down through the years.  We have seen only a small percentage of increases.  Farmers who were getting &euro;5,000 ten or 15 years ago are getting very little ten or 15 years later.</p></speech>

They have had a good success rate in terms of farmers being willing to participate in them.  They have returned a good deal for the rural countryside and the environment.  They have been significant in respect of the income they have generated and provided for farm families.  They started off with the REPS and we then moved on to the agri-environment options scheme and, more recently, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme.  The average payments under REPS 1, 2, 3 and 4, were &euro;4,200, &euro;4,700, &euro;6,300 and &euro;5,700, respectively.  The average payments for AEOS 1, 2 and 3, were &euro;3,800, &euro;3,300 and &euro;3,300, respectively.  Under GLAS the average payment is &euro;4,500.</p> <p>  The key commitment in the programme for Government is to deliver a new flagship agri-environment scheme in the next Common Agricultural policy, CAP, that will help deliver incomes significantly for farmers and deliver outcomes to contribute to environmental measures and emissions objectives as well.  In advance of the new CAP kicking off in January 2023 and as part of this year's Estimate, the plan is to deliver a pilot agri-environment scheme.  We are currently engaged with the European Commission to get approval for that.  The objective of the scheme is that it would be paid based on a measure of 10 ha of land.  My objective is to try to ensure all farmers, large or small, have a full opportunity to engage in the scheme and to benefit to the fullest extent in terms of payments under that scheme.  A farmer with 10 ha will have the same opportunity to earn an income through the scheme as a farmer with 100 acres.  The estimate is that the average payment under that scheme would be in and around &euro;4,700, with the potential for a payment coming in at just under &euro;7,000.</p> <p>  It is a pilot results-based scheme.  It is very much subject to getting approval from the European Commission.  We cannot actually run new schemes as such.  We can run pilot schemes in a transition period.  This is a pilot and comes with those constraints.  We will be using the learnings from this results-based pilot to inform how we structure the next flagship agri-environment scheme to replace GLAS AEOS and, before those, REPS.</p><p>I will be engaging with farm organisations and farmers regarding that new flagship environmental scheme, its structure and how we can ensure it can best achieve policy objectives while, importantly, also being user-friendly and delivering on farm incomes.</p></speech>

Some 330 more farmers will be involved with organic schemes.  Farmers are going to be losing &euro;10 million though from the European fund or single farm payment, which is not the Minister's fault.  Under the knowledge transfer heading, farmers will have about &euro;4.5 million less in their pockets, while there will be &euro;1.5 million less in their pockets under the sheep welfare scheme.  The forestry programme must be dealt with clearly.  We had said we were going to plant 8,000 ha last year.  What happened to those moneys?  We had budgeted for putting in the plants, and farmers get a percentage of that figure, as well the moneys participants get each year.  What happened to that money?  When we look at the figures for this year, there is not a hope in hell of hitting 8,000 ha because the area is in chaos again.</p> <p>  According to the figures I am looking at, therefore, if we add up all the millions of euro farmers are going to be down, it will be about &euro;70 million in total.  To put it simply, that money is coming out of their pockets.  When we look at the figures, where is that money going to be allocated to put it back into farmers' pockets this year?  Am I correct in saying approximately 6,600 fewer people will be participating in environmental schemes this year?  Am I also correct in saying the knowledge transfer scheme has decreased from approximately &euro;5 million to circa &euro;500,000, or something like that, off the top of my head?  The Minister is not at fault for this aspect, but will &euro;10 million less be coming out of Brussels as well?  Am I also correct in stating that last year we did not even reach half the budget allocated for forestry?  According to the figures I am looking at, this year is going to be the same.</p> <p>  I need one other issue clarified.  A figure of &euro;23,000 or thereabouts is down for carbon tax or something.  What is that about?  How many farmers will be going into this pilot thing which the Minister has been going on about?  My understanding on the organic scheme is it encompasses the dairy and tillage sectors.  Beef farmers do not seem to be scoring that high in this area.  When I talk about farmers being down on money in their pockets, am I correct in saying there are big drops in funding in schemes associated with knowledge transfer and sheep welfare?  The figures we have show there is a drop in the single farm payment or basic payment scheme, BPS, whatever we want to call it.  Some 6,600 fewer farmers are now in the environmental scheme as well, which represents a great deal of money on average.  When we asked the Minister what the average payment was on GLAS, he told us it was approximately &euro;4,200.</p> <p>  We can go through figures all day and look them up and down and inside out, but overall there is less money in farmers' pockets.  Another scheme, for example, and I think it is beef genomics, is down 37%.  It could be the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme, I am not sure, but the Minister mentioned something about that aspect earlier.  Where are we going to make up the decreases to ensure these farmers are going to get money into their pockets?  While the figures could be looking lovely in an overall context, it is the amount of money in farmers' pockets which is important.  There is extra spending under wages in this Vote and that is understandable.  There is also extra spending under the headings of Brexit and X, Y and Z and that is understandable too.  No one is debating that at all.  What I am looking at, though, is the deficit in farmers' pockets.  Compared with last year, will the Minister tell me where that shortfall in the money going into farmers' pockets is going to be made up this year?</p></speech>

Regarding GLAS, as the Deputy is aware, I provided for that scheme to be continued this year during the transition period.  It had been at full participation levels up to this point.

Turning to the knowledge transfer scheme, the Deputy is right.  It is tapering off coming out of the outgoing CAP.  Programmes that were running had come to the end of their timeframe.  In the previous year, there was &euro;5 million in the area of knowledge transfer.  Closing out those schemes this year will see that figure come down to &euro;500,000.</p> <p>  However, there is new funding in regard to the knowledge transfer scheme, especially from the perspective of farm safety.  The Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, is overseeing that area this year.  All the schemes were continued into this year and an extra &euro;79 million in new funding in the budget is going towards several schemes in the environmental space.  Examples of the measures included in that funding this year are the pilot agri-environmental scheme, the reopening of the European Innovation Partnerships, EIP, project in farm safety, the organic scheme and the straw incorporation scheme.  It is important to state as well the TAMS scheme is being fully continued as part of Pillar 2.</p> <p>  Regarding the opportunity to ensure farm incomes can be underpinned and protected, as I have said before, schemes tend to have their fullest membership and greatest expense at the end of a CAP cycle.  Previously, we saw that schemes were discontinued for a time while a new CAP cycle was starting and that resulted in farmers missing out on significant payments during the time while they came out of one scheme and were waiting for the next one to start.  We are not seeing that happen now.  It took significant funding to ensure that would be the case, albeit not everyone has availed of the opportunity to continue their involvement with GLAS for another year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.174" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021033000002#L01200"><p>I think clarification is needed here.  It is unfair to say farmers basically did not bother themselves to avail of the opportunity with GLAS.  The reality under the scheme for those leasing a farm is it would be necessary for the lease to last for five and a half years, or six years to be comfortable.  If such a lease was coming to an end and the land concerned included one of the main projects for qualification for GLAS, the Department made provision for such land not being available again.  The result, though, was some of the payments in situations like that fell to about &euro;1,500.  It was not worth filling out the GLAS application and that is why we have lost approximately 6,000 farmers in the scheme.  That means there is less money in the economy.  The knowledge transfer scheme is gone.</p> <p>  Will the Minister examine the forestry situation?  I am not even going to talk about the Minister of State with responsibility for forestry.  This is a situation where we are going to ask farmers to chop straw and plough it into the ground.  Even if we look at Europe's targets on organic schemes, the first requirement in that area is to be 50:50.  If a farmer has slats, then it is necessary to have straw bedding behind.  We are then going to tell everyone to chop the straw and drive it into the ground.</p><p>Let us think for a minute about what we are doing.  The reality is that many millions of euros will not be in farmers' pockets for one reason or another.  We must also look at the beef environmental efficiency programme-suckler, BEEP-S, which is &euro;10 million down.  That is &euro;10 million less in this country.</p><p> One aspect the Minister did not address was forestry.  Where did last year's money go from the amount that was allocated last year?  Does he agree that we will not even come near our targets this year?  He spoke about how we brought in legislation.  Everyone here supported it and would do so any day of the week.  The Minister should have a look at the figures that come out on the dashboard every week.  They are absolutely horrendous.  The forestry sector is getting worse.  It would pay for Ministers to be good to, and talk to, the industry at the moment.  We are, again, in a few weeks of crisis.  The same thing keeps coming out with people saying they are sorting it and they got this and that done.  I am not just targeting the Minister.  I know a junior Minister is also supposed to be resolving the issue.  It is in chaos, however.  Where are we going?  We are putting in and looking at figures everyone knows.  We are not opposing the Minister.  The bottom line is that these are dream figures, however.  We have a big amount down for forestry this year that will go back to the Exchequer.  Where else is it going to go?  It will not be doing the work.  That money will not be in farmers' pockets because the Minister's Department is not functioning, to put it bluntly.</p><p> One should look at the different schemes in terms of the ways in which they are set up, and the GLAS, especially.  I know several farmers who could not get the land for the next five years.  What brought them into it was fencing along rivers or wild bird cover or whatever else; I believe the fancy term used was "priority access".  When they did not get that land, they were brought down to a smaller area and it was not worth their while.  If a person has 4.2 acres, on average, and he or she loses 50% of that, he or she would be wasting their time.  The Department needs to look at how we get money into farmers' pockets.  I do not care how we go about it.  With the best will in the world from the Minister, if one adds forestry, the environmental scheme and all the different schemes along with the &euro;10 billion put down in Europe, farmers will be down &euro;100 million.  That is not good.  That is money that would be spent in communities around the country.</p></speech>

My objective as Minister is to support farmers and farming incomes in every way I can.  I am constrained in how I can do that in a transition period between one CAP programme and another.  I maximise every opportunity available to me to try to ensure that every opportunity is provided to farmers to continue to have their income maintained, hence the continuation of the schemes that were in place, whether that be GLAS, the beef data and genomics programme, money for BEEP-S, areas of natural constraints, obviously, and the sheep welfare scheme.  Alongside that is additional new funding for measures such as the new agri-environment results-based pilot scheme.</p> <p>  To touch on the issue of forestry, over the past two or three years, we have seen a carry-over of capital expenditure in forestry into the subsequent year.  One can carry over capital from one year to the next.  The vast majority of forestry funding goes on recurrent expenditure for forestry grants.  There is also afforestation grant aid.  As a result of the targets not being met in recent times, there has been an underspend in that regard.  Last year, for example, &euro;13.7 million was carried forward and continued into this year's budget. </p> <p>  The Deputy's point that the licensing situation must be sorted out and addressed is absolutely spot on.  Both myself and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, agree with that fully.  We are doing all we can to try to address what was undoubtedly a crisis situation at the end of last year, and continues to be such.  We are making every effort to resolve this. </p> <p>  As I said, there have been significant interventions regarding the emergency legislation last October with regard to the project woodlands.  That is a representation of the massive effort and steps taken by the Minister of State to try to streamline the licensing process and get the numbers up, because they must come up.   The backlog and delays we have seen are simply not acceptable.  It is something about which the Department is very much aware and we are doing all we can to try to address the issue.  The Minister of State and I are very much aware of the stress and impact that is having on the sector, and also the fact that it has made the achievement of our aims of new afforestation simply not possible unless we address the current licensing situation and the problem that exists.</p></speech>

I will follow on from Deputy Fitzmaurice on the forestry issue.  Many people out there are really frustrated at present.  I have been contacted by quite a few people over the last number of weeks about how timber from the sawmills has gone out of control, specifically with the manufacturer.  That would be timber for houses, timber products or whatever.  This is a real issue on which an awful lot more can be done.  Those people are all blaming the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on felling licences and planting and everything like that, even the nurseries.  It is everybody.  This is a real challenge.  I encourage the Minister to go back to his officials and do whatever can be done.</p> <p>  On the issue of the flagship rural development scheme, I met with the IFA and other farming organisations over the recent period.  This is a meaningful scheme in which there are real returns and benefits for farmers.  That is if we do not have a repeat of some of the outgoing schemes, where people pull out and leave after a while because they do not get the financial benefits.  If one goes back to the blueprint of the old rural environment protection scheme that was probably one of the most successful environmental schemes.</p> <p>  I understand the Horse and Greyhound Fund was raised but that is under programme C so I will leave it until then.  I previously raised the knowledge transfer scheme with the Minister, which I know is no longer there, and similarly, the early retirement scheme.  What is there to replace the knowledge transfer scheme?  Does the Minister have any plans to reintroduce an early retirement scheme?</p></speech>

First, I refer him to my earlier comments on forestry.  I totally agree with him on the fact there is a massive challenge here and much of it lies at the Department's door with regard to the delay in licensing.  There were reasons and backgrounds for that in terms of the change in legislation and the court decision which very much changed the level of input, particularly the ecological input, required to process a licence.  As a result, that led to a backlog, which built up over the course of last year and certainly reached crisis proportions.  There was a crisis response to the emergency legislation and also significant effort regarding the new project woodlands and putting in place specific work streams to try to address that.  This work is still under way and has to continue; we must get it sorted.  We are very much aware of that.  We are simply not an acceptable position at the moment and everybody is making a massive effort to try to address it.  That does not take away from the impact it has had on the sector.  I certainly assure the Deputy that we are doing all we can in that regard.  I have taken steps and we will continue to do all we can to increase output.  Ultimately, the bottom line is that we have to increase the licence output in terms of felling, afforestation and road openings in order that farmers who apply get them in a reasonable timeframe.</p><p>They need to have confidence that whenever they apply, there will be a reasonable process in place to deal with their application.  We certainly acknowledge that the position that has pertained has been damaging to that confidence and we need to address it.</p><p> I am very committed to ensuring the environmental scheme will be worthwhile and beneficial to farmers, as I outlined in my initial remarks.  We are looking at a payment rate on 10 ha and it is the proposal we have put to Europe.  The average payment rate would be approximately &euro;4,700 on that, calculated on the basis of income forgone or expenditure accrued.  There will be expenses because it is results-based and there is a charge to engage an agricultural consultant but we would still be talking about &euro;4,700 to begin with over 10 ha.  One of the key measures we have proposed to the Commission for consideration is the option of low-input permanent pasture for those 10 ha.  That would be the anchor option.</p><p> Given that this is a pilot, the participation rates will be very much limited by what we can agree with Brussels, given the restraints of the transition period of the Common Agricultural Policy and only pilot schemes being allowed.  For farmers, if the payment is &euro;4,500 over 10 ha, there is a &euro;260 average basic payment rate and under an areas of natural constraints scheme they could have &euro;148 per ha, meaning the potential payment is more than &euro;800 per ha before putting a sheep or a lamb or cow or calf on that land.  That would be quite attractive and a good start for farmers and their families.  I was particularly keen to ensure that all farmers, even those with 10 ha, could participate fully.  Every farmer has the opportunity to make a significant contribution with measures relating to biodiversity and the environment.  We must provide them with the opportunity to do that.</p></speech>

The position just does not seem to be improving.  There will be &euro;103 million put into forestry this year and we are told it is &euro;18 million more than last year.  Is that a carry-over from last year, as Deputy Fitzmaurice suggested?  How will the money be spent?</p> <p>  This is referred to in the Revised Estimate as for forestry and bioenergy but how much is going into the forest service and supports that our foresters need?  How much is going to the ash dieback scheme and how much is going elsewhere?  Will the Minister break down those figures?</p></speech>

The significant majority of the funding goes to recurrent annual premiums, as opposed to the one-off afforestation grant that is a smaller part of the overall annual budget.  In the past couple of years we have seen a carry-over from the forestry budget in the form of capital into the following year's overall envelope.</p> <p>  It is certainly our objective to do all we can to increase licence numbers this year and ensure there is as much afforestation as possible.  We could probably all agree it is unlikely we will reach the 8,000 ha mark this year but we want to make very significant progress based on the very poor outturn last year and work towards the target.  If it becomes clear later in the year that the full amount will not be used, we will look at where we are then.  At this point, our focus and objective is to drive on with Project Woodland working streams and address the very acute questions around the issuing of licences.</p></speech>

I remind everyone that, apart from me and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and all members are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Shanahan.  Senator Ahearn is running late.</p> <p>  Today we are carrying out pre-legislative scrutiny on the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Amendment) Bill 2020.  The Bill provides for the treatment of Covid-19 as an occupational illness by employers and requires them to report any occurrences of the disease in the workplace to the Health and Safety Authority.  The Bill was introduced in the D&aacute;il last year by Deputy O'Reilly, who is also a member of our committee.</p> <p>  To assist the committee in its consideration of this matter today, I am pleased to welcome from the Health and Safety Authority, Dr. Sharon McGuinness, chief executive, and Ms Yvonne Mullooly, assistant chief executive in the chemicals and prevention division.  From the Health Service Executive, I welcome Mr. Nick Parkinson, head of the national health and safety function; Dr. Lynda Sisson, national clinical lead for workplace health and well-being; and Professor Martin Cormican, national clinical lead for the antimicrobial resistance and infection control team and for the vaccine roll-out.  From the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I welcome Mr. Frank Vaughan, congress health and safety consultant, and Mr. David Hughes, deputy general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.</p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations on parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding the reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  However, today's witnesses are to give evidence remotely from a location outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Opening statements and other documentation have already been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite Dr. McGuinness to make her opening remarks on behalf of the Health and Safety Authority.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Yvonne Mullooly.  In the interests of time and with the committee's understanding, I do not propose to read the detailed statement and will instead concentrate my comments on the specifics of the proposed amendment, which are detailed from paragraph 16 of my written statement onwards.</p> <p>  In considering the amendment, the authority would state first that the protection of workers and the prevention of accidents, injuries and illness is always our primary goal.  To achieve this, we need to have robust and reliable information and data.  With regard to Covid-19, I would point out that the authority already has a significant level of information available to it in respect of cases of the disease in the workplace.  This information comes from both public and occupational health and safety reporting systems that are already in place and operating.  These include the requirement, under the biological agents regulations of 2013 to 2020, for an employer to report to the authority if an employee contracts Covid-19 as a result of occupational exposure from working with the virus.  The public health computerised infectious disease reporting system, CIDR, is managed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and the national incident management system, NIMS, collects data on incidents from the public healthcare sector.  All of these reporting systems are important sources of information not just for the authority but for public health authorities.  We have access to the data available on all three systems.</p> <p>  In addition, we have initiated the preparation of a regulatory impact analysis, RIA, on foot of a request from the board of the authority.  The intention of the board is to ensure the authority has comprehensive and immediate data to support the protection of workers from Covid-19.  The purpose of the RIA is to identify a range of possible options for the potential achievement of this objective and to provide detailed information on the costs, benefits and impacts of each option.  The RIA will provide our board with a basis for recommending the most appropriate way forward and will be considered by the board in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  I will now return to the specifics of the amendment, and I again refer members to paragraph 16 onwards of the written statement provided.  As I have already said, the authority would point out that the protection of workers and the prevention of accidents, injuries and illness is always our primary goal.  Covid-19 is an infectious disease which has caused a public health pandemic, and an individual has the potential to be infected by contracting it in or out of the workplace.  The most reliable data on Covid-19 in the workplace are the data collected in the infectious disease database known as CIDR, as these data are medically validated and confirmed by a Covid-19 PCR test.  The CIDR data are provided to the authority by the HPSC every week and give details of all cases of Covid-19 in all workplaces.  This allows the authority to identify quickly the workplace, its geographical location and the number of cases associated with it.  The information provided for in this Bill is, therefore, similar to that already supplied directly to the authority by the HPSC every week and, as such, there may be no additional benefit in the proposed amendment.</p> <p>  The Bill may be contrary to the scope of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 as the Act only provides for an occupational illness or disease that is attributable to work.</p><p>The wording in the Bill would in essence make Covid-19 an occupational disease if any worker in a workplace were to contract it, irrespective of where he or she caught the disease.  As Covid-19 can just as easily be acquired by employees outside of work and subsequently brought into the workplace, such circumstances would not be considered "attributable to work" under the Act.</p><p> The Bill needs to consider the implications on all employers of imposing a Covid-19 reporting obligation on them.  Most employers would not be in a position to assess or attribute Covid-19 infections to their workplace with any degree of medical or legal reliability, since Covid-19, as I stated already, can be acquired in community, domestic and workplace settings.  The amendment may leave employers with an obligation, which they may not reasonably or legally be able to fulfil, as there is no counter-obligation on the employee to provide detailed confidential medical information to his or her employer.</p><p> The Bill may introduce a significant administrative burden on certain employers, particularly those in the healthcare sector, to report information that is already reported to CIDR, and in certain circumstances is also reported to NIMS, as well as reporting requirements under the biological agents regulations directly to the Authority.  In that regard, information is already available through these three systems.</p><p> Employers who have a due to report to the authority under the biological agents regulations are saying that it is difficult to determine if cases of Covid-19 amongst their workers are occupationally acquired or have arisen outside the workplace due to community transmission.  Determining the source of Covid-19 infection in an individual can require detailed medical assessment by both public and occupational medical professionals.</p><p> There are, as has been stated, three reporting requirements in the State related to Covid-19 in the workplace &ndash; CIDR, NIMS and the reporting under the biological agents regulation.  A fourth is also under assessment by the authority, that is, the regulatory impact analysis noted earlier.  The added value in creating a fourth or possibly a fifth reporting system in Ireland for the infectious disease Covid-19 is questionable, as it may not provide any additional public or occupational health assurance or relevant policy-making information on Covid-19 in the workplace.</p><p> Guidance from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform requires the preparation of an RIA to support significant legislative developments which is why the authority initiated the RIA development process to consider options for reporting of Covid-19.  The authority believes that the RIA should be completed before any amendment is made to the 2005 Act or, indeed, any other occupational health and safety legislation.  Any regulation for Covid-19 reporting needs to be made on both a sound legal as well as a medical basis.</p><p> The authority's RIA development process involves consultation with a range of parties, including employee and employer stakeholders as well as Departments and agencies.  It is nearing completion and will go to our tripartite board for its consideration and recommendations.  We feel, therefore, amending the 2005 Act at this juncture may be premature.</p><p> To conclude, there are already three reporting systems in the State for cases of Covid-19 in the workplace.  The authority has access to all three and is currently completing a regulatory impact analysis, which is looking at options for a possible fourth system.  Worker protection is already well served by all these reporting systems and by the work that the authority is doing in relation to the work safely protocol and specific occupational health and safety legislation such as the biological agents regulation.  Worker protection is also at the forefront of all the engagement and supports the authority provides to public health, which is ultimately responsible for addressing this global pandemic.  The key to managing Covid-19 ultimately resides with all of us adhering to public health advice, guidance and regulations.</p><p> On behalf of the Health and Safety Authority, I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to present to the committee today and I look forward to answering questions in due course.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Dr. Lynda Sisson and Professor Martin Cormican.</p> <p>  As the members will be aware, the HSE made a submission to the committee and we will be happy to take questions on it.  I will, therefore, confine my opening statement to some general points.</p> <p>  At the outset we would like to emphasise that the HSE views the health, safety and welfare of its staff and service users as being of the utmost importance.  Our position on, and dedication to, securing safety, health and welfare at work is demonstrated through our corporate safety statement and suite of supporting policies.</p> <p>  The past 12 months have been a challenging time for the health service, as a front-line service.  They have brought new health and safety management challenges and the organisation, its managers and staff have been required to adapt to a very rapid pace of change.  We have worked hard to manage the health and safety issues and we would like to strongly acknowledge the support and dedication of all the staff of the HSE in meeting the best possible standards under the unique circumstances presented by the pandemic.  We would also like to acknowledge the support and assistance received through our collaborative relationships with key stakeholders, such as our union colleagues, the Health and Safety Authority and the State Claims Agency.</p> <p>  One of the areas in which we have adapted, is that of Covid incidence reporting.  We have strongly encouraged and seen a high level of reporting via three channels: first, via public health and the computerised infectious disease reporting, CIDR, system; second, internally, via the national incident management system, NIMS; and, finally, externally, to the HSA under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Biological Agents) Regulations 2013 (as amended).  Following changes to the biological agents code of practice, external reporting to the HSA of cases of the disease considered to have arisen from occupational exposure commenced in November last.</p> <p>  The information gleaned through these approaches is regularly analysed in the HSE and action is taken, as necessary, to respond to any significant findings and trends.  The public health CIDR system takes a broad approach, and records all cases including those affecting healthcare workers, regardless of whether they are in active HSE service.  It does not specifically determine occupational causality.  NIMS collects cases relating to active HSE staff and seeks information on whether there is an occupational or workplace link.  Similarly, the current external HSA reporting requirements apply to cases that are work-related, that is, resulting from occupational exposure.  In both cases the relevant manager, potentially with medical, occupational health and contact tracing or public health assistance, makes an analysis as to whether the case is work related.  We have developed documentation to support managers in the decision process.</p> <p>  The current reporting structure provides for a nuanced approach to Covid incident reporting, which aligns well with the systems already in place for the statutory reporting of other incident types.  Potential issues with a broad-brush reporting requirement arise from categorising Covid-19 as an occupational illness.  Covid-19 is significantly, perhaps predominantly, transmitted in the community, with a consequent impact upon people who work - observed patterns in reported incidents suggest that cases within the organisation follow community trends; healthcare consists of many professions and work activities and cannot be considered homogenous in terms of exposure to Covid.  While a causal relationship may be demonstrable in some situations, for example, unprotected exposure during laboratory work with the live infectious agent, this would not be the case across all areas of the organisation; and the requirement could lead to the extensive and unfiltered reporting of many thousands of cases across a workforce the size of the HSE - hence the pool of cases received by the HSA may be clouded by community transmitted cases, potentially making it harder for the enforcement authority to target action.</p> <p>  It is often very difficult to identify where and when a person acquired an infection, such as Covid-19.  This is because at the point in time when infection occurs, the person catching infection is generally not aware that anything has happened.</p> <p>  If the person develops symptoms it is usually five-to-six days after he or she became infected, but the symptoms can develop after one day or can take up to 14 days.  This means that a person who develops Covid-19 could have become infected in any of his or her interactions with another person anytime during the previous 14 days in any setting.</p> <p>  For people, including healthcare workers, who move between different settings such as home and work, it is difficult to say where they acquired infection.  It is sometimes possible to link a healthcare worker infection to the workplace with reasonable confidence based on all the circumstances.  Sometimes it is possible to link a healthcare worker infection with the workplace with great confidence, based on sequencing of the genes of the virus from the worker and others linked to the same workplace.</p><p>The circumstances of infection also make it very clear that healthcare workers become infected outside the workplace because they have become infected during periods of leave and in other circumstances in which their infection was linked to an outbreak in a non-healthcare setting.</p><p> It is noted that occupational illnesses or diseases are specifically excluded from the reporting requirements under the safety health and welfare at work general application regulations, as amended, potentially due to the clear reporting requirements for specific cases or circumstances arising under the social welfare (occupational injuries) (prescribed diseases) legislation.  This legislation lists or prescribes specific examples of occupational injuries and diseases and, in the case of the latter, the industries or activities they are associated with, and the circumstances under which a case may be considered to have been work-related.  The ethos underpinning the legislation is essentially echoed in the approach taken in the biological agents regulations and associated HSA code of practice, that is, occupational injuries and diseases are reportable where there is a clear, demonstrable and epidemiologically sound association with a given type of work or workplace and it can clearly be differentiated from cases where there are other, additional or alternative causes or contributing factors.</p><p> The HSE is enthusiastic about, and embraces, any new and enhanced legislation that furthers the safety, health and well-being of our staff and service users.  Assuming robust application, the current systems should provide quality, targeted data upon which the HSE can review its approach to Covid occupational safety health risk management while also allowing the enforcement authority to respond to cases or clusters of occupationally acquired Covid-19 infection in a focused manner.  In addition to considering potential further legislation, perhaps the committee would also consider the role further guidance and instruction might play.  I thank the members of the joint committee for the opportunity to present the HSE&rsquo;s views on this important Bill.</p></speech>

As the representative body for trade unions and their members, the congress has always taken the lead in seeking to create safer workplaces and we see occupational safety and health as a key concern of unions.<br/><br/>We know that wherever people congregate there is a risk of catching or spreading Covid-19.  Workplaces, regardless of sector, are potential vector points and this is explicitly recognised in public health advice that as many people as possible work from home.  It is in the interests of workers and society as a whole that all cases and clusters in workplaces are reported.  Workers must be protected and reporting is a small but important part of our legislation which triggers the protections provided in law to mitigate the risks and protect us from workplace hazards.  The current Covid-19 pandemic is such a hazard and infections must be considered as a reportable workplace incident.  The EU has recognised this by expediting the revised biological agents directive and amending it to include SARS-CoV-2 within its ambit.  The EU recognised it from June last year and set a deadline for states to enact it on or before 24 November 2020.  Ireland enacted it on that day and now must explicitly extend the reporting it provides for to encompass all workplaces.<br/><br/>The amendment under discussion is to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  We think it is useful to reflect on some aspects of the existing legislation which help to inform our perspective and which we detailed in our earlier submission.  The Act defines the term &quot;accident&quot; in section 2 as meaning &quot;an accident arising out of or in the course of employment which, in the case of a person carrying out work, results in personal injury&quot;.  The term &quot;personal injury&quot; is then defined by the same section as including &quot;(a) any injury, disease, disability, occupational illness or any impairment of physical or mental condition, or (b) any death, that is attributable to work&quot;.  Our primary legislation would seem to be clear that an occupational illness is covered by the Act and is, therefore, reportable to the HSA, which has statutory responsibility &quot;to promote, encourage and foster the prevention of accidents, dangerous occurrences and personal injury at work in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions&quot;<i>, </i>as per section 34(1) of the Act.<br/><br/>Some years ago, a report entitled A Review of the Occupational Diseases Reporting System in the Republic of Ireland was prepared for the HSA by Professor Anne Drummond of UCD.  The report recommended:</p> <blockquote> 	[A]<i></i>review [of] the requirements of the Notification of Accidents Regulations to require that employers report accidents resulting in personal injury (including disease and illness) or death, and record occupational diseases and work-related illnesses contracted as a result of an exposure over a period of time to risk factors arising from work activity, and report to the HSA when requested. </blockquote> <p>Notwithstanding this, a position was adopted regarding the reporting of accidents in an amendment to the general application regulations in 2016.  These regulations were made pursuant to section 58 of the 2005 Act and impose an obligation on employers to report accidents and dangerous occurrences in the workplace.  However, unlike the Act and the recommendations from the report, the regulations, at regulation 224, define the term &quot;personal injury&quot; as not including &quot;any disease, occupational illness or any impairment of mental condition&quot;.  In other words, disease and illness were specifically excluded.  It is not entirely clear why this view was adopted, but the effect of the provision is that employers are not obliged to report occurrences of occupational disease or illness.  This is in contrast to accidents whereby employers are obliged to report to the HSA any accidents resulting in more than three days' absence from work.<br/><br/>The Bill seeks to address this deficiency in workplaces incidences of Covid-19 and would assist in protecting all workers by requiring all workplaces to comply with the minimum requirements of the biological agents directive.  While some might contend that this directive applies only to a restricted range of workers, such as those in laboratories, there is no such stipulation in the legislation.  We would maintain that the legislation clearly covers all contexts in which workers might be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and thus at risk of infection and Covid-19 disease.  There is no justification for making a distinction between workplaces in a pandemic of this nature.<br/><br/>The suggestion that reporting would expose employers to litigation has been advanced by some in government as a concern.  Such a concern is misplaced and is a conflation of two entirely different legal consequences.  The HSA inspects, advises, recommends and issues advisory notices.  Only in cases of absolute non-compliance does it prosecute.  Litigation is reliant on proof of negligence.  The requirement to report is a long way short of admission of negligence.  The argument is a diversion from the absolute responsibility of the Legislature to protect workers in their workplaces.  We believe it is important, therefore, that there be a direct reporting requirement to the national authority charged with responsibility for health and safety in our workplaces.  Workers want nothing more than a safe place to work and, therefore, ICTU supports the Bill.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for their submissions and contributions.  This proposed legislation is sponsored by me.  I will not say it close to my heart, but it is a little bit.  The Bill, as we know, arose from conversations during April and May last year regarding a request made by ICTU to introduce an amendment to ensure that Covid-19 becomes a notifiable disease.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses for their views on the previous situation.  I will refer briefly to a contribution from another Deputy to the Covid committee.  He referenced the previous regulations from 2007.  We know that in 2016 a change was made to remove infectious diseases from the regulations.  Do the witnesses have a view on why that was changed and what the potential implications would be if we reverted to the pre-2016 situation?  I am easy about who goes first.  Perhaps they can go in the order in which they spoke earlier.</p></speech>

The pre-2016 regulations were introduced when we amended the general applications regulations for the purposes of the reporting of accidents and incidents.  At the time occupational illnesses were not included as part of the definition of "personal injury".  One reason for that was that we introduced the amendment to put a stronger emphasis on the reporting of accidents and incidents at that time and made sure that people reported them to us so that the regulation had that particular driver.</p> <p>  At the same time, there was no defined list of occupational illnesses at national or European level.  In terms of the intention of the board when it reviewed the regulatory impact analysis at the time and made the recommendations to the Minister regarding the legislation, it was felt that without a defined list, it would be difficult for employers to identify with any degree of certainty an occupational illness.  The key point regarding personal injury and the definitions used in the Act is that they must be attributable to work.  It is not simply the case that somebody has an occupational illness; it has to be attributable to work.  That is a key factor in that regard.</p> <p>  Part of the current regulatory impact analysis involves an option that might include an amendment to section 224 of the 2016 regulations.  We are examining that, and that could come forward in due course.  It would require reporting.  However, the challenge will still remain as to whether an employer can, with any degree of certainty, confirm that Covid-19 was caught by a worker in a workplace and attributable to the work activity that was going on.  That remains a challenge if the legislation is changed or that definition is introduced.  </p> <p>  We get notice of all of the cases and outbreaks of Covid in workplaces.  We are part of a number of outbreak control teams established by public health.  Ultimately, public health manages an outbreak and we are there to support and guide.  While there is an absolute priority for worker health and safety, and the protection of that, when there is an outbreak we are very much mindful of that.  Equally, it is important to manage an outbreak because we do not want the disease to move out to the community.  There is a higher public health requirement.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

In my opening remarks I mentioned that we were not entirely clear why the amendment was introduced in the way it was 2016.  I have no particular insight on that, bar the fact that there seemed to be resistance to doing that.</p> <p>  A couple of speakers have remarked on the fact that we have a community incidence of Covid-19, and that is probably the preponderance of cases we have the State.  Nobody is denying that.  Clearly, we have had clusters of infection in workplaces, not only necessarily in the highlighted areas such as healthcare, but also last year, tragically in a number of our meat factories.  Sometimes I suspect that the concentration on such cases mitigates the occurrences in other sectors.  Cases are happening across the board.</p> <p>  With all occupational diseases, not just Covid-19, there can be difficulties in determining precisely what has occurred in an occupational context as opposed to some other source, be it wider environmental factors or whatever.  It seems to be the case that many other jurisdictions have come up with ways of dealing with that, and an evidence-based approach is taken.  Over the past year various other countries have adopted essentially a basis of likelihood with regard to Covid-19.  The argument that one cannot determine the source of the infection brings us into a blind alley.  There are ways of determining probability and likelihood.  I do not think that is a sufficient reason to refuse to-----</p></speech>

It is not credible to say that the amendment is not required purely and simply because it might place an administrative burden on someone or might be hard to prove, because the systems can be put in place to determine what has happened.  We know, for example, that community transmission is a significant factor, but it would be foolish to pretend that it is only community transmission.  There are people who have acquired this infection in their workplace, and I do not think anybody would contradict that.  In a scenario whereby they had contracted Covid-19 in the workplace, their employer is currently not obligated to deal with that.  We need to place that obligation on the employer.</p> <p>  The purpose of this engagement is to tease out the potential implications of the passage of the legislation and to ensure that we robustly engage with any of the issues identified.  I ask Mr. Vaughan to outline his opinion on the notion that somehow the possibility that an administrative burden might be placed upon an employer would be sufficient reason not to proceed with this.  I do not accept that.  Employers would not necessarily be resistant to an administrative burden if it improved the health and safety of their staff.  In my experience, and as a former union official, the vast majority of employers want their workers to be safe.  Not only that, they want to be able to loudly proclaim that and have it on the public record.</p> <p>  There is a reason some workplaces have been singled out for special attention during this pandemic, with meat factories, nursing homes and hospitals being the top three.  Nobody is suggesting that the reason they were singled out for special attention was they happen to be located in areas where there is a high level of community transmission.  In fact, the reason these workplaces have been singled out for specific and special attention is they have become sites of transmission.  I contend that where this has happened and infections have been acquired in a workplace, that should be treated as an occupational illness purely and simply because it is an illness a person acquired in the conduct of his or her work.</p> <p>  The point made by Congress is important.  That is not an admission of or proof of negligence on behalf of any employer, in the same way that any workplace injury or illness is not negligence.  Negligence is not automatically assumed.</p><p>I was alarmed to read some of the submissions where the two were linked in that this will automatically mean that negligence is proven.  This is not the case as negligence is proven in many forums.  In the opinion of our witnesses, it is true to say that Covid-19 is acquired in the workplace?  If one does not call it an occupational illness or workplace injury, what would one call it if it is contracted in the course of one's work?  I am aware that in the regulations, diseases like contact dermatitis are mentioned.  Again, one has to prove that it was contracted in the workplace and it could have been contracted elsewhere.  In all likelihood this is probably a good enough definition but I am interested to hear the views of our witnesses on what we should say when someone contracts the disease in the workplace because people do and it has been happening.  The proof of that is the fact that we have had several types of work singled out for particular and special attention.  Could I have our witnesses views on that point starting, perhaps, with the Health and Safety Authority, the HSE, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, if that is okay?</p></speech>

The idea of an occupational illness acquired in the workplace is one thing but being attributable to work is another aspect of all of the considerations we have regard to in the Act.  Even the HSE in its earlier statement said that certain cases can be attributed directly to work and that is what should be reported and recorded.</p> <p>  On the data that we receive through the public health computerised infectious disease reporting system, CIDR, we already have the high level element of what is happening in a workplace in the numbers of workers who will have contracted Covid-19.  This allows us to respond appropriately in those aspects.  In that respect we are supportive of looking at and ensuring that employers and others are clear as to what is attributable to work and how they can report that fully and legitimately.  That is already in play in the biological agents regulations, as I have already said, but equally, we are looking at it in the wider context for other workplaces through the regulatory impact analysis that is ongoing.</p></speech>

If a fourth source of information is being contemplated, it is because it is necessary.  The issues around administrative burden, etc., will apply in the circumstances where a fourth set of information is introduced.  That is not a good enough reason not to proceed.</p> <p>   As my time is very short, I see that Mr. Hughes from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has his hand up and I am unsure if that is to respond to this point here.</p></speech>

It is an important feature.  Reporting is not necessarily just about the individual cases but is about surveillance.  We know, for example, that in the last week the epidemiology reports are indicating that although most of the economy is closed, there were 19 outbreaks in workplaces.  If one considers hospitals, healthcare facilities and residential facilities, there were 16 outbreaks.  That is where the health service is fully operational and where workplaces are practically closed.  We have an issue with clusters in workplaces and the surveillance that a requirement to report would give would assist the public health authorities, but as importantly from the point of view of workers, would demonstrate that this State is taking seriously its responsibilities to protect workers in their workplace.  The arguments that have been made, it seems to me, are that workers must wait.  That is a familiar argument.  Workers cannot wait as their health, safety, welfare and their very lives are at risk when the economy opens up if there is not a proper reporting mechanism to deal with outbreaks in workplaces.</p> <p>  The other argument that has been suggested is that the information is already available.  Perhaps it is already available but there is no requirement to drill down into that information.  For example, we can say that it is in particular sectors but we cannot get to the meat, and more particularly the workers or their representatives do not find out the actual locations unless it becomes public knowledge.  The information being available and a requirement on the State to act are not the same thing and in this case they definitely are not.  </p> <p>  A further argument that is being made is that, essentially, a worker has to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that they got it in their workplace.  That is surely too high a standard in a pandemic.  The number of healthcare workers who have currently contracted the disease is 28,038, as reported yesterday.  The majority of them were not reported to the Health and Safety Authority because there was no requirement to do so until the 24 November 2020, when the European directive became enforceable in every country.  </p> <p>  We have a problem here and it is putting our heads in the sand to say that taking the requirement to report disease in 2016 was appropriate when we are now in a pandemic.  This amendment would put this requirement back there and it should be back there.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I am not opposed to enhancing reporting requirements when the added value is clear but I believe that the added value is lacking in this Bill.  Both Dr. McGuinness and Mr. Parkinson have made it clear to me that the reporting systems which are already in place are significant.  Strengthening those systems by providing additional resources to ensure that they are fully implemented seems to me a more prudent route than creating more layers within the system.  My colleague from Kildare North, Deputy Lawless, spoke previously in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the Bill.  Members of all parties and none have broadly agreed during this pandemic that our path must be shaped by expert advice so the very clear reservations that both Dr. McGuinness and Mr. Parkinson have outlined this morning should give us all food for thought as to what exact benefits will derive from the Bill.</p> <p>  I recognise the point made by Dr. McGuinness that it could prove very difficult for employers to judge whether an employee contracting Covid-19 did so in his or her workplace and therefore should be reported.  Obviously, there have been some clear cases of workplace outbreaks that we are all aware of but of the people I know who have contracted Covid-19, the vast majority have no idea where it was transmitted to them.  Their employers, therefore, would not have been in a position to judge in a majority of cases.</p> <p>  We should also note that the vast majority of businesses have acted responsibly throughout the pandemic by following all public health advice, despite the crippling impact on their businesses.  Too often businesses are spoken of in extremely negative tones on the basis of actions by a small minority or handful of businesses in the entire country.  Having been an employer for most of my life, I would be very conflicted if an employee advised that he or she had contracted Covid-19 but did not wish me to inform anybody else.  On the one hand the Bill would require me to do so but on the other hand I presume doing so against the express wishes of an employee may cause a breach of GDPR requirements.</p><p>These are issues that large companies with expert legal advice may be able to find the right solution for.  However, for the sector that I represent, the SMEs, which are the backbone of the Irish economy, such a scenario would be challenging and adds considerable cost and burden.  These companies need clarity from State bodies as to their requirements and this is lacking from the Bill in its current format.</p><p> We all want to protect workers and we all agree that under no circumstances should anyone work in an unsafe workplace or in a workplace that causes significant risks to one's health.  We need to equally ensure that the administrative, and potentially the financial burdens placed on employers by the State do not result in workers no longer having a workplace.  Businesses up and down the country are battling to survive a crisis that, as we are all aware, is not of their own making.  The last thing they need is additional burdens being imposed on them by the State, particularly where the added value is "questionable", which is what we heard this morning on the basis of expert views.  Having said that, if the Bill is to progress I suggest that we may be better served by considering the broader category of infectious diseases, rather than limiting the matter to Covid-19.  I appreciate, as we all do, that Covid-19 is a challenge we are currently facing but a broader Bill may leave us in a better position in the long term.</p></speech>

That is an obligation in the public health regulations.  The idea that an employer would be breaching GDPR regulations is stretching it.  The reality is we are dealing with a pandemic and with something that is conveyed from one human to another.  We must all work to ensure that wherever there are outbreaks, be they in households, workplaces, hospitals or institutions, they can be dealt with in a way that suppresses the virus.</p> <p>  I agree that the wider question of removing regulation 224, as the Senator has suggested, is a bigger issue and that needs to be dealt with.  The 2007 report by Professor Anne Drummond of UCD did not suggest that it should be withdrawn from the Act.  It was an original requirement in the Act that disease would be reportable.  That requirement was taken out in 2016 and the HSA is conducting an RIA on that.  The reality is that Covid is rampant.  Lots of workplaces are looking to get staff back in and if we do not get a reportable system then our ability to control this disease is lessened and workers are less protected.</p></speech>

A reporting system of any sort will support that goal but it does not prevent us going ahead and making sure there are other systems in place to support and protect workers, particularly in relation to Covid-19.  We inspect and provide advice, support and guidance directly to employers and employees.  We have a workplace contact unit that is available to all employees if they have any concerns about their health and safety in the workplace.  That is still our driver and that will continue whether we have two systems, one system or five systems.  That will always be our ultimate driver.</p> <p>  On the wider context of that, we are looking at occupational illness in a general sense.  We have been looking under our current strategy to have better recording and reporting because it is something that needs to be addressed in the wider context.  The decision around the 2016 regulations was taken by our tripartite board, which is made up of employer, employee and other stakeholders and the board made a recommendation to the Minister in due course.  We have done a lot of consultation, we will continue to do that consultation and whatever the outcome from the discussions here is, we will take that on board and implement it when and if necessary.</p></speech>

Was it based on the evidence that is being suggested, that the three existing systems are a better way of tracking this or what was the background to that decision?</p> <p>  Perhaps additional reporting restrictions or obligations by employers are not the way to go here.  As we start to reopen the economy - and as other speakers have said, most of the economy is closed - what are the new expectations of employers?  Is the HSA modifying its guidelines in respect of antigen testing, for example, which seems to be on the verge of being accepted as a tool?  Is the HSA offering new advice to employers?</p> <p>  On the other side, the profile of risk from this virus changes significantly as we vaccinate those over 70 and those who are vulnerable to illnesses.  How will this change the HSA's view towards workplaces and the safety of opening workplaces?</p> <p>  Does the HSA have adequate experience with employers in respect of cases that are unearthed?  If the HSA is not finding it adequate, is it due to deficiencies in its powers or what is the situation?</p></speech>

I mentioned the 2016 regulations and we made that particular amendment because there was a low level of reporting of workplace accidents in general at that stage under the 2011 regulations.  We needed to make sure that was increased so we had proposed an amendment.  A regulatory impact analysis was completed as part of that particular legislative process.  At the time of the RIA, we identified that there were difficulties for employers in assessing and attributing disease or illness to a workplace activity and that there were concerns there.  Therefore, at the time the board of the authority decided, after all the considerations, not to put in the requirement for the reporting of occupational illness onto the issues where it developed it at a national and EU level.  We have kept and will continue to keep that under review as matters go forward.</p> <p>  On new advice, the HSA has a responsibility under the work safety protocol.  We have worked closely with colleagues on the employee and employer side in the initial development of the return to work safely protocol and then the later work safety protocol.  Together with a range of other inspection bodies, we are involved in the inspection and checking of adherence to the work safety protocol.  The detail in that protocol is at every stage predicated on the public health advice.  As that changes, the advice in the protocol changes.  The general premise and framework is for employers and employees to work together to make sure: there is a Covid response plan in place; people are informed and trained; and there is a lead worker representative in place to support the employer and other workers.  This is done in order to protect and prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace.</p><p>That is very much there and obviously any changes to the public health advice would be reflected in that particular document.  Obviously, as more people are vaccinated in the wider community - it is not an area for which we have responsibility - the case numbers go down generally.  That can have a beneficial effect in the workplace.  Likewise, when workers in particular sectors such as healthcare also get vaccinated, that also protects them.  Ultimately, we are still very much minded to continue our roll-out of the advice, support and inspections that we do for Covid, whatever stage the vaccination programme is at.  The important thing is to maintain keeping Covid out of workplaces but, equally, supporting public health in the wider community response to outbreaks of it.</p><p> Our general experience with employers and our inspections has all been positive.  Employers are happy to see us when we check protocols.  They are pleased to show us how they have done the job and how they are putting in place the necessary public health measures.  When there are specific outbreaks of Covid in a workplace, we support the public health management of that outbreak.  Sometimes we go in as the boots on the ground into particular workplaces such as the meat processing, retail, manufacturing or construction sectors.  We go in to support the public health officials to ensure their recommendations are put in place.  It has been a positive engagement.  Throughout this, all of the discussions between public health and occupational health have been done generally with employee and employer considerations on board.  Both sides have been supportive and engaged in those discussions throughout the process of managing Covid.</p></speech>

I also thank Deputy O'Reilly for putting forward this matter as it has provided us with an opportunity to examine and tease out this issue.</p><p>Who is doing the RIA, and when will it be finalised?  Dr. McGuinness said the Health and Safety Authority receives weekly data reports on Covid-19 workplace outbreaks.  These are based on medically confirmed and validated data.  How does that work?  Will she talk us through exactly how those reports get to the authority?  Who is responsible for informing the authority and where do they get the information?  Is there any obligation on employers to report Covid in the workplace?</p><p>There is a small contradiction in some of the evidence.  I apologise if I am misquoting him but I think I heard Mr. Hughes say that employees have an obligation to tell an employer if they have Covid-19.  In the Health and Safety Authority submission, however, it is stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The amendment may leave employers with an obligation, which they may not reasonably or legally be able to fulfil, as there is no counter-obligation on employees to provide detailed confidential medical information to their employer.  Creating a requirement for employers to capture and report alleged incidents of COVID-19 to a third party may also have GDPR implications. </blockquote> <p>There is a contradiction.  I am not sure which of the two is correct.  Does an employee have an obligation to tell his or her employer that he or she has Covid-19?  In that instance, I am also aware of the advice we all have heard that, if a person thinks he or she has the symptoms, then that person is asked to stay at home and get a test by the public health people.  If somebody has the symptoms, are they obliged to tell their employer about it?  How is Covid-19 reported to the Health and Safety Authority?  Is it from the public health people, the employer or the employee?</p><p>Should the employer have permission from the worker to report he or she has Covid-19?  For example, say I am working in a particular facility and I contract Covid-19.  Should the employer simply report a case of Covid-19 in the workplace or go further to report David Stanton has Covid-19?</p></speech>

An employee in the original Act cannot put colleagues at risk.  They are obliged to avoid putting their colleagues at risk.  Labour lawyers and trade union officials of experience take the view that such an obligation in a pandemic requires Covid-19 to be reported to a person's employer.  If a person is symptomatic, if a person suspects he or she has it or if the public health authorities say he or she has it, that person would be obliged to report it.  By not doing so, that person would be putting his or her colleagues at risk and an employer would be entitled to move against such an employee in that situation.  There is an obligation without doubt to report to one's employer.</p> <p>  On the question of permission to report, given the employee has an obligation to tell his or her employer, the employer then would not have to seek GDPR concerns in respect of reporting it to a State authority where the obligation would be there to do so.  I do not believe these are real issues.  As we are dealing with a pandemic, these matters have to be addressed with a level of urgency not there at the moment.</p></speech>

One comprises the reporting regulations from the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application)(Amendment)(No.2) Regulations 2016.  This deals with the reporting of accidents and incidents to the authority.  The other one is the reporting under the Safety Health and Welfare at Work (Biological Agents) Regulations 2013, amended in 2020 to include the virus SARS-CoV-2.  It is specific to Covid-19 because it requires reporting by the employer to the authority where there is occupational exposure and it is attributable to the individual worker who has contracted Covid-19.</p> <p>  There is also separately the public health system.  Covid is an occupational issue and is ultimately a global public health pandemic.  The driver for Covid comes under the public health infectious disease regulations, which have been amended to require the reporting of Covid as an infectious disease.  Every time somebody gets tested, that detail is put into the computerised system, CIDR, established and run by Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  Those are the data everybody sees daily and weekly with facts and numbers.  The information in that database comes from the public health medical side.  Everybody who has a positive PCR test would be reported to that system.</p> <p>  We get that directly from the HPSC every week.</p><p>The HPSC updates the information up to the previous weekend, and we get it every Tuesday meaning that it is live and realistic.  There is also other reporting.  We are a member of the national standing oversight committee on high-risk sectors, which include construction, meat processing and food manufacturing as well as some other manufacturing plants.  A number of employer groups and ICTU are also members of that committee.  We get data from it on particular cases in those workplaces.</p><p> The third system I mentioned was the national incident management system, NIMS, which was set up by the State Claims Agency.  It is effectively a system for the public healthcare system to report incidents.  We have access to those data if and as required in that context.</p></speech>

I support the Bill.  Workplace infections are a driving factor in Covid, but that has been hidden by the inadequacies of our testing and tracing regime.  If one looked at current Covid hotspots geographically, one would find that they map fairly well onto geographical centres with meat plants.  There is a more general point to be made, though.  According to traffic data, it looks like twice as many people travel to work now as did during the first lockdown.  It is the main reason people are leaving their houses and interacting with others, thereby getting and spreading the virus.  The Government has been at pains to underplay this element.  At some stage, the T&aacute;naiste told our committee - he later retracted this - that people were safer at work than they were at home, the idea being that the virus somehow generated by itself at home.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for Dr. McGuinness.  If I am a worker and I consider that my employer is not essential but is open nonetheless, can the HSA do anything for me in terms of getting the employer shut down?</p></speech>

We do not have a specific role in determining what is open or not at any one time.  That is a Government decision based on public health advice.  If a business is open but is not essential or providing an essential service in line with the list provided, the Garda has responsibility for closing it down.  Obviously, we get complaints in this regard.  We advise people in response and engage with the Garda as appropriate, but we do not have a duty in respect of what is open or deemed essential.  However, we would inspect any open business in terms of its Covid responsibility under the protocol.</p></speech>

That has been the advice throughout the pandemic.  Any worker who has concerns can get in touch with our workplace contact unit.  We will respond to any complaint and provide support as appropriate.  If a worker has a concern, we can examine the matter and contact the employer to reflect that concern.  Ultimately, however, it is a discussion and, aside from contacting us, the worker may be able to bring it to the attention of the lead worker representative and others in the workplace.  The decision as to what is open or essential is not one on which we have the ability to make a call.  However, we can support the worker through advice and guidance.</p></speech>

Let us forget about the question of essential.  The issue is that I as a worker was allowed to work from home during the first lockdown and can safely do so, but as appears to be the case for many workers, I am being compelled this time around to go into work.  The HSA has advised workers that it is at their employer's discretion whether they return to work, given that the Return to Work Safely Protocol has been developed to ensure a safe return to work for all staff.  Is it not the case that the HSA can effectively do nothing for me?  It cannot force, fine or inspect an employer that is not allowing workers to work from who could be safely doing so.</p></speech>

As such, we would have to consider that.  If we receive a complaint about issues in a workplace that is open and operating but where the worker feels he or she should not be there, we can carry out an inspection to determine whether systems are in place to enable the worker to work safely.  The question of whether the employer should be open or making people come to work is for the employer and the employee.  We and the Government are requesting those conversations to be had and all sides to support that process.</p></speech>

I very much support the Bill.  The INMO, Congress, SIPTU and others made clear last year their express desire for this amending legislation and they indicated there is a serious deficiency with regard to the reporting legislation.  I have three specific questions.  The first is for the representatives from the HSE.  I want to understand better what happens when there is a report of Covid-19.  What are the criteria for deciding to assess the sequencing of the genes where there is a presentation with Covid-19?  It was stated it is sometimes possible to link a healthcare worker infection with the workplace with great confidence based on the sequencing of the genes.  In what cases does this happen?  Does it happen for all workplace outbreaks?  Does it happen for outbreaks in the community?  Are there set criteria?</p> <p>  My next question is specifically for the representatives from the HSE.  Is the reluctance on the part of the HSE with regard to this Bill related to the resources required to undertake the additional work on gene sequencing of the virus?</p></speech>

I might hand over to my colleague Professor Cormican to provide further information on this.  The Senator stated she wants to gain a better understanding.  Safety and the reporting of incidents are matters we take very seriously.  We have strongly promoted this within the HSE because we find information is power and that the more information we have, the better we can manage the risk.  We treat Covid not necessarily as an illness but as an occupational hazard.  We manage it in the context of health and safety legislation as well as infection control legislation.</p> <p>  Regarding the reporting procedure where there is a case, we first get the full details of the case.  The manager would get the details to fully understand what has happened and report them on the national incident management system, which is our internal reporting system.  As part of the data-collection and investigation process, the manager would refer to an algorithm we have developed to make a decision as to whether we feel the infection is occupational.  Once the manager has made that decision using the algorithm, we make a report to the HSA, if appropriate.</p> <p>  As I said in our opening statement, we do collect the data and we are certainly not resisting in any way the collection of data on the Covid incidence.  We feel there is good machinery already in place for the reporting of the Covid incidence.  I hope that answers the first part of the Senator's query.  If Professor Cormican is still on the line, could I hand over to him to discuss the question on gene sequencing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Martin Cormican" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021033000002#J00600"><p>Sequencing is resource intensive.  The capacity of Ireland to do sequencing has increased greatly over recent months but it does require resources.  At the moment, where there is an outbreak in a healthcare or hospital setting, we recommend that the sample from the first case be sent for sequencing if it is suitable for sequencing.  There are technical requirements to be considered.  Sometimes samples cannot be sequenced for technical purposes and then additional samples are used as required.  A judgment is made as to whether the sequencing is likely to be informative.  As Mr. Parkinson said, all the circumstances are taken into account, after which a question arises as to whether sequencing would be useful.  No country would have the capacity to sequence all the viruses at the moment, to my knowledge.  Our capacity is probably similar to that of other countries but it is used selectively where it is likely to be informative.  The comment made in our statement was more by way of explaining that in certain circumstances one can be very confident the virus was acquired at the workplace.  For example, if a group of patients in a ward or nursing home are all infected with virus with a specific genetic sequence and the exact same fingerprint is found in the workers on the ward, it puts it beyond all reasonable doubt that the infection is workplace related.  That, however, would not be done universally in any setting.  It is helpful in some cases and in others it is not.  Sometimes there appears to be a relationship with the workplace but when one looks at the genetic fingerprint, one finds out it is not connected to the workplace because the fingerprint is distinct.  Sequencing is not done routinely but selectively.  It is useful but not useful in isolation.  It is not used in isolation but it is used, as Mr. Parkinson said, in the context of all the other circumstances.</p></speech>

I am conscious that I probably have very little time left in my slot.  I have a question each for the representatives of the HSA and Congress.  With regard to the HSA, it was stated that a number of workplaces are open and that it is hoped a much larger number will be open in the coming weeks and months.  I note the representatives' concerns about the Bill and what they called the onerous responsibility on employers with regard to it.  I want to understand the sense that the HSA feels the legislation will be onerous on itself.  One inspector was taken on by the HSA in the second half of 2020 and one was taken on in 2021.  I understand two are being recruited.  Is there a resource issue in the HSA resulting in its reticence and concerns relating to this Bill?

The HSA has resources assigned for reporting under the biological agent regulations and, indeed, for assessment and analysis of the weekly reports from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  In that regard, we have assigned resources.  If any reporting system is put in place, we will make sure the reporting requirements are put into play.  For example, much of the current reporting on accidents is already done online.  We would be doing something similar to reduce the burden on both ourselves and others who have also to report.</p> <p>  We are in the process of recruiting.  We got &euro;4.2 million from the Government last year for additional resources and we have got sanctions for significant numbers of inspectors.  We are currently in the process of recruiting those.  Resources may be challenging in the short term but, as with every aspect of Covid, we have prioritised our work to make sure we are able to address Covid whenever and however we can in that regard.</p><p> I will hand over now as I do not want to go over my time.</p></speech>

That is the difficulty with it.  I think the regulatory impact assessment, RIA, going through the HSA will take so long that the Covid emergency may well have passed and workers will feel the Act will not have been used to protect them.  I think that opinion is fairly widespread within the workforce.  Remember, 19 workplace infections and the economy is practically closed.  The figure is 16 in healthcare-related activities and that is last week.</p></speech>

I thank all the speakers for coming here today, and for their presentations and comments on Deputy O'Reilly's Bill.  The Bill opens up discussion about the progress which needs to be made in reporting Covid cases, working conditions in certain workplaces, and the need for statutory sick pay.  I understand from the witnesses' presentations that there are three different ways of reporting cases for which the employer is responsible.  How quickly can an employer report a case and what is the actual process of reporting?  Reporting of Covid cases needs to be done in a time-sensitive manner and we need to ensure there is no unnecessary bureaucracy involved.</p> <p>  My main point is about sick pay.  The safety of workers and wider society is the priority here and I think we all agree on that.  However, it would be naive not to acknowledge many workers in workplaces, such as meat processing plants, do not have sick pay schemes, which could deter them from reporting their symptoms or getting tested for fear of being without a salary for weeks and not being able to make ends meet.  The solution is clearly the introduction of statutory sick pay, which I believe is currently being progressed and reviewed by the T&aacute;naiste.  However, I want to hear from the witnesses about their engagement with workers and whether they think this is a contributing factor to clusters and levels of Covid cases.  What can potentially be done in the interim period?  I invite the three witnesses to give their opinion on sick pay.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in that the absence of an immediate sick pay, particularly during the pandemic, is a real problem.  Workers on very low incomes are in a massive dilemma because they will be without income if they report symptoms.  There is a big problem with the suppression of the virus and the information that would lead to controlling the virus in the absence of sick pay.  We are long overdue a proper sick pay scheme for workers.</p></speech>

This is about anything that protects the workers and makes them feel comfortable not going to work.  The advice is that anyone who has symptoms of Covid should not go to work because it protects not only himself or herself but also the other workers.  That advice is very clear.  The systems in place to enable that and to protect the worker by allowing him or her to stay at home while sick are vitally important and obviously sick leave is part of that.</p> <p>  There were some comments made earlier and to be clear, the protection of workers is our ultimate concern.  We already have three reporting systems, which gives us quite a high level of information on what is happening in workplaces.  Not all of them are coming directly from the employers but that does not prevent our organisation from taking the necessary steps to support and prevent, and protect our workers from Covid-19 in the workplace.  We are mindful that any reporting system is just one part of our extensive set of approaches that we use at all times.  We are not waiting for a report in order to act at any stage in that regard either.</p></speech>

However, we actively discourage workers with symptoms from coming to work for the reasons outlined by the Deputy.</p></speech>

This is an important Bill.  Sick pay is really important in a general sense because there is much that can be done around sick pay.  In relation to this Bill specifically, Covid-19 is already a reportable disease under the biological agents regulations.  As the witnesses have said, there are a few different ways to report it.  Covid-19 can be acquired in any setting and it cannot always be reliably associated with a work activity.  In some cases, such as meat factories, it is clearly to do with the setting while in other settings it is not so clear.  What is the story with the regulatory impact assessment initiated by the board of the HSA?  I do not know where that sits at present  When will it be completed and when can we look at it?  It was on that basis of seeing what the outcome of that would be that they were going to wait and see about this Bill.  On its completion, it will be considered by the board of the HSA and the next steps would be discussed with the Department.  Do the witnesses know what is happening with that or have they answered that question already?  A regulatory impact assessment initiated by the board of the HSA to assist in the consideration of a potential amendment requiring employers to report cases of Covid-19 that are attributable to work activity, to the HSA is ongoing.  I wonder about its status..</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that, I believe there is value in this debate, and I thank everyone for participating this morning and in using this to move forward.  This was something that was raised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions with the Minister a year ago.  It has been raised again and again, repeatedly.  This proposed legislation ensures the change will be made rather than waiting, which is the alternative.  That indicates where it came from.  Obviously, we will consider any result from the RIA and all information is very welcome, but I felt there was a need, as others did, to progress this on the basis that there did not seem to be any progress being made.</p><p>From my perspective, the rationale was to ensure that it becomes a notifiable disease as quickly as possible.  We did not want to hang around or wait, but these things unfortunately take time.  Naturally, the result of the RIA will inform any future deliberations on this.</p></speech>

It has been a really useful discussion.  I will take up from where the previous conversation finished, that is, with the issue of why the regulations changed in 2016.  I think members of the general public will be genuinely quite shocked to hear that right now there is no obligation on employers to notify the HSA of Covid-19 cases.  I wish to drill down into this.  I will direct my first question to Dr. McGuinness.  I thank her for her presentation and her patience this morning.  She said that the issue with changing the regulations was the low number of accidents reported.  That was the HSA's understanding at the time.  The upshot of that issue was that the HSA decided to exclude disease from the definition of workplace accidents.  How was that supposed to improve the reporting of accidents?</p></speech>

To be clear, the amendment was driven primarily at the time by the low numbers of accidents reported.  There are two separate issues because we were looking not only at the accident reporting but equally at the reporting of occupational illness.  As for occupational illness, as I think I said earlier, there was no defined list of occupational illnesses either in European or national legislation and, therefore, it was felt there was a challenge.  As part of the regulatory impact analysis, which was considered by the board at the time, it was felt that it was not clear-cut that an employer would be able to identify with any degree of certainty what an occupational illness was.  Very often an occupational illness, and indeed illness or disease more generally, is referred back to the causative agent.  That can be a chemical or biological agent or whatever, which is why something like the biological agents regulation is important.  It identifies the causative agent of the disease rather than the disease itself.  It therefore protects the worker from the agent itself in the first instance in order that no disease is caused in that regard.</p></speech>

Again, however, if it had come in and there was just a prescribed list of occupational illnesses, it would have to be identified on that in order to give guidance and clarity to employers as to what is reportable and what is not, as the case may be.</p></speech>

They seem to have had no difficulty doing so.  Dr. McGuinness may have seen the addendum to the ICTU presentation, which showed the European Union of Medical Specialists making reference to the need to make Covid an occupational illness.  What is the particular difficulty Ireland has that we cannot adopt best practice being adopted across the rest of Europe, given the context of a pandemic and the more than 4,000 lives we have lost?</p></speech>

That is what all member states will put into force in their countries.  We have looked at this and have talked to colleagues across Europe because we are in various committees and working groups with them.  Many member states are doing similar in that they are identifying Covid as a specific illness for particular sectors.  That is derived directly from the biological agents regulations, which we all have to transpose and implement in that respect.  It is a challenging one, and across European countries very often the issue is still driven by public health.  Again, the nature of the reporting systems in place in countries is driven by the fact that there are different systems in place, not just necessarily under occupational health but in general reporting as well, so they are all interconnected.  We are very much in line with the majority of the member states that have looked at this as a specific illness in the context of specific sectors such as healthcare.</p></speech>

Let us take a meat factory and two workers.  The first worker contracts Covid in the community, at home.  He goes to work because he is asymptomatic and then, unfortunately, passes it on to a second worker.  What are the obligations of the employer in this example?  Does it have to report both people to the HSA as having had a workplace illness of Covid, neither or one of the two?</p></speech>

That would all be done as part of the public health regime and would be reported as part of the CIDR database through the medical officer of health in that regard.  In respect of reporting, meat plants are not working directly with viruses as it is and, therefore, the reporting would not come necessarily directly to us.

What Dr. McGuinness is actually saying is that in a case in which one worker introduces Covid into a factory unknowingly and a further worker then gets it - and that, of course, is how clusters build - at the moment there is no obligation on the employer to report that to the Health and Safety Authority.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, however, the reality is that there are three reporting regimes already in place and we are looking at a fourth - and discussing a potential fifth one here - so there are systems already in place that we can avail of to know where those cases are such that we can address them appropriately.</p></speech>

If it is an outbreak, very often in meat plants we will be involved in the outbreak control team set up by the departments of public health to support them in the management of the outbreak.  In addition, as part of the national standing oversight committee, we get the list every week of all the outbreaks in meat plants, construction sites and other high-risk sectors.</p></speech>

What Dr. McGuinness told us two minutes ago is that there is no obligation on the employer to report the two cases in the example I gave her.  That appears to me to be a major gap.  How does it make sense for employers not to have an obligation to report employees with Covid in the workplace?</p><p>That question is for the HSA.</p></speech>

The most robust system, therefore, for tracking Covid in anybody, whether a worker or someone else, is the public health infectious diseases requirement and reporting through the CIDR database.  Even if an employer does not report directly to us and whether there is legislation requiring that, we still have access to all of that information to enable us to identify particular workplaces and sectors where there are issues arising.</p></speech>

We have a system in place for that under the biological agents regulation.  We have allowed people to report issues in as streamlined a manner as possible.  Again, they would have to get all of that detail together and put it in one place.  The driver for anybody in the midst of an outbreak or case of Covid in a worker is to suppress and prevent the further spread, not just in the workplace but also in the community.</p></speech>

I am not in any way convinced that this will place a massive administrative burden on employers.  I am a small bit concerned that perhaps the HSA would come in and say this on the basis that employers can answer for themselves.  Indeed, they have made a submission.</p> <p>  In terms of the practicalities of the administrative burden, there is already an online system.  Reporting a Covid case would feed into the same system.  When one thinks about what is considered an administrative burden, one probably thinks about people drowning in loads of paperwork.  In fact, it seems that the HSA has gone to considerable effort to streamline this process, and fair play to it for that.  Presumably if the amendment was passed, it would mean that another illness would be added to an existing process.  Am I correct in thinking that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sharon McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021033000002#M00800"><p>As I said, we use an online process.  The administrative burden is not solely somebody entering data on a sheet of paper or sending them into us; it is in addition to that.  Every case of Covid has to be looked at in the context of it being attributable to a workplace.  Even if there is an amendment, as we have discussed, the reality is that it still has to be attributable to work.  The employer needs to be assured, therefore, and perhaps take the time to assess, whether an employee contracted Covid in the workplace as part of his or her work activity rather than contracting it outside of work and bringing it in.  That is probably where the bulk of the administrative challenges lie for employers.</p></speech>

It does not appear that the administrative burden would be so large as to discourage an employer from doing that.  The information and exercise of collating that information would be extremely valuable.</p></speech>

As I have said, public health has the duty, first and foremost, to manage that outbreak, wherever it is, and work with an employer and representatives, as appropriate, to suppress the outbreak.  That has and is being done as part of that work.  The data that come to us have been through that process.</p></speech>

It crosses over with the argument that this is an additional administrative burden if Dr. McGuinness is in a position to say it is already being done.  She can see why we are struggling with that concept.  Employers will have to do something they are already doing.  She said all of the information is already available, albeit without an obligation to report directly to the HSA, and, on the flip side, there is an additional burden.  That argument seems to be counter-intuitive.</p></speech>

Who is preparing the RIA?  Is it somebody in the HSA?</p> <p>  I want to go back to the point I made on what the HSA said, namely, that there is no counter-obligation on employees to provide detailed confidential medical information to their employer.  Congress officials seemed to contradict that and have said there is.  If the HSA is correct, an employee could be in the workforce with Covid.  As Deputy Duffy said, he or she might not want to tell people he or she has it and could be spreading it.</p> <p>  I would like to get to the bottom of an important matter, namely, whether there is a legal obligation on employees to tell an employer or their colleagues that they have Covid.  The HSA might say a bit more about the GDPR implications in that regard.</p> <p>  Something struck me.  The reports from CIDR and the HPSC are issued weekly.  Is that a long period before information is received?  We get daily reports from the Department and others.  The HSA receives information on a weekly basis, but an awful lot can happen in a week.</p> <p>  As far as the HPSC reporting is concerned, can Dr. McGuinness tell me exactly how a workplace is  identified?  Are those data captured initially from the person who presents to a doctor and then has a positive Covid test?  Does the workplace information state that a person works in a particular workplace?  Is the information passed on at that stage?</p></speech>

KPMG has supported us in the development of the RIA process.</p> <p>  In terms of the report, we receive that information on a weekly basis.  In terms of weekly reporting it involves about five working days and is fairly flexible.  We also continue to have access to what is online, etc.  Numbers across the board are published on a daily basis for workplaces and community transmission.  The HPSC reports, which anybody can view on its databases or website, show that it breaks down cases across nursing homes, hospitals, education, etc., and there is then a catch-all group called "workplaces", which is broken down into construction, food and meat processing.  We get all of that information.  Within each of those categories the specific location of the outbreak is identified, whether that is the name of a hospital, factory or whatever.  We have that information alongside the caseloads in that regard.</p> <p>  I refer to the point about the worker.  There is an obligation in that regard.</p><p>Obviously, we are all duty-bound when we work with each other to work safely and healthily together and to inform people if there are any measures in respect of which, perhaps, the group health and safety would be at issue.  However, as we all know, when it comes to medical issues, people perhaps want to keep some of that information to themselves and there is a level of sensitivity in personal information in that regard, so it is challenging.</p><p> The other point is that Covid is a challenging disease.  We all know that.  However, we can see, through the numbers and reports by NPHET on many occasions, that the reality is that there can be as many symptomatic as asymptomatic people in the workplace.  That is a challenge because in essence the reporting and identification will only happen with those who are symptomatic.  Again, that could be equally challenging.  We would say that through engagement between employers and employees, everybody should be working to prevent Covid coming into and spreading in the workplace.  Those who are in any way sick should stay at home to stop the spread and should inform their employers.  The other point is that if a worker is tested, the information goes into the public health CIDR system.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021033000002#A00200"><p>I welcome everybody to our public virtual meeting using Microsoft Teams.  I welcome Leo Bollins and Margaret O'Donnell from the secretariat.  I thank the Business Committee for agreeing to this public meeting of the Committee on Public Petitions during the level 5 restrictions.  We have made every effort to mitigate the risk of the new variants of Covid-19 to members, witnesses and staff.</p> <p>  The first part of our meeting with the European Ombudsman is in public session.  At the conclusion of the public session, we will suspend the meeting until 12 noon, at which time we will resume in virtual private session.  Apologies have been received from Senator Warfield.</p> <p>  I will read some formal notices.  Members, witnesses and staff are requested to use the wipes and hand sanitiser provided to clean seats and desks that are shared so as to supplement regular sanitation.  This will help to mitigate the risk of Covid-19 spreading among the parliamentary community.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the places in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  I ask that members make the secretariat aware of whether they are within the precincts of Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.</p> <p>  I wish to explain to the witnesses some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to Ms Emily O'Reilly, the European Ombudsman, who is joining us from Strasbourg.  She is joined by her head of cabinet, Mr. Aidan O'Sullivan, who is in Brussels.  Ms O'Reilly is no stranger to the committee.  In fact, on 20 July 2011, when she was the State Ombudsman, serving a population of 4.6 million people, she was the first witness to address the first Committee on Public Petitions.  Here we are, ten years later, and she has been twice elected as European Ombudsman, serving a population of 448 million people.  Whether we are dealing with a large or a small population or working at local, regional, state or European Union level, we are all facing the same pandemic of Covid-19 and the new devastating variants.</p> <p>  The committee would like to hear about the European Ombudsman's findings on how EU institutions have responded to the Covid-19 crisis, the transparency of the information provided by the institutions and how they have communicated with the public.  The committee is aware that she has been monitoring EU institutions such as the European Council and the European Commission and agencies such as the European Medicines Agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Investment Bank in terms of how they have responded to the pandemic.  The committee would like to discuss how greater transparency could be achieved to maintain the trust of the public.  As EU member states continue to roll out Covid-19 vaccines, the committee looks forward to engaging with Ms O'Reilly on these initiatives and other works carried out by the European Ombudsman on pandemic-related matters.  </p> <p>  I invite Ms O'Reilly to make her opening statement.  She is welcome to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.334" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021033000002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for his warm welcome.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss my work during and in the context of the Covid-19 crisis.  Members do not need me to tell them how challenging this past year has been for everyone.  Those challenges are set to continue for much of 2021 despite the miracle arrival of vaccines developed and authorised with unprecedented speed.  As national politicians, members have had the unenviable task of monitoring life-or-death decisions made by the Government and the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, with no comparable situation in recent memory to guide them.  The balancing of risks and needs has had to be done with little time fully to reflect on outcomes and consequences both short and long term.  I wish members well as they continue that arduous task while also striving to keep themselves and their families safe.</p> <p>  Covid-19 continues to have devastating consequences across Europe and the world and continues to monopolise the attention of governments and public administrations, as well as the societies they serve.  Shortly after the World Health Organization, WHO, declared Europe to be the epicentre of the pandemic, it was obvious that this virus, which has no respect for borders, would be a major challenge for the EU.  For my office, as the watchdog of the EU administration, it was clear that a transnational crisis of this scale would severely test the capacity of the EU institutions, and I began to monitor their response early on, using my powers of own-initiative investigation.  In addition, I also began to receive complaints related to the pandemic and to the EU&rsquo;s response to it. </p> <p>  In April last year, I wrote to the Presidents of the European Commission and the European Council with proposals on how to maintain high transparency standards during the crisis, and especially in the context of emergency or accelerated decision-making procedures and derogations from standard rules on meetings.</p><p>I made the point that during such a major crisis it is even more important that public authorities are open about how they operate and take decisions.  Transparency helps to ensure public trust in, and reinforces the legitimacy of, decision-making processes. <br/><br/>I am sure members are all acutely aware of how during this terrifying time people will constantly seek assurance about what the Government is doing and whether they are being given all the facts necessary to make decisions about their lives and the lives of their families.  Any sign that facts are being hidden, provokes not just distrust but also increased mental stress.  <br/><br/>I received encouraging replies from both institutions that they would indeed prioritise transparency.  However, as the crisis evolved, I considered it important to look in greater detail at some more specific aspects of the EU response and the roles of particular institutions and agencies.  In July, I launched a series of inquiries and initiatives to this end.  One of those concerned the work carried out by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, in gathering and assessing data linked to the pandemic.  As members are likely aware, the ECDC was set up in 2004 in the aftermath of the SARS outbreaks, essentially to help to co-ordinate the EU response to a future and more serious epidemic.  Approximately 30 people in Europe were infected by SARS, a tiny number compared to Covid-19, which may have led to a certain complacency in relation to the necessary powers to be granted to this new agency.  Making it work was not helped, of course, by the fact that the member states retain power over health policy and not the EU.  While the ECDC was gifted a flattering title and lofty ambition, it was not given complementary powers, emerging rather as a weak agency with little independence of action.  It can request health and other data from the member states, but there is no legal obligation on them to supply it.<br/><br/>My inquiry highlighted shortcomings in how the data is communicated to and gathered by the ECDC, both in terms of timing and completeness, and how the centre presents this information to the outside world.  I raised issues, for example, <i>vis-a-vis </i>changing advice on the wearing of face masks and why certain surveys of member state capacity to deal with the crisis were published and others were not.  I made a series of suggestions aimed at promoting greater transparency and better means to enable greater scrutiny of the data and assessments compiled by the ECDC.  Ultimately, however, if the EU wants an agency that can live up to the title of pan-European disease prevention and control, EU legislators will need to reflect on the centre's founding mandate.  Without specific new powers to ensure the completeness and quality of the data it receives from national authorities, it cannot effectively fulfil this role.  It remains to be seen how the proposal from the Commission in this regard will develop.<br/><br/>The second inquiry I opened concerned the Council of the European Union and the transparency of its decision-making.  My inquiry assessed the decision by the Council to derogate temporarily from its rules of procedure during the crisis and the implications this has had for its decision-making process and the transparency of that process.  As members may also be aware, the Council shifted to meeting by videoconference and to taking all decisions by written procedure.  My inquiry found that there was a considerable lack of transparency in how the Council made this fundamental shift to its way of operating.  While the meetings of preparatory bodies in the Council are now more accessible to the public, there are still areas in which the Council should improve and I concluded this inquiry just last week with some suggestions.<br/><br/>In addition to those inquiries, I also engaged with the European Medicines Agency, EMA, the Commission and the European Investment Bank, EIB, about their roles.  I also received a number of complaints related to the transparency of the negotiations for the vaccine procurement scheme, as well as public access to the so-called advance purchase agreements - the contracts that have been subject of so much debate, as member are well aware.  While my inquiries into the requests for public access to the contracts were under way in the form of freedom of information requests, the Commission decided to publish most of these contracts.  As is often the case, it belatedly realised that transparency was not just in the public interest, but in its own interest.<br/><br/>Another recent inquiry concerned a request that the Commission disclose details about the negotiating team in charge of the vaccine contracts.  Given the blame game around vaccine procurement and roll-out, I consider that it is in the Commission's interest to provide greater transparency about the negotiations, including this team, since it is made up predominantly of representatives of national authorities in the member states.  EU citizens need to know the extent to which their governments are involved in the contract deals and that the work is not solely carried out by the Commission.<br/><br/>I hope that my opening statement has provided members with some insight into my work in the context of the Covid-19 crisis.  In the case of Covid-19, it is clear that there is a negative perception of how the EU has responded to the crisis to date.  While the institutions were undoubtedly unprepared for dealing with a health crisis on this scale, it is possibly too easy to blame Brussels without acknowledging that often the real decision-makers reside in the national capitals and not in the so-called Brussels bubble.  The crisis has cast a spotlight on decision-making at EU level and may, in time, influence the future direction of the Union itself as the debate over what should best be done at national level, and what could better be done at Union level, continues with the Covid-19 backdrop as a guide.  As I noted earlier, the EU has no real competence in the area of health policy, which made it very difficult for the institutions to play any role in co-ordinating a response, something my inquiry into the ECDC laid bare.<br/><br/>The joint procurement scheme for vaccines was not without flaws, as we know.  However, it was a first of its kind, with the Commission constrained by the demands of member states concerning which vaccines they wanted and at what price.  The negotiating team was clearly also a joint effort, with national administrations having been active members.  I expect there to be more twists and turns before we finally emerge from this crisis and, as ombudsman, I will likely deal with more complaints.  However, my overriding message to the institutions will remain that conducting their tasks in as transparent a manner as possible is both in the public interest and, as the Commission found out <i>vis-a-vis </i>the vaccine contracts, also very much in its interests.<br/><br/>I look forward to our discussion. Thank you all for listening.  Go raibh maith agaibh.</p></speech>

I agree that there will be many more twists and turns before this awful pandemic is finished.  We have heard terrible stories from all over Europe.  I thank her for her contribution.  Before I allow members in, I would like to ask a couple of questions.</p> <p>  I would welcome Ms O'Reilly's views on the importance of the relationship in ensuring effective collaboration between Ireland and the EU on the EU issues that matter to them most.  This is important in the fight against Covid-19, but it is equally important in other areas of public concern such as the Mercosur trade deal talks, which affect Ireland.  How could this committee and her office could work together for the mutual benefit of the people of Ireland and the EU?</p> <p>  Since the pandemic struck, Ms O'Reilly has examined various aspects of the EU response, including the initial assessment of the threat of Covid to public health.  She has also, to some extent, looked at the EU's negotiations with pharma companies and called for more transparency on both counts.  I am interested in hearing about here findings in regard to the ECDC's initial assessment of the threat of Covid to public health.  Did the fact that the EU institutions have little power in respect of health matters make the pandemic worse in the Europe and did the lack of transparency during the early days of the pandemic, especially in the Council, create problems for the EU?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.337" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021033000002#B00300"><p>The links between the EU and Ireland are incredibly important and they have always been very good.  We saw that during the Brexit negotiations.  It was interesting to note last week when there was some talk of the EU adopting a more protectionist attitude in regard to the export of vaccines and so on that Ireland was to the fore in warning against that because there have been some short-term benefits.</p><p>Ireland was fairly quick to see the medium-term and long-term difficulties that might pose.  As well as this, since the UK left the EU, although Ireland and the UK would have always partnered and been allies on many issues of mutual importance in the EU, there is the issue of new alliances emerging.  Ireland is part of that.  Before the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a sense that Ireland was cleaving more towards some of the Nordic countries, such as Denmark, and the Netherlands and so on.  It will be a while, however, before those alliances form themselves in a stronger way.</p><p> I cannot stress enough the importance of engagement in Dublin, the capital, with Government and the Oireachtas in the room members are in now.  People think the EU happens in Brussels.  It does not; it happens in all the member states.  Committees such as this and other relevant committees have a huge role to play in bridging that gap between the two settings.  I know that sounds almost like a clich&eacute; but I really cannot emphasise it enough.  The messaging from the EU needs to happen in the member states.</p><p> The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, was where the EU came up against its own internal contradictions, in a sense, in that it was an EU solution to an EU problem.  On one hand, the member states did not want to concede any of their competence with regard to health.  The ECDC, therefore, was given few powers and little independence of action.  Therefore, although it was given a title that mimicked that of the centre in the US and other places, it certainly did not have the capacity to do what it was intended to do.  The pandemic certainly exposed that.</p><p> The issue now is for the EU if it wants to have a powerful agency in future pandemics, or even in the current one, which does not seem to be going away any time soon.  If it really and truly wants an agency with power and with the capacity to co-ordinate all the responses from the members states, then it must have a big discussion and debate with the member states to see whether more power should be ceded to it.  It is a sort of sleight of hand.  When most citizens hear of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, they think that is exactly what it does.  It actually does not, however.  In a way, it is a sort of post box for information that may or may not come, or may not come at the right time, for member states, which it puts together and sends it out, usually belatedly.</p><p> I will finish on this.  Quite early on in the pandemic, in January and February when the first cases started emerging in European countries, particularly France, Germany and Italy, the ECDC suddenly almost had an existential crisis.  Its instinct was to say that everything will be fine and we can cope with this.  Within a few weeks it was forced to say that it could not.  The EU, and member states in particular, had to learn from that and really ask what they wanted.  Did they want to hold on tightly to their powers with regard to health policy or cede them for the greater good?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1554" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021033000002#C00300"><p>Ms O'Reilly is very welcome.  I thank her for attending.  It is much appreciated.  The European Ombudsman has been very busy in the past 12 months looking into the EU's response to Covid-19.  I will try to focus on some of the investigations that are still ongoing because I know some have concluded.  Perhaps I could get some clarification.  An investigation into the European Medicines Agency, EMA, in 2019 has been concluded and published.  Is it correct that the European Ombudsman is still looking into aspects of the EMA's work today, however?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.341" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021033000002#C00400"><p>Yes.  We continue to monitor the EMA.  The investigation we concluded in 2019 concerned the way in which it held pre-planning meetings, with which we in Ireland are all familiar, that can be held between developers and local authorities on possible developments they want to do.  Equally, the EMA had pre-regulatory decision meetings with pharmaceutical companies, which would say they were thinking of looking for authorisation on certain things.  They asked what the EMA thought and there would be a discussion.  There were, therefore, concerns around that so we looked at it.  Basically, we made recommendations to the EMA, which it accepted.  This meant the people who were involved with the pre-authorisation meetings were not really the ones ultimately making decisions on that.</p> <p>  We knew at the beginning that the EMA was going to be the focus of much attention because of the power it has.  The member states, of course, form the board of the EMA and are the ones that ultimately decide or agree on any recommendation it makes regarding the authorisation of vaccines.  We were, therefore, looking very carefully at its transparency in that regard.  There is still much anti-vaccination opinion.  It is not even people who are anti-vaccination ideologically but those who are genuinely nervous about vaccines.  We knew, therefore, that everything the EMA did had to be really open and transparent.  So far, we have been happy with the response.  It has spoken about fast-tracking certain procedures into the future.  Sometimes when people hear the term "fast-track", they think about skimping on important bits of the process.  I am sure that is not what the EMA is thinking of.  It is an agency which, from my experience, takes its responsibilities incredibly seriously.  Nonetheless, we will be keeping an eye on that to see its intent and how things are panning out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1554" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021033000002#C00500"><p>The European Ombudsman wanted the Commission to publish the contracts, which it would not do initially but since has.  That recommendation or investigation that was under way in Ms O'Reilly's office has, therefore, concluded, although it continues to look into the procedures that were adopted in improving the vaccines.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.343" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021033000002#C00600"><p>One of the access requests we received was about a team that deals with these vaccine contracts, which is made up of members of the Commission and members from seven member states, not including Ireland.  That is not particularly relevant but I want to make it clear that Ireland is not involved.  That is the core team but then it would go back to all the member states.</p> <p>  A request was received from an MEP seeking the names of the civil servants from the member states on that committee.  We agreed with the EMA that there were data protection issues and there was no overriding public interest in knowing who precisely the civil servants were.  The Commission refused to actually publish the names of the member states that were doing this, which to my mind was quite extraordinary.  Its reasoning was that if people knew, for instance, that Italy was one of those member states then somebody would be able to join the dots and locate the civil servant, which to my mind, although I did not say this at the time, was ridiculous, really.  When things like that happen, one gets a little bit frustrated; let me put it that way.  Some people, although not everybody, have a tendency to think that if the Commission is hiding that, what else is it hiding?  With something as simple as that, therefore, the heavens were not going to fall if people knew who the member states were.  Most people know who they are anyway.</p> <p>  We continue to get access to documents requests regarding the EMA.  We have had a very long relationship with it going back even before my time.  Certainly, it is a priority of my office to keep an eye on that because so many people are keeping an eye on the EMA and must put their trust in it with regard to vaccines and their authorisation.</p></speech>

Is it the view of Ms O'Reilly's office's that this led to a delay in the European Union procuring the vaccines that were needed and then in their roll-out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.345" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021033000002#C00800"><p>It is not something we have specifically looked into, although we may.  I believe there will and must be investigations in many sectors in every member state.  I am sure in Ireland this will also occur as to how things happened.  At the moment, I do not believe it is an exaggeration to say things are happening at a frantic pace.  I know it has been stated, reported and commented on that one of the reasons for the slowness in the vaccine roll-out in the EU was because of this haggling over pricing, for one thing, and that the EU and the Commission, perhaps, took a traditional conservative approach, which in times of crisis is probably a good thing.  People will demand that they get good prices and so on.</p> <p>  The other approach was to just throw everything at it and say we are in an emergency with this crisis; this is a war.  One might contrast the EU's response with those of the UK and US, which developed a warlike mentality.</p><p>This was evident even in the language that was used.  Operation Warp Speed was former President Trump's description of throwing money at the vaccine development and roll out.  We have seen what happened in the UK as well.  One could also say that there was a huge political imperative for both of those countries to do it, given the huge and appalling number of deaths that had happened on those Governments' watch.  Nonetheless, while I have not investigated this and do not have facts to hand that I can stand over, there does appear to have been a classically bureaucratic, conservative approach taken by the EU.  That said, we must also remember that there are 27 member states involved.  Austria, for example, now wants more of the available vaccines but the other member states have said that it did not do its homework at the beginning, did not order enough doses and was a little bit frugal.  The EU also has to consider poorer countries and it has been to the fore, beyond anything that the UK or US has done, in giving vaccines to other countries.  The figures in that regard are quite impressive.  </p><p> When this calms down, we will be able to make definitive judgments about this but we must all recognise that this was an unprecedented situation.  There was no play book for this.  Obviously mistakes were made but good things have been done as well.</p></speech>

Does she see herself looking into the decision-making process around enforcing the export protocol which is still being discussed?</p></speech>

In the event that we did decide to look at that - although this is not something I am contemplating at the moment - it would have to meet the three criteria for initiating any investigation.  One is that it is in the public interest and clearly, something like that would fit into that category; two, that it is doable, that we would get a result and that we would not be over-promising; and three, that we are not doubling up on investigations that are being done elsewhere.  If a committee of parliament, for example, or some other agency was doing an investigation that was likely to yield as good as, or better, an outcome as us, then we would not do it.  As I said already, the pace of events is significant.  We continue to look at the EMA and it is possible that in time we will look at the procurement process, particularly if complaints come in.  However, I must emphasise that we would not be looking at member state actions but at the actions of the EMA.</p></speech>

I listened very attentively to her opening remarks and noted with interest her contention that transparency helps to ensure public trust and reinforces the legitimacy of decision-making processes and that any sign of facts being hidden provokes not just distrust but also increased mental stress and mental health issues.  She said that EU citizens need to know the extent to which their own governments were involved in the contracts and so on.  She mentioned that there are lots of people out there who are very sceptical about the vaccines and that it is important to get those people on board.  I was extremely impressed by the honesty of Ms O'Reilly's report and very interested to hear that the ombudsman's office does not have any real competence in the area of EU health policy, which strikes me as strange.  If the EU is supposed to work for the good of all of its members, that should include their financial, mental and physical good.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy referred to the EMA and possible investigations by the ombudsman's office.  Let us say the ombudsman conducts an investigation and issues a final report, including recommendations.  Have such reports or recommendations ever been challenged by any EU member state?  Has anybody ever questioned the recommendations of the European Ombudsman's office?  Has anyone ever asked whether it would be prudent to go that way or suggested that her office should stay away from an issue because of possible implications by way of court cases and so forth?  Does the ombudsman ever feel compromised when she issues her reports?  She spoke earlier about investigations that her office has conducted pretty rapidly, considering Covid has only been with us for 12 to 18 months.  Has she ever been challenged in terms of the EU not doing something on foot of her findings or recommendations or choosing to ignore them?</p></speech>

When I was the Irish Ombudsman I could rely on across-the-board parliamentary and Government support for what I did and there was a very high acceptance of my recommendations.  It is a little more challenging at the European level because of different cultural views of issues around administration, data protection, freedom of information and so on.  In addition, one important country does not have a national ombudsman, namely, Germany.  It has a petitions committee but does not have an ombudsman so the Germans do not quite understand or get the role of the ombudsman.  There have been issues, particularly in relation to the work I have done on transparency at European Council and EU ministerial level.  There has been push back with some people saying that my office is going beyond its mandate and so on.  When I hear that, it suggests to me that I am doing my job but people are not too thrilled about the fact that I am doing it.</p> <p>  Regarding the ECDC report, part of my rationale for doing that was to make my office as useful as possible during the pandemic.  By highlighting the lack of health competence and the fact that it is member states who decide on their health policies and not the EU, we showed how that became a huge problem during the pandemic.  Italy was in a terrible state at the beginning and there were moves by certain countries to protect their own equipment and supplies until the Commission basically got everyone to calm down and start sharing.  It was, in a way, the EU confronting its own contradictions and the ongoing debate around a more united Europe versus a Europe in which member states have more control.  The ECDC was created precisely to assist with what started to befall us last year but it did not and could not assist because the member states did not have to, and therefore did not, play ball.  For example, in the years leading up to the pandemic the ECDC would have carried out surveys on Ireland's ICU capacity, the way Spain looks after elderly people in care, what levels of PPE the Netherlands has in stock and so forth.  The responses the ECDC got were very piecemeal and the member states did not want them to be published.  Even when member states gave information to the ECDC, they did not want that information published because they did not want to appear in a league table showing, for example, that Ireland is fantastic in relation to ICU capacity, Denmark is a disaster, Germany is in the middle and so on.  Therefore, the capacity of the ECDC to war game, to ask what would happen if a pandemic were to happen, how prepared we are and who needs what was compromised.  The ECDC could not war game and therefore, when the pandemic reached our shores, there was no plan.  There was chaos.  People have learned an awful lot over the last 12 months, obviously, but the only way chaos is going to be prevented in future is if member states decide that the EU should have a health competence and cede more of their control over public health.</p><p>That is a political issue.  It is for the member states to decide among themselves but what my investigation did was point out what happens when one creates a body of the kind in question.  It does not seem appropriate, perhaps, to call it a pretend agency but in a way it is.  First one hears about the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and then about the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC.  One believes the ECDC must have the same powers as its counterpart but it does not.  The point of my investigation was to feed into the debate that has to take place.  It has already started.  Members will have heard the Commission talking about a health union and so on.  It was to assist in that debate.</p></speech>

Having been a member of the petitions committee, I am aware of its potential.  There is obviously great potential but there is also potential to work with our European counterparts and, more importantly, Ms O'Reilly, in addition to our Ombudsman in Ireland.  That is one part of my question.</p><p>My other question concerns the only point that really worries me.  I am asking for Ms O'Reilly's opinion more than anything else.  Where the final recommendations of an Ombudsman are received by our petitions committee, would Ms O'Reilly find it prudent if we were to challenge them and say that, as members of a petitions committee, we did not agree with the decision?  Would that be a good idea?  Would it be outside the remit?  I want to try to touch all bases here.  I would like Ms O'Reilly's opinion on the matter because we want this committee to work properly and do not want to be setting off on the wrong foot.</p></speech>

I well remember the history of the petitions committee because there was not a petitions committee when I dealt with a quite famous case, the lost at sea case, several years ago.  It was the first time that a recommendation had been rejected so I decided to submit a special report to the Parliament.  The then Government decided not even to have a committee discuss it.  Anyway, the case became politicised, not because of anything my office had done but because we had, unusually, looked at the actions of a Minister in regard to the development of the scheme.  Naturally, that gave rise to political sensitivities, which had an impact.  Then the committee that investigated or considered the report split on party lines, which was a pity because I believe an Ombudsman's report should be dealt with in an impartial way insofar as that is possible in a political community like the Oireachtas.  Arising out of that, the petitions committee was created.  Deputy Charles Flanagan was the Minister who was at the first session, I believe, and he said that, to the greatest extent possible, the committee would not split along party lines on Ombudsman reports.  That does not mean one cannot reject them; of course they can be rejected.  If an Ombudsman makes a recommendation, it does not mean it is necessarily going to be accepted, but it is critical that it be evaluated impartially and that the way the Ombudsman &mdash; currently Mr. Peter Tyndall &mdash; goes about his work also be evaluated impartially and independently.</p> <p>  I welcome what the Deputy said about greater liaison between my office and the Petitions Committee, which is the committee to which I report within the European Parliament.  I said earlier but cannot emphasise enough how important it is that the work of the EU and communication thereon take place not in Brussels but exactly where the members are all now.  That is so important.  A petitions committee has great potential to achieve that.  Arguably, there are foreign affairs and European affairs committees and so on but this committee is the link to the people, just as my office is, and that is where our complementary roles lie.</p></speech>

Many questions on the EMA have already been asked so I will not refer to it.  On Ms O'Reilly's inquiry into the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, I was taken with her reference to the gathering and assessing of data linked to the pandemic.  She stated issues arose over the changing advice on face coverings.  We saw this here at home when we changed tack on that front, arguably ahead of many of our European colleagues.  Ms O'Reilly mentioned there was a survey of the capacity of a number of member states to deal with the Covid-19 crisis.  Having regard to that and the face coverings issue, she might elaborate a little more on the inquiry.  Has it concluded completely?  Are there still elements being dealt with?  I am not prying but just wondering whether Ms O'Reilly could elaborate a little more.</p> <p>  I have a question that is similar to those of Deputy Buckley on Ms O'Reilly's office's engagement with us.  How many complaints or inquiries does she deal with annually?  How many staff are in her office?  If I could ask Ms O'Reilly those questions-----</p></speech>

That is the critical thing.</p> <p>  On face masks, I was always fascinated by the face masks issue because, to me, it seemed blindingly obvious that we should be wearing them.  I looked at my Amazon bill for last year, which was distressingly large, to see when I first bought face masks.  I first ordered them on 28 February, which was before we were advised to do so.  I am not saying I am a genius and prescient but, to me, as a reasonably intelligent human being, it seemed obvious that we should have been wearing face masks.  I was always puzzled as to the approach.  At the beginning, NPHET, the WHO and the ECDC were almost counter-indicating their use, suggesting they do more harm than good.  The ECDC was effectively saying "No" at a certain point and three weeks later it was saying "Yes", and now we are all wearing masks.  I am in Strasbourg, where they are worn on the street.  One wears them all the time.  People talk about the science.  The science on the virus was really simple: it is spread by aerosol, it is in the air, one breathes it in and gets the disease, and what happens, happens.  Therefore, face masks were obvious.  When the ECDC changed its advice it did not say why, and that is why we made the recommendation that, in future, it explain to people why it is changing advice on certain matters.  I tune in to Irish media regularly and I quite frequently hear the ECDC being referred to.  People understandably and rightly trust it but to really earn that trust, the advice it is giving and the decisions it is making have to be justified.</p> <p>  On the question on my office, it has approximately 70 staff.  It is a tiny office.  We get roughly 2,000 complaints every year.  Many of them are not within our mandate but within that of the relevant member state's public administration so we would advise people accordingly.  We open approximately 350 to 400 inquiries each year.</p><p>Some of those follow complaints and others are own-initiative systemic investigations.  A recent one we carried out related to the ECDC.</p></speech>

There is a sort of a newsfeed on the ECDC website and in the part relating to March and April of last year, one can see quite clearly what might be called the contradictory advice on that and the speed at which it changed.  I suspect that part of the reason the WHO, the ECDC and NPHET at the time were not suggesting that people should wear face masks and, in fact were discouraging them, related to the fear that there would be huge demand and that the supply that was necessary for medical and healthcare workers would be diminished.  The ECDC in its response, if I recall correctly, almost agreed with the point that if the authorities had started telling everyone to wear face masks, there would have been a run on them.  The Senator might recall that there was a severe lack of them and the EU, and I think Ireland as well, had to seek airlifts of personal protective equipment, PPE, from China.</p> <p> The issue is interesting in an almost philosophical way.  If I knew that face masks were a good idea, surely the WHO and the ECDC did too.  Similar to the point I made earlier when talking about politicians and their role in finding that balance of risk, was it riskier to tell everyone to get face masks or to do it the other way?  All these matters will be analysed after the fact.</p> <p>  On the Senator's first question, I do not recall that particular issue, although it may just be something that has not yet come across my desk.  I will follow up on it for him.</p></speech>

I thank Ms O'Reilly for her excellent presentation and her ongoing work.  When she was based in Ireland, I dealt with her office on a number of occasions and her staff were fantastic.  I thank her for her communication with me, as a parliamentarian.  She might comment on the impact of the virus on the work of the European Union and on its future.  She spoke about the European Union not having a competency in health policy and the area of transparency.  How does she foresee the European Union moving forward in its work?</p></speech>

It will be interesting to see how that goes because the first big argument was over who should chair it.  Instead of having one chairperson, it will now have three presidents, as well as deputy presidents and further layers &ndash; gang loads of them - involved.  There are also different views as to what outcomes people can expect.  Ireland was, if I recall correctly, one of 12 member states that wrote a letter last week warning not to raise expectations and saying that nothing should come out of this that will involve treaty change, whether major or minor, although obviously that is a political issue.<br/><br/>As anyone who has read about historical events of this nature will know, whether it be a world war, a famine or even the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>, curiously, which led to all sorts of social change, huge change comes out of them.  I think that what will happen because of this will be the future direction of the EU will be greatly influenced, and the debate between those who think there should be more Europe and those who think there should be less will be influenced by this.<br/><br/>One could argue that because of what has happened to Europe and the issues with vaccine contracts and what I have said about the ECDC and so on is an argument for more Europe.  On the other hand, what has happened in the UK, as committee members will be aware if they can bear to read some of the press there, has convinced people they did the right thing.<br/><br/>As for the impact, I was reading earlier that one step the UK is going to take, because the EU threatened the supply chain, is to attempt to decouple itself from the EU supply chain and become more self-sufficient.  The impact of this on the UK, ironically, might even be that it has a better Brexit.  Part of the power of the UK and the British Empire over centuries was based on innovation, whether it was the quality of its armadas, the steam engine or any of the other amazing innovations that came from and fuelled the empire.  I think this will give an impetus to the UK to become more self-sufficient and to increase its use of innovation.  As for how far that will go, I do not know but one can see how this will, perhaps, change the direction in which one might have thought the EU, or the UK post Brexit, was going to go.</p></speech>

Obviously, I am aware that civil rights issues have been raised.  The question always concerns appropriateness and balance and ensuring that measures that are introduced for a certain reason will not continue into the future if the reason they were introduced is no longer relevant.  Frontex, as the agency is also known, has been very well resourced, including through soon having recruited 10,000 border guards, some of them armed.  The implications for fundamental rights, if they are not monitored adequately, are significant.  Many investigations, therefore, are ongoing into Frontex by the European Parliament.  We are examining its complaints mechanism to ensure that it works and is real.</p><p>In a way, it could be seen as a proxy for the EU's attitude to fundamental rights, migration, asylum seekers and so on.  It is the agency charged, in one way, with dealing with part of that problem.  People might say it is the most acute one.  Some member states or people might think that keeping people out, or the protection element, is emphasised and others want more emphasis on fundamental rights.  It must be remembered that irrespective of people's opinions on what should be done, there are laws and regulations that govern its operation.  It is also bound by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p></speech>

It is great to have this conversation with Ms O'Reilly this morning and it is fair to say that since she became Ombudsman in 2003 and European Ombudsman in 2013, she has really been to the fore in finding the truth in terms of ethical standards and trust.  She spoke about trust today and there is much conversation about how transparent Europe was in dealing with the pandemic.</p> <p>  Politicians are not held in very high esteem by the Irish people.  I heard a conversation on the radio this morning indicating that a very low number of people trust politicians.  Ms O'Reilly made some very open and frank comments about how we do our business in Europe.  How does she find the institutions react when she might be telling them to get their act together, for example, or be more ethical in what they say to people?  In dealing with European Medicines Agency or the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, does she find that people acknowledge her role, respect it and try to correct what she sees as inadequacies when giving a truthful position to European citizens?  I have other questions but members have asked them already so I will not repeat them.  I thank Ms O'Reilly for being with us this morning.</p></speech>

They are very much appreciated.  In general, my recommendations are well accepted by the institutions.  The only place I get pushback tends to be in respect of transparency or freedom of information.  In Ireland, which has an Information Commissioner, there is an Ombudsman to make binding decisions.  In Europe, we make recommendations so the institutions still control the tap.  Sometimes it takes a while for recommendations to be accepted; we are trying to influence a cultural change or shift so that something that might have been recommended a couple of years ago might only come to fruition a few years afterwards.</p> <p>  We have done much work on the transparency of the European Council, the ministers from member states who make law with their co-legislators in the European Parliament.  I have been trying to show the real-life impact of this.  There is the example of two current pieces of advice.  One relates to bees, pesticides and advice from the European Food Safety Authority.  Advice was given to member states in 2013 but it has been stuck, with no decision made as to whether it would be implemented by member states.  The problem is that we cannot know which member states are holding up matters.  We do not know if it is the Irish, the French, the Germans or whomever who might be under pressure from constituencies at home and who do not want to go along with the advice as a result.  As citizens do not know that, they cannot therefore influence their own member state.  If we knew Ireland was blocking a particular regulation that some constituents may favour, the only way the Senator could influence this is if he knew in the first instance who is blocking the process or how it is being blocked.</p> <p>  This goes back to what happens in the Oireachtas and the extent to which it holds the Government accountable.  I remember that people from a parliamentary committee in the UK came over before Brexit and the chairperson complained that ministers went to Brussels but people did not know what they were doing or agreeing.  I asked the chairperson to ask the ministers because the accountability lies not with Brussels but with the relevant national parliament, which, in the case of Ireland, would be the Oireachtas.  That is very important.</p> <p>  In general, my recommendations are accepted but I have also learned to play the long game, knowing that sometimes baby steps are required.  Sometimes a recommendation is made and we can go off to do our shopping for a long time before it might be agreed.  Since I took office, we know that relatively few citizens, going on the basis of the number of complaints we get, need the European Ombudsman because their daily needs are taken care of by people like the members at this meeting, the relevant ombudsman and all of that.  At a European level, there is a different type of issue.  Whether it is a big investigation into the ECDC, the transparency of trade deals or similar big matters, I seek to do work that if done and accepted will have a trickle-down effect on many citizens, even if they have never heard of the European Ombudsman.</p></speech>

We really appreciate the contribution she is making today.  I am interested in the pressures of the pandemic and the fear of diminishing checks and balances on the basis of those pressures.  I will ask about two specific cases that came across her desk.  These are allegations that Frontex was complicit in illegally pushing back migrants in the eastern Mediterranean in order to stop them from entering the European Union.  There are also allegations of physical altercations between migrants and Frontex personnel and that the agency also operated outside the European Union.  Has Ms O'Reilly concluded her investigations into Frontex?</p></speech>

As I said, there are quite a few investigations into Frontex, including by ourselves.  We are looking at the complaints mechanism introduced in respect of Frontex a few years ago under a new regulation after it had for a long time refused to accept a complaints mechanism or the need to have one.  Its point of view is that any abuses or violations of fundamental rights or any problems that arise in the context of a Frontex operation are the responsibility of the member state and that the agency is just there to co-ordinate and help.  We disagreed with that and pointed out that Frontex is a European agency.  The uniforms of Frontex guards have the EU logo on them so the agency has to take responsibility or to forward complaints if they are made.  I made a special report to the European Parliament in that regard, which it supported, and there is now a complaints mechanism.  However, the extent to which that is known about or used is contested.  We are looking quite forensically at this, asking very basic questions such as how many complaints there have been, how many were admitted or dealt with and what was the outcome.  This is simple stuff.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned other issues.  We would not look at alleged pushbacks in a particular state or so on, including what a member state did.  We would look at how Frontex acted.  We are going through in fine detail with Frontex the protocols it uses in cases such as those outlined by the Senator.  This takes in decision-making, how it deals with collaborators in member states and so on.  We can go through what is almost an administrative checklist of what is supposed to be done versus what is done.</p></speech>

We have greater powers than the European Parliament in that respect.  We can demand to see and get any document, no matter how confidential or secret it is.

It is critical and important to climate change and what regulations will come to deal with it.</p> <p>  There was an allegation of a conflict of interest.  Our finding was that there was not maladministration because, according to the tight rules of the Commission on what constituted a conflict of interest, to our mind it was not fair to suggest that the people who looked at this did not follow the rules.  What we did say was the conflict of interest did not encompass the issue posed by BlackRock.  A company, on the one hand, was advising and dealing in energy products while, on the other hand, it was helping to make the rules in a way or advising on rules that could be made in climate change regulation.</p> <p>  Our recommendation was for the Commission or the Legislature to look at the guidelines for what constitutes a conflict of interest.  The overarching point I made on that was that one had to join the dots.  On the one hand, the Commission comes up with a good vision as to what it will do to prevent climate catastrophe.  The Commission President, Madame von der Leyen, described what could be done as the EU's moonshot moment.  One has to link those big statements, however, with the smaller steps taken in other places.  A small step is to give a contract to a particular company that may have a conflict of interest in those matters.  It is all part of this which has to be recognised by the institutions.</p></speech>

Was the European Commission in the best position to carry out advanced procurement?  Is it the best administrator to make key decisions in that kind of a crisis?  When it comes to the negotiations between the European Commission and pharmaceutical companies, especially AstraZeneca, is Ms O'Reilly in a position to say there was more transparency with the public?  Could the deals have been more effective?  Could they have inspired more confidence in the EU's ability to roll out such programmes?</p> <p>  A significant amount of public money was given to the pharmaceutical companies to develop these vaccines.  The pharma companies, however, then kept the patents and intellectual property rights.  Ms O'Reilly said earlier that this was causing problems in Europe in getting the vaccines manufactured.  Developing countries are now relying on big pharma for these life-saving vaccines.  There is a possibility that Third World countries will be left behind in this process.</p> <p>  I agree with Ms O'Reilly on transparency.  If there is transparency from the start, it does away with social media doctors and people getting their information from unreliable sources.  That is where an awful lot of problems have arisen.</p></speech>

However, it is not just those countries that will be left behind if they do not get their populations vaccinated.  It will be all of us who will be left behind.  We know enough about this clever virus now to realise that, if people are allowed to go unvaccinated, it will allow mutant variants to arise which could be far more deadly than the ones we are dealing with now.  If large populations around the world are left unvaccinated, that is where those variants will thrive.  Eventually and inevitably, they will come into our own countries.  It is not just altruism that should encourage us all to help in the vaccination effort in poorer countries.  It is actually self-interest.</p> <p>  At the moment, everybody is stuck in this self-interest mode, although it should be recognised that the EU is contributing a lot of vaccines and funding to enable vaccine programmes to take place in developing and poorer countries.  At the moment, however, it is very m&eacute; f&eacute;in.  There was a story last week that the UK would give people in Ireland vaccines.  I do not see that happening anytime soon.  In fact, the UK has denied it as well.  Equally, the US is far more protectionist than the EU.</p> <p>  Once that panic has abated, it would be morally irresponsible, at the very least, and stupid not to make sure as many parts of the world are vaccinated as well.  If not, it will all come back to haunt us again.</p> <p>  On the vaccine contracts, we have looked at access to documents but we have not looked at the way these were negotiated.  It is not Madame von der Leyen who signs off on these.  It is the member states which all sign off on decisions made about these contracts with this special committee which comprises the Commission and seven member states at the centre.  It is something obviously that we might look at.  We might get complaints about it.  However, our focus and my mandate concern solely the actions of the Commission and not necessarily the member states.</p> <p>  One of the reasons there continues to be pressure on the pharmaceutical companies to be open, as well as on the Commission to ensure transparency about these contracts, is precisely because the companies in question got a lot of European money to develop those vaccines.  Accordingly, they are our vaccines and our transparency.</p><p>I have followed some of the debate on the patents and I am not sure where that is at and I cannot comment with any great insight into it.  What I do know is that one of the revolutionary parts of the vaccine creation has been the open access to scientists and the incredible unprecedented collaboration that has taken place among scientists of the world.  It has not happened before.  Before, there were particular sectors of the population who needed the vaccine and now everybody needs it.  The imperative to throw everything at it is huge.  As I have said, we are far from being out of this.  We are still learning.  There is still this frantic pace of events.  It will be a while before we have the time to examine this.  At the same time, I do not think we should wait forever or wait for another few years before we start looking at this because even now we can put into play some of the lessons we can learn now from how the pandemic has been managed.  Inquiry is very important, and not just, or not even, for the blame game but just so that we can learn from it.  It is a matter of protecting our health that we look into the decision-making at all levels.</p></speech>

I had to step out of the committee for a few minutes so if one of these questions has already been asked please indicate and I will move on to my next question.  With regard to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, investigation, am I right in saying Ms O'Reilly was critical of the interaction of the ECDC with the Chinese authorities?  If so, will Ms O'Reilly elaborate on this?</p></speech>

I was a bit surprised at this because I had read a lot about this and we all read about what happened in China.  The WHO is still wrestling with finding out its exact origins.  People have read all the speculation and the reports about what happened at the very beginning.  I found it a bit puzzling as to why the ECDC would say everything was fine with the Chinese authorities.  I asked my colleagues to ask again or find out the reasons.  I do not have the report in front of me so I cannot exactly detail it but my impression was that the ECDC stated that insofar as the authorities they were dealing with were able to give it certain information, they gave it that information but the issue was the chain of command.  The Chinese centre for disease control could not independently give the information.  It had to go up to the very top to get authorisation for the release of information.  Insofar as it shared the information it was allowed to share, it did so but the question remains as to what had happened at the other level and what was kept back.  It is a bit of a subtle distinction but I think I get what they were talking about.  I felt this needed to be explained, given all of the speculation and negative reports on how the Chinese communicated about the virus from the start.  It was right to be a little bit questioning on it.</p></speech>

It was not something we investigated.  I am not sure we even received complaints about it.  The way I saw it, if we want to use an analogy, is that if three people are on site building a house it will get built in a year but if 100 people are on site building a house it will get built in a few months.  Everything that had to do with the creation of a vaccine or the authorisation of a vaccine was speeded up because there were simply more resources being put at it.  If normally on a Friday afternoon people would close the files and go off for the weekend people continued to work on the files over the weekend.  I have found nothing to suggest that the authorisation was done rapidly.  The European Medicines Agency has a good reputation.  It is headed by an Irish person at present.  I am sure it was under pressure . I have no doubt about that.  From what I have seen, however, it did not cut corners on the authorisation of vaccines.</p></speech>

These were general letters asking for transparency on what they do, especially at a time when people's processes, including this committee's, have changed or are different and there is not the same access or access pathways.  The EIB is responsible for a huge amount of money and will be responsible for the distribution of future funds, whenever that is signed off.  It will play a key role on where investments are made.  We keep an eye on this.  We have dealt with a number of complaints over the years about investments made by the EIB with regard to procedures, its handling of complaints and conflicts of interest at member state level.  It is a body with which we have quite a lot of contact.  I can arrange to send the Deputy an update on our investigation of the EIB.</p></speech>

Something Ms O'Reilly has spoken about today, and something she speaks about quite a lot in public, is the blame Brussels culture and the ease with which individual member states try to make the EU an unknown or faceless bureaucrat to blame for decision-making at member state level.  If I am correct, is the criticism under way of the EU procurement process on the vaccine an example in Ms O'Reilly's mind of the blame Brussels culture?  At the same time, earlier in the meeting she spoke about the ECDC not wargaming Covid properly.  The US and UK treated it like they were facing a war and mobilised their resources.  Ms O'Reilly feels Europe has not done this.  Am I correct that this is her view?</p></speech>

That is it.  The Commission does not make the decisions, it is the member states that decide.  If we look at the various ways in which the vaccines have been rolled out, I am in France, which was a bit reluctant about AstraZeneca from the start, and when particular issues emerged, one minute it was giving AstraZeneca only to those aged over 60 and the next minute it was giving AstraZeneca to those aged under 60.  Those figures are not quite right but France changed its decision-making on who should get it very quickly and completely.  It did a 180&deg; turn.  That was not the Commission, it was France making up its own mind.  There was a very interesting long article in <i>Le Monde</i>yesterday about President Macron's attitude to vaccination generally.  Initially, he was of the view that no vaccine would come on track until the end of this month, so he devised his policies around this.</p><p>He is under pressure now in relation to lockdowns and so on.  The point I am making is that, for all that Brussels proposes and negotiates certain things, ultimately it is the member states who are proposing them.  The way the pandemic has been handled and the vaccine has been rolled out is completely different in every member state.  I was talking to an MEP from Malta the other day and asking how things were among that small population and he told me they took an aggressive approach &ndash; "aggressive approach" was the term he used - at the beginning.  I think they now have one of the highest levels of vaccine take-up.  It will be a while.</p><p> We hear anecdotally about France, which has a fantastic health system and so on.  If I wander around Strasbourg, on virtually ever other street corner there is a place I can go in, get a free Covid test and get the result within 12 hours.  They do certain things well, so I expected the roll-out of the vaccine to be at a similar level to the UK but it has not been.  There are all sorts of cultural and political issues relating to that.  That is the point I make about blaming Brussels.  It is the individual decisions made by the member states that to a large extent - we can argue about that and we will find out empirically what that is - have dictated the play in each member state.</p></speech>

If a straw poll were taken of members of the public, they would say unambiguously that their confidence in the European institutions as a consequence of what happened with the vaccine, when they see what happened in the UK and under the Biden Administration in America, is low.  I am not interested in the blame game.  Rather, as a pro-European, I am interested in seeing the institutions strengthened.

Certain countries refused to export their personal protective equipment, PPE, to hoard it and all of that.  Certain countries, particularly the bigger ones, wanted to go their own way on that, which obviously was going disadvantage other countries which did not have the same capacity or resources.  It was the Commission and other leaders that persuaded the member states to take a different approach and to try to take a joint approach, if possible.  That led to a fairer distribution of PPE and other health resources.</p> <p>  On the joint vaccination procurement, it was done with the same intention that it would not be the states who could afford it that were going to buy everything up and that we would jointly agree this.  That is what happened; it was jointly agreed.  People see the Commission, Madame von der Leyen and so on, but sitting around the table with Madame von der Leyen are the Irish representatives as well as the Spanish representatives, the Polish representatives and everybody else.  It could be argued the Commission is doing the work, has the information and is ultimately more influential than an individual member state, but the fact is the member states were all involved.</p> <p>  On the Senator's question of how to avoid this in the future, the member states have to learn the lessons of this.  Do member states want more Europe and a more centralised European response, which would be significantly better than what we have seen, or do we want a go-it-alone strategy, which will inevitably disadvantage smaller countries, including our own?  Those are big political decisions but people need forensically to analyse what went on, to be honest with the public about where responsibility lay and to put forward proposals which would avoid this happening so the next time one person, and it always starts with one person, in, say, Ireland emerges with a potentially lethal virus, the wargaming has been done and there is a united approach to it.</p></speech>

Ms O'Reilly made a recommendation, I think it was in January, to the European Commission about creating an online portal for funding.  Was that recommendation taken on board and implemented?  Second, there was a previous inquiry conducted by Ms O'Reilly relating to the EU Presidency and the corporate sponsoring of same.  Have there been any breaches of that since?  I presume not.  My final question concerns the award for good administration.   I want to end on a positive note.  The deadline for that award was the end of January.  How many organisations have been put forward, given the year it has been?</p></speech>

On corporate sponsorship, I regard that as a successful initiative for us.  It was a complaint we got relating to the fact that when new EU member states hold a council, which can be an expensive process for them, they invite corporate sponsors to sponsor them.  The concern was they would be given privileged access to the Commission, to regulation-making and so on.  Initially, the Council said it was nothing to do with it and that it had to do with the member states.  We disagreed because people see the member state acting as President of the Council.  Latterly, the Council has accepted our view that it has a role.  We did not recommend that sponsorship should end but that the Council should develop guidelines on what is and is not acceptable.  The Council has accepted that.  Germany did not have any sponsorship.  Portugal has sponsorship but we await the Council guidelines on that.</p> <p>  I can get back to the Deputy on the portal but I think it had to do with the fact that a lot of money is about to be put into the member states.</p><p>People need to know where that money is going, who is getting it, who is accountable and so on.  It was in that context that we suggested a portal to the Commission.  This would allow us to easily see what Ireland or any given company got.  I am not sure where we are on that but we will certainly get back to the Deputy on it.  I thank him for raising the nice, happy friendly thing I do, which is the awards system.  We are now on our third iteration.  We did not know if anyone would enter this time but we got almost 40 applications from all over the EU, the agencies obviously being spread all over the place.  We are looking at those applications now and I believe we are to have the awards ceremony at the end of June.  The President of the Commission, Dr. von der Leyen, has agreed to say a few words at that.  I am sure she was delighted to be in a position to say nice things about the great things the EU administration does.  I thank her for that.</p></speech>

The Minister of State with responsibility for planning and local government, Deputy Peter Burke, and officials from his Department are with us.  I thank him for joining us.  He may call on these officials to speak briefly to clarify points.  I am aware of the wide range of issues that will form the subject of today's discussion.  If necessary, further and more detailed information on certain issues that are raised or questions that arise may be sent to the clerk to the committee for circulation afterwards.</p> <p>  Members are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the precincts of the Leinster House complex.  In that regard, I ask all members to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contributions.

Witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts should note that the constitutional protection afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege.  Persons giving evidence from other jurisdictions should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime, although that does not apply in this case. </p> <p>  I call on Minister of State to give his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined today by Paul Benson, principal officer in my Department, and by representatives of the Housing Agency, John O&rsquo;Connor, chief executive officer, and Claire Feeney, senior executive officer.</p> <p>  I will make a brief opening statement and we then look forward to answering questions from the committee.  We also welcome the insights of the committee into these important matters.  This is a very timely meeting as we embark on a new overarching housing strategy, Housing for All, and a review of the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016.</p> <p>  Housing is a top priority for this Government and the approach set out in the Housing for All strategy and the programme for Government is clear.  The Government is working towards a housing system that caters for all our people.  In this regard, the programme includes a commitment to ensure that an appropriate mix of housing design types is provided for older people and people with disabilities, which is obviously very important.</p> <p>  Since taking office, the ministerial team in the Department has set about this work with our officials, other Departments, local authorities, delivery partners and key stakeholders.  My Department has also been reorganised with a new division established at the start of the year which focuses on housing inclusion, homelessness and affordability.</p> <p>  The record &euro;3.3 billion housing budget for 2021 is a clear signal of the Government&rsquo;s intent to deliver on the programme for Government, and it is only the very beginning.  This investment will provide further impetus to important schemes targeted at housing for persons with a disability such as capital funding for social housing to local authorities, funding to approved housing bodies including funding through the capital assistance scheme, and the housing adaptation and disabled persons grant schemes.</p> <p>  Three major strategies were published in 2011: the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016, the national implementation framework for the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016, and Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion.  In conjunction with the Department of Health, the HSE and other stakeholders, my Department has been working hard to implement these strategies.</p> <p>  The vision of the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016 is &ldquo;To facilitate access, for people with disabilities, to the appropriate range of housing and related support services, delivered in an integrated and sustainable manner, which promotes equality of opportunity, individual choice and independent living.&rdquo;  The strategy uses the term &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in reference to four categories of disability aligned with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD: sensory disability, mental health disability, physical disability and intellectual disability.  </p> <p>  The strategy is a joint initiative with the Department of Health and its aims are aligned with the UN convention.  A key output of the strategy has been the establishment of a housing and disability steering group in each local authority and preparation of a strategic plan for the delivery of housing for people with a disability in every single local authority area.  This is supported by a national housing sub-group made up of representatives of my Department, the Department of Health, the HSE, the National Disability Authority, NDA, and other stakeholder organisations.  This group meets regularly to co-ordinate relevant actions on a national basis with executive support from the Housing Agency. </p> <p>  The overall national housing output requirement in the coming years coming years is estimated at 33,000 new homes per annum, including social, affordable and private homes.  All delivery channels and mechanisms will be needed to achieve these targets.  We are planning for delivery of these homes in the new housing strategy - Housing for All - and the needs of people with a disability will be factored into this process at national and local level. </p> <p>  With regard to social housing, the programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by 50,000 units over the next five years, most of which will comprise new builds.  The level of allocations for social housing to people with disabilities has increased significantly over the past ten years, with more than 10% of all allocations being made to people with disabilities.</p><p>The work on the strategy will also include an examination of adaptation, conversion and refurbishment programmes and grants for existing stock.  For example, the housing adaptation grants schemes have assisted 115,000 households to stay living in their homes since 2008.  This is very much in keeping with the objectives of the UNCRPD.</p><p> Regarding the building regulations, part M, access and use of the building regulations aims, to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  While the part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions, where practicable and appropriate. </p><p> As members will note, there is clear alignment between the objectives and approach of housing policy for people with a disability and the UNCRPD.  This can be bolstered further as we develop the two housing strategies mentioned.  I have outlined in appendix 5 key achievements in this area to date.  We can provide the committee with more detailed briefing on areas they may find of interest following today&rsquo;s session.  We look forward to the discussion. </p></speech>

It is refreshing to hear his conscious positive bias towards people with disabilities and the provision of housing for people with disabilities.  He knows there have been many difficulties in getting adequate housing for people with disabilities over the years.  I wish to raise one issue that was brought to my attention recently.  It concerns a girl in long-term local authority housing in the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  Her rent allowance is &euro;29 a week but her rent is &euro;73 and she also has housekeeping costs.  This girl has fallen into poverty because of the caste system.  There is great inflexibility.  I have been working with different Department on this case.  One Department says it is the responsibility of another Department and that Department say it is the responsibility of the other one.  Given the inflexibility of the means test for RAS, how can we justify giving a person in receipt of a disability allowance a means test, allowing her rent allowance of &euro;29 a week but charging her &euro;73 for rent and &euro;80 for housekeeping, which puts her into poverty and means she will never be in any way independent?  It is a specific question.  I believe in the philosophy of universal design and I am sure that will be well covered in today&rsquo;s discussion.  However, I would appreciate if the Department could examine the specific issue I raised.  I have been coming up against a brick wall trying to deal with it.  That girl has been means tested but she has no means.  If she was able bodied, she would be in receipt of the housing assistance payment, HAP, and would get much more assistance.  That is my question.</p></speech>

She made a very valid point.  The explicit aim of what we are doing is to ensure everyone has a housing solution.  Currently, a review process is ongoing in the Department of the means test for the income eligibility criteria.  In connection with that assessment, we will examine what potential income disregards can be expanded.  The Senator rightly pointed out that a person in receipt of disability allowance is among the most vulnerable in society who has to shoulder a certain burden.  The key issue is that we have to examine this in the context of the other supports.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, is currently reviewing other housing supports.  Other actors of the State are coming into the process such as the Land Development Agency, LDA, which will bring in more units and in that context we need to examine the income eligibility criteria.  That review is currently in the final stages and, hopefully, we will have more news on how we can expand that means tested area.  I accept this review that been ongoing for a long time.  We are very conscious of that.  The Minister is on record also as saying he wants to bring this to a conclusion very quickly.</p></speech>

We as a committee are pleased we have identified him as the person responsible for overseeing this important area.  There was some confusion in previous meetings.  Therefore, it is great we know that he and his Department are responsible for this area.  He has a given us a impressive overview of the work that is going on.</p> <p>  We learned something at our previous meeting, which came as no surprise to any of us.  We learned from the representatives of Disabled Women Ireland that they feel that people with disabilities who want choice, whether to live independently or with their partners, families or friends, are not given that level of choice because the facilities or the infrastructure are not in place to enable that to happen.  Does the Minister of State intend to review the national housing strategy for people with disabilities and, if so, when would that happen?  He is doing a great deal of work on a consultation process.  We are all wondering how the voices and experiences of people with disabilities are being included in the discussions and the plans for housing for all.  Making housing available for disabled people is not enough.  We need to start by pre-empting that houses are being built in this way.  Some of the submissions I have read suggest that 7% of all social housing should be wheelchair accessible.  Is the Department considering key recommendations like that and how it can adapt - forgive the pun - Government policy to ensure it is flexible and fully accessible to all?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021033000002#B00900"><p>I thank the Deputy for those questions.  The sound and the connection dropped in the middle of her contribution for a few moments but I hope I got the gist of what she said and, if not, she can ask me a second question.  One of the key recommendations in the national disability strategy was to have a steering group in each of the 31 local authorities.  They are aware of the demand in each local authority and they are also the planning authorities for the way housing will be delivered into the future in their areas of jurisdiction.  Each separate committee is led by a director of services and has members from the HSE, the local authority and various different groups.  One change we are bringing about is to ensure the voice of lived experience is brought on to that committee from people with disabilities.  That will greatly assist matters.  They will assist in meeting the policy and targets within the council.  The committees meet quarterly.  The have many meetings with the Housing Agency to ensure the programme in terms of the national strategy is being implemented correctly and that process is ongoing.</p> <p>  In terms of providing different solutions, choice and independent living are key to the overall strategy.  We are trying our very best to deliver that.  Since 2016, we have seen almost a 300% increase in cast-building construction units.  That is a colossal increase in a five-year period.  Our grants have also increased by more than 100% in the year prior to Covid and 64% last year because of Covid.  We are trying to give people independence and choice.  The Deputy made valid points on the building regulations.  A major study by the Churchill Fellowship outlined Ireland as a leader and the path to follow in getting to have universal design, bringing people along with it and encouraging that to happen.  As I pointed out in my opening statement, we can note from the building regulations how much we have improved on issue, be it for commercial buildings or apartments having a disability certificate and ensuring compliance for visitors and those who use commercial buildings.</p><p>I acknowledge we have a significant volume of work to do in bringing the universal design side together.  We have to do that with the advocacy groups and, I hope, in the new strategy as we try to develop it over the months ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.442" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1520" speakername="Violet Wynne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021033000002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his statement.  I acknowledge the pressure that the Department is under owing to the housing crisis but, as we know, the crisis comes down to Government policy, funding, schemes and the political will to address the issues.  What seems to be forgotten about is that there are genuine issues regarding equality in housing policy because of the already-dire housing situation.  It worries me that the housing crisis might be used as an excuse to deprioritise equality issues, especially when it comes to ensuring the rights of disabled people to access appropriate supports according to their housing needs and independent living.  An example from my own constituency concerns a person who recently became disabled and who, as a current tenant of local authority housing, applied to have adaptations made by the council.  The council stated the works could not be done on the property, despite the fact that the individual had received a quote privately and advice to the effect that the works could be done.  The council then offered a transfer to a house that was considered suitable to meet the needs of the tenant but it completely disregarded the fact that the location was miles away from the tenant's support system, local shops and services and that the tenant would not be able to get around.  The tenant was basically told that this was the best that could be offered at the time.  There has to be more flexibility when these circumstances arise.  I am aware that this is a specific case and I have taken it up with the local authority, but the housing strategy for people with disabilities must provide flexibility regarding the range of requirements for independent living.  There must be a way to ensure that councils adhere to the policy even when resources are scarce.</p> <p>  I have a few points and questions.  Why is the national housing strategy document on housing people with disabilities a document covering the period 2011 to 2016?  I note that the plan was extended for this year but it seems like there is poor management of strategy documents that have been reviewed and refreshed.  It makes me wonder how disability matters are prioritised in the overall housing strategy.  Clare County Council confirmed to me yesterday that it only recently received the draft template for local authorities for the new strategy.  It is to be completed by May 2021.  Is there a reason this is at the last minute?  Very late notice has been given for such important work.</p> <p>  I have a question on independent living.  Submissions to the committee highlight a severe gap in housing and support service provision between the HSE and local authorities.  People with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, are being left on social housing lists because they require allocations of funding, supported living or social care supports.  Can the Minister of State elaborate on the process and the barriers to the provision of social housing to people with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, who require a social care support?  How will housing for people with disabilities be considered within the general national housing activities and how are local authorities and the HSE ensuring effective interagency co-operation to meet the needs of the group concerned?</p></speech>

I assure her that the Government is determined to tackle and resolve the housing crisis, as shown by the budget of &euro;3.3 billion, a record budget, in the Department.  We have a huge hill to climb, however.  The reality, as seen from the new housing needs and demands assessment, is that there is a requirement for 33,000 units per annum.  I am very conscious that no construction is going on in this country.  Therefore, there is a huge gap for the Government to fill.  We are willing, ready and able to fill it.  As a result of the new builds the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is arranging, through the LDA and the affordable housing legislation, the Deputy will see housing unlocked and people getting the opportunity to own their own home.</p> <p>  In a moment, I might ask Ms Feeney to add to the points in the strategy.  The strategy was extended under Rebuilding Ireland and it is not being delayed.  We want to go through a very robust consultation process this year to ensure we bring in all the stakeholders concerned.  I am aware that we are dealing with very vulnerable people and we need to ensure they have an opportunity to have a say on the policy that will shape their lives and housing options in the future.  We need a strong strategy to go forward with.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned a case, which I will not go into because I cannot refer to any particular cases, but there are a number of options for people with disabilities in terms of funding streams through the local authorities.  The schemes are very robust.  There is significant uptake.  Where there are pressures in local authority areas, demand is so strong on the ground.  That is why we have consistently increased the allocation over the past five years to give people a choice of independent living, which is so important to us and which is enshrined in the programme for Government.</p> <p>  Let me refer to the various allocations.  The housing adaptation grant for people with a disability gives up to &euro;30,000 to cover up to 95% of the works.  Under the mobility aids grant scheme, applicants may obtain quickly a fund of &euro;6,000, which may cover 100% of the cost of the works.  This is to try to give people assistance, where they need it, to live in their own home.  That is notwithstanding the disabled person's grant for works on local housing authority stock, together with all the various construction works and acquisitions under the capital advance leasing scheme, the capital assistance scheme and local authority-led housing policy.  There is a large number of areas.</p> <p>  The demand for housing for the disabled on the national list amounts to 8%.  The Department allocates an average of 12%.  Therefore, we are outpacing demand and trying to deliver solutions in a very challenging environment.  We are doing our very best in that regard.  I have heard the points the Deputy made.  I ask Ms Feeney to comment on the current position on the strategy and our sense of urgency in bringing all agencies on board in respect of it.</p></speech>

The deadline we have for the strategic plan is a soft deadline, namely the end of May.  The reason we have settled on that date is to try to ensure we are getting the local pictures as well as the national feed-in so it will not be a case of taking submissions at national level, with submissions being received only through the website.  It is a matter of also taking on board local input, even the local strategic plans in draft.  If any local authority or housing and disability steering group has a concern about the short timeframe, we can absolutely address that and take a submission in draft initially.<br/><br/>With regard to the overall strategy and the consultation, I will give a rundown on what we are doing.  As the Minister of State said, the deadline for the completion of the strategy is the end of this year.  I am told we will have it ready on the Minister's desk by the middle of November.  At present, we are in the consultation phase.  We currently have a landing page on our website, <i>www.housingagency.ie</i>.  There are a number of versions of the questionnaire there, including English and Irish versions.  These have been enabled to be compatible with all text-to-speech systems.  We have an easy-read and plain English Word version because the platform we use did not allow for full easy-read capability.  The easy-read Word version can be downloaded, completed and posted back to us.  The address is on the website.  We also have a PDF version that can be completed and emailed.  In addition, we have a video that goes through all the questions.  It is only ten minutes long.  People can use it as a guide, whether they are doing a facilitated session with people or otherwise.<br/><br/>The next round of advertisements will be in the newspapers on Sunday.  They will include a contact number that people can ring to request a hard copy of the survey because we are conscious that not everybody might have access to online services.  In addition, we are making people very much aware that it is not just about the questionnaire; if they want to make a submission, they should do so.  We have set a deadline of 16 April for closing off the survey or questionnaire but we will accept submissions up to the end of May.</p><p>On the issue of hearing the voices of people with disabilities, there have been 920 online submissions to date.  Of the 872 people who answered the initial question, "Who are you?", 184 or 20% are disabled people and a further 35% are a family member of a disabled person.  It is encouraging that we are getting the real views of the people we are going to affect through the new strategy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.446" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021033000002#D00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for joining us today.  The first thing I want to talk about is the local authorities' housing adaptation grants and all that goes with them.  I have come across a situation in my constituency whereby people apply for these grants and find themselves going over an income threshold, in some cases because they have somebody in the house.  I know of an elderly couple who have a daughter with special needs in the house.  Their three incomes were combined and it meant they did not get the full value of the grant because they were over a certain threshold.  The thresholds are there for a reason but they should be looked at and index linked each year rather than leaving them static over a long time.</p> <p>  The housing adaptation grants are great for people who want to remain in their homes and I compliment the local authorities.  However, there should be a bit more support for people who need it to allow them to remain in their homes.  That is especially the case with the adaptation of a bathroom, for example, where a bath needs to be replaced with a level access shower.  That type of thing should be fully endorsed with a good lump of money for applicants because they will come up with the balance, whether through going to the credit union or whatever is necessary.</p> <p>  There is also a lack or gap in the system when it comes to people who acquire an injury which leaves them in a wheelchair, or where they have an accident and must have a limb amputated, or where they acquire a brain injury.  All of a sudden, such people's whole lives have changed.  They might need to adapt the house fully to make sure they can live there.  Take the example of a two-storey house with bedrooms upstairs.  If one wants to build a ground floor area where an injured person can live a truly full life, the amount of grant available is small compared with what the overall cost to do something like that can be.  That needs to be looked at.</p> <p>  Parents who have children with autism have told me they want to make sure they have some sort of sensory room within their homes for their children.  There is very little support for something like that.  What we have in terms of grants for adaptations from local authorities is good but they need to be reviewed and the thresholds need to be increased.  We should also look at increasing the amount of money available, especially for people who, all of a sudden, find themselves in a position where their lives have changed and they have to adapt their houses in a speedy way.  Such people often have to borrow money to make those alterations, which is on top of all the stress of their lives having changed.</p> <p>  In general, with the designing of houses for private or public use, it is important the housing agencies are included in what we are doing here.  When a universal design is built, there is an additional cost that must be borne by the State to make sure we allow people to live full and independent lives as much as they can.  We are now reviewing local authority strategies, but the local authorities also need support from central government to make sure things happen.</p> <p>  That was a commentary.  Does anybody want to say anything about the level of grants from local authorities, which I think are brilliant?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021033000002#D00300"><p>The Deputy hit the nail on the head in terms of allowing people to live independently and supporting them to do so.  That is the first choice for people.  They want to be kept in their homes.  I acknowledge that 80% of the grant aid comes from the Department, with 20% a key allocation from the local authority.  We will, towards the end of this year, review the thresholds.  The various grants have different thresholds.  One progressive move that was piloted in a few counties and which we will be implementing is that the three main grants will be under one form.  That will make it easier for people to understand and make the grants more accessible.</p> <p>  It can be hard when demands and needs are great and means thresholds are set because there is always going to be a difficult case outside the threshold.  That is difficult but we will do our best to review it and accommodate as many people as we can.  It can be seen from the uptake of the grants that they are strong.  It just shows society is using them and they are making a difference.  We will work to try to keep rolling out the grants as quickly as we can.  I would also note that if there is any spare money, it is often allocated to local authorities for this purpose because it is providing a considerable service to people and their lives.  I acknowledge and note what the Deputy said about building regulations.</p></speech>

While the 12% may be ahead of the 8% demand, a concern we have and we have seen in submissions to the committee is that a number of people who have a disability and are in need of independent housing are not, in fact, even on the housing list.  What work can go into identifying those who may be housed <i>per se</i>but are not housed in accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and in a way appropriate to them that reflects their rights and choices?</p><p>Others have asked about congregated settings.  I know the Minister of State will be creating new instruments, but some of those he has had to use were from a pre-UNCRPD era.  For example, a crude measure of the number of people in a house, be it four or ten, does not capture the idea of choice for persons with a disability and, indeed, the obligations of the State in that regard.  Choice for Travellers should also be included.  How do we bring in disability standards in respect of Traveller accommodation and halting sites?</p><p>In that regard, what are the plans to review Part M of the building regulations?  It is not currently fit for purpose.  Part M refers to the visitability of buildings.  As the Minister of State has acknowledged, the regulations set a minimum, and while it may encourage other standards, the issue is around the quality criteria.  We must raise the technical specifications as a whole for all buildings, and that could be done by reforming Part M.  The State can and should be doing more by adding quality criteria in terms of universal design in housing built by the State.  What are the Minister of State's plans in respect of universal design for housing that is built, purchased or funded by the State?  What are his thoughts on raising the Part M specifications as the minimum?  I am explicitly thinking about new builds and new housing but also in terms of publicly owned housing.</p><p>This comes into the area of the Land Development Agency.  I am concerned about the ratio of social and affordable housing affordable to commercial housing proposed by the Land Development Agency.  Does the Minister of State think there is a case for an additional percentage specifically in respect of disability accessible housing that would be publicly owned and public rental for persons with a disability which would then increase our housing stock and be there as something that could be used again?  I am suggesting publicly owned public rental housing for persons with a disability and, perhaps, putting in a specific additional cohort of social housing in respect of that, as well as raising the general universal standards.</p><p>I have two quick questions in respect of public amenities because the Minister of State's remit includes planning.  How do we ensure universally accessible public amenities are factored into the design of all of these new neighbourhoods we are planning to build?  Could there be a proposal for combining housing adaptation and retrofitting grants?</p><p>We know large-scale retrofitting will be rolled out.  Could there be a combined proposal for which people could apply?  I believe that would be appealing to many people and would allow the standard to be raised.</p><p> My next question relates to renters.  There are many disabled people in the private rental market.  How do we ensure they can seek housing adaptation and be supported in doing so?  How do we ensure they do not have security of tenure jeopardised if they seek measures?  Under much of the current tenancy legislation adaptation or works to premises are among the things that push people out.  Bearing in mind that statutory home care provisions are on the way we are going to see a significant push up in demand.  We need to get ahead of the curve in that regard.</p></speech>

The Minister will be setting the affordability criteria by regulation in respect of the Land Development Agency.  This will be a key driver in delivering affordable and social homes.  Reference has been made to liaising with the local authority.  The local authority will be driving this with the Land Development Agency as the product manager carrying out work on these sites.  The disability groups within the local authorities will shape the demand in each different area.  It will be up to the local authority to ensure it is delivered through the Land Development Agency.  It is something we are keen to look at to try to increase the level of housing available for those with a disability.  We are doing that through all the schemes.</p> <p>  I mentioned the major increase in scale.  I know we are coming from a low base but there has been a major increase.  I cited 300% over five years under the capital assistance scheme in delivering construction units suitable for people with disability and to encourage independent living.</p> <p>  Deputy Canney has acknowledged the support we need to get to the appropriate place in terms of the building control regulations.  Currently, the National Disability Authority and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are looking at how we can bring universal design more into the delivery of new units.  That working group is entitled Building for Everyone and is due to report soon.  We are currently working on that across the Department.</p> <p>  Reference was made to public areas and planning.  One of the key actors within the Department is the urban regeneration and development fund.  That is one thing we will really prioritise.  We have had an allocation of &euro;1.3 billion in the past three weeks to try to unlock the potential for all citizens within our regional cities and towns.  We are talking about making publicly-run places more conducive for people from all sectors of society, including those with disabilities.  One key asset we have is a competitive process to unlock the potential of our towns and cities.  I see that as an important process in delivering on this measure as well.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to various schemes to help to keep people in their homes.  As I said to Deputy Canney, they are being reviewed at the end of the year.  We have had one application process to cover three schemes.  We have improved our language in terms of ensuring it meets the threshold of plain English and that it is accessible for people.  We are willing to work with and assist people through that process with a shared goal whatever the sector.  This applies whether we are talking about the private rental sector, working through the disabled person grant scheme with a local authority or where a person owns his or her own home and is looking for an intervention through adaptation and mobility grants.  All those different grants to try to unlock the potential.  The Senator rightly said that time has passed since the UN charter was signed.  Two-year and four-year reporting mechanisms will be built into the agreement.  Now we are approaching our two-year reporting mechanism.  We are looking under the various different areas at the progress we have made.  We acknowledge that we have a great deal more to do.</p> <p>  Articles 9 and 19 directly impact on our Department in terms of delivering housing.  I have referred to the work we have done relating to Part M of second schedule to the building regulations.</p> <p>  I have also referenced ongoing work with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We have moved to have disability certificates for commercial apartment blocks and buildings.  We have age-friendly and walkability surveys for 52 towns.  I have mentioned how a streamlined application process for the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, could unlock that potential and make centres more age-friendly or disability-friendly.  All of these are key in terms of Article 9.</p> <p>  The main thrust of our national disability strategy comes into being through Article 19.  This is borne out by how we work in close co-operation with our agencies to deliver disability housing and give people the choice and independence to live in their own homes or in supported accommodation.  That is so important and we are working to do that.  We work closely with the HSE in delivering that.</p></speech>

I am heartened by the ambition of the Department to increase the social housing stock by 50,000 in the coming five years.</p> <p>  I note that studies of the economic well-being of disabled persons and person with disabilities regularly show that they are disadvantaged economically.  While I welcome the plans for inclusion of disability needs across all types of housing, including social and affordable and private housing, we should make particular provision for social housing.  I am heartened to see the figures on that and in particular that 10% of all social housing during the past ten years has been provided to persons with disabilities.  Can the Minister of State give an idea of the percentage on the housing list who have denoted a need relating to disability and mobility provision?  I am curious to know where the 10% figure fits in.</p> <p>  I note the strategy on community inclusion and the provisions relating to the policy on time to move on from congregated setting.  Even with universal design houses are built to baseline standards.  This costs organisations in trying to advance community inclusion in terms of having to retrofit houses.  It would be wise for the Department to have conversations with great organisations like Cheeverstown regarding its advice and input.  I believe it would be important to have a discussion with those involved about how universal design could be made even more universal and inclusive.  Mobility champions like Colin McAndrew have really influenced my thinking on the surrounding infrastructure and the environment around housing to ensure we have accessibility by design.  He has commented on how when we make society accessible for people with the least mobility, then we make it accessible for everyone now and in the future.  Any planned need for housing provision should be linked up to the environmental infrastructure surrounding it.</p> <p>  My next question relates to the role of the local authorities from a social housing and infrastructure point of view.  What engagement has the Minister of State had with local authorities specifically to advance that?  My experience of South Dublin County Council was that it was fantastic, ambitious and open.  I am keen to know how the local authorities are engaging with the Minister of State on this matter.</p></speech>

That is important to say.  One of the priority actions under the national disability plan is action 1.1.  As I mentioned before, this led to the establishment of a steering committee within each of the local authorities.  It places an obligation on the local authority to put forward a five-year plan on how it would resolve and respond to the needs of those on the list, especially those in need of special accommodation for disabilities.</p> <p>  Senator Seery Kearney asked a question on local authority data.  It normally runs around the level of 8% but can vary according to the different local authorities.  Nationally, it is approximately 8%.  That five-year programme sets out how the local authorities are responding to the need and shapes how they deliver their housing units.</p> <p>  One thing is really heartening.  We are experiencing difficult times with Covid-19.  I have referenced where construction is.  The overall disability allocation for housing tenancies has increased by 64% from 2016 and we had 2,389 allocations in 2019 up from 1,179 in 2016.</p><p>The allocations are across all the categories that are so important, including physical, sensory, intellectual and mental health and they are being delivered on the ground by local authorities, which is so important.</p><p> I refer to new reference too in terms of the various needs, which was mentioned.  Priority action 5.4 relating to mental health sustainability officers is something we really need to examine in the next plan to see how we can increase that provision.</p><p> It is very important to support people in tenancies.  That is another significant issue.  It can be daunting for those with a disability or a mental health issue when they are placed in a tenancy.  We really need to get wrap-around supports in place.  That will be a key part of the next process.  </p><p> The Senator referred to local authorities.   When I was a councillor and chair of my municipal district, an experiment carried out by the Irish Wheelchair Association with several elected members really opened my eyes.  One councillor was blindfolded and another was put in a wheelchair and they were brought around the local town to experience the impediments there are that the Senator and I would not notice while walking around.  It was an incredible experience in terms of making me aware of the basic infrastuctural improvements that we really need to deliver to unlock opportunities for people.  We are working hard, through the 31 local authorities, to try to deliver in respect of those important issues.</p><p> I refer to the importance of the various forms being accessible and in plain English.  It is very important to ensure there is no impediment to people in terms of applying and being supported through the application process for housing adaptations in order to give them that choice and independent living.</p></speech>

He may be aware that the remit of the committee is to ensure that all Departments adhere to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and to implement it.  Article 19 of the convention states:</p> <blockquote> 	Persons with disabilities have the opportunity to choose their place of residence and where and with whom they live on an equal basis with others and are not obliged to live in a particular living arrangement. </blockquote> <p>However, to take the example of my county of Cavan, I am aware of at least five persons with disabilities who have been waiting more than ten years for housing.  I know their situation is replicated across the country.  It is a direct denial of people's right to live independently and it is in contravention of the UN convention.</p><p>Disabled people are being forced to live with ageing parents who are being expected to provide what sometimes is quite complex care for a son or daughter.  That is not dignified for anyone concerned.  Many ageing parents, often in their 70s or 80s, constantly worry about what will happen to their son or daughter when they pass.  They fear their child will end up in a residential setting, possibly miles from home and family and without the proper level of suitable care.  We have many documents that outline that this issue will be addressed but it has not been addressed thus far.  I want to be fair to local authorities because I believe they are trying to address this issue but there is a lack of co-ordination between them and other agencies.  What can be done to bring the HSE in particular on board to ensure that supported living is provided to people in these situations?</p><p>At one stage last summer, there were six families in County Cavan who were local authority tenants and needed a transfer or significant works done to their houses due to illness or an accident making their current accommodation unsuitable.  They had to wait quite lengthy periods and either live in unsuitable accommodation, remain in hospital or go into a nursing home.  How much money is made available to tackle emergencies such as these?  I am sure such emergencies happen all over the country.  I make that point without even broaching the issue of private home owners who need work carried out on their houses.  </p><p>I do not expect an answer to my next question today, but I ask that one of the officials forward an answer in writing.  Ireland has the lowest rate of employment in the EU for people with disabilities.  What is the rate of employment of people with disabilities within the Department of the Minister of State and in each of the local authorities?  Are there disability or access officers employed within the Department and local authorities?  If so, how many of those people have lived experience of disability?</p></speech>

I appreciate her comments and her understanding of the situation.  As one who has come from the local authority sector, she can really see first hand the challenges that are faced.  I have articulated the various schemes and the increased allocations we have made, but one can always say it is never enough because we are speaking about the most vulnerable people who require the most additional support.  I assure the Deputy that approximately &euro;75 million has been allocated to the adaptation schemes this year.  Obviously, those with disabilities will feed strongly into that process.  Provision is also made under capital schemes such as the capital assistance scheme, CAS, and the capital advanced leasing facility, CALF, scheme.  All of those schemes are targeted to ensure there is housing for the disability sector.</p> <p>  I will bring in Ms Feeney to outline in more detail how we are responding to Article 19 of the convention.</p></speech>

One of things about which we and the Minister of the State have always had a concern is that people moving from congregated settings have a choice regarding where they go.  It is very much about having a care plan that is developed with the person, not for the person.  Circular 45/2015 set out clearly how the co-operation was to work.  There are some really good examples of where co-operation has been worked, such as where funding may come through the HSE into one of the specific approved housing bodies, AHBs, to provide support and the local councils provide the actual housing.  For example, there have been schemes in Fingal with the Housing Association for Independent Living, HAIL and Co-operative Housing Ireland, in Cork with the Cope Foundation, as well as in Longford and various other places.</p> <p>  The Minister of State alluded to the issue of mental health tenancy sustainment and the joint funding aspect of that.  It is very much about ensuring that people can live in places and houses of their choice and be supported to do so.  In 2017, a guide to the assessment of and allocations for people with a disability was issued to local authorities.  That too was very much about ensuring there was choice for people and that they could work with their service provider and local authority with regard to the provision of housing.  The guide provided examples in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.458" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021033000002#F00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his attendance.  Senator Higgins covered some of the topics I wished to address, such as new builds by the State and State-provided housing, so I will address the issue of the private sector.  I refer to the construction sector currently and the kinds of housing that are being made available on the market.  Obviously, the requirement for appropriate housing does not just impact persons in supported housing; it impacts on the wider building stock.  Many families would benefit from having greater choice, to which the Minister of State referred.  Older people in particular would benefit from universal design.</p> <p>  We know that people with disabilities are more likely to experience poverty and are vulnerable to difficulties in securing housing.  The reality is that many people with disabilities will use the housing assistance payment, HAP, to house themselves.  In that context, I refer to build-to-rent units.  Obviously, construction has been somewhat disrupted in 2020 and 2021.  However, in 2019 turnover in the build-to-rent sector more than doubled, to &euro;2.54 billion, as institutional investors came into Ireland and swamped the market.  It is a highly profitable housing model.  Sales of build-to-rent units in 2019 comprised nearly 3,000 homes, while the total number of units that were in train or of which construction had begun was in excess of 6,500.</p><p>Build-to-rent units represent a significant proportion of our new building stock.  For those who are not aware, build-to-rent units have the following exemptions: there are no restrictions on dwelling mix; there is significant flexibility on the minimum storage standards and private amenity requirements; there is a default minimum or significantly reduced car parking provision; the requirement that all apartments in a proposed scheme exceed the minimum floor area standards by a minimum of 10% does not apply to build-to-rent schemes, so all the units can be the minimum space requirement, and is 37 sq. m for studio apartments, which is significantly lower than in 2014; and the requirement for a maximum of 12 apartments per floor, per stair core and lift, does not apply.</p><p> Build-to-rent typologies and building units do not necessarily represent high-quality building standards and they do not represent spacious building standards or universal design.  As BTR housing is exempt from the standard requirements for storage and public amenities, all BTR developers must provide is evidence the proposed facilities are appropriate to the intended rental market.  I take it that the intended rental market includes people with disabilities.  My understanding of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is that we include people with disabilities.</p><p> Local authorities have a role to play here but the majority of BTRs are constructed under the sustainable housing development, SHD, scheme and are controlled by the Department.  Does the Department believe build-to-rent provides appropriate housing choice to persons with disabilities?  Does the Department take the view the planning guidance on build-to-rent is in compliance with the spirit or technical requirements of the UNCRPD?</p><p> Can the Minister of State outline the evidence the Department requires from developers in producing applications for permission to build-to-rent in relation to the suitability of the design for persons with disabilities?  Does the Department provide guidance to developers or local authorities on build-to-rent specifically in relation to the provision of housing for people with disabilities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.460" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021033000002#G00200"><p>I thank Deputy Hourigan for her questions.  The Deputy well articulated the pressure points we face.  On Government policy on design, the design guidelines issued for the construction of apartments state 50% of any developments of nine apartments or more must have a  minimum of 10% increased, oversized space.  There are also clear guidelines that developments have lift access and that floors have open thresholds in terms of rooms and design criteria to ensure they are more friendly for those with a disability.</p> <p>  I mentioned the Churchill fellowship in terms of the study done across many different countries, which put Ireland as moving quickly towards the ambitions set out in the UN charter.  We are not there yet and, as I said, an upcoming report within the two years will articulate that.  However, the planning system must try to deliver units that cater easily for, and offer choice to, people with disabilities.</p> <p>  As Deputy Canney outlined, we must be careful in terms of the consequences for delivery at present.  With that in mind, we have asked that a cost-benefit analysis be carried out - it  is currently under way in the Department - to report back on how we can get to this universal mechanism and support the private sector to get to it, which is important in terms of delivering units.</p> <p>  I previously articulated how Part M of the building regulations has improved and supported delivery of units for those with disabilities and in terms of disability access in commercial settings on the building control side, which has been significantly ramped up in recent years.  While I acknowledge we are not there yet, we are improving.  There is a considerable number of tenancies currently on HAP that are in the disability sector.</p> <p>  It is about offering choice and a chance at independent living for vulnerable people.  I articulated how much the allocations and the grant thresholds from various funding streams have increased since 2016.  We are working on a cost-benefit analysis.  I already mentioned that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is working on, and feeding into, the design process.  We are renewing our strategy in that context.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State.  Many of the questions I wanted to ask have already been asked.  We have a shortage of social housing, in particular two-bedroom units.  We need to consider building more two-bedroom units.  If one drives into a local authority housing estate, or even a private estate, one rarely sees five or six bungalows beside one another.  We must think about building more bungalows in the long term for people with disabilities and people who are getting older.  That should be a priority.</p> <p>  Many of the people I work with, in conjunction with the Carlow local authority, are looking for two-bedroom houses.  A person with a disability would want a two-bedroom bungalow.  We speak about adaptation grants, which we all welcome.  They are so important.  We have the mobility and disabled grants.  In Carlow, all the grants are on the one form, which I welcome, but the funding comes from different sources.  The mobility grant is not like the adaptation grant and nor is how one qualifies for it.  I am glad it is being considered because grants are so important, and we all welcome them, but how does a person qualify for a grant?</p> <p>  I am working with a young lady who is a wheelchair user and who is living in a local authority house.  She does not qualify for a grant for windows and doors because she is not over 66 years of age.  One always tries to see what people qualify for but people under a certain age do not qualify for a grant for windows and doors.  The grant system needs to be considered.  Local authorities have received much funding this year for grants.  It is welcome but we must ensure we balance the grants, so people who need to access them qualify for them, without having to be over 66 years of age.</p> <p>  I want to ask the Minister of State about the length of time people with a disability are on the housing list, which is an issue.  We have 31 local authorities and the Minister of State is aware there seems to be a different mechanism in each local authority in order to qualify.  There is no sense of urgency in terms of people with disabilities or people who need houses.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State consider having a disability officer in each local authority to deal specifically with these issues?  They are very serious.  We spoke about mental health, which is another issue.  Mental health will be so important going forward but people whose mental health is suffering and who need the help of a local authority should be able to contact a staff member who works solely on mental health.  I ask the Minister of State to work on issues, such as this, because that is where we are falling down.</p> <p>  We spoke about the grant thresholds.  Grants are means-tested.  As the threshold for local authority housing has not been reviewed for more than ten years, I know of people who do not qualify to go on their local authority housing list because they are on disability but their partner or spouse is working.  That is unacceptable.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister of State to consider the review of local authority housing because it is a significant issue.  We must give out information on these issues.  I can only praise Carlow County Council, which is my county council, whose staff are always so helpful when one is looking for information.  However, we must give out more information.</p><p>People with disabilities or with mental health issues are not getting the proper information.  I ask that the committee look at making sure information is made available as part of its work going forward.  We have all gone through Covid-19.  People are staying within their own 5 km area and everyone is trying to work within the boundaries.  Local authorities&rsquo; hours have changed so if people must access their services, they have to telephone because the office is closed.  That is okay because we must be respectful of what is happening now, but we cannot keep going the way we are going.  I ask the Minister of State and his Department to look at these issues going forward.</p></speech>

For the first time under the national planning framework, the Department has a tool called the housing demands and needs assessment tool.  That will shape the delivery plans of our local authorities regarding the type of housing required in specific jurisdictions and areas.</p> <p>  That will, hopefully, assist in alleviating the particular demand the Deputy quite rightly referenced.  In terms of the allocations, and the Deputy rightly praised her local authority, there has been a huge increase.  I know it can be frustrating to people but if I look back at where we were five years ago, we have increased the figure by 64%.  We had 2,389 allocations last year of all types.  I am talking about sensory, physical, mental health and different categories being catered for.  It is still improving.  I fully accept we have a long way to go but one can see the work being done on the ground and what is being delivered to people.</p> <p>    The Deputy raised a valid point in terms of forms and that is why we piloted a new medical and housing form this year in four local authorities, which was very successful.  We have assessed it and made a few changes.  We hope that from next month that form will be used throughout our local authority network.  That will improve access for people to these important supports for those with disabilities.  It has obviously been stress-tested and it is in plain English.  I referenced in my previous contribution three main headline grants to support those with disabilities which we have put on one form and which is in plain English.  Obviously, our disabled persons grants, DPG, are not means-tested for our local authority housing stock.  A huge amount of work can be done delivering them on the ground.  As a Deputy, I see, as I am sure the Deputy does, the various people who come into our clinics.  One also sees many vulnerable people who have been looked after.  What drives one on in politics is trying to address the demand.  I refer to the gold-plated standard under the UN strategy which the Department is working very hard to try to achieve.</p> <p>    As I pointed out at the start, a &euro;3.3 billion headline budget as outlined by increases in various sectors will hopefully bring about huge changes during the years ahead.  Without sounding tone-deaf, I say that in terms of being under the pressures of Covid regulations throughout the construction sector. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.464" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021033000002#H00300"><p>I confirm I am in Leinster House.  I thank the Chair for allowing me to participate in this afternoon&rsquo;s meeting.  I have followed the debate all along.  I thank the witnesses for their participation.  This is a matter close to my own heart.  I have a few issues I want to put to the witnesses.</p> <p>  The Covid crisis has served as a wake-up call to many families particularly in parts of rural Ireland where there are elderly and ageing parents looking after a younger person with a disability in the house.  Covid has caused us all to look at our own fragility.  We have seen in excess of 4,000 people lose their lives in Ireland over the last 12 months.  It is a reminder of the fact that many older people will not be around forever, and they need to future-plan for the needs of their child.</p> <p>  It concerns me that there is a mountain of applications for sheltered accommodation building.  I do not necessarily believe we are meeting those needs.  I hope some of the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials can dig into some of those figures, if possible.  Are there figures available in relation to applications versus availability of accommodation for people with physical and intellectual disabilities in the mid-west?  Are those statistics available today?  I will come in with another question afterwards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1456" speakername="Michael Moynihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021033000002#H00400"><p>We will take the Deputy&rsquo;s question all at once.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021033000002#H00500"><p>I am happy to do that.  I want to raise the point about the location of housing for people mainly with intellectual disabilities.  There seems to be a trend around large houses at the edge of a village or a town, which are typically former bed and breakfasts that have ceased trading.  One sees this regularly in county towns.  There is an eight or ten-bedroom unit at the edge of a town or village, which nobody wants to buy because no family has a use for a property of that size.  Quite typically, a section 39 organisation, such as Brothers of Charity or RehabCare, snaps up these properties.  They are usually available at a competitive price.  They become a site for sheltered accommodation for people with intellectual disabilities.  I do not necessarily think they are in the right location and we really need to look at this.</p> <p>  There is a fabulous facility being planned for Ruan in north County Clare, which is a wonderful village.  It is a village I, and many people in Clare, would love to live in.  However, we have to ask whether it is best positioned for someone with an intellectual disability to have the highest level of independence he or she yearns for.  I have someone quite close to me who has an intellectual disability.  Someone with an intellectual disability needs to be able, at several times of the day, to walk out the door, go to local shops and access services, and go on local transport.  Sometimes these former bed and breakfast properties which are being snapped up are not best fitted for the needs of those people.  </p> <p>  My last point relates to locations.  I refer to many of the units identified as housing for people with intellectual and physical disabilities, and the ancillary infrastructure around them.  The Minister of State has already identified inadequacies in terms of footpaths etc.  There must be metrics other than price and proximity to the edge of a town or village that can be looked at.  We must look holistically at what a house has to offer in terms of overall accessibility and its usefulness to the person staying in it in terms of the quality of his or her everyday life.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021033000002#H00600"><p>I will bring Ms Feeney in on that point in a moment.  I drilled down into the figure earlier on in terms of the current list nationally.  There are approximately 5,002 approved applicants with a disability, and I cited that is around 8% of the national housing list.  I referred to how we are providing 12% solutions.  In terms of our allocations, we are prioritising, as much as we can, those within the disability sector to ensure their housing needs are met.</p> <p>  On location, one critical thing is that the national planning framework, to be fair, will point infrastructure towards housing needs.  That in addition to our urban regeneration and development funding will absolutely give a huge chance.  We have the plan to unlock the potential.  I have seen on many occasions section 38 and 39 organisations purchasing properties out in the countryside with no infrastructure to support them, with no transport for very vulnerable people.  This limits their choice compared to if they were in a town which had all services beside them to meet their needs.  I absolutely agree 100% with the Deputy on that point.  We need to look at that issue.</p> <p>  The Deputy highlighted another point.  As a Deputy, I have seen elderly parents who have a son or daughter with a severe disability.  They worry and experiencing stressful feelings about the future.  That presents a huge challenge to the State.  My Department is working with the HSE and we are doing significant work in that area but there is no doubt more that needs to be done.  One can think of people who have a business.  They are probably working longer than they should be.  They are trying to hold on to their business in some cases where they may have no sibling or child to take over the business.  They are worrying about whether their business is going to be wiped out in terms of means-tested applications for the future.  I know Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is doing a huge amount of work in this area as well and have had discussions with her in that context.</p><p>I might bring Ms Feeney in to respond to Deputy Cathal Crowe on that issue.</p></speech>

A very important issue is looking at future need, of which the housing subgroup would have been very conscious, covering such things as elderly parents.  We are working with the Health Research Board.  It has a database that holds quite an amount of information about people's housing need, so it has details on the housing need of anybody accessing disability funding.  We are looking at how we can share information so that at a county level, we can help to inform the local strategic plans.  One of the most important things is around raising awareness of the benefits of being on the housing list and the housing options available to people.  One section in the local strategic plans being produced by local authorities involves local authorities identifying how to raise awareness of housing options.  We are aware that the Irish Wheelchair Association is planning a campaign shortly, which we will support 100%.  It was raised at all of the housing and disability steering groups and it will be supported at local level.  It will increase the number of people on the housing list and will then give local authorities and the Department a better view of how to strategically plan for housing need over the next five years through Housing For All.</p></speech>

There are issues regarding the adaptation grants.  In some cases, the grant might need to be increased with regard to a specialised adaptation needed for the person with a disability.  There should be a bit of flexibility in this regard to meet the needs of somebody with a specific need, who would be in a nursing home or healthcare facility if there was no flexibility or some way of addressing that issue.</p> <p>  Regarding two-bedroom accommodation mentioned by some members, the availability of housing for single people is causing significant concern across the country and needs to be looked at specifically for persons with disabilities.  We will have an ongoing discussion with the Minister of State because issues will arise from time to time at which we need to look.  What discussions is the Department having with local authorities regarding the county development plans and strengthening the connection between the Department and local authorities to make sure there is better provision for people with disabilities?</p> <p>  There needs to be a new discussion between the Department and section 39 organisations about how they are trying to get funding for their builds for respite and residential care.  That is part of our remit and we will look at this issue.  As members said, they are looking at value for money because they are charitable organisations and do not have endless resources.  The Department needs to be very mindful of that and look under the various schemes, such as the capital assistance scheme, to ensure there is scope for section 39 organisations to get the best property to serve the people whose lives we hope to improve through the work of this committee.  It is important that the Minister of State takes this on board from this meeting.  Does he wish to make a few closing remarks?</p></speech>

There will be a review later this year of the various grant schemes.  I appreciate, understand and know the value and importance of these schemes.  We can bring that in with our engagement with the HSE in terms of the Chairman's remarks on section 39 organisations.  It is very important that we have cross-communication because there are so many different actors providing services in the disability sector on behalf of the State.  As we shape and develop our new strategy, it is important that we cover them all in a more coherent way.  I acknowledge that this is very important.</p> <p>  Regarding the Chairman's comments on the county development plans, the Department issued a direction in the past ten days to ensure that these plans meet the need for the process in line with the national planning framework and our regional and local strategies because it is so important that units are developed for the type of need that is there.  Our regulator will be looking at this.  Deputy Murnane O'Connor clearly articulated how two-bedroom units are needed so badly.  We will look at all that and I am happy to engage with the committee in the future.  I thank the members and my officials.</p></speech>

Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely, that is, outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity for legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present in the building.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams prior to making their contribution to the meeting to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. O'Sullivan, who is very welcome, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am afraid I had to look up the word for "video link"; it was not in the dictionary when I was studying Irish.</p> <p>  It is a great pleasure and honour for me to be able to contribute to the committee's work on reflecting on the trade agreement with Canada.  I thought it might be helpful if I put the CETA debate in the broader context of EU trade policy.  I was the director-general for trade in the European Commission from November 2005 until November 2010, and I have continued to follow trade matters closely in my subsequent roles, most recently as EU ambassador to Washington.</p> <p>  During my time as director-general, there was a considerable evolution in EU trade policy.  Initially, all our energy was focused on trying to make a success of the World Trade Organization, WTO, negotiations launched in Doha in 2001.  We even placed a moratorium on the negotiation of new bilateral trade deals in order to underline our commitment to the multilateral process.  However, by 2006, it was becoming clear that the Doha round might not succeed and other trading partners such as the US were restarting bilateral deals.  The EU decided to launch three sets of bilateral deals with South Korea, India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN.  The deal with South Korea was concluded in 2010 and I had the pleasure of presiding over it.  The search for a region to region deal with ASEAN was abandoned in favour of a series of bilateral deals, leading to free trade agreements with Vietnam and Singapore.  The negotiations with India, initially promising, were, unfortunately, never concluded.</p> <p>  In 2008, after the collapse of the Doha development agenda, even more bilateral negotiations began, and, today, the European Union is at the centre of the largest free trade network the world has ever seen, with 44 agreements covering 76 countries, representing 33% of total EU trade flows.  Negotiations are currently in hand for free trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and the Philippines.  A deal has been reached with Mercosur, the South American customs union, which awaits a formal Commission proposal to the Council and Parliament for possible signature.</p> <p>  It is important to underline that these new trade deals were intended to be significantly more comprehensive than previous free trade agreements.  They sought to cover nearly all goods, significant chunks of trade in services, regulatory matters and sustainable development issues, such as environmental and labour standards.</p><p>This was part of a broader trend of recognising, on the one hand, that non-tariff barriers can be as significant, if not even greater, barriers to trade than tariffs and, on the other, that trade agreements needed to address a wider set of level playing field issues, a term that has become well known in Ireland because of the negotiations on Brexit.  This is both to ensure equity of trading terms and that FTAs would be a vehicle for mutually enhancing core regulatory standards to be agreed with our trading partners.<br/><br/>Canada was seen as an excellent test partner for this next-generation FTA because its own international trade policy had for some time sought to incorporate a broader range of issues, the case for mutual economic benefits from reduced barriers was a good one, and this has been borne out by the results of the provisional application, and because Canada was the type of like-minded partner with which the EU expected a productive dialogue.  Following an exploratory period in 2007 to 2008, formal talks with Canada were officially launched in 2009.  The negotiations were concluded in August 2014.  After approval of the text by all member states, it was signed in 2016.  The European Parliament gave its approval for the deal in February 2017.  Canada ratified the Comprehensive and Economic Trade Agreement, CETA, in May 2017.<br/><br/>In parallel, a strategic partnership agreement, SPA, was negotiated and it was signed in October 2016.  This reflects the fact that the EU conceives of a deepened FTA relationship not as purely economic, but as an opportunity to deepen relations with the partner across the board.  The strategic partnership agreement upgrades the framework of co-operation between the EU and Canada and expands the basis of the relationship, in parallel with what we are doing to foster trade and investment through CETA.  The agreement enshrines our shared democratic values and enhances political dialogue on a broad range of areas, including international peace and security, economic and sustainable development, justice, freedom and security.<br/><br/>Since both agreements contained elements considered of mixed competence, ratification by each member state individually is required, a process which can normally take several years to complete.  The SPA entered into provisional application in April 2017.  In order not to delay the benefits of the trade deal, it was agreed, provisionally, to apply matters of EU competence in CETA from September 2017.  In practice, this is probably 90% of the deal with the exception of portfolio investment and the investor court system.  This means that, in particular, most of the trade improvements have been in force since then, leading to a significant increase in trade in both goods and services.  For Ireland, bilateral trade has increased considerably as a result of the virtual elimination of tariffs.  Trade in goods alone between Canada and the EU was worth &euro;59 billion in 2019.  Ireland&rsquo;s trade in goods with Canada reached &euro;2 billion in 2019, an increase of 37% compared to pre-CETA trade.  Ireland has a positive trade balance of nearly &euro;1 billion with Canada, consisting mainly of chemicals, pharmaceuticals and agrifood products, particularly beverages.  Services exports at nearly &euro;2 billion have increased by 17%.<br/><br/>It is useful to reflect a little on what provisional application means.  Until the European Court of Justice judgment on the Singapore FTA in 2017, it was always assumed that the presence in any trade deal of even minor issues relating to mixed competence or exclusive member state competence required ratification by each country individually.  This process typically involves more than 40 parliaments, including those with bicameral systems as well as federal systems such as that of Belgium, which has seven parliaments that have to ratify.  I will not hide the fact that this caused considerable bewilderment from our trade partners who had to negotiate with the Commission, backed by the member states, secure signature via unanimous approval of all countries, secure the approval of the European Parliament and then still await formal ratification by all national parliaments.  The assumption had always been, and this has been the case until now, that given the rigorous scrutiny process needed for Council and European Parliament approval, ratification by national parliaments would be largely automatic.  National parliaments cannot renegotiate the texts and, therefore, are faced with a relatively binary choice, to accept or to reject.  They have that choice.<br/><br/>Provisional application was the technique developed to ensure that at least the trade benefits could be applied pending the final outcome of this sometimes lengthy approval process.  It is decided by the Council upon a proposal from the Commission and can only cover those aspects of the agreement fully within EU competence.  On this issue of exclusive versus mixed competence, a few years ago the Commission decided to test the assumption about exclusive versus mixed competence before the European Court of Justice.  It submitted, as a test case, a draft FTA with Singapore and asked the court whether it could not be considered as a matter of exclusive competence, notwithstanding the presence in the deal of certain elements of mixed or national competence.  The court found in a judgment in May 2017 that the Singapore deal as such needed national ratification, but laid down principles which opened the door to crafting trade deals in such a manner as only to need ratification at EU level, that is, a vote of the Council of Ministers and a vote in the European Parliament.  Based on this judgment, it is my view, and I believe others would share it, that it is highly likely the Canada deal, with the exception of the investment chapter, if presented today would not need national ratification, as was the case for the recently concluded EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement.  However, the Canada deal, as concluded in 2017 and already ratified by Canada, does require full national ratification.  This is why the matter is now before the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>Chairman, I will say a few words about the issue of investment because this is one of the elements of controversy in this agreement.  The Lisbon treaty, which entered into force in December 2009, added investment to the coverage of the trade competence of the EU in Article 207.Since the emergence of bilateral investment treaties in the late 1950s, member states had concluded many such agreements.  There were hundreds of bilateral investment treaties between member states and third countries.  It was decided to grandfather all these agreements on the understanding that they would be progressively phased out as EU deals took their place.  This required the Commission to negotiate investment chapters granting member states equivalent protection to that prevailing in the bilateral treaties.  Notably, it included a system of investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, which was designed to give European investors protection from arbitrary or discriminatory treatment by host governments of their investments outside of the EU via a system of independent arbitration.<br/><br/>The inclusion of such provisions became a major point of contention in the never completed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, negotiations with the United States.  As a result of that controversy, and following a wide public consultation which the Commission initiated on the subject, the EU has proposed to revamp investment protection rules, moving away from <i>ad hoc</i>arbitration panels in favour of a more court-like process.  The EU and its member states are actively supporting the establishment of a multilateral investment court, MIC, composed of a first instance and an appellate tribunal staffed by full-time adjudicators.  Canada was the first country to accompany and support the EU in this direction and has joined forces with the EU and others to promote the idea of an international multilateral court to handle such cases in the future.  We are not there yet because this will require an international agreement.  In the meantime, CETA breaks completely new ground in this area.  Not only does it contain strong language protecting the right of states to regulate but the investment court system established in CETA is composed of a first instance and an appellate tribunal, staffed by full-time adjudicators.  This represents a clear break from the <i>ad hoc</i>system of private arbitration of ISDS found in most bilateral treaties.  I understand that Ireland does not have any bilateral investment treaties and this is, therefore, not a procedure with which we are familiar or had to work in the past.<br/><br/>That concludes my opening remarks.  I hope I have been able to contribute to the committee's understanding of the origins and nature of the discussion on CETA.</p><p>I remain at the committee's disposal for any questions.</p></speech>

I will ask three questions.  The first relates to the fact that Mr. O'Sullivan has said this is more than a trade deal and is the precursor to the new generation of trade deals, including services, regulatory matters, labour standards and the environment.  Will Mr. O'Sullivan provide the committee with a brief understanding of why it was felt we would move away from trade deals to have a much broader set of arrangements to be negotiated between the European Union and other states or groups of states?</p> <p>  Second, the Singapore judgment from the European Court of Justice seems, according to the presentation Mr. O'Sullivan has given us, to have changed the ratification and probably the content of future trade deals that will be negotiated by the European Union.  Is CETA the last of its kind?  Will all future trade arrangements to be negotiated by the Commission be fundamentally different in character post the Singapore judgment?</p> <p>  My third question is the most important, from my perspective.  It is the most contentious issue and the one that we as Deputies have received most correspondence on.  Like everybody else on the committee, I have had enormous bilateral discussions with groups and individuals in my constituency and further afield on the investment protection mechanism, the so-called investment court system that Mr. O'Sullivan alluded to.  I have two simple questions in relation to this most fundamental issue.  Can we simply disconnect the investment court system from the CETA agreement?  The likelihood is that Canada would trust European courts to be fair and give fair judgments and I presume European countries would trust the Canadian court system to be impartial and fair in judgments of any disputes that might arise.  That would obviate the need for a parallel system that sits outside our court system and potentially outside our constitutional system.  Why would we not proceed with the agreement as has been provisionally implemented to date, seek bilaterally to dislodge the investment court system from the agreement and seek Canada's acceptance of that?  What would be the likelihood of that?</p></speech>

I will take the three questions in order.  Why did we move to a broader, more comprehensive approach on trade agreements?  There were three main reasons.  First, tariffs were important to reduce and, if possible, eliminate.  CETA does more or less eliminate tariffs between us on, I think, 98% of goods.  Second, there was a recognition that non-tariff barriers of various kinds were becoming the real issue and some degree of regulatory convergence and addressing of that issue in trade deals was important.  This was a general trend pursued by Canada and other partners in trade deals in the last decade or so.</p> <p>  The third reason relates to sustainable development, environmental and labour standard issues.  Increasingly, there was criticism saying trade deals did not take sufficient account of these issues so it was important to put these chapters into this generation of trade deals.  That is why we have more comprehensive deals.  The South Korea agreement of 2010 was a good example.  Recently we have seen that the European Union has criticised South Korea for its failure to ratify international labour organisation conventions, has initiated the dispute settlement in the agreement to try to change that situation and has made some progress.  This was also a response to wider societal and political concerns that trade deals needed to take into account these broader dimensions.  That is why we have these more comprehensive agreements which reflect both new economic realities and new political realities.</p> <p>  On the court judgment, I do not think it has changed the content of future deals.  The previous principle was known as the Pastis principle, an allusion to the French alcohol of which even a little drop put into a glass of water turns the water yellow.  The idea was that even if there was a very small bit of national or mixed competence in an agreement, that meant the whole agreement became mixed and needed the full complicated system of ratification.  The court basically said "No" and that as long as it is essentially about trade it can be considered a trade agreement, even if it touches on some other issues.  To link this to the Deputy's third question, it identified two areas in particular.  They were portfolio investment - or non-direct investment - and the investor court system or investor state provisions which it said would require full national ratification.  The issue is now how to package the results of the negotiation in such a way as to have the trade-focused part being subject to the slightly less complicated route of ratification at the level of the EU, requiring a decision of the Council of Ministers and of the European Parliament but not ratification at national level, and those elements, in particular relating to investment, which would still require full national ratification.</p> <p>  To the third question on the investor court system and whether it can be disconnected, I hinted that if we were today starting from scratch with a blank sheet of paper or had just the raw material of the Canada agreement and the Commission was deciding how to present it, that is probably what it would do.  I cannot speak for the Commission but the logic of what the court said would lead one in that direction.  However, we are not in that position in relation to Canada and we need to be clear about this.  The package of CETA, including the investment court system, has been ratified and is concluded.  Trying to disconnect it would require a renegotiation and one cannot just renegotiate one thing.  It does not work that way.  Once one opens the Pandora's box by saying one would like to revisit this text, Canada might be well disposed but would be under pressure to open other things.  The trade thing has not worked quite as well for them as it has for us, so they might look to reopen that.  In relation to this deal and the package on the table, it is a take-it-or-leave-it option for the package as we find it.</p></speech>

There are many concerns but the biggest is around the investment court system.  Mr. O'Sullivan said in his article in <i>The Irish Times</i>that CETA &quot;is an important stepping-stone to a multilateral investment court&quot;.  Who pushed that?  Is it an EU concept?  In the context of CETA, was it being pushed by the EU, by Canada or was it an equal proposition?</p><p>Second, in the context of our court system, for which we as Members of the Oireachtas have a responsibility in terms of our day-to-day role and in terms of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, where will that court sit and where will our current system sit with that court?  Could a multilateral investment court undermine decisions taken by the courts here or <i>vice versa</i>?</p><p>Where in Mr. O'Sullivan's view does that sit?</p><p> Will setting up such a structure make it harder for Irish and EU citizens to access or to initiate actions than they currently can in the context of any agreement with Canada or any other agreement which will come under the remit of this new investment court system?</p></speech>

When the European Commission was faced with difficulties about the ISDS in the context of TTIP - the Deputy will remember that there was a huge amount of concern and anxiety about it - it launched a widespread consultation and reached the conclusion that the European Union should seek to replace the current system of <i>ad hoc</i>arbitration with a multilateral investment court.<br/><br/>At the same time, we were negotiating with Canada.  The Canadians were highly sympathetic to our concerns.  In fact, Canada is our greatest ally in trying to reform the system of ISDS.  As there was not yet a multilateral court, the best we could do with Canada was to agree a kind of bilateral version of a multilateral investment court.  That is basically what CETA does.  It is a kind of stepping stone.<br/><br/>My personal view, respectfully, is that it is important to demonstrate to the rest of the world, which we are trying to persuade to come on board for this multilateral investment court, that we can have a functioning model in CETA to show how such a system might work and be improved relative to <i>ad hoc</i>arbitration.<br/><br/>The investor-state dispute settlement system does not replace the national legal system.  It is always possible for companies, governments and civil society to go through the national system.  The difference is that under the arbitration system, basically both sides voluntarily accept that they will go down the road of trying to resolve these issues by arbitration rather than through the national courts.<br/><br/>I want to give just another little bit of context, if I may, so the committee gets this.  Why is this important to many member states which believe we need a system of investor protection?  Companies frequently investing substantial sums of money in countries with unstable governments or legal systems can encounter real problems such as having their property expropriated or having changed terms of the investment in ways which can be very damaging.  This is unfair and discriminatory.  If they try to use the national courts in the country concerned, they may well lose because the government in question is able to change the law or manage the system.  They wanted an independent system which could guarantee them certain rights to protect investments.  That is the background.  I fully agree with Deputy Howlin's suggestion that there is not much risk of that between Canada and the EU.  Canada wanted very much to reform the system, as we did.  We wanted to put into this agreement a working model of how one could have a better way of dealing with this issue than the traditional <i>ad hoc</i>tribunal.<br/><br/>Citizens' rights under national law are unchanged.  They would still be able to pursue their national rights.  While I have not read the latest text, as I understand it, it is foreseen in the multilateral investment court that civil society and other actors can be party to the proceedings, make their views known and have their concerns taken into account.  It is a fairly transparent and open process.</p></speech>

There seems to be a belief that we do not need to ratify this final part of the agreement and that we can somehow pause it indefinitely.  What are Mr. O'Sullivan's thoughts on that and whether that is an accurate summation?  Is it a bit misleading?</p> <p>  There is also a belief that somehow CETA can be amended.  Is that feasible, realistic and practical?  Mr. O'Sullivan in a way is doing down his own role and experience in this.  Going back ten years when this was thrashed out, where were the notable wins within CETA for the European Union?  One would not expect confrontations with Canada as it is a good country with which to have a trade agreement.  Within that discussion, this is important for other trade deals currently being negotiated or in the process of being ratified.  Where were the notable wins within the European Union for Ireland?  How hard were they to come by and what was the impact?</p> <p>  If we pause this process, reject it or send it back to the courts, what does it say for future trade deals?  What does it say to the Australian or the New Zealand Governments?  What does it say to Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, which seek trade deals and trade partnerships with the European Union, when a good and solid trade deal, which was hard fought, falls at the final hurdle?  Is it possible to get good next-generation trade deals going forward?</p> <p>  If Ireland were to somehow put the kibosh on this deal, what does that say about Ireland within the EU, considering the difficult period we have had with Brexit and the absolute European solidarity shown on that, as well as the far more difficult conversations that will be needed on other trade deals?  What about the strong concerns that the Irish Farmers Association and many others have about possible deals?  Where does that leave us?</p></speech>

The negotiations went on for a long time.  They started in 2009 and finished in 2014, which was five years.  By the way, there was a lot of backwards and forwards in the finalising of the text and many moments when it had to be revisited.  Bologna and the Italians, along with various other member states, had issues about cheeses and so forth.</p> <p>  Getting to the final text in 2016 required two years of further high-level interventions.  We may only want to look at one bit but others will want to look at other bits too.  Once the Pandora's box is opened by those wanting to look again at the structure and the content of this agreement, unfortunately, everything then unravels with no guarantee that it can be put back together again anytime soon.</p> <p>  On the question of pausing it indefinitely, the way the provisional application works is that it continues to function until a member state definitively announces that it is not in a position to ratify for whatever reason.  Within its own constitutional structures, a member state could say it is not going to do it because political circumstances have changed.  At that point, the text foresees that the Council is seized of the issue and has to discuss what to do.  We have never been in that situation and we do not know what would happen.</p> <p>  Can a decision be postponed forever?</p><p>It is true that at this point there are 12 member states, listed in my paper, which have not yet ratified but are in the process of ratifying.  I suppose there is no immediate sense of urgency until the last one has ratified.  However, that then raises the other point, which is on what basis would Ireland want to pause it.  What is the difficulty?  Why would Ireland not wish to go forward with this?  That comes to a certain issue of credibility in negotiation on the part of the European Union.  </p><p> I want to be very clear because I am conscious this is delicate.  I am not suggesting that national ratification means that the national parliaments have no voice; of course, they do.  Their assent is required, but it comes at the end of a very long and complicated process during which the content of the deal has been checked, double-checked, verified and agreed by member states, in the Council and by the Parliament.  If our negotiating partners go through all of that and then have to negotiate with 40 national parliaments, where it may be found they can also raise new issues or take a different view, it becomes an issue of credibility for a bloc such as the European Union which thrives on trade.  Trade is the lifeblood of our economy.  Overall, these deals are very good for us.  </p><p> The Deputy asked what the wins for Ireland and the EU were.  We got considerable market opening in Canada in a couple of areas it was sensitive about.  Apart from the market opening, the wins for Ireland were defensive.  We very successfully managed to stave off some of the very powerful demands from Canada for very substantial opening of some of our sensitive agricultural markets.  In fact, at the time of the conclusion of CETA, there was talk that this would be very damaging to Irish agriculture.  If one looks at the agriculture side, the take-up of the tariff rate quotas has been relatively low.  Ireland has benefited very well from this trade deal.</p><p> I hope that deals with the issues.  On the other member states, which was a point mentioned by the Deputy and raised in my op-ed, I am certainly not saying that Ireland does not have the right to tell other member states that it is not happy and it is not going to agree.  I question whether we have a credible case not to agree to this particular deal, which is generally very good for Ireland, since Ireland is a promoter of open global markets, free trade and encouraging foreign direct investment.  This looks to everyone like a deal very much tailor-made for the kind of policies Ireland pursues.  People will raise their eyebrows and ask why Ireland would have a problem with this deal.  That is my personal view.  This is, generally speaking, a rather positive package from an Irish perspective.  Most people would expect and hope that Ireland would feel comfortable giving its agreement to it in the end.</p></speech>

In a very insightful webinar on the topic of CETA last week, organised by Dr. Ois&iacute;n Suttle, it was raised that the basis for investment dispute settlement system came about after the Second World War.  There was a collective desire to establish an international legal order to create peaceful relations on a rule-based system which was ultimately introduced to defer future wars.</p> <p>  However, we have come a long way since the Second World War.  Our national laws are constantly changing and progressing to protect our citizens' fundamental rights, to reflect international human rights standards and bring about sound public policy.  The Judiciary plays a central role in protecting, defending and interpreting these laws.  Just last week the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 was passed.  This is a monumental Bill which will require the State to reduce emissions protecting our children's future for generations to come.  However, without our courts system to ensure that legally binding emission reductions are met, this Bill is meaningless.  </p> <p>  Some of this may have already been covered to an extent, but my first question relates to CETA and whether the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, will alienate the judicial power of our national courts.  Does Mr. O'Sullivan believe there is a risk of undermining public policy?  Furthermore, in the past, ratifying EU agreements was put to the people by means of a referendum, such as the Lisbon treaty.  Does Mr. O'Sullivan think there should be limits on the Government's ability to ratify international agreements using legislative power?  </p> <p>  The make up of this tribunal is another important question and concern.  Ultimately, it is those who sit at the decision-making table who have the power to decide the most critical issues.  If we have no control over the members of the tribunal, how do we ensure the decisions given are made in the best interests of public policy and our national laws? </p></speech>

I will try to do them justice.  On the question of alienating the national legal system, I sincerely think this is not a risk.  The national legal system remains and people's rights under it are unaffected.  CETA simply creates a system whereby it is possible to arbitrate disagreements in a different way if people want to do that.  It creates certain rights for investors and states.  There is very strong language in CETA on the right of states to regulate.  I cannot imagine, for one moment, that the legislation which the Government will bring forward on climate change, which is part of the wider European effort to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 and be emission neutral by 2050, would in any way be affected by these provisions.  Maybe a lawyer could imagine it.  I am not a lawyer but I really do not see how that could be the case.</p> <p>  On the issue of referendums and trade deals, it is of course, in the end, for each of our member states to decide, in accordance with their constitutions, how they want to manage these kinds of situations.  This includes decisions on when referendums are needed, when things are done at Government level, when are they done at the level of the houses of Parliament and so forth.  As a practitioner, I can honestly say that if I sit down with any significant trading partners, such as the United States, Canada, Vietnam or Australia, and have to say to them that there will be a referendum at the end of this, I do not think they would even want to have the conversation.  They would understand that it would be a very difficult, risky situation for them, because they have to deal with their domestic politics about these trade deals and what is in them.</p> <p>  We need a system which enables us, in a very transparent, public and open way, in the run-up to reaching the deal.  Under Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m, the EU Commissioner for Trade who preceded Phil Hogan, transparency was brought to a new level in that all the documents in a trade negotiation are now made freely available on the web.  There is wide opportunity for civil society and national parliaments to see what is going on and to be seized of the issue.  When a deal is finally arrived at, needs to be concluded and is decided at the level of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, it has been thoroughly analysed and the result is a truly democratic and accountable one.  That then should be the end of it.  If one has to go back and have further discussions in all of our member states, it will become a system which is simply unmanageable, relative to our trading partners.</p> <p>  On the issue of the tribunal, I confess I do not know the precise way in which the tribunals will be appointed.  The proposal is that they will be full-time, qualified, judicial appointees.  They will not be, as is frequently the case currently, a group of lawyers or people just selected by the parties.  There will be a system of transparent nomination.</p><p>Of course, this is in the investment court system, ICS, in CETA.  Although I cannot give an informed answer, I imagine the multilateral court also envisages some form of transparent appointment process whereby it would be known who these people were and, more important, that they would be full time on this job rather than part time as is currently the case with the <i>ad hoc</i>system.  Many of those guarantees are built into these new proposals.</p></speech>

I must agree with many of the previous speakers.  This comes down to the qualms and legitimate worries relating to the investment court system in particular.  I fear it is being left open for corporations to argue they have possible legitimate expectations of profits.  Obviously, as legislators, we want to introduce public good legislation.</p> <p>  The climate action Bill was mentioned here.  Had we already been signed up to the investment court system, ICS, would we have left ourselves exposed, leading to a chilling effect on us, as legislators?</p> <p>  Imagine we want to introduce a ban on the importation of fracked gas in the future.  A corporation may argue that on the basis of what Canada and the EU signed up to in the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA, or another agreement, the laws changed in this State had impacted on it and its ability to make a profit, even though we change the legislation in the best interest of our people.  I am worried about that.</p> <p>  The EU and other major countries and trading partners have recently come up with trade agreements in which they have disabled or decoupled the investor state dispute settlement, ISDS, part so as not to leave themselves exposed.  Why we would leave ourselves in this situation and what can we do from this point?  </p> <p>  I accept Mr. O'Sullivan has given certain answers but we could hold off on ratification which would not become an issue until everybody else has ratified.  I assume there would be a huge issue in going against ratification.  Mr. O'Sullivan has said opening a renegotiation would be difficult but anything would be feasible at the point in time in which Canada, or another country, became aware of major issues.</p> <p>  We signed up to this in 2016 but there has been movement away from the ICS part of the deal in particular in relation to other trade agreements.  I do not see why we would sign up to something that could leave us exposed to corporations that could make a determination on the basis of their legitimate expectation of profit against our right to legislate for the betterment of our people.</p></speech>

There were a few notorious cases such as the Philip Morris case in which it challenged Australia's packaging on tobacco.  The case was thrown out.  <br/><br/>If one considers the history of arbitration, governments have, by and large, defended their cases well provided they can show there is no discrimination or unfair treatment and, sometimes, there has been unfair treatment.  Although it is not fashionable, corporations also have rights to defend their interests if they have been unfairly treated.  The proposal of either the multilateral investment court or the investor court system which is in CETA does not pose a threat to the right of governments to regulate.  <br/><br/>There is very strong language in the CETA agreement and the chapter on investment which repeats the right of governments to legislate as they see fit in the best interest of public policy.  There are very strong statements to the effect that simply the fact that companies might make less money out of the revision of a system is not a sufficient basis for making claims.<br/><br/>Perhaps the Chair might want to come back to this with some legal experts.  What it is important, and Ireland needs to reflect on this, is that Canada is one of the greatest allies we have in the fight to put in place a more effective and transparent system of dealing with the issue of investor state dispute settlement.  What we have done with Canada in the CETA agreement is a working model of how one can make this better and address the concerns the Deputy just mentioned, namely, the right of governments to regulate and to pursue the public policies which they have been elected to do, without fear the companies will sue them left, right and centre because they may have lost money.<br/><br/>If one believes in a reform of the investor state dispute settlement system, including the multilateral investor court, one would want to see CETA approved and implemented because it takes one in that direction and in ways which enforce the right of governments to regulate in the best interests of their own people.  Canada has been a great ally of the European Union in this and we should not lose sight of that.</p></speech>

I disagree with some of the thoughts Mr. O'Sullivan has articulated so well in his paper.  I would love to hear his response.  Does he accept that allowing a foreign corporation to sue a sovereign state in a dispute heard outside the state's legal system can be challenging at the best of times, albeit not insurmountable?</p><p>Mr. O'Sullivan has stated in his paper the main motivation for the arbitration, and I accept it replaces <i>ad hoc</i>arbitration, is to prevent the risk of a hometown decision from a rogue state.</p><p>The main motivation, and it is in Mr. O'Sullivan's paper, is to prevent the risk of, for want of a better word, a home town decision from a rogue state and how damaging that would be.  There are countries in such dire straits where I accept that could happen.  Why have one size that fits all?  To some, it looks like an insult to a tried and tested judicial system which is beyond reproach, beyond fear or failure, and which has come through testing times in this jurisdiction and has always risen impeccably.  One might not like the decision but why must Ireland go into a one-size-fits-all approach when it is absolutely unnecessary because of the proven track record of the Judiciary in this country?  It is something we should all be proud of.  We will not go into the law and whether the Constitution can do it, but is Mr. O'Sullivan aware of the concerns of the association of European judges?  Is he aware of the concerns of the association of German judges?<br/><br/>Is it not enshrined in the improved arbitration, which is no longer <i>ad hoc</i>, that it is still binding, although there is an appellate jurisdiction, and that it is still, in a form, confidential?  Please correct me if not.  They are two fundamental principles of arbitration.  How does Ireland get its say if, for example, there was on the face of it an error in an arbitration, which occasionally happens?  Will Mr. O'Sullivan take on board that countries with good systems of utter judicial independence find this as an outrageous overreach if not an insult to the system which is so impartial?<br/><br/>Mr. O'Sullivan said it was difficult but not impossible to change.  Nothing is impossible and we could change that although it would be exceptionally challenging.  Will Mr. O'Sullivan elaborate on how to go about changing that one aspect of it?  Are we talking about months or years?  What exactly must happen in terms of diplomacy and negotiations?  I fully accept our Canadian trade is important and Mr. O'Sullivan has outlined that, but they are the angles I ask him kindly to respond to.  I appreciate his time this evening.</p></speech>

I am well aware of the controversy over this whole issue.  I lived through it during the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, negotiations.  I had many discussions with both sides of the argument.  I understand there are those who find the very idea of a special track for commercial litigation or disputes unacceptable.  I am afraid the practice of international investment has shown most people think it is necessary.  I think most governments would agree it is useful.  It is not a criticism and one should not take it as such.  Germany is one of the leading exponents of bilateral investment treaties.  It more or less invented the concept.  It is very proud of its judicial system.  It does not see any contradiction between the strength of its judicial system and the fact it accepts, in certain circumstances, this kind of arbitration is probably the best way to go because it gives that country's companies certain rights in jurisdictions where things may function less well.</p> <p>  I get the argument.  I do not have sympathy for it but I do have a certain understanding of it.  If one looks at the way the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, has worked and one looks at the cases, one will find very few cases where companies have succeeded in extracting compensation other than in situations where it is demonstrable they have not been fairly treated.  Governments have probably even accepted that they were not perfectly treated and it is just a question of how much the compensation would be.  I accept Ireland does not have any bilateral investment treaties so we have no tradition of this.  I honestly believe, however, a well crafted system of investor-state dispute for international investment can be a useful complement to even the most effective national judicial systems.  That is the question the Oireachtas is called upon to look at.  Many member states attach importance to this.  Many of our trading partners attach importance to this.  If we want to be, like the EU, in the business of concluding trade and investment agreements, we must have an answer to the concerns of our trading partners and other member states.</p> <p>  I want to be very clear.  I do not think I said "nothing was impossible" but maybe I did.  It would be extremely difficult to reopen the CETA package now.  At the end of the day, if a sovereign parliament or member state is forced to say it cannot conclude this package because of XYZ - in Ireland's case it may be because of the investment court system and somewhere else it may be because of trade concessions or whatever - of course that creates a problem and it has to be addressed.  The point I want to make is that when one has a package deal on the table, it is very difficult to limit the renegotiation to just one thing and to say, "I don't want to touch all the rest; I just have one thing I need touched."  I am sorry, but we have 26 other member states and Canada involved.  Basically, there are 27 other people who will say, "Well, that's interesting that you want to do that, but if we're going to talk about that, I've got four or five other things I want to talk about."  That is the way it happens.  I think it would be extremely difficult at this stage to reopen this negotiation because of this and because considerable efforts have gone into crafting the investment chapter in a way that moves in the direction of the critics of the older system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021033000002#G00500"><p>I thank Mr. O'Sullivan for being here.  It is good to see him again slightly in the flesh or as near as circumstances permit him to be in the flesh with us this evening.</p> <p>  It seems to me that the investment court system, ICS, issue is one on which it is possible to take a number of different stances.  I want to explore with Mr. O'Sullivan the following.  As I understand it, going back to our Maastricht treaty in 1992, we specifically amended our Constitution to allow us to become part of a binding jurisdiction for a European patent court.  At that time, it was thought we had to amend our Constitution to do that.  As late as 2012, 2013 or 2014, the then Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, told D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a referendum would be needed for a unified European patent on the same basis that here was something which was going to become binding on Ireland in these circumstances.  Underlying that issue was the whole concept of a sovereign state agreeing to be bound by the decision of a tribunal other than the Court of Justice of the European Union etc.  That is one issue.  There is a constitutional dimension to this.</p><p> From an entirely practical point of view, the terms of the TTIP negotiations, in which Mr. O'Sullivan himself was involved, with the agreement's controversial arbitration provisions, which caused considerable controversy, were justified at the time to a large extent, to use a quotation, "because of its potential global reach in setting an example for future partners and [other] agreements".  I see implicit in what Mr. O'Sullivan said earlier in reply to Deputy Howlin the same notion that this is a good example and something we want to have in all agreements.  However, as against that, and this is my worry, it seems to me no Irish investor in Canada has in the back of its or his or her corporate mind the notion the Canadian courts will not uphold its or his or her rights as an investor in Canada, and I know of nobody in Ireland who would say, "I do not have faith in the Canadian courts to uphold my rights."  Likewise, I have absolutely no reason to believe Canadian companies or corporations lack faith in the Irish courts to uphold their rights, such as they are.</p><p> One of the things that is strongest in mind is that we receive a huge amount of foreign direct investment, FDI, from the United States without such an arbitration system existing at present.  People have confidence in the jurisdiction of the Irish courts and its integrity.  Nobody in America says, "Sorry, I do not want to invest in Ireland because the sovereign government may confiscate my investment or act in a manner which is inimical to my investment and unlawful."  Therefore, I think we have, Britain certainly has and most of the European countries have, a huge comparative advantage internationally in that we are countries where it is safe to invest.  I do not see why we should cash in our chips, so to speak, to set an example in trade deals with the Third World countries or the developing world or the other blocs - South America, Mercosur or the like - and say, in effect, we have less confidence in our own courts or in the Canadian courts than we ought to have and the right way to deal with this is to superimpose either arbitration or an ICS as a confidence builder for investment.  I do not see that any Canadian should have any reasonable worries about coming to Ireland as an investor or that any Irish investor corporation should have any problems with Canada.</p><p> What I am really asking, bearing in mind there is a constitutional dimension to this and we are being asked to confer additional rights over those available in our courts and under our Constitution on investors in Ireland, is this: is this in our interest?  Is it in our interest, for instance, to be on a level playing pitch with Bulgaria as a place in which to invest?  That is just a simple question.  Is it in our national interest to say the jurisdiction to determine disputes in Ireland is the same as the jurisdiction to determine disputes with the Bulgarian Government?  Are we throwing away a comparative advantage?</p><p> Having said all that, and at some length, for which I am sorry, it strikes me the ICS jewel on top of this trade agreement is a bit redundant between the European Union and Canada, that the arguments against its inclusion are very strong, that nobody in Canada has any well-grounded apprehension about investing in this jurisdiction, and that nobody in Ireland has a well-grounded apprehension about investing in Canada.  What we are really doing with this agreement, therefore, is being driven by a WTO agenda to try to make this the international norm in order that it will be the way to determine disputes with other regions of the world where there would be an absence of such confidence.  Those are the points I wish to put to Mr. O'Sullivan.</p></speech>

I really do not want to express a view; I am not qualified to do so.  I will leave that to constitutional lawyers.<br/><br/>On the more general point, if it is true that one should just rely on national courts, why then do all our fellow members states have so many of these agreements?  Why have countries such as Germany, France and others, including the United Kingdom, which are very proud of their systems, opted to allow the existence of this parallel system in certain well-circumscribed and limited circumstances?  They have not seen any conflict between the older system of arbitration and their national judicial autonomy and sovereignty.<br/><br/>Senator McDowell says this is a WTO harmonisation agenda.  On the contrary, many people - certainly the United States and the Chinese, among others - do not like the idea of a multilateral court.  They want to keep the arbitration system because it is a more <i>ad hoc</i>, specific and limited system which they feel works quite well for them.  It is certainly not a question of making a judgment on the value of a country's legal system, and this is an important point.  It is to a certain extent exactly the opposite.  It is the fact one chooses to have a model as to how to manage these kinds of disputes when they may arise that is one-size-fits-all because one does not then have to make a judgment on the legal system of the country with which one is negotiating.  Imagine if, before we started a negotiation with a partner, we had to decide whether we trusted its judicial system sufficiently to have a parallel system of investor-state dispute settlement.  That would be a very tendentious and difficult discussion.  This is why even when a country such as Germany concludes bilateral investment treaties with countries with less robust legal systems, it is reciprocal.  They give to the investors from that country the same rights they will claim for their investors in the country concerned because they think this is sufficiently constrained and sufficiently limited as not to contaminate or to cause a major conflict with their solid legal systems.<br/><br/>I hear what the Senator says.  In Ireland's case, I admit that, not having any bilateral investment treaty or any experience of this, we are of course a good place in which to invest, and nobody has asked to have an investment agreement with us.  We do not have an investment agreement with the United States.  The fact is, however, most of our fellow member states do have bilateral investment agreements with nearly all the kinds of countries with which we have negotiated or will negotiate.  Since investment is now a Union competence under the treaty, we have to address the issue in some way, recognising that the <i>ad hoc</i>tribunal or arbitration system was perhaps less balanced and effective.  This is why the European Union is pioneering the idea of a multilateral court to put it on a more solid and more transparent footing, including with rights of other interested parties such as civil society and so forth to make their views known.  I perfectly accept the validity of the questions and the debate but I believe that if Ireland looks at this in the round as a member of the European Union that wants to engage with these kinds of trade and investment agreements with a multiplicity of partners across the world, we have every interest in rowing in behind a well-crafted and well-thought-out multilateral way of dealing with this rather than relying on the traditional arbitration.</p><p>CETA is a very important step in that direction.  That is why it is a positive movement in this whole area of investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, and not something which should be viewed with concern.</p></speech>

I do not see how the conclusion would be drawn by any investors that because Ireland would ratify CETA somehow we had less confidence in our domestic legal order and our judicial system.  I do not believe people would see it that way at all.  As I say, the current system of bilateral ISDS co-exists with the judicial systems of many countries whose judicial systems we would admire.  They do not see it as in any way conflictual or somehow undermining the credibility of their national judicial system.</p></speech>

We are starting our scrutiny of the trade agreement and he is our first speaker.  We appreciate him giving his time to put the agreement in context.  Following the conclusion of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement we are all becoming a little bit expert at trade agreements generally so we have that background as we start this process.</p><p>I hear very clearly what Mr. O'Sullivan is saying with regard to the investor court system in that if we were to delete that in some way it would involve a renegotiation of the agreement.  My view is that would signify the end of the agreement.</p><p>I also clearly hear what he is saying about the multilateral investor court, the bilateral investor court and the <i>ad hoc</i>arbitration process systems, namely, that they are parallel and separate from national legal systems.  This committee has to examine the constitutionality of the entire investor court system but, ultimately, that is probably a matter for the courts, not the Oireachtas.</p><p>My main question is coming at that from a different angle.  It relates to environmental health and worker rights' regulations.  There is no doubt that Ireland was dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century with regard to these issues as a result of the EU.  In Mr. O'Sullivan's experience and given his knowledge of these trade agreements, and I am not talking about Canada but other countries where these trade agreements have been concluded, have they improved standards in those countries where the standards needed to be improved?  I refer to standards relating to the environment, health, worker rights, level playing field issues and so on.  Is there any evidence to show that those standards have improved as a result of these trade deals where they needed to be improved?</p></speech>

What the European Union has tried to do in respect of environmental issues, and labour issues in particular, is to encourage the ratification and implementation of agreed international standards.  It has not sought to impose European standards on countries for whom state development deals might not be appropriate.  However, where there are international environmental conventions or international fishing conventions on illegal and irregular fishing, in terms of the conventions of the International Labour Organization, ILO, we have always included in our trade deals a commitment from our trading partners to ratify and implement those agreements, and we have held them to that.  I instanced in my first presentation or in answer to one of the questions where we recently initiated dispute settlement proceedings against South Korea for failure to ratify a number of ILO conventions to which it had committed.  The Deputy will have seen the controversy with China over the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment which, by the way, does not include an ISDS because people did not want to go down that road with China.  One of the controversial elements in that is a requirement on China to adopt or to make best efforts, according to the Chinese, ILO conventions, particularly on forced labour and prison labour.  I believe that Europe's commitment to those principles and international standards in trade deals has helped to increase their spread and to increase the standards in a number of our trading partner countries.</p></speech>

The United States is party to at least 50 such trade agreements but has only faced 13 ISDS cases and never lost a case.  Many of the criticisms levelled at these settlements are in the areas of maintaining states' regulatory capacity and ensuring transparency of the arbitration process.

The investor court system put in place a quasi-judicial system of a first instance and then an appellate body with permanent membership by qualified legal experts.  In response to an earlier question I had to admit that I do not know the precise mechanism that is proposed for their appointment.  It would be easy to check.  I would not want to mislead the committee but I would be surprised if it is not a fairly transparent system of both the Canadians and the Europeans putting forward names and then agreeing a final list in a fairly transparent way.  Honestly, I do not want to mislead the committee.  Either I can check it or somebody else can check it for the Senator.  It is an answerable question but I do not have the answer for her.</p></speech>

I have two sets of questions.  The first is on this question of renegotiation.  Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned that CETA was a test, and things do seem to have moved in a different direction since then.  When we talk about an example, he referred to the EU-China deal and the EU-UK deal.  All of those have maintained dispute mechanisms but only between the parties who have signed up to the treaty.  The South Korea example is dispute resolution between the actual signatories of the treaty but the EU-China deal and the EU-UK deal and, interestingly, to a large extent, the new US-Mexico-Canada deal have chosen not to give dispute resolution protections to investors.</p><p>They have reserved the dispute resolution mechanism solely for the parties that are actually signatories and signed up to all those other parts of the deal.  It strikes me that the tide seems to have moved in a different direction, as Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned at the beginning, and it is the case that investor dispute mechanisms are no longer being added into trade deals.<br/><br/>The US-Mexico-Canada agreement, USMCA, is an interesting example in respect of renegotiation.  The North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, took 13 years to negotiate and the renegotiation took two and half years.  It strikes me that as part of the changed landscape, the fact that the EU Council and the EU Commission have been empowered to negotiate since the Singapore agreement, means that renegotiation could proceed and could be explored during the period of ongoing provisional application that we have on the current deal.  It would seem to be reasonable to look at whether a better deal could be constructed while continuing with this.<br/><br/>In that regard, another area that is not just a matter of renegotiation but ongoing negotiation concerns the investor courts system itself.  The text and the operation of the investor court system is not finalised.  As I understand it, under CETA the joint committee can continue to review the practices in relation that.  In fact, in the European Court of Justice ruling from 2019, the European Court of Justice quoted that the Commission had stated that it was committed to &quot;further review, without delay, of the dispute settlement mechanism (ICS), and allowing sufficient time so that member states can consider that in their ratification processes&quot;.  That review has not been held yet, as I understand it.  The review was specifically around small and medium businesses and their equitable access.  It was specifically also around the costs associated with taking a case.  Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned that they are permanent, but of course there is a very high <i>per diem</i>cost attached to each day of the case.  We have details on that.<br/><br/>It strikes me that there is actually a negotiation ongoing in terms of how we improve the ICS structure as well as scope for renegotiation.  The core issue, which is the key thing for me, concerns regulation.  There is of course a right to regulate.  It can sometimes be a bit of a red herring.  However, looking at CETA itself, it is clear that states can regulate, but companies can also seek compensation.  That is made explicitly clear.  The section on regulation states that the mere fact of regulation does not amount to a breach, but in the section on the withdrawal of subsidies, it is explicitly stated that that party would not be required to compensate investors.  Therefore, in one section there is a protection against compensation in respect of subsidies, but there is not a protection against compensation claims in respect of regulation.  Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned that member states have taken cases, but the key point here is the chill effect.  That is the core of what will happen in terms of regulation.<br/><br/>Mr. O'Sullivan stated that he is not a lawyer, but I know that works as a senior counsellor with Steptoe &amp;amp; Johnson, which says on its website that bilateral and multilateral treaty investment protections &quot;may be a highly important tool for foreign investors and industry associations in advocating against legislative changes to renewable energy regulations.&quot;  It continues:</p><blockquote>	It may well be possible to use such protections as a tool to assist lobbying efforts to prevent wrongful regulatory change. </blockquote><p>I am speaking in the context of fair and equitable treatment, which Mr. O'Sullivan's own company describes as a &quot;very wide protection&quot;.  It explicitly states:</p><blockquote>	The fair and equitable treatment standard may be breached by a frequent occurrence of regulatory changes which undermine that stability and predictability of the business environment for investors. </blockquote><p>I am interested in a number of areas, including labour rights and the environment.  However, I am very concerned that companies may be seeking to determine what the fair and equitable treatment standard might be in the context of frequent regulation, which is certainly something we are going to see in certain areas.  In that regard, is it not the case that the chill effect is there?  Is there not a giving of an undue power in terms of a threat of potential litigation and compensation in respect of potential necessary citizen-demanded regulation?</p></speech>

On the chill effect, we are not operating in a vacuum.  The bilateral investment treaties have been there for many years.  The investor-state dispute settlement system has been in place for 30, 40 or 50 years.  I have never heard the argument, certainly not from Governments I have been dealing with, that they feel this is a constraint on their right to regulate.  I have never heard this-----</p></speech>

I can only say to the Senator that I have honestly never heard that from countries which are running these systems.  Senator Keogan asked about examples.  Many cases have been decided.  Governments have won many and lost some, and companies have lost many and won some.  Looking at it, the general trend is rather about equity and fair treatment and a legitimate sense that companies may have lost money unfairly.  However, these are judgments which are made, and companies do not win all the time at all.  It is not as if we are operating in a vacuum.  We have a history of a system which is there and which we would like to change in the way we have discussed.  Therefore, I personally do not see that risk.</p> <p>  On the Senator's statement that people are now getting rid of these things, the cases she has described are all very different.  To be very frank, nobody wanted to have an investor-state dispute settlement system with China, because everyone knows that if a company dared to go against the Chinese Government in any way, it would be punitively dealt with through other means.  This was not a system that people wanted to have with China.  The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement is not an investment agreement; it is only a trade and co-operation agreement and there is no investment chapter.  When we crafted the Korea agreement, we did not have competence for investment so there was no need to address the issue.  The issue of addressing this at European level has only arisen because investment was added as a competence in the Lisbon treaty and therefore certain aspects of bilateral investment treaties had to be taken over into EU level agreements.  One element in that was the investor-state dispute settlement.  That is how the EU found itself getting involved in this.  Beforehand, we did not need to worry about it.</p> <p>  In relation to the USMCA, or the agreement previously known as NAFTA, in fact, what happened, as I understand it, is that a dispute settlement system is maintained with Mexico.  There is still an ISDS system with Mexico.  It is true that the US and Canada omitted it from their agreement for a particular set of circumstances, which we can discuss on another occasion.  Therefore, the system is maintained.  It is also to be found in the comprehensive and progressive trans-Pacific partnership, of which Canada is a member.  Therefore, there are certain cases where people may decide to leave these things out.</p> <p>  The fact is, and now I come to the renegotiation point, that this is part of the CETA package.  The Senator is right that there are elements in it which are open to adjustment and refinement.  I do not think they change the fundamentals but they may provide additional answers.  However, the fundamental structure is built into the treaty.  If a state decides to change this, it is a renegotiation.  If both sides really agree that renegotiation only happens on a very limited part, perhaps that can happen.  However, a state runs the risk, in any situation where it reopens a package, that all sides involved can then come to the table with additional issues.  The scope for containing a new negotiation only to this area is, in my view, probably very limited.</p> <p>  It is clear that the investment court system in CETA is a stepping stone towards the multilateral investment court.  If the multilateral investment court ever sees the light of day and is established, there will probably be an exercise of retrofitting it to agreements which did not contain reference to it.</p><p>That would be a separate exercise, which would be the result of a new legal situation created by the establishment, finally, of this multilateral investment court on which, as I understand it and I am not an expert, the EU, Canada and other like-minded countries are making quite a bit of progress in the international negotiations but they are not there yet. </p></speech>

His answers have been very comprehensive and the information is really important.  Deputy Howlin will be followed by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and then I will take members in order.</p> <p>  Canada ratified CETA in May 2017 and six countries have yet to ratify the SPA, including Ireland.  Why has Canada not ratified the SPA?</p></speech>

I think it is a little bit along the lines of what I said earlier.  They are in the unusual situation where having done all of the negotiation and got the agreements they still have to wait for member states.  As I understand it, on the SPA, they have decided that they will wait until all member states have ratified before they will ratify themselves.</p></speech>

I will quote a line from a letter that was published in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which responded to his op-ed.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	ICS can take into account the investors' profit expectations arising from its interactions with a state or a statutory body.  In short, [the writer asserts] the right to regulate does not protect a state from potentially very expensive claims that might arise from non-regulatory actions taken to promote a public interest. </blockquote> <p>How does Mr. O'Sullivan respond to that?</p></speech>

One has to show whether there was legitimate expectation on the part of a company which led them to make, maybe and for example, heavy investments, which then they discovered would not lead to any outcome.  The mere loss of profit is not considered in and of itself a justification for triggering the mechanism but it is an element if a company feels that the way in which the regulation has worked, for example, if it is discriminatory or it was particularly targeted at the sector in a way that only one company would suffer from it then it might be a case of discrimination.  Therefore, it is a case-by-case decision.  I reiterate that in the history of these cases, governments have won the vast majority of cases.  It is not as though the evenly existing system of ISDS allows companies to ride roughshod over the rights of government to regulate and adjust the rules of industry, government and so forth on their own territory.</p></speech>

The French are considering leaving the energy treaty charter because of being hampered in what they can do about climate change as regards ISDS.  The Dutch Government is being sued in respect of climate action under this.  Senator Higgins has mentioned the fact that the US and Canada have negotiated their way out of many elements of ISDS under North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, so, therefore, we can see that there has been a move away.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned the Philip Morris case, which the company lost as it tried to delay plain packaging for tobacco but the case cost millions of Australian dollars and took approximately four years, which will have a chilling effect.  Does Mr. O'Sullivan accept that there seems to be a move away from ISDS and, to a degree, there is an element of madness in us signing up to ICS?  I do not see that there is going to be any major reputational damage to either the French or Dutch who are in no rush to ratify CETA.</p></speech>

There is a move towards a more structured and more judicial-like arrangement.  I absolutely accept that this is a live debate and one which is taking place as we speak.<br/><br/>For the Oireachtas, it is in the end the decision of Members as to whether they take more time to see whether things will evolve or whether they vote against or in favour of the package.  I would simply make the point that looking at this package in the round it has a huge amount to offer Ireland.  I do not believe, sincerely, that the ISDS, or investor-state provisions, pose a serious problem from an Irish perspective at least.</p></speech>

So there is a chill effect.  We know that the Morris case did not just have an impact on the Australian Government as it eventually won.  The case was used as an example of expensive litigation in a number of other countries to deter them from bringing in legislation in respect of smoking.  So the chill effect went beyond one country and was much wider.</p> <p>  Renegotiation may be difficult but is renegotiation pre-ratification easier before we have a 20-year sunset clause?  We know that if we fully ratify CETA there will be a 20-year exit clause in which it is set in stone.  Does Mr. O'Sullivan regard renegotiation pre-ratification easier than post-ratification?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.532" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021033000002#L00900"><p>I do not think renegotiation is easy under any circumstances.  It may be possible if down the road, when CETA has entered into force and ratified and there is a change in the international legal environment for how one deals with these issues, it may be perfectly possible to suggest that requires an adjustment of the current legal text.</p> <p>  The difficulty of addressing it now in the absence of clarity on that is that it becomes a rather open-ended renegotiation.  It is not with a specific objective in mind of adjusting the text to take account of a changed environment.  One is basically saying, We do not like this; we would like to replace it with something else."  We would have to then describe what that would be and we would need the 27 member states all to agree as to what that would be.  We would then have to talk to the Canadians.  I reiterate that once one starts a renegotiation of a chapter in a treaty it is not self-evident that one can limit that renegotiation only to the chapter that one or other member states does not like or has some difficulties with.  So that is the challenge I would see.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned earlier that, overall, he believes in the round that this is extremely positive for the EU, Ireland and Canada.  Can he quantify?  People often talk about the cost of Brexit per British citizen or the cost per Irish citizen.  Is it feasible to quantify the potential gain in the back pocket of the average Irish or European worker of this fully working and implemented trade agreement?</p></speech>

Models were done before the agreement was finalised.  The net result of the outcome has been hugely positive for the trade balance in both goods and services of the EU as a whole, and specifically for Ireland.  It is undeniable that there have been many economic advantages.  What that means on a macro level to all members of the population is obviously more limited.</p><p>It is clearly good for Irish companies, which are better able to export their goods and services to Canada and have been doing so on the back of this agreement.  That is clearly a net economic gain for this country.</p></speech>

Nobody is suggesting that there is a major investor confidence issue between Canada and the EU so is any real damage being done by a delay in its implementation?</p></speech>

Respectfully, there is a kind of general credibility issue here.  If the European Union and our member states have signed up to this after a lot of debate and discussion, and that is the case, it is a bit disappointing for our trade partners to then be told that nobody feels in a hurry to formally ratify it.  This is not something we want to see become a habit because it would become quite difficult to maintain credibility with our negotiating partners.  That is not to say that national parliaments cannot take the time they need to give proper scrutiny and give themselves the time for debate and discussion, but the notion that the national ratification creates a third round of negotiations, for which our partners have to be prepared, would be a dangerous thing to take root and I hope we do not go down that road.  Of course, at the end of the day all our national parliaments that are called upon to take this decision must do so while being fully responsible to their partners, their electorate and their national systems but we have to bear in mind that we do not operate in a vacuum and that we are dealing with trade partners who are looking at us very carefully to see how reliable a negotiating partner the European Union really is.</p></speech>

Does Mr. O'Sullivan think there will be any external deliberations?  Will the EU reach out to Cyprus to get it back on board?</p></speech>

My father served there often with the Irish Army and the UN and I spent time there.  It is a place for which I have enormous affection but I must admit I do not follow the internal politics in great detail.  It is up to each country in its own constitutional setting to decide whether it has definitively reached the conclusion that it cannot ratify an agreement.  A vote may be revisited or looked at again.  Until such time as the Government of Cyprus formally notifies its EU colleagues that the Republic of Cyprus is unable or unwilling to ratify, the situation remains unchanged.  The fact that there has been a vote does not necessarily constitute the final word of the country on that matter.  It is for each country to decide at what moment it is in a position to deliver its final verdict, positively or negatively, to the Council of Ministers.</p></speech>

I had not intended to speak at this stage of the meeting.  Could he repeat his comments again?  He mentioned that the EU's trade partners might see us as unreliable if our ratification process went on.  Presumably they too have a parliamentary ratification process.  Surely a ratification process should be seen at the beginning of any trade negotiation as part of the scrutiny of that negotiation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.546" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021033000002#M00900"><p>Absolutely, but I just wanted to explain that we are in a rather unique situation relative to others.  Canada has had its scrutiny and its parliamentary vote and it ratified the agreement in May 2017.  We are in the unusual situation that the trading partner must negotiate with the Commission, backed up by the member states, and there must then be a unanimous vote of the member states in the Council, where each government votes and presumably has also checked back with its parliament or parliamentary majority.  There has to be a vote in the European Parliament but then we say to the trading partner that we also have to go through national ratification, which involves 40 parliaments.  If that becomes a further round of negotiation it will, frankly, be very difficult to persuade people to engage with us because they may feel the process is just endless.  That is why it is very important that the political discussion and the democratic transparency of the process of negotiating these agreements happen at the moment we decide to sign and when the European Parliament decides to approve it.  If we then have to go back to all these parliaments at the national level and open the possibility that there might be a new negotiation or new issues raised, it becomes very difficult to manage.  No other trading partner in the world has a similar system.</p> <p>  Of course, all our trading partners that are democratic have their governments, parliaments and accountability but they do not have a further layer of lower national-level ratification with the potential to reopen certain issues which have been decided with great difficulty.  That is the issue.  I have full respect for national parliaments and for the system as it is now but that was one of the things that may have led the European Court of Justice to suggest there may be ways of minimising the number of trade deals, or the matter within them, that need to go for full national ratification.  That would be a better system, including for national parliaments because they could have their say at an earlier stage and would not find themselves constantly required to revisit the same territory in a further phase.</p></speech>

Upwards of nine committees want to participate in this particular topic.  That is an indication of how seriously we are taking our democratic duty.

I welcome the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, who is joining us today from a witness room in Kildare House.  I also welcome officials from the Department.  I thank the officials and the Minister for the briefing material we received prior to this meeting.</p> <p>  The proposed format of today's meeting is that we will hear opening remarks from the Minister for each matter referred, before opening it up to the floor for questions from members of the committee.  I wish to remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make that official in any way identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located within the Leinster House complex.  I call on the Minister to make his opening statement in respect of the motion referred to the committee relating to Ireland's participation in the EDA project on MARSUR networking.</p></speech>

Even a year after Covid-19 struck, it is not easy to have proper conversations on complex issues when one is not in the same room as others.  I will, obviously, try to answer people's questions as they arise and, hopefully, give the committee a detailed outline of the subjects on which I am asking for the committee members' support today.  The first of those issues is what is called MARSUR III.  The following motion has been placed on the Order Paper for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and was referred to this committee for consideration:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the European Defence Agency Project - Maritime Surveillance (MARSUR) Networking - Operational Support and Development (MARSUR III) pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. </blockquote> <p>In commending the motion to the select committee, I will briefly outline the function of the EDA and the background to the programme in which Ireland wishes to participate.  The EDA was established by a joint action of the Council of the European Union in 2004 to support the member states and the Council in their efforts to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, as it stands now and develops into the future.  </p><p>On 6 July 2004, the Government approved Ireland's participation in the framework of the EDA.  It is an agency of the European Union which is composed of defence ministers of the 26 participating states.  Denmark does not participate due to its opting out on CSDP issues.  Ireland participates in the framework of the agency and contributes to the annual cost of running the agency, including its annual work programme.  The agency is focused on assisting member states in capability development, in obtaining better value for existing member states, defence expenditure, improving competitiveness and securing greater efficiency, particularly in the area of research technology and procurement of defence capabilities.  The primary reason for Ireland's participation in the agency is to support the development of the Defence Forces' capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management operations.  The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 prescribes that participation in EDA projects or programmes is subject to Government and D&aacute;il approval.  Capability development projects with the EDA are classified either as category A projects, where all member states join unless they specifically opt out, or category B projects, where two or more member states come together to pursue a particular initiative.  Ireland has participated in a number of category A and category B projects over the years.  Four of those are now completed.  Those projects covered capabilities such as force protection, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear, protection, counter-improvised explosive devices and earlier maritime surveillance projects.</p><p>There are four current and ongoing EDA projects in which Ireland is participating.  These projects relate to cyber-defence training, satellite communications, counter-improvised explosive devices training and military search capacity building.  The proposal I am putting to the committee today is to seek approval for Ireland to participate in a follow-on to the EDA project on maritime surveillance, MARSUR, networking, that is, operational support and development under MARSUR III.  Ireland has participated in the MARSUR project since its inception.  MARSUR networking provides a secure information network among the European maritime operation centres to share maritime and naval information in a secure manner in the interests of European maritime security.  The technology used to communicate is known as the MARSUR exchange system, MEXS.  This system has been developed by the participating member states since the first MARSUR project.  The project aims to avoid duplication of effort and to use available technologies, data and information exchange to enhance co-operation and simple, efficient and low-cost solutions to enhance situational awareness in support of surveillance and security in the maritime domain.  The Naval Service has been participating in the MARSUR project since 2012.  This third iteration, MARSUR III, is a follow-on project, a continuation of the work done to date with the aim of further enhancement and improvement in terms of maritime surveillance.  Previous iterations of this project have received Government and D&aacute;il approval.  This third iteration remains true to the objectives of the previous projects, with its aim to further develop a capability that fulfils the need of maritime surveillance, information sharing and networking.</p><p>The EDA MARSUR projects strengthen the recognised maritime picture.  In simple terms, a recognised maritime picture is an image or map that shows all vessels and activities that are present in a particular maritime area.  It links to national and international data and information on vessels, the maritime environment, infrastructure, etc., that has been compiled from various monitoring and surveillance systems.  Enhanced exchange of information plays an important part in protecting maritime trade, the maritime environment, natural resources and in countering illicit activity in the maritime domain.  The MARSUR projects have assisted member states, including Ireland, in enhancing situational awareness so as to combat drug trafficking, people smuggling and other illicit activities.  MARSUR III is a follow-on project and will look to improve and upgrade the current technology to support the exchange of classified information, provide support to EU maritime operational engagements and CSDP missions and operations, and develop new functionalities such as artificial intelligence and big data processing.</p><p> MARSUR III will last for six years, with the possibility of extending it for a further two years.  In that regard, I am seeking approval for Ireland's participation in the project for the life of the project, including any extension that might arise.  The cost of participation is &euro;50,000 per year for the life of the project.</p><p> There are 15 other EU member states preparing to join the MARSUR III project, including Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden - in other words, virtually every country that has a coastline and maritime interest.  This level of engagement is indicative of the project's value and importance in terms of maritime surveillance and security.</p><p> Participation in this project will further enhance the capability of our Defence Forces to undertake the roles assigned to them by Government at home and overseas.  As the State's principal seagoing agency, the Naval Service provides unique seagoing capability.  It is tasked with providing a fisheries protection service and general maritime patrolling, and is ready to respond to, for example, an aid to civil power request, a pollution incident or a search and rescue or recovery mission, which is exactly what happened over the weekend when a fishing vessel was caught in a particularly difficult storm off the south coast.  While everybody was brought home safely, the fishing vessel, unfortunately, sank because it lost power and the ability to turn on its edges.</p><p> Having access to national and international data on maritime surveillance through the EDA MARSUR projects is essential for the Naval Service to continue to provide this important role.  It is a system that has been used on overseas missions and at home.  It was used by the Naval Service when it was engaged in Operation Sophia, the EU security mission in the Mediterranean, and in a national context it supports Naval Service security and defence operations within Ireland's exclusive economic zone.</p><p> The EDA maritime surveillance project is one of the longest-running projects in the EDA and is an excellent example of member states working together to develop effective technological solutions in support of common interests and endeavours.  I commend the motion to the select committee.</p><p> When some people looking from afar hear about the EDA they think about threats of European armies and so on.  It is nothing of the sort.  This is an opt-in mechanism on a project-by-project basis to work with other countries to improve capacity, learn lessons and build interoperability.  The project we are looking to be part of for the next six years today is built on the work that has already happened regarding improving maritime surveillance and capacity in our waters and other EU waters.  I strongly recommend we support it and let it get on with building on the work that has already been done.</p><p> I do not know whether the Chair wants me to deal with the motion first before going into the other elements of the committee.  It involves all of our overseas missions.  There may be very different questions on that.  I am in the hands of the Chair.</p></speech>

My first question relates to MARSUR III and our contribution.  Will we be able to offset some of the challenges presented over the past year by some states interfering with data cables and undersea fibre-optic cables between Europe and the US?  Will MARSUR III be able to be a bulwark against that?</p> <p>  Are we in a position to be able to recruit into or enhance our Naval Service?  It is currently doing an incredible job but it is significantly understaffed.  Is it intended to recruit, upskill and train new staff?  At current staffing levels we will struggle.</p> <p>  When this matter was raised in 2019, there were questions about how it interfered with our neutrality and sovereignty.  Have those concerns been proven to be unfounded over the past two years?  What would the Minister suggest to those who have made those comments?</p></speech>

The Minister briefly touched on the concerns around a European army.  I would be interested in hearing more from him regarding that.  There is a real danger, in particular given the departure of Britain from the EU, that the discourse on an EU army will be reignited once again.</p> <p>  Ireland had the option of opting out of the EDA.  It seeks to develop the military capacity of European states to allow said states to function as a body in the furtherance of EU aims.  We are still a neutral country.  This further dependency on the EDA calls that into question in a serious way.  A previous Minister explained Denmark was constitutionally prevented from participating in the EDA following its original rejection of the Maastricht treaty.  How does it function in the area of naval surveillance in the absence of its membership of the EDA and, consequently, MARSUR?</p> <p>  I would like to put a couple of other questions to the Minister.  I have a broad question on the EDA.  How much does Ireland contribute to it annually?  What other projects are involved?  The Minister outlined a number of projects we are involved in and are operating.  Has Ireland opted out of any programmes to date?  I ask the Minister to elaborate on that a little bit further.</p> <p>  Does MARSUR permit access by military vessels from other countries involved in the EDA to Irish waters?  To what degree is that permitted?</p> <p>  Deputy Gannon alluded to a major concern that I share, namely, the capacity of the Irish Navy.  We know a number of our vessels are still tied up and there are major issues in terms of the recruitment and retention of naval personnel.  How does all of that fit into the dependency on the EDA and the MARSUR programme?  It is a major concern.</p> <p>  A major concern I have is that we would be so interlinked with the EDA, it will become virtually impossible not to say "Yes" to an EU army.</p><p>I fundamentally believe it is a long-term aspiration of the EU to develop an EU army.  When we are so tied in and dependent in terms of all of our training, surveillance and all of that, it will become impossible further down the road to say "No" to that.  Those are some specific questions on that issue.</p><p> On a broader issue, I take this opportunity to ask the Minister, as this is his first time to appear before the committee since the appointment of Deputy Jack Chambers as the Minister of State with responsibility for defence, which surprised many people, myself included, as it was one that went below the radar, what is the Minister of State's specific role with regard to defence?  What responsibilities does he have?  It has been said he has no responsibilities whatsoever.  On the other hand, I note he has met representative organisations of the Defence Forces and been briefed by a number of those organisations.  Will the Minister outline who has responsibility for defence and what responsibilities the Minister of State has?</p></speech>

Having regard to the number of questions, I propose to go back to the Minister and then I will revert to Deputies Berry and Clarke.  I note the questions from Deputies Gannon and Brady.  Some of Deputy Brady&rsquo;s questions might have strayed somewhat from the motion, but I am keen this committee avails of every opportunity.  I ask the Minister to be particularly brief in his responses to questions that may not be directly related to the motion.  I do not wish to rule them out in the interests of the smooth running of the meeting.  I thank the Minister again for his attendance.  We will deal with these questions now and then come back to Deputies Berry and Clarke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.564" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021033000002#C00300"><p>I will deal with Deputy Gannon's questions first.  I am not sure this will make a huge impact with respect to underwater fibre cables but I can come back to the Deputy on the technicalities of that.  My understanding is that MARSUR III is more about surveillance on the surface of the water, primarily, and the sharing of information in a way that is confidential and secure.  That is important in the context of maritime security.  Ireland has ten times as much sea surface as land surface.  We have a significant responsibility in the north-west Atlantic in terms of maritime security.  In terms of co-operating with our neighbours and other EU countries in sharing data in a way that is secure and safe, we could say "No".  I would make this point to Deputy Brady.  No one is forcing us to do anything here.  We do not have to be part of any of these projects if we do not want to be.  We have chosen to be part of these projects because we think it is Ireland&rsquo;s interest and enhances the capability of our Defence Forces, not undermines their independence as seems to be suggested.   If the Deputy were to ask those in the Defence Forces whether they want to be part of these projects, he would get his answer.  They want to be interoperable with other defence forces in case they need to work with them, whether it be on a security, rescue or maritime catastrophe issue - for example, if there was an oil tanker spillage or something like that.  We want to make sure, just like when our Defence Forces are on peacekeeping missions overseas, we have interoperability with the other nations with which we work.  We are in UNIFIL with Polish forces at the moment.  As we train together and understand each other, we are interoperable in a very efficient way that keeps our personnel as safe as they can be.</p> <p>  The idea that neutrality means we do not talk to anybody else, do not do anything in partnership with anybody else, keep to ourselves, keep our head down and do not spend any money on the military and military capacity, to my mind is complete nonsense.  Being militarily neutral means we decide what we are and are not part of and what does and does not suit Ireland and our interests and defence priorities.  That is what being non-aligned means.  The European Defence Agency, EDA, only works for many of the other countries in the EU that are also non-aligned militarily and are also neutral because it allows countries to opt in or opt out as the case may be, whether it be category A or category B projects.  </p> <p>  On this particular project on which I am asking members for their support, Sweden is a country that also considers itself to be neutral - and it is very much a part of this as well - as does Malta, but because they are maritime countries they want to make sure there is interoperability and proper sharing of information.  Ireland, like other EU neutral counties that are not members of NATO, decides to work with other countries when it makes sense to do so.  The projects in which we are involved, linked to the EDA, have all been ones that significantly enhance our capability from a military perspective, be it around cybersecurity, from which we need to learn and share experience with other countries.  If our view was that we could not talk to any other EU countries because that would compromise our independence, we would be in a pretty sorry state in terms of our capacity and state of readiness for many threats, some of which are real and some of which are perceived.  </p> <p>  The programme for Government and the White Paper on Defence are very clear on this.  We are not changing our position in the context of Irish neutrality but we are being proactive in what we choose to be part of.  These EDA projects we are part of certainly make a lot of sense to me in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s capacity building within our Defence Forces.  </p> <p>  Both Deputies have raised very fair questions on the Naval Service with respect to strength, staffing and resource issues.  We know about that.  We are trying to fix it.  We have introduced sea-going and financial incentives for people in the Naval Service.  We will continue to work with the Naval Service on a recruitment and retention strategy until we get it right.  We will also continue to invest in the Naval Service until we can be sure we have sufficient numbers that we need.  We have a target strength where we know we need to be at.  We are not close to that at the moment.  I believe that, given time to address this, we will get back there.  We have recruitment and retention issues across the Defence Forces more generally and that is a big focus of the new Commission on the Defence Forces, which is doing good work.  I am really happy with how it is progressing.  It will report before the end of the year.  I can assure the Deputies that I am more than aware of the challenges, but the idea that we would respond to recruitment and retention challenges in the Naval Service by opting out of increasing our capacity, both nationally and internationally, and by learning from best practice and by opting into shared data gathering and so on, in many ways would be downgrading the role of our Defence Forces and our Naval Service, not improving their capacity, which certainly will help to attract more people into the Naval Service as they see it as an exciting and rewarding career.  </p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Brady&rsquo;s questions on a European army and so on, that has nothing to do this motion.  I do not see any path towards the creation of a European army.  I see interoperability, co-operation and opt-in or opt-out options for countries.  As it happens, Denmark is a NATO country and it co-ordinates its military co-operation and research through NATO structures rather than through the EDA.  That is a matter for it.  We are not a member of NATO.  We work with NATO on certain things and again we choose when and on what we do that.  That is what a neutral state can do.  That is how the EDA works for us as well.</p><p>I reassure the committee that this adds to rather than compromises our independence as a country.  It allows us as an independent state to get the benefit of co-operation without being tied into a military alliance.  That is the beauty of it.  Other countries rely on NATO and its structures for that kind of interoperability, but we do not.  The way in which the EDA works allows countries that are not NATO members to benefit from shared information and shared projects of interest on an opt-in or opt-out basis depending on the project.</p><p> The Deputy asked how much we spent on this.  I will provide the figures.  The maritime surveillance, MARSUR, project costs us &euro;50,000 per year.  Our overall contribution to the EDA in 2015, including projects, was &euro;397,000.  In 2016, it was &euro;221,000.  In 2017, it was &euro;547,000.  In 2018, it was &euro;578,000.  In the year up to 2020, it was &euro;689,000.  It is in and around &euro;500,000 per year.  Given the projects I outlined that we have been and continue to be part of, this represents much better value for money than trying to build the same capacity on our own because we believed doing so enhanced our neutrality somehow.  We would be left behind and, unfortunately, the Defence Forces would be left exposed by not having the benefit of these projects and the know-how developed through them.</p><p> According to a note I have, there is no provision in the EU treaties for the establishment of a European army.  That is true, but there is also no political intent to move in that direction.  That is certainly the case from an Irish perspective.</p><p> On the matter of the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, under the Defence Acts, I as Minister can call the Council of Defence or the Council of State to advise me on a defence issue.  For that to happen, there is a requirement in the legislation for a Minister of State in the Department of Defence to be part of the Council of Defence structure.  The Government felt it was consistent with existing legislation to have a Minister of State in the Department of Defence.  That is what the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, has been asked to do.  He does not have any formal assigned role to go with that, but if he is going to be part of the defence structure, he has to be briefed and up to speed because he is someone whose counsel I will seek in terms of political decisions we have to make around defence.  That is why he has been briefing himself, meeting representative bodies and so on, as he should.  He is working with me and does not have an assigned role that a Minister of State would normally have for a specific policy area, but he is certainly involved.  I have had a number of meetings with him on broader defence thinking and policy development within the Government.  That will be useful, particularly when the Commission on the Defence Forces reports.  I hope he and I will be able to bring those recommendations to the Government and ensure they are acted upon.  That is the position.  There is no mystery around it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.567" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1587" speakername="Cathal Berry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021033000002#D00300"><p>I wish the Minister and his team a good afternoon and I thank him for his opening statement.  Getting it in advance yesterday was helpful.</p> <p>  The Naval Service is more important now than at any time in Ireland's history since the Second World War.  It is essential.  Due to Brexit, we now have a third country with a large sea border on our doorstep.  The land bridge to the Continent has effectively been compromised, leaving us much more reliant on our sea lanes of communication.  All of the Deputies at this meeting are familiar with the drugs issue in every town and village throughout the country.  Anything that enhances our anti-smuggling operation is something we should embrace.</p> <p>  If the Naval Service is so important, then MARSUR III is also important.  It is essentially just a secure communications network, both device and data.  This is the same principle as the Garda liaising with Europol or Interpol.  The Garda's sovereignty is not being compromised by interacting with either, and neither would the Naval Service's by interacting with like-minded countries around Europe.  My main concern in respect of MARSUR has to do with whether Ireland, from a manning experience, will be able to play a full role.  Naval ships are MARSUR's eyes and ears.  Unfortunately, our eyes and ears are tied up in Haulbowline at the moment and unable to put to sea.</p> <p>  We always try to find solutions.  While I accept the Minister has been working very hard on recruitment and retention, I have a couple of suggestions that might help.  The Minister appreciates there are imperfections in the seagoing service commitment scheme.  A person must have three years of service in the Naval Service before being eligible to apply for the scheme.  I would be grateful for the Minister's thoughts on extending the scheme to everyone.  As with any job, we try to get people who join the Naval Service to commit to the organisation during their first three years.  Denying them access to the scheme makes them question that commitment.  Have they made the right decision?  They are 20 or 21 years of age and have the world in front of them.  If they are embraced as full members of the Naval Service from the get-go, I suspect it would help with retention.</p> <p>  I would be grateful for the Minister's views on another suggestion.  The tax credit that is provided to the Naval Service's sailors is useful and has taken the sting out of the lack of pay.  I appreciate it was increased in the previous budget by &euro;230 to &euro;1,500 per year.  However, the seafarer's tax credit for private sector sailors &ndash; those who are working with shipping companies or on trawlers &ndash; is &euro;6,350.  That is more than four times as much as the tax credit for Naval Service personnel.  Could we devise a pathway to pegging the Naval Service tax credit to the seafarers' allowance?  It would have a significant and almost overnight effect in the navy and get people to stay longer.</p> <p>  My next point has to do with the independent pay review body that is scheduled to be stood up next year.  We all appreciate that the Commission on the Defence Forces will make its interim report in December, but when will the independent pay review body be established?  Will it be in January 2022 or later?  If the Minister signalled it would be established as soon as possible, it would help retention by giving people hope.</p> <p>  To summarise, what are the Minister's views on extending the seagoing service commitment scheme to people with less than three years' service, will the Naval Service tax credit be pegged to the seafarers' allowance, which is four times larger, and will he signal when he believes the independent pay review body will be established next year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.568" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1583" speakername="James Lawless" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021033000002#D00400"><p>I thank the Minister for his opening remarks and engagement.  I broadly support the collaboration as proposed, but I will drill into the details of a couple of gaps we may have in an attempt to understand whether our participation will bridge them.</p><p>Deputy Gannon raised an interesting point on undersea cables and surveillance.  There was a significant incident about 12 months ago in which aircraft circled what is called spaghetti junction off the south-west coast.  It was suggested this was an intercept operation, certainly a mapping of some sort, to try to trace those cables, albeit from the air.  It was very apparent the target was undersea cables.  Part of our offering for locating foreign direct investment and the headquarters of multinationals' EU operations in Ireland, primarily in Dublin, has been the security and integrity of the data sets they keep and the data transfers to the US.  There are data protection and other issues around that which I will not get into today.  Can we stand over physical security not being compromised?  Does this project enhance that?  I hope and expect that it would, but the Minister might comment on that.  Are any other measures being taken to secure those assets and transfers and to have maritime surveillance on the undersea cables that would be of significant interest?<br/><br/>The next point is on protection of assets of a different sort, such as natural resources.  There is some degree of fossil fuel exploration off the west coast at the moment.  We are, thankfully, moving on from that to a more wind based and renewable energy based space.  I anticipate, and hope, that in the next number of years we will see development of significant offshore wind energy.  To what extent, if any, will the likes of this project help to secure and monitor those assets from harm, whether hostile, just weather events or other factors coming across the horizon?  Is it envisaged that our energy security will be enhanced as part of this, through those kind of offshore energy assets?<br/><br/>My third point is slightly different and goes back to Brexit issues.  We have had some at-sea skirmishes, as it were.  We had the Rockall incident with Scottish or Irish ships, perhaps a bit of both, being turned back.  The <i>voisinage </i>dispute is now resolved, but the issues were there at the same time.  Where our territorial seas end and the UK seas begin is now a European border as well.  To what extent will that feature in this programme?  Will it assist with these types of issues and engagements when they arise?  </p></speech>

As part of the Common Security and Defence Policy, does MARSUR oblige the State to align our foreign or defence policies to those of other member states?  If it does, is there a presumption that Irish interests and the interests of other member states will always align?  The Minister spoke of spending money on our military and opting into projects.  Is there, whether intentionally or unintentionally, a possibility of this <i>quid pro quo</i>of software for naval operations, creating a situation where the Government becomes over-reliant on this provision of software and hardware, thereby resulting in us not being able to withdraw at a future date?</p><p>The Minister also mentioned cybersecurity, which does not fall under the Department of Defence remit.  We have spoken about this before and the Minister acknowledged his issues and concerns about that fact.  How does the cybersecurity of MARSUR meet with the needs or asks of the Department of Defence?</p><p>I too would like to know the future impact of Irish participation given the retention and the recruitment crisis in the Defence Forces, particularly in the Naval Service. MARSUR ensures more funding from EU budgets for the arms industry, for obvious reasons, but it also includes technology.  Technology has been developed by private companies with EU funds which has then been exported outside the EU to countries that would not, in any way, be aligned with our position on foreign affairs, humanitarian work and peacekeeping.  In fact, these countries have a long and shameful track record of human rights abuses.  How will the Minister address those concerns in asking Ireland to agree to this while knowing the potential is there for other countries, which have this shameful track record, benefitting from it?</p></speech>

I am also interested in the area of cyber defence.  I note we are participating in cyber defence training, which is hugely important because there is so much happening in that space at the moment.  My question may be related to what Deputy Clarke talked about.  On cyber defence, I ask the Minister how many personnel are involved, what is their level of expertise, do we have the equipment they require and what is the interaction with other member states?  The Defence Forces have a huge and important role to play in this area.</p> <p>  I also note there is training involved in satellite communications.  The Minister might tell us a little more about that.  What is our role there? </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.573" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021033000002#E00500"><p>I will answer Deputy Berry's questions first.  I agree with his comment on the importance of the Naval Service.  I live next door to a Naval Service base; Deputy Stanton lives pretty close to it.  In normal times, I cycle down to the Naval Service base most weekends and sometimes run along there as well.  I know it very well and I know many people working there.  As Minister, I am more than conscious of the need to rebuild momentum in recruitment and investment in the Naval Service.  We have invested very heavily in capital investment in the Naval Service in upgrading our fleets and so on, and we will do much more.</p> <p>  We are also committed to investing significantly on Haulbowline Island.  Today, the Government made a decision to transfer the ownership of Haulbowline Island from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  When I was in that Department, I essentially took ownership of half the island in an effort to take responsibility for what was called the east tip, which is now a maritime park.  At the time, it was essentially a slag heap in the middle of Cork Harbour.  We will continue to invest in that island in improving the work atmosphere there.  We will invest in accommodation facilities as well, in what is called block eight.  We will invest in new capital equipment, including ships, in the years ahead. </p> <p> The Naval Service has a strong future.  I understand the frustrations but I also push back strongly on some of the commentary on the Naval Service, stating that it is on a downward trajectory and there is no hope for the future because it is not prioritised and so on.  None of that is true.  It is being prioritised.  We have, like many countries in the world, a real challenge at the moment in recruitment and retention within the Defence Forces.  Many countries have that.  Since the Defence Forces are much smaller than those in many other countries, when we have significant numbers of talented people with specific skill sets in the Naval Service headhunted by the private sector because they are really good, we have a problem.  We have to respond to that.  We are doing so with tax credits and the service at sea scheme, which will, hopefully, be worth more than &euro;10,000 over two years for people who are eligible for it.  </p> <p> We speak to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform all the time about the terms and conditions of that scheme, but it is not straightforward.  Last summer, we wanted a simple and significant increase to the patrol duty allowance.  It was not possible to achieve that because it would have been seen as a pretty straightforward pay increase. We could not do that in the context of public sector pay negotiations.  Let us be honest about that.  We had to design a scheme that did not undermine public sector pay policy and, at the same time, recognise the unique service in the Naval Service and the commitment that is necessary to go to sea.</p><p>Therefore, we designed the scheme that does not apply to everybody but applies to many people going to sea.  If it applied to everybody, it would be considered by many outside the Defence Forces as a simple pay increase.  </p><p> Let us consider what we are doing on pay across the Defence Forces.  There is a 10% increase in the military service allowance to a restoration of pre-Haddington Road agreement levels and of certain allowances specific to the Defence Forces, including security duty allowance and patrol duty allowance.  The patrol duty allowance for 120 days per year is worth more than &euro;7,000 per year.  There is also the tax credit of &euro;1,500.  On top of that there is up to &euro;5,000 per year for seagoing.  </p><p> There are many financial benefits to being in the Defence Forces as well as job security, a real sense of adventure and working for the State.  Clearly, we need to do more because the overall package is not strong enough to retain people.  Many people are joining the Defence Forces and we have a pretty tough system of qualification and training to get in because the standards are high, as they should be in the Defence Forces.  I assure the Deputy that we will keep working on getting that balance right to get the numbers up to where they need to be.  Of course, we also need to get the equipment.  </p><p> Deputy Stanton had three questions.  There are ongoing conversations on the qualification criteria to try to get more people in.  Regarding tax credits, working within the Naval Service is different from a broader seafarers' tax credit, but I take the point.  This was a tax credit that was agreed and increased by the Minister for Finance in advance of last year's budget.  We will see if we can maintain that progression when it comes to the next budget.  </p><p> The programme for Government makes a commitment to having an independent review body.  Not everybody in the Defence Forces supports this by the way.  PDFORRA does not support that approach and instead it wants to be affiliated to ICTU for the purposes of pay negotiations.  Whatever path we take here, we need to ensure it works for the Defence Forces so that people feel they are valued and paid appropriately.  The programme for Government has committed to setting up a pay review body quickly after the commission on the future of the Defence Forces makes recommendations.  Of course, as part of its terms of reference, it is also allowed to make recommendations on pay structures.  The issue of pay and pay structures within the Defence Forces will continue to be prioritised by Government either through the commission and its work or the subsequent pay review body.  I have not entirely ruled out the PDFORRA request to build a connection with ICTU.  We will look at that.  I believe there are problems with it, but I do not have a closed mind to any of these issues.  I have a political responsibility for everybody in the Defence Forces and we will keep an open mind on all these discussions.</p><p> Deputy Lawless asked about the undersea cables.  I will read out a note I have because several members, including Deputy Stanton, have asked about it.  The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications is currently undertaking an information gathering and consultation process with relevant stakeholders to inform policy development and decision-making in the area of international connectivity for telecommunications.  As part of this process, a public consultation was undertaken late last year.  The public consultation document highlights that international connectivity for telecommunications relies on submarine cables using fibre optic technology.</p><p> Ireland is connected to North America and to the UK by a number of submarine cables.  There are currently no submarine cable routes from Ireland directly to continental Europe without traversing the UK, which is seen as an area for potential development.  The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications outlined that resilience is built into the system to mitigate any damage to submarine cables.  A high capacity and multiple routes provide resilience in the event of a route failure.  Where damage has occurred to a cable, in the past the operators have shared a cable while repairs were under way.  The current review of international connectivity for telecommunications will further inform this area.  </p><p> The Defence Forces are aware of active sub-sea fibre optic cables landing on the island of Ireland.  While these may present strategic locations for marine counterterrorism, the locations and security of these telecommunications resources do not rest with the Defence Forces.</p><p> Deputy Lawless asked about energy security.  As with the challenges of Brexit from a fisheries perspective and from the perspective of maritime management in general, which is becoming much more complex now with Brexit, I believe that energy security offshore will become an increasingly important issue.  We will facilitate the spending, primarily by the private sector, of billions of euro on building offshore energy apparatus, both fixed and floating, in the Celtic Sea, the Irish Sea and along the west coast.  Those will be State assets that will need to be protected and I believe the Naval Service will play an increasingly important role in that regard in the future.  I am trying to have diplomatic solutions rather than military ones when it comes to Rockall.  I continue to work on that with colleagues in Scotland.  </p><p> Deputy Clarke asked about cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity is a Defence Forces responsibility, but ours is not the only Department.  No single Department looks after cybersecurity.  The lead Department is the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, which is responsible for Ireland's cybersecurity centre.  The formal Defence Forces personnel are very much part of that centre.  Defence Forces personnel are on secondment to Europe's cybersecurity centre in Tallinn, Estonia.  We need to ensure that the Defence Forces protect defence infrastructure from a cybersecurity threat that is very real.  The Defence Forces will continue to contribute to the overall debate.</p><p> As Minister for Defence, I chair the joint task force that measures threats to Ireland and puts together the response capacity to those threats.  Cybersecurity is in the top two or three priorities.  The Department is very much part of the cybersecurity strategy in Ireland, but, of course, other Departments are also involved, including the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Environment, Climate and Communications; the Taoiseach; and Justice.</p><p> Does MARSUR III require Ireland to align our foreign and security policy?  No, it does not.  We have decided to work in tandem with many other countries because it is in Ireland's interest to do so, but it is also in their interests to take a European approach to maritime security.  Just as we do with the Garda when it shares information and builds networks through Interpol or other networks, the EU is stronger than the sum of its parts by agreeing to work together in different areas that are strategic and benefit everybody.  It does not undermine our neutrality or our independence of thought from a foreign policy perspective.</p><p>If there is one thing I know about the maritime domain, it is that it does not respect borders.  If somebody wants to bring drugs into Ireland, when they are travelling through other countries' waters it is the sharing of information that allows the Naval Service to be as effective as it is, for example, in intercepting drug trafficking.  The Naval Service is very effective at that but, without intelligence and the sharing of information, it is like finding a needle in a haystack.  That is the practical reality.</p><p> As for whether we are becoming over reliant on the European Defence Agency, I do not think so, but we use it to the maximum effect we can.  That is what we should be doing.  We should be sweating this opportunity as much as we can to get as much out of it as we can to improve our own capabilities and capacity by sharing.  If one takes the example of cybersecurity, the reason we are linked to the European cybersecurity centre is not because we want to become overly reliant on it, it is because we want to learn from it.  There is a reason Estonia is where that is, and that is because Estonia was essentially under attack in terms of a massive cybersecurity attack and it has learned the lessons from that.  We need to make sure that we are never in that position in the future by also applying those lessons here.</p><p> Finally, on the satellite communications, a research project that I mentioned earlier is another EDA project that we are involved in, but any new project that we buy into and are part of has got to go through this kind of process where I need to put it to the D&aacute;il and the Government to get approval for it.  There is nothing hidden here.  On the satellite side, telecommunications and satellite technology is something that Ireland really needs to be part of given where we are geographically in the world and the opportunities that are there from that for us, in particular, to use satellite telecommunications.</p></speech>

I suggest that he commence the opening statement at paragraph four and perhaps do his best to get through it as quickly as he can because I am keen to get Deputy Brady and other members back in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.577" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021033000002#G00300"><p>I will try to do that.  This is less of an ask <i>per se </i>and more of an outlining of the facts but it also applies to 2019.  In truth, this is a little out of date.  It is a procedure that we have to go through to explain.  The reality is we are still involved in all of these missions and the 2019 picture is very similar to the picture today, although the numbers vary slightly.</p><p>The following motion was placed on the Order Paper for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and has been referred to this committee: </p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2019, a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 6 March 2020, in accordance with Section 13 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 2006. </blockquote> <p>Irish troops were first deployed on UN peacekeeping operations in 1958 and since then, not a single day has passed without Irish participation in UN peace support operations.</p><p>As of 5 January 2021, there are some 586 Defence Forces personnel serving overseas in ten different missions around the world.  Ireland has a battalion in UNIFIL and also a company group in the UNDOF mission on the Golan Heights.  We also have other significant postings in the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans.  For all these Irish men and women of the Defence Forces deployed on these operations, service with the United Nations is rightly regarded as a noble and important contribution in supporting Ireland's place in the world and our international and foreign policy objectives.</p><p>Ireland's main commitments during 2019 were to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights.</p><p>The UNIFIL mission was Ireland's largest overseas deployment during 2019.  Due to other national commitments both Finland and Estonia withdrew from the Irish-Finnish battalion in November 2018.  As an interim measure, Ireland assumed the full duties and responsibilities of the Irish battalion and continued in this role up to November 2019 contributing some 450 troops during that period.  In November 2019, following an agreement with Poland to come on board as a key partner in this UN peacekeeping operation, Ireland reduced its contribution of troops in UNIFIL to 340 personnel with Poland providing some 220 personnel to a joint Irish-Polish battalion.  Hungarian personnel also deployed as part of the Polish contingent.  The Irish Defence Forces have had an ongoing relationship with the Armed Forces of Malta since 2009, providing both cadet and officer training.  In 2019, nine Armed Forces Malta personnel also deployed as part of the Irish-Polish battalion.  The UNIFIL mission in Lebanon continues to represent Ireland's largest overseas peace support deployment.</p><p>Ireland's second largest overseas deployment in 2019 was to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights.  The Defence Forces contribution to UNDOF comprised approximately 137 personnel in 2019.</p><p>In September 2019, the United Nations appointed Acting Brigadier General Maureen O'Brien to the post of Deputy Force Commander UNDOF.  Maureen O'Brien is the first female to achieve this rank in the Defence Forces, and is the highest ranking officer from the Defence Forces to serve in this mission.  Additionally, she assumed the role of Acting Force Commander for the period October 2019 to July 2020, following the untimely passing of the Force Commander, Major General Francis Vib-Sanziri of Ghana in April 2019.  We are very fortunate indeed to have Brigadier General Maureen O'Brien serving as Deputy Force Commander of UNDOF.  She brings extensive command and peacekeeping experience to the post.</p><p>Since its establishment in 1974, UNDOF has been a successful mission in supporting the efforts of the international community, both in the Golan Heights and in the Middle East region more generally.</p><p>Government and D&aacute;il approval was received in June 2019 for the deployment of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Forces to participate in the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, MINUSMA, the UN-led mission in MALI.  The deployment of 13 personnel to the mission, primarily drawn from the Army Ranger Wing, took place in September 2019.  All deployed personnel are currently embedded within a larger German company and are carrying out assigned tasks in accordance with the mission mandate.</p><p>MINUSMA was established on 25 April 2013 by UN Security Council Resolution 2100 to stabilise the country after the rebellion in 2012.  The role of the mission is to ensure security, stabilisation and protection of civilians; supporting national political dialogue and reconciliation; and assisting the re-establishment of state authority, the rebuilding of the security sector, and the promotion of human rights more generally in Mali.</p><p>United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, UNTSO, UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, MINURSO, and UN Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, MONUSCO are also projects that we are involved in.  Ireland continued to contribute military observers and staff to various United Nations missions such as United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, UNTSO, throughout 2019.  In addition, a small number of Defence Forces officers continued to serve with MINURSO, the UN mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara - we have only two personnel there now - and MONUSCO, UN Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is a complex mission.</p><p>On other UN mandated missions, the UN has come to increasingly rely on regional organisations including the African Union, the EU and NATO to provide forces to implement and support UN Security Council resolutions.  In 2019, the Defence Forces were deployed in a number of such UN mandated missions.  The EU Training Mission in Mali, EUTM Mali, is a good example of that.  Ireland has participated in the EU Training Mission in Mali since the mission was launched in 2013.  During 2019, 20 Irish Defence Forces personnel were deployed to EUTM Mali.</p><p>I have visited the mission near Bamako.  We are working both with the UK and a German contingent.  The objective of the mission is to train and mentor the Malian armed forces to improve their military capacity and their effectiveness in guaranteeing the country's territorial integrity.  The other EU mandated missions in which the Defence Forces personnel were deployed in 2019, and are still serving, are the EU-led mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUFOR, with five personnel, and the NATO-led international security presence in Kosovo,  KFOR, with 13 personnel.  </p><p> I think I have given a good description of where we are.  Our guiding star is the UN with UN resolutions, and UN mandated and supported missions.  We operate across a broad portfolio of different missions.  The two dominant missions in terms of numbers are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon or UNIFIL in southern Lebanon and the Golan Heights.  It has been a somewhat complex mission in recent years for obvious reasons given what has happened in Syria, and the relationship between Syria and Israel.  We think both have been very valuable missions in terms of experience and the Irish contribution in both has been significant, and certainly noted internationally.  In many ways our Defence Forces on peacekeeping missions are a reinforcement of Ireland's approach to international peacekeeping and conflict prevention.  Certainly, being a Minister for Foreign Affairs as well as a Minister for Defence has been very helpful in that context. </p></speech>

When one sees that the UN peacekeeping operations have involved 70,000 tours of duty it puts into perspective the amount of involvement that Ireland has had over the years and that pride, which is very welcome to see written about.  I hope all of that translates to the much earned yet outstanding medals for A Company of the 35th Battalion of Jadotville.</p> <p>  That Acting Brigadier General Maureen O'Brien has been made acting first commander is a very significant event that deserves recognition.  I hope that many more women will follow in her footsteps and will match, if not exceed, her achievements.</p> <p>  The Minister has spoken at length about Mali.  His statement includes the following sentence, which sits uneasily with me but maybe that is due to the arrangement of words: "The mission aims include reforming the chain of command in areas of training, logistics and military policy to ensure obedience."  Can he elaborate on what that may be, please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021033000002#H00300"><p>I thank all of the members of the Defence Forces for the phenomenal work they have done over very many decades in overseas missions.  They have catapulted Ireland right to the top of the international stage in terms of our standing as honest brokers.  A lot of that stems from our neutrality and how we are perceived internationally so I commend all of the members of the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  Like Deputy Clarke, I commend Brigadier General Maureen O'Brien on her phenomenal achievement.  She is the first female to hold her new rank and be a senior member of an overseas mission.</p> <p>  I have a number of concerns about Mali, in particular the 20 Irish Defence Forces personnel on the EU training mission to Mali, which was a decision taken without D&aacute;il approval.  The Defence Forces (Amendment) Act 2016 is quite clear about when D&aacute;il approval is required in terms of the triple lock mechanism.  The provision lays out clearly the number of personnel and how once the number exceeds 12 personnel the scheme must go through that process.  I have serious concerns about this matter and the fact that the mission involved members of the Defence Forces providing training to the Malian army.  I do not know how that can be perceived as a one-sided involvement in the current conflict situation.  To my mind, that training goes beyond our traditional peacekeeping role.  I would like to hear some views on the matter.</p> <p>  Can the Minister detail the role of the Irish troops involved in the training of military forces in Mali?  Last year, soldiers who had been trained as part of this mission staged a coup in Mali.  I tabled a number of questions and the Minister has confirmed that no Irish troops had been involved in the training of those soldiers.  What EU forces were involved in the direct training of the Mali forces who went on to stage a coup?  Does the involvement of troops in Mali, in the EU's military force, not undermine Ireland's standing as a neutral country?  I think it does and the reputation that the members of our Defence Forces have built up over many years as honest brokers in areas of conflict.  Does this training not undermine our position as a neutral country?  I am concerned about our standing in the international community, which is a just recognition that we have.</p></speech>

I wish to remember those who have lost their lives so have given the ultimate sacrifice.  We must remember that our troops working as peacekeepers is not a game and is a very serious situation.  I am open to correction but I think more than 87 people have lost their lives serving abroad over the years.  With respect to the United Nations, what is the position regarding the UN making payments to the Irish State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.582" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1587" speakername="Cathal Berry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021033000002#H00500"><p>In light of our seat on the UN Security Council, is the Minister aware of any plans for new overseas missions for the Defence Forces in this calendar year?</p> <p>  In terms of amendments to the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2020 promised recently that would permit Reserve Defence Force specialists to serve overseas, can the Minister update us on the current status of the legislation?  Report Stage is due to be taken in the D&aacute;il and I would appreciate an indicative timeline.</p> <p>  Lastly, it is very good that the troops who will be deployed overseas in the next few months will be vaccinated prior to travel.  Are there plans to vaccinate the troops who are currently deployed overseas, primarily in Syria and the Lebanon, prior to their return home?     </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.583" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021033000002#H00600"><p>On vaccines first, we have been insistent on ensuring that the Defence Forces before heading off on rotation whether it is to UNIFIL or the United National Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, are vaccinated beforehand.  That was an understandable ask from representative bodies and we also wanted to do it, particularly given the role of the Defence Forces in the roll-out of vaccines, testing and so much more besides around managing this pandemic.  It was not just a reward for all of that work.  It was also a recognition that they are going to parts of the world where there is not the same level of control and protection from Covid.</p><p>The European Secretary General made pretty serious interventions last year to stop rotations and personal leave for people on peacekeeping missions and it was quite disruptive.  I recognise the professionalism and flexibility shown by our personnel abroad in the context of an international pandemic.  It was very challenging for many peacekeeping missions.  We will vaccinate people before they leave, and we have also ensured that people get the appropriate allowances for the quarantine required before leaving.  It is effectively the equivalent of beginning the mission early and getting the appropriate allowances and financial recognition for those sacrifices.</p><p> It is a bit more complex to get vaccines to our troops out there because we are reliant on the UN system and it is not as straightforward to give vaccine prioritisation.  We will do everything we can.  In any event, on these new rotations everybody there will be vaccinated before they depart, which will make that question less of an issue.  The past 12 months has been somewhat challenging.</p><p> I have just been handed a note on the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2020 and am looking for the relevant date.  The Department is engaged with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General to finalise the legal text of the amendments I talked about.  They will brought forward on Report Stage of the Bill.  I am anxious to get on with that - yesterday, if we could.  It is fairly straightforward legislation and the signal it gives to reservists is strong.  It also gives a signal to the Commission, quite frankly, on the direction of travel we would like it to pursue.  Far be it from me to lean on the Commission, which I certainly will not do, and there is a strong chairperson who will make his own decision on the direction of travel in terms of policy and recommendations.  I would be surprised if the reserve was not a large part of those recommendations.</p><p> New overseas missions are unlikely this year but we are starting a process of reviewing peacekeeping missions more generally.  We have been in UNIFIL for quite a long time and are likely to stay, and we have also been on the Golan Heights for some time.  Those two missions have dominated Irish peacekeeping for a number of years.  We have to anticipate where the UN and the Security Council will need expertise in the future.  If we decide to change focus to build capacity for peacekeeping missions in some other part of the world, there has to be quite a long lead-in time from a training perspective for that.  In the years ahead, we are likely to see an increased ask of Ireland from the UN, for Africa and across the Sahel in particular.  Sometimes they are chapter 7 missions rather than chapter 6, and that requires a different kind of equipment and training to ensure we keep our people as safe as their training and equipment can keep them.  </p><p> Although I sense some concern and criticism in regard to our experience in Mali, our involvement in both missions - the training mission and the UN mission embedded with a German contingent - is very helpful in scoping out new challenges for which the Defence Forces may need to prepare.  That will not happen in the space of a few months; it will require two or three years of preparation time to change the emphasis in regard to equipment, procurement and training, and a different kind of mission will be required if we seek to pursue it.  We are having that conversation within the Department of Defence and with the Defence Forces to consider some of those options.  I do not foresee any change in missions this year, at least in any of the larger missions.</p><p> To respond to Deputy Stanton, we always have to remember people who have lost their lives abroad.  This is serious stuff.  The Defence Forces train as they do because they are in very dangerous parts of the world that can quickly ignite in terms of tension and conflict, as we have seen on the Golan Heights and, previously, in southern Lebanon with tensions between Hezbollah and Israel.  There are multiple tensions within Syria and also between Israel and Syria, particularly with the forces linked to Iran.  The potential for risk and danger always needs to be managed.</p><p> On payments from Ireland to the UN, a total of approximately &euro;14.9 million was received by the UN by way of appropriations-in-aid in respect of UNIFIL and UNDOF.  The amount outstanding at year end 2019 in respect of UNDOF and UNIFIL missions was &euro;3.8 million.  Ireland is not entitled to any reimbursement in respect of Defence Forces participation in EU-led and NATO-led missions as all troop contributors to such missions are responsible for their own costs.  In 2020, the amount received from the UN by way of appropriations-in-aid in respect of UNIFIL and UNDOF was &euro;13.2 million.  We get back from the UN in the region of &euro;13 million or &euro;14 million every year in respect of those missions and will continue to pursue that.</p><p> Deputy Brady asked some important questions about Mali and I hope I can give some reassurance on the issue.  As EUTM is a training mission, it does not require the same triple-lock systems.  We are not sending Irish troops into harm's way but rather for a training mission, which is what it is.  The Army Ranger Wing and its support staff, which is there with it and the German contingent, are on a different kind of mission but the training mission is just that.  I visited the training facilities when I was last in the defence Ministry.  It is about trying to build capacity, know-how, professionalism, discipline and all the other qualities that need to be built within the Defence Forces to enable them to operate as they need to in a very volatile and difficult environment, as has been seen in Mali over and over again.</p><p> Deputy Clarke asked about ensuring obedience.  One just has to read the sentence in my submission.  I referred to "logistics and military policy to ensure obedience to the civilian authority and the restructuring and training of units of the Malian armed forces."  We are working to enshrine a sense that the Defence Forces need to be loyal to a civil authority.  That, of course, was what the coup was about when senior military leaders took over the country, which was far from welcome or ideal.  In any training mission, one of the most important points - Deputy Berry will understand this better than most - is that defence force personnel have to be loyal to civil authority because they are there at the behest of the government and the state, as opposed to their own interests in controlling a state.  I am glad to say that in Ireland there is no issue with the relationship between the Government, the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence, although there are differences of opinion at times.  In many countries throughout the world, the relationship between senior officers in the defence forces and government ministers, and respecting the civilian authority, constitutes a large part of training.</p><p>Respecting the civilian authority in a country is a big part of training.  I seek to clarify that.  "Obedience" might be the wrong word but the Defence Forces must serve the state and the democratic structures of the state as opposed to what we see in some part of the world, such as Myanmar with military generals running the country in a brutal way that is clearly unacceptable to the international community and the UN.</p><p> Brigadier General Maureen O'Brien is an inspiration within the Defence Forces.  Despite the fact she is a women in that position and the highest ever ranking woman in the Defence Forces, not only is Brigadier General O'Brien hugely effective in her own right, she is so impressive that she may well be sought after within the UN system for potential future roles around advice and strategic thinking.  In many ways, Brigadier General O'Brien is a trailblazer for what is possible and what we want, which is more women officers in senior positions in the Defence Forces.  It is a shame she is coming to retirement age because I wish we could have her for much longer.</p><p> Jadotville was mentioned.  We are doing what we said we would do.  The Chief of Staff has a process under way to make recommendations on Jadotville, which I hope can bring this debate to a successful conclusion since it is the 60th anniversary of Jadotville in September this year.  The Chief of Staff is focused on it.  The process needs more time and he has asked me for more time.  There has been an extensive consultation process and a huge archive of information and data to go through.  We must give him the time and space to do it properly, so we get the right outcome and hopefully it will happen-----</p></speech>

I ask speakers to identify themselves as they make a contribution.  I welcome the Minister of State and his colleagues to this committee, which is dealing with Estimate for the Office of Public Works, OPW.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members must be physically present for these meetings either in the meeting room, their offices or in the general precincts of Leinster House.  Members who are not in Leinster House, or in their offices, are not allowed to contribute.  The Minister of State and members are reminded that due to Covid-19 restrictions the meeting must conclude in two hours.  If they are unhappy with that, they can come back again another day for another two hours.  There is no problem.  We will facilitate the Minister of State.</p> <p>  The D&aacute;il ordered that the Revised Estimate for public services 2021 in respect of the following Vote be referred to this select committee for consideration: Vote 13 - Office of Public Works.  The format for the meeting is that we will consider the Estimates and members will then have the opportunity to ask questions.  I call the Minister of State to make his opening statement.  If he wishes to shorten that statement he can, as the committee already has it.  </p> <p>  It is no harm to remember Mr. Kevin Boxer Moran, a previous Minister of State who presented Estimates to the committee.  He was an excellent Minister of State and we wish him well in whatever he is up to now.  He was very good at visiting constituencies and delivering the various schemes under his remit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.595" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021033000002#A00400"><p>I am pleased to be here with the members of the committee to present the 2021 Revised Estimate for the Office of Public Works.  I am joined by my officials and, virtually, by the chairman of the OPW.</p><p>The 2021 Revised Estimate provides a gross allocation of &euro;514.775 million to support the ongoing and widely respected work of the Office of Public Works in the provision of vital services to people in the areas of flood risk and estate management, including our much-valued heritage estate.  Since being appointed to serve as Minister of State, I have been struck by the range of responsibilities and the diverse portfolio of services provided by the Office of Public Works.  Today, I will give an indication of some of the funding priorities for the OPW in 2021.</p><p>The OPW will shortly publish its 2021 to 2024 statement of strategy. <font color="#2F2F2F"> In it, the OPW has developed four themes with four principal objectives that outline the OPW's priorities for the next three years.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  These themes will be reflected in the work programmes of staff at all levels of the organisation, providing direction and purpose.</font><font color="#2F2F2F">The OPW is committed to strengthening our client facing services; sustainability will be embedded into all OPW decision making; the OPW will continue to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change; and, through its people and processes, the OPW will further develop its organisational capability.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The Office of Public Works operates in a highly complex environment, providing a leadership role as an expert for a very diverse range of public services.  It engages with a multiplicity of stakeholders, client organisations and customers across its heritage, flood management and estate portfolio remit.  </font><font color="#212100">In this context, it is timely and appropriate to set out our vision of creating harmony between our built and natural environments</font><i><font color="#212100">.</font></i></p><p>In an overall context, the 2021 gross allocation represents a 2% increase on the 2020 allocation of &euro;505.427 million.  The staff right across the Office of Public Works has largely and successfully continued to implement the current strategy and programme of work during this most difficult of years.  I am sure the Chairman and members will join me in paying tribute to the staff of the Office of Public Works, both indoor and outdoor, in what has been a very difficult year and a period of huge uncertainty.  Within the heritage estate, many of the visitor sites have had to close for a period.  However, our parks and outside areas have fulfilled a critical role in public society and have enjoyed an extraordinary increase in visitor numbers as the public has recognised the full value of these facilities over the past year.</p><p>The structure of Vote 13, the OPW Vote, remains unchanged in 2021.  The two primary strategic programmes, flood risk management and estate management, are focused on two high-level goals. These are to minimise the extent of coastal and river flooding and its social, economic and environmental impacts and to deliver the management, design and sourcing services for the State property and heritage portfolios.</p><p>Under its flood risk management brief, the OPW continues to co-ordinate Ireland&rsquo;s whole-of-government approach to flood risk.  The OPW understands that flooding is a natural phenomenon, which can impose significant damage on people&rsquo;s homes, businesses, and communities.  I have seen the damage flooding can cause at first hand, as I am sure other members have.  The cause, extent and impact of flooding are varied and complex and Ireland&rsquo;s flooding problem cannot be fully eliminated, but it can be managed or mitigated to reduce its likelihood, severity and, ultimately, its impact.  The OPW's core objective is to reduce, to the greatest extent possible, the level of flood risk for people across the country.</p><p>The OPW has undertaken assessments of the potential impacts of climate change, in line with the Flood Risk Management Climate Change Sectoral Adaptation Plan 2019-2024.  All OPW flood relief schemes are now designed and built to take account of future climate change scenarios and can be adapted to manage that risk as needed.  The OPW tripled the number of major flood relief schemes at design and construction stage by the end of 2020.  Further investment in this area will continue in future years as schemes enter the construction phase.  With approximately 300 communities at risk from flooding this investment will provide protection to thousands of homes and deliver extensive benefits to communities and businesses alike.  An allocation of &euro;127 million has being provided within the 2021 Revised Estimate to deliver this essential service.</p><p>The second major OPW programme, estate management, continues to fund the design, and extend and modernise, a significant number of properties within the State&rsquo;s property portfolio.  This includes Civil Service office accommodation for all Departments, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and many of our State agencies.  In all, the OPW manages in excess of 2,500 properties on behalf of the State, which includes some of Ireland&rsquo;s most significant heritage properties, monuments, gardens and arboretum.  This management role includes the curation and presentation of 30 major historical properties, as well as the State&rsquo;s art collection, artefacts, plants and trees.  This is work that makes a significant contribution to the health, enjoyment and well-being of the public and for which the OPW is widely recognised and is justifiably proud.</p><p>Having a modern, flexible, and energy efficient portfolio of office accommodation is now more important than ever to deliver work environments suitable for Civil Service employees to carry out their functions.  The OPW is working with Departments to address these demands while also working to realise the benefits of blended working.  The OPW is designing the workplace of the future for the Civil Service.  It aims to deliver accommodation that allows more agile ways of working to meet our future needs.  This work environment will be delivered within the 887,000 sq. m of office accommodation, currently managed by the Office of Public Works. </p><p>The issue of climate action is one of the highest priorities for the estate management within the OPW, where the design and provision of energy efficient buildings are required if we are to mitigate their carbon impact.</p><p>Essential programmes of work include upgrading the building fabric, eliminating the use of fossil fuel heating and increasing the energy efficiency of the OPW&rsquo;s portfolio.</p><p> This will support the Government&rsquo;s climate action targets.  The OPW will be a major contributor to the delivery of Europe&rsquo;s 2030 climate and energy objectives, including the public sector target of a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions and a 50% improvement in public sector energy efficiency.  The OPW will be a key delivery agent for Project Ireland 2040 in this space.</p><p> I am pleased to be able to confirm the OPW will provide two new capital grants in 2021.  The sum of &euro;3 million has been included in the 2021 Revised Estimate, with Dublin Zoo getting &euro;2 million and Fota Wildlife Park getting &euro;1 million in 2021.  It has been a challenging year for both Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park and this financial support is essential to allow them to recommence vital work on capital projects, including the construction of world-class habitats for some of the world&rsquo;s most endangered species.</p><p> The OPW is a transformational contributor in the delivery of capital investment on behalf of Government.  Its investment in heritage, both natural and cultural, plays a pivotal role in our tourism sector.  Like many other business activities, this sector has been sorely affected by the current pandemic.  In 2020, the OPW had the opportunity to engage new audiences and present our heritage sites to their best advantage when visitor charges were waived at the OPW-managed visitor sites.  This was an incentive to maximise domestic tourism in late summer to encourage staycations for Irish citizens.  I hope the OPW may be able to contribute to this effort again in 2021, especially across the widely dispersed regional network of heritage sites, where their economic role in attracting visitors is greatly valued.</p><p> I apologise for my voice; I do not know where it is gone.  As the Chairman knows, it is unlike me.  I miss it dearly, as I am sure he does.</p><p> A gross sum allocation of &euro;387.412 million has being provided for estate management within the 2021 Revised Estimate.  This is to ensure the OPW is well positioned to support the recovery of the tourism sector as well as the wider economy.  It will allow us to maintain our efforts of contributing towards Europe&rsquo;s 2030 climate and energy objectives.</p><p> I have only referred to a small section of the work of the OPW, but it goes without saying that the scale and complexity of our responsibilities in the delivery of two infrastructural programmes has considerable impact across the country.  This work impacts on communities throughout Ireland and it plays a vital role in protecting, promoting and sustaining our rural communities.</p><p> In tandem with these programmes the OPW is also a major source and contributor of expertise to other public bodies, working in partnership and collaborating with about 80 such bodies.  This multifaceted role of the OPW means it carries within it a diverse range of skills and expertise.  This positions it as the go-to organisation for Government, providing assistance and advice on major capital works.</p><p> I can say with confidence that I am looking forward to supporting the further progression of the work of the OPW through the allocated sums in the Revised Estimate.  I would be happy to take any questions the Deputies may have.  If there are specific questions I cannot answer today, they can be answered by the officials who are present with me or by the OPW chairman, Maurice Buckley, who is appearing remotely.  Alternatively, we can come back by correspondence to the committee later if that is acceptable.</p></speech>

As he knows better than anybody else, Cork city is capable of being flooded as much from rain as it is from the tide.  Cork city recently came very close to being flooded from a rain event.  In 2009 Cork city flooded from a rain event.  The Deputy knows my views about how Cork city flooded in the past.  I am sure he knows the views of many of the traders in Cork city.  Cork city is the most vulnerable populated part of the country with regard to the possibility of it being flooded again.  It is the area that gives me the greatest level of concern.  More than 250,000 people live in Cork.  The Deputy knows the city better than I do.  I studied there and I lived there for a while.  I witnessed the flooding.  I have family living there.  I want to see Cork city thrive.  A tidal barrier will not solve the problem that happened in 2009, as the Deputy and I both know.  A tidal barrier would be-----</p></speech>

A tidal barrier would have been totally and utterly useless in 2009.  It would not have prevented what happened in 2009.  Could the event that happened in 2009 happen again?  It absolutely could happen again.  The reality is the Office of Public Works and Cork City Council are trying to be honest with the people.  The matter is subject to a judicial review and we cannot pre-empt what will happen by way of a judicial review.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has spoken about flooding caused by rain in 2009, which is a key issue.  There is no debate about that.  However, there is a debate about the best and most cost-effective way of dealing with it.  I again refer to Professor Phillip O'Kane of the department of civil engineering in UCC whose paper submitted to that conference last year stated, "When flood-protection has priority over hydropower, when floods are likely, a flood-attenuation of ~70% is possible, with complete protection of Cork during a repetition of the November 2009 river flood without the OPW scheme."  Would the Minister of State care to comment on that?  </p></speech>

I was not at the conference.  Is the Deputy suggesting taking out the ESB generating station on the Lee?  Is that the Deputy's suggestion to eliminating the flood risk in Cork city?  Is he suggesting removing the ESB power-generating station on the Lee as a contributor to the flood relief scheme of Cork?</p></speech>

This is a key argument that has been put forward, not just by the Save Cork City campaign but also by eminent and respected academics from UCC's department of civil engineering.  Their argument is that given sufficient warning of weather events, the dam system the ESB already has in place upriver is more than sufficient to dam water for a very limited period of time or to release water in advance in such a way as to protect the city from upriver rain-driven flooding without the need for the OPW wall scheme.  Rather than replying to the question now, I suggest the Minister of State might read the paper.  I will ensure it is sent on to him and I will move on to my next question.</p></speech>

During the last severe weather event in Cork, an intervention by Cork City Council, the Office of Public Works and the ESB prevented an event similar to the one that happened in 2009.</p><p>Perhaps the Deputy might like to do what I do, which is to talk to the business people and the people in Cork who have had to wade through sewage, faeces, urine and sludge.  He might want to ask them whether they want to wait for a barrier which may hypothetically work out in the sea but which will not protect them from rain flooding or whether they want to get on with the delivery of scheme which will work in the city centre.  He should come back to me when he has done that.</p></speech>

The original benefit was estimated at &euro;18 million, which was greater than the estimated cost of &euro;12 million.  The current estimated cost is well over the &euro;18 million mark.  It may possibly be the first time in the history of the OPW that the proposed cost of a scheme is greater than the estimated benefit.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?  Is he aware of any other such case?</p></speech>

The initial cost was only marginally lower than that.  The Deputy must remember that this scheme has been subjected to delays and we have to allow for building cost inflation during that time.  We hope that this scheme will not be delayed further.  As the Deputy knows, this is one of the oldest parts of Cork city.  It is an urban village.  The people in that village, this long-established part of Cork city, many of whom are elderly, are crying out for the scheme to be delivered.  They hope it will not be delayed further.  The funding is in place.  We want to get on and deliver it.  The money is in place and we just want to make sure the scheme is delivered.</p></speech>

I am not sure that the costs have gone up only marginally.  The original costing was &euro;12 million.  An increase to &euro;20.5 million is not quite a doubling but it is not far off it.  In 2016, a cheaper alternative was identified.  This alternative could potentially be very effective.  Alternative upper catchment management is proposed which would see the storage of excess water.  In 2016, this was costed at &euro;11 million.  Does the Minister of State have any notion as to the latest costing for this alternative?  Is it significantly below the &euro;20.5 million he has indicated in respect of the culverting scheme?</p></speech>

Deputy Barry knows better than I do that, having been granted planning permission for one scheme, we cannot put a hypothetical alternative scheme through the planning process or apportion costs to a scheme for which we do not have permission, particularly a scheme designed some seven years ago.  If we were to do so, the people of the area might have to wait another seven years.  We cannot delay this opportunity or deny these people a flood relief scheme for another seven to ten years.  I hope that, as a representative for that part of the city, this is not something Deputy Barry would like to see happen.</p></speech>

I raise the issue of flooding in Galway.  I know the Minister of State is very aware of the real-life impacts flooding has had on Galway city and county.  I raise the issue of the long-awaited flood defences that are to be completed in the Spanish Arch and docks area of Galway city.  Flooding in this area has a significant impact on businesses in the area as well as on many residences, especially along the Claddagh.  In November, it was revealed that Galway City Council estimated that it would be towards the end of 2028 before works were concluded in this regard.  I understand that the OPW was to commence a five-stage process.  The first stage was to be an environmental impact assessment and cost-benefit analysis.  The second and third stages involved the seeking of planning permission and progressing detailed designs.  The fourth and five stages were to involve construction and completion.  In the chief executive's report to Galway City Council, it was stated that the local authority did not anticipate construction commencing until the first quarter of 2025 and that it could take three years to complete.</p> <p>  As the Minister of State is aware, this is a significant capital project which serves an environmental purpose while also having the potential to save homes and lives in the event of a flooding emergency.  We know that capital projects will be crucial.  The likes of the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and even the International Monetary Fund all tell us that expanding capital investment will be key to economic recovery as the pandemic recedes.  Will the Minister of State commit to re-examining the timeline in respect of the flood defences in Galway city with a view to bringing forward the start date?</p></speech>

She is correct with regard to west Galway.  There was an unprecedented event in Clifden in the Deputy's constituency during the summer.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge, as I have done in the D&aacute;il, the outdoor staff of Galway County Council, the sister local authority in Clifden, for the work they did.  Galway City Council is at an advanced stage with the OPW.  The scheme will cost approximately &euro;10 million.  Design consultants were appointed in November 2020, as the Deputy mentioned in her comment on the CEO's report.  The scheme is currently programmed to go to planning in the first quarter of 2023 with a view to commencing in the first quarter of 2025.</p> <p>  The Deputy has heard my frustration in the D&aacute;il with regard to these matters.  These projects take too long to complete.  The chairman of the OPW is on the call.  We are really frustrated by the length of time these projects take.  The Deputy can probably gauge from the previous contribution of another Deputy and the interaction I had with him that I am very frustrated by this, whether it relates to projects in small urban villages in city centres or large-scale schemes such as those in Galway, Cork or Limerick.  We can sometimes get to the finishing line only for someone to make an objection or an application for a judicial review.  I know the Spanish Arch area of Galway well.  It is very exposed to the sea, as is the city.  I know the large inflated worm that is in place works but it is not a permanent solution.  A permanent solution is needed.  The business people and residents of Galway need a permanent solution.  </p> <p>  The OPW is committed.  There is money available.  All Deputies online and present need to be mindful that we do not have a worry about allocating money for capital spending.  I say to Deputy Farrell, and to Galway City Council, that, if we can shave off time in advancing projects, we will gladly do so, but we have to be mindful of the fact that if our detractors make accusations later, we may end up in the High Court.  We do not want that.  We have to make sure that everything we do is double-checked and triple-checked because I do not want to be here in 12 or 18 months time hearing someone suggest that what we did to shave off time was wrong.  I will definitely get a more comprehensive response for the Deputy with regard to the Galway city scheme.  I have committed to Galway County Council that, when the pandemic is over, I will go back to Clifden.  I will also visit Galway city and I will invite all Oireachtas Members from the area, including Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, to a briefing with both the city and county councils on flood relief schemes for Clifden and Galway city.</p></speech>

That would be very good.  We will do anything we can to expedite matters in order to keep those businesses and homes safe.  I appreciate the Minister of State's offer of a briefing alongside Galway City Council.  That would be great.  I have two other questions on flood defences.  The first relates to insurance companies.</p><p>Are there still issues with insurance companies insuring homes where the OPW has set in flood defences that meet the criteria of one-in-100-year events?  Has the Minister of State had any engagement with insurance companies regarding this?</p><p> Regarding flood defences, the national development plan seeks to invest up to &euro;940 million over its lifetime.  It lists five examples of locations that have been earmarked for the delivery of further relief schemes to minimise the impacts of river and coastal flooding.  As the Minister of State is aware, they are Limerick city and the surrounding area, Tralee, Dundalk, Carlingford and Drogheda.  The review to renew process is ongoing.  Will the Minister of State confirm that flood defences for Galway will be included in the key projects in that review?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.634" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021033000002#D00200"><p>I will take the last part first.  Galway is included as part of our catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study.  I could get into a bigger discussion with the Deputy later about coastal erosion.  Through the OPW, I am committed to holding a webinar with all Oireachtas Members regarding where it stands on coastal and river protection for flooding.  I want to hear from Oireachtas Members in terms of policy, suggestions and amendments to the law.</p> <p>  Regarding insurance, last week I met officials from the Department of Finance and Insurance Ireland.  It is not an issue that is the responsibility of the OPW but is it is one I feel aggrieved about, to be quite honest.  We are spending a serious amount of money on permanent and demountable flood defences.  In some areas we have no choice but to build demountable defences because we cannot build walls across bridges or a permanent fixture across a road where a flood is likely to occur.  We have to install demountable defences to protect properties where we know there will be a serious flood.  For the past number of years this has gone around the world like Methuselah's cat and nothing has been done about it, to be quite honest.</p> <p>  The meeting I had with officials from the Department of Finance and Insurance Ireland last week was part of an action plan I have developed over recent months with my officials in the OPW.  As I have said, we are not the lead Department on this but we chair the interdepartmental working group on flooding.  We got this as a hospital pass.  I have made sure it is something the Department of Finance and Insurance Ireland have to take responsibility for.</p> <p>  Insurance companies will refer to variables.  The variable they want to dodge in this instance is demountable defences, and they say they are not the responsibility of insurance companies.  There are variables in an automobile.  When motor cars, as they were called, were first put on roads there were a lot of variables.  Cars are all mechanically propelled and are completely and utterly dependent on variables, yet they are all insurable.</p> <p>  Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance will have to come to a satisfactory conclusion at some stage as to whether demountable defences, which are engineered and signed off on by the OPW and handed over to local authorities, are insurable.  They have been proven to work, to hold back floods and to deal with one-in-100-year events or whatever.  They have been shown to work in the recent past.  They and the properties concerned are insurable.</p> <p>  This issue has been given to us.  The Chair of this committee would do me and the people who cannot get insurance a great favour if the committee dealt with this issue.  I have no problem coming before the committee again, as Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, to deal with this as a separate issue.  It is something that needs to be addressed once and for all.  As I have said, it has been given to the OPW as a virtual hospital pass.  We would love to see it addressed.  It is not fair to people who cannot get insurance.</p></speech>

I assume the accounts for 2020 will not be available until September of this year.  These accounts deal with the pre-pandemic period.</p> <p>  My attention was drawn to page 20 where section A deals with flood risk management.  I note that in 2018 pay increased by 12%, non-pay costs increased by almost 20% and spending on the purchase of plant machinery increased by 36%.  The notes state that was partly due to the purchase of additional plant equipment to aid the construction of flood relief schemes as well as technical equipment.  The spending on flood risk management projects in 2019 declined, although it was projected the OPW would need to increase spending from &euro;54.6 million to &euro;73.1 million  in 2019.  However, spending fell to &euro;58.2 million.</p> <p>  The note in the document states delays arose because of a number of major projects, which is not the fault of the OPW.  Cost management is the responsibility of the OPW.  From what I can make out from the accounts dealing with flood risk management, non-pay and plant and machinery costs have increased but the work is declining.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?</p></speech>

The OPW is doing a lot of the work on flood risk management using direct labour.  Some of the allocation is in plant and machinery that we replace and purchase for ourselves.  One such example is Templemore, County Tipperary.  Clonlara in County Clare will be a direct labour scheme.  To be quite honest, as Minister of State I hope to see an awful lot more direct labour being used.  The spending involves the replenishment of in-house land and machinery.  It cannot be bought cheaply and, unfortunately, it has to be purchased regularly.  That is what the spending relates to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.637" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021033000002#D00600"><p>There has, rightly, been a lot of discussion about flooding.  Those of us living in Dublin-Rathdown are extremely grateful to the OPW, working in partnership with the local authority, for the remediation works on the Slang and Dodder rivers.  It made a huge difference to the local community.</p> <p>  I want to move to my hobby horse, namely, the post-Brexit situation and the need for continued capital investment.  I would like to dig through a couple of things regarding the work the OPW has done, is doing and will do, in particular when it comes to our ports.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could go through and elaborate on the work that has been carried out in Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort, in particular.</p> <p>  Figures released to me by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, last week show there has been a 150% increase in direct shipping from Ireland to our largest market, which is continental Europe.  There has been a significant decline in goods being shipped to Great Britain or through the land bridge.  I refer to the feasibility of our ports, including Rosslare, Dublin, Cork and Foynes, which is close to the Minister of State's part of the world, and others.  I say this in the context of their ability to cater for new and larger shipping containers on existing routes and the expansion into new routes, and the potential of there being more routes across the Continent.  This is vitally important to exporters of all hues in this country, be it people shipping pharmaceutical goods, importing plant machinery, as the Minister of State mentioned the OPW is doing, or exporting pharmaceuticals and medical devices.</p> <p>  With regard to those new routes and the improvements that are needed within the ports, that also includes approach roads to the ports.  I can think of Rosslare Europort and the ability for lo-lo shipping to use train lines.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could deal with those areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.638" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021033000002#D00700"><p>It is worth noting that when Brexit kicked off, the Departments of Foreign affairs and the Taoiseach asked the OPW to take on responsibility for putting in place infrastructure at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and, specifically and to a lesser degree, Dublin Airport.  It did so within a very short time and under budget.  It handed back the infrastructure to the relevant authorities.  They are pieces of infrastructure worth seeing in terms of their scale, size and complexity and how they operate.  A multiplicity of agencies are involved, including Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other officials.  It shows what the OPW can do when it is charged with doing something in an emergency situation, which is what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform did in terms of looking at Brexit as an emergency.  The OPW took on the difficulties involved and, to a degree, the planning situations that would be confronted were circumvented.  The OPW was given a role, and turned around the project.</p><p>Ongoing work will be needed at Rosslare Europort.  The OPW has purchased and developed a 17-acre site in close proximity to the port.  A border control post at Dublin Airport has been completed and is operational.  As of 31 December, approximately &euro;62 million had been spent, with a further &euro;29 million profiled for 2021.  Since January 2019, the OPW has completed 28 individual projects across 24 sites at three locations.</p><p> The Deputy is right about other Brexit-related projects.  There may be opportunities for other ports that are not already profiled, but that will have to be decided by the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Finance and by the Revenue Commissioners.  If they deem it necessary, the OPW will carry out those projects.  In recent years, we have shown that there is a blueprint for doing so and that there is no need for the State to look beyond State agencies.  I am keen for the OPW to demonstrate that there is capacity within the State in terms of engineering profiling and that we as a State agency can do more in the delivery of large-scale infrastructural projects.  Brexit proved that the State can often be confronted by various issues, not all of which are necessarily Brexit related, that we have the in-house capacity to handle.  If opportunities at other airports or ports present themselves as the Brexit scenario unwinds, that will be a call for the Department of the Taoiseach to make in the first instance.  To answer on behalf of the OPW, however, the OPW would be in a position to take on that job.</p><p> Rosslare Europort is a developing port.  It has managed in recent months to get additional capacity into and out of Belgium and France.  That is welcome.  We are working with it and Wexford County Council, through the council's CEO, Mr. Tom Enright, and will continue doing so.</p></speech>

How many buildings that are managed by the OPW are empty?  I do not mean Covid-related non-usage, but in general.  When I undertook some research a number of years ago, I found that a large number of State buildings, owned by the people of this country, were lying idle in 2016.  In my constituency, an ESB building that had been bought by the OPW lay idle in Enfield.  I know of other buildings throughout the country.  Will the Minister of State give us what information he has on this matter?</p></speech>

There is a hardly a county that does not have a community that does not have the community facilities it needs.  In my constituency, we are battling away in Johnstown, Enfield, Longwood and many other places to try to get our hands on buildings for their communities to use.  It costs the State to have an idle building.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development launched a major plan yesterday concerning rural Ireland and community buildings.  Can we put as much effort as possible into ensuring that we get these buildings back into use?</p></speech>

Since I assumed my role, that is one of the actions we have been taking.  Our local authorities are not exactly jumping through hoops to take them on, though.  We have been at pains to get local authorities to take over some of these buildings even though they are in towns and villages that have local authority waiting lists.  Some of the buildings will require conservation architects and have difficulties associated with them.  In many cases, the situation is not straightforward.  Some of the buildings are in isolated locations, require a great deal of money or need communities to take them on with a liability.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that, in many cases, if one takes on a listed building, one also takes on a liability.  To get a community to take on such a building is a challenge.  This is not for the want of trying by the OPW.  We have asked the HSE, local authorities and every other State body to take on these buildings, but we are finding it difficult.</p></speech>

However, some of them are in decent enough shape and are in towns that have no community facilities.  The OPW is holding them, but there are major difficulties with the Department of Justice, the Department of Education or local authorities.  For example, there are two old schools in Trim.  One was handed over to the Department of Education and is lying idle.  My question is really just about OPW buildings, but the issue of empty State buildings is a major one across all Departments.  I urge the Government to make use of them as best it can.</p> <p>  How many acres does the OPW own that are lying fallow?</p></speech>

When Senator McDowell was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he bought Thornton Hall in north Dublin for a new prison.  Thornton Hall is under potatoes at the moment even though it cost the country a large amount of money.  The State owns a great deal of land that is not being used for the purposes it was purchased for at a significant cost to the State.  I do not just mean the financial cost, but also the opportunity cost.  The Government is not making use of that land to the benefit of the Irish people.  I understand that dozens, if not hundreds, of acres at Thornton Hall are owned by the State but are under potatoes during a housing crisis.  Does the Minister of State know of other lands that were bought by the State for a particular purpose but are not being used for that purpose?</p></speech>

If the Department of Justice, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of Education owns lands, they are not owned by the OPW.  Most of the lands that are in the custody of the OPW, such as monuments and the lands around them, are actually owned by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  We are just their custodians.</p></speech>

That battlefield site was the birthplace of the Irish Republic.  It was the last stand of the Volunteers in 1916, whom many of us will celebrate on Easter Monday.  Those buildings lie on a street that was synonymous with the vibrancy of the Dublin markets years ago.  It gives me no pleasure to say it, but Moore Street is an open toilet now.  It is a derelict location that, according to the people who work there, is a dangerous place at night.  It is frozen in its dereliction because there has been a battle over the past ten or 15 years with a number of large property owners.  None of their property objectives have come to fruition.  As a result, everything there has been stalled.  However, the buildings owned by the OPW on Moore Street could easily be developed now into a wonderful national museum and heritage site of great interest to, enjoyed by and educational for the people of Ireland and tourists from abroad.</p><p>Moore Street itself could become a vibrant public market to compete with the public markets of major European capital cities.</p></speech>

Those buildings are owned by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  The Office of Public Works, because it does not own buildings as I explained earlier, manages, supports and operate the buildings once they come into the charge of the Minister.  We manage the operation, conservation and the restoration of them when the Minister instructs us to.  When that time comes, everybody accepts the Office of Public Works conserves our national monuments to the highest possible standard.  If one looks at all of the monuments associated with 1916, the decade of centenary from 1913 to 1913, and anything that the OPW has had any role in during the decade of centenary or anything associated with it even back as far as Daniel O'Connell and Derrynane and all the monuments associated with Irish freedom where the OPW has its footprint, one will find that we will maintain it to the highest possible standard.</p> <p>  When it comes to Moore Street and the restoration associated with it, the OPW is part of the discussion around it.  No doubt when it comes to that, and OPW will be part of it, it will be maintained to the highest possible standard.</p></speech>

I thank him particularly for, and note, the flood relief works that have been undertaken so far and are still in the pipeline - no pun intended.  In Kildare, I note the works in the Morell River, which were delayed due to court proceedings, are up and running now.  How are they progressing?  I note much development work has been curtailed by the Covid.</p> <p>  I will mention the great houses throughout the country that fall within the responsibility, and those that are in the charge, of the Office of Public Works in respect of which I have put down numerous questions over the years and will continue to so do.  A number of buildings that strike the eye as one travels along any of our major routes stand out in the sense that they seem to be in a rundown state and look to be in danger of collapse.  What can be done about them?  Some of them are in private ownership.  Others are in public ownership.  There is, for instance, in my constituency, Carbery Castle, which is not too far down the road from Johnstown which my colleague in Meath mentioned a few minutes ago.  It is an eye-catching building with much history attached to it.  It has not been mooted yet but there has been a local evaluation done of it.  My question would be, to what extent could the Minister of State envisage embarking on a restoration programme.</p> <p>  Similarly, in relation to Rathcoffey Castle in private ownership, I am not certain whether it is available for restoration but there is that in my immediate area.  There is also a very historical building in Taghadoe Round Tower and Abbey.  A long time built, dating from the 8th century, it is in need of remedial works in the sense of sealing the building from rain damage, etc.  An examination was done a couple of years ago as to what might be done by OPW in the future.  I ask the Minister of State if it might be possible to progress that in relation to that particular building.</p> <p>  There are a number of other public buildings that I have made reference to in the past as well, including Castletown House, in Celbridge, which is also in my constituency.  I do not normally do a constituency tour of these buildings but occasionally it is no harm to do a little bit of twirl around the constituency to see how things are going on.  I await the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.656" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021033000002#F00600"><p>First of all, the Morell flood management scheme, as the Deputy quite rightly says, was at a standstill because of a judicial review but construction got going again and continued during Covid.  It is a direct labour scheme by the Office of Public Works.  It is something, as I said earlier, I would like to see more of.  It is a substantial scheme costing &euro;10 million.  It will protect many properties in that part of County Kildare.  It is a very important scheme involving 7.5 km of embankments.  It is quite a complex scheme involving the realigning of two streams and 11 culverts.  It is hoped, all going well with no further delays, that it will be completed in the third quarter of 2024.</p> <p>  On the heritage side, I will begin with the last one Deputy Durkan mentioned.  Castletown House is a hugely important and significant part of our tourism offering, not only in County Kildare but in the eastern side of the country.  It is historically significant.  There is potential for a great deal more by the OPW and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  It is something that I have already spoken to the commissioner about to see, with Kildare County Council, whether there is potential to do more post-Covid to drive more tourism into that part of County Kildare.  After Covid, something that I want to see, if we can sit down with Kildare County Council and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is whether there is more that can be done there.  I visited there years ago on a school tour.  I visited there as Minister of State with responsibility for tourism.  It was regarded as Ireland's largest house when it was built by the then speaker of the Irish Parliament.  There is more that can be done for it.</p> <p>  I am not sure if I have the pronunciation right where Deputy Durkan referred to Taghadoe Round Tower.  There are no plans at present to undertake any works here.  The OPW is aware of structural issues here.  I might be able to get the Deputy a more comprehensive note on it afterwards.</p> <p>  I do not have any good news for Deputy Durkan for buildings that we do not have custody of that are national monuments other than to say that the Minister who has responsibility for it is the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and there are grants available from that Department.  We have responsibility for the limited number of monuments that we present.  Kildare County Council will be able to help as well through the Rural Regeneration Fund that is presentable there through Leader.  That might be an option for the Deputy to pursue.</p> <p>  The Office of Public Works is doing work with local authorities in terms of the presentation of our monuments as a whole.  In how we can present all of our monuments in terms of a tourism package, we are not doing enough.  As a former Minister of State with responsibility for tourism, I am aware this is something we are not doing enough of with the local authorities.  Our Commissioner, Mr. John McMahon, and I have spoken about this to see how we will do more of it.  I met the County and City Management Association recently.  Particularly now with staycationing, it is obvious that we do not do enough of it.  It is glaringly obvious we have not done enough of it over the past number of years.  We have all of these fantastic monuments around the country and we do not even have road signs to them.  The basics have not been done properly.  I have charged the county and city managers with trying to do even something as basic as the road signage with Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  It is something that I can meet Deputy Durkan on, separately, outside of this meeting about, if that is what he would like.</p></speech>

Centrally located and steeped in history, it is in reasonably good condition but needs to remain that way.  I would say in conclusion that it is hugely important to ensure that the buildings do not fall into disrepair in the sense that they are national monuments, they can be retained at relatively little cost and it should be done where possible.</p><p>We need to be proactive about it.  I would encourage the relevant Department to investigate each of the sites involved, of which there many not only those in my constituency but throughout the country.  Tourists will take great interest in this, as will schools, colleges and students.  Students need to know about their history, in particular their local history, and about the significance of it as it relates to them and they need to take ownership of it.  Some of the buildings, sadly, suffered harsh treatment at the foundation of the State, but they are still buildings of considerable importance.  We need to protect and preserve them for future generations.</p></speech>

There is an issue there regarding toilet facilities.  Twenty-two thousand is a lot visitors.  It is clear that number can be increased.  As I said, the issue there is as basic as the provision of toilet facilities.  Kildare County Council is one of the most well-off local authorities in the country in the sense that it has one of the largest rates bases.  Maynooth is one of the largest towns in the county.  It has the potential for a great deal of tourism in terms of the ecclesiastical college and university.  I am sure the CEO of Kildare County Council, given that he has the deepest pockets of any local authority manager in the country, could find it within his budget to provide toilet facilities at Maynooth Castle.  I am sure that through engagement of the CEO with the OPW locally money could be found for the provision of toilet facilities for the up to 22,000 visitors mentioned.  The only way that number of visitors can go is upwards.  I am sure the Deputy will be able to facilitate a meeting between the CEO of Kildare County Council and OPW staff locally and that the council will be able to find the money for the toilet facilities.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  My first question follows on from Deputy T&oacute;ibin's question.  What is the OPW spend on security for the 76 vacant buildings in its possession?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.663" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021033000002#G00600"><p>I do not have that detail with me, but I can get it for the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.664" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021033000002#G00700"><p>Regarding the figures provided by the Minister of State, in 2019 there were 98 vacant properties, but that number has since decreased to 76.  At that time, the OPW spend on security was approximately &euro;340,000.  I presume the spend has also reduced.  I would welcome the details in that regard.  Most of the properties, as mentioned by the Minister of State, are Garda stations closed by the Government in 2012 and 2013.  The Minister of State also spoke about the challenges facing community groups and so on taking them on, which I can understand because I have been involved in efforts to acquire some of the buildings.  What is the policy in this area?  Where a community group or a school wants to utilise a former Garda station which the State has no intention of reopening, is the facility transferred into the ownership of a State body for use by the community group and so on.  What is the process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.665" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021033000002#G00800"><p>If there is a State body locally that wants to take possession of the building, it needs to demonstrate that it can manage it.  We do not want buildings taken over and ending up in a quasi-derelict state.  The buildings can be taken over by a State agency for local use.  For example, an unused Garda station on the main street of a town could be transferred to a local authority and taken into the local housing stock.  That is the optimum use.  If that is not a realisable prospect, the building can be brought into use by the HSE or another State body for use locally for the provision of community or State services.  That is the preferred option.  Where none of that is possible, if a community group can demonstrate that with the support of LEADER it can provide a local service such as a cr&egrave;che, community centre or other local amenity, it will be offered a 25, 50 or 99-year lease.  This has happened in my constituency and I am sure it has happened in the Deputy's constituency as well.  We do not want to burden the local community with a facility that ends up being a millstone around its neck.  Where we have entered into discussions with community groups around this process, many of them have backed on the basis that it is too much hassle for them.  Our ambition is to dispose of these buildings.</p></speech>

I want to ask the Minister of State some brief questions on my county of Donegal and one question on the overall Estimates in terms of the capital expenditure.  On the Donegal town CFRAM report, the Minister of State acknowledged that the project is not in the first phase of projects and that the OPW and Donegal County Council were working closely to ensure it commences as early as possible in the current programme of investment.  Is there any update or has there been any movement on that work in Donegal town?</p> <p>  The Minister of State also said that six projects in Donegal were selected to be progressed as part of the first phase of the implementation, in addition to projects that were already progressed for Raphoe.  He said that consultants were appointed for the projects in Lifford, Burnfoot and Castlefinn and that the county council is in the process of designing the Ballybofey-Stranorlar, Buncrana-Luddan and Ramelton projects in a bundled format.  Have the design consultants for Ballybofey-Stranorlar, Buncrana-Luddan and Ramelton been selected?  If not, what is the status of the procurement process and when is it likely to occur?  People are eager that there is progress in this.  I have two other questions then following that.</p></speech>

They have appointed consultants for the bundle and that is a start.  Some &euro;157,500 was approved in 2018, which the Deputy has details for, but the total budget for Ballybofey-Stranorlar is &euro;1.92 million and the total number of properties is 59.  We are only going through tranche 1 of the CFRAM and Donegal town is in tranche 2, as the Deputy knows.  This is a slow process.  The Deputy is right that we will get to Donegal town and it will be in tranche 2.  In Lifford, the consultants are at design stage and the public exhibition stage will be early next year.  There is a cross-Border element to this project, as the Deputy knows.  The river is the Border.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister of State will do the same post Covid.  He was also excellent in finding ways to try to resolve some of the issues in some of the projects.  One of those projects was the Clady River in Gaoth Dobhair.  There was a major issue there where the bridge was swept away.  That caused major problems because it was not an OPW or county council bridge.  Basically, three families were left stranded and they had to resolve the issue themselves.  I live close to this area.  There has been heavy rain in Gaoth Dobhair in recent days and that river is at road level again.  There is always an issue with that road and the adjoining houses.  My understanding is that Donegal County Council and the OPW have never progressed an application for funding for upstream flood mitigation.  It needs to be done.  I know the problem is probably at Donegal County Council's level but I ask the Minister of State's officials to reach out to Donegal County Council to try to resolve some of the issues upstream where debris is being caught in that bridge and is basically causing a barrier for the river flowing.  I encourage the Minister of State to look at that.</p></speech>

I have crossed over that bridge many a time and I know the bridge and the river.  The Deputy is right about the county councils.  I have appealed to them, as my predecessor did, in relation to minor works applications for local authorities.  I have met the county managers.  One of the things we are doing is revising the cost benefit analyses for all flood mitigation measures.  I have asked the Chairman and my officials about the cost-benefit analysis metrics that can be attached to local authorities applying for money to carry out works.  It cannot all just be about economic metrics.  Local authorities do not have a bean at the moment so if moneys are available from the OPW, whether it is for bank mitigations or for bridges, we should try to help and the cost-benefit analysis metrics should be revised.  I will caution on one matter, however.  A bridge being blocked by a bush or a tree is my definition and the Deputy's definition of a flood.  It is another Deputy's definition of a habitat and that is a big problem.</p></speech>

If we look at the outturn in the context of what was projected when we dealt with the Estimates, as we are supposed to do, we can see that this has not been good in recent years.  Four major schemes were supposed to be delivered in 2019, but only two were delivered.  The following year five schemes were promised, but only one was delivered.  If one looks at the number of major flood relief schemes, in 2019 six were supposed to be delivered but only two were delivered.  The following year, four major flood relief schemes were promised but only one was delivered.  On flood embankments, 132 km were promised in 2019 but only 95 km were delivered.  We have targets before us which are bigger than any other year but if the same trend is followed, the OPW will deliver about a quarter of what the targets are.</p> <p>  That takes me to the following point.  If we look at what the OPW has been asking for in terms of capital expenditure, we can see that for 2021 the capital allocation for flood risk management is &euro;88 million and that for 2020 it was also &euro;88 million.  In 2019, Maurice Buckley, the chairperson of the OPW, wrote to the then Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Robert Watt, and provided a submission for the ten-year investment programme.  Mr. Buckley clearly outlined that the OPW's needs were that &euro;103 million, &euro;112 million and &euro;114 million were required in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.</p><p>That was not to do super jobs but to continue to provide existing services and implement the flood protection schemes in 30 areas of the CFRAM proposal.  When the Government announced its capital plan, it did not deliver on those figures but on &euro;80 million, &euro;90 million and &euro;100 million over a three-year period, from 2018 to 2020, inclusive; what was delivered on the ground was worse than that, at &euro;73 million, &euro;88 million and &euro;88 million.</p><p> We can talk about the projects, Cork and Donegal and all the rest but unless the pot of money is allocated to those, there are problems.  Donegal town goes into phase 2 and others.  Over and over again, the OPW says that it needs much more money than what is being delivered.  Even what is being ring-fenced in the capital plan is not being delivered by the OPW on the ground.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right on one point.  I need a bigger pipe.  I need more projects going through at initiation stage and being animated at the start.  I refer to places like Donegal, Gaoth Dobhair, Crossmolina, Enniscorthy, Adare and Limerick.  More projects must be animated at a much earlier stage so that if something gets blocked, there is something there to pick up the slack.  However, there is another problem.  If four projects fall out of the courts at the same time, like Bandon, Douglas and a whole clatter of them in the same year, and I do not have money to meet them, I have a bigger problem.  If I do not have the &euro;119 million that I am asking for - I am only plucking a figure from the sky - and they all fall out of the courts at the same time, or there are judicial reviews, objections or delays, I will have a problem if they are all ready and waiting to start, but I have not asked for the funds and the Oireachtas has not voted for it for me.  A great part of my problem is that I am at the mercy of objectors.  I do not know if a scheme mentioned earlier by another Deputy will end up in judicial review - it may not.  If it does not, happily I have money to fund it and it can start immediately.  I do not know if a scheme that is currently in judicial review in Cork will come out of that in June, in which case it can start and I have funds to allocate to it.  I am a victim of a planning system that is completely and utterly unfit to deliver massive infrastructural projects.  The Chairman might say that a Minister of State is criticising the Government - absolutely.  I have a planning process that is completely unfit to deliver major flood infrastructure to the State.  As a result, I am here asking for money that I do not know if I can spend, but I need in the event that the planning process is able to deliver to me.  That is my biggest problem.  I need a bigger pipe at the start to shove through more so that if one gets stuck I can pull something else out at the end.</p></speech>

It is apt, following the last exchange, that we look at the financial aspects of that.  It is my belief that investing in changes in land use, working with agriculture and different landowners upstream and engaging in nature-based, soft engineering solutions can have many benefits, including societal, environmental, tourism and employment benefits.  This can also reduce the need for concrete walls to be put downstream where one is dealing with the end of the pipe solution.  It is a combination.  That could also be an opportunity to reduce the conflicts the Minister of State spoke of around planning and to talk about what some people see as a conflict with the environment.  It is all part of the one hydrological cycle.  Nature-based solutions have to become a bigger part of our flood defences and flood mechanisms.  Regardless of how much concrete can be poured, how quickly it can be poured and how high one can pour it, nature has a lot more resources than we do at an engineering level downstream.  I thank the Minister of State for his time on that.  I know he has an understanding of that issue, which I hope to pursue further with him.  We spoke about the massive-scale Avoca catchment project in County Wicklow.  We need to look at this on scale because flooding in our towns and villages emanates countrywide in all parts of the country.  We need to look at it on a catchment-based level.</p> <p>  I have two questions, both relating to flood defences in County Wicklow.  The Arklow flood defence scheme is about to go to planning stage.  There are ongoing maintenance costs associated with the River Dargle flood defence scheme in Bray, which was completed a couple of years ago.</p> <p>  On Arklow, when one builds a flood defence, the physical objective is to place a barrier between the people and their property, and the river.  It is also really important that people can maintain a connection with the river.  Over generations, people in a town or village develop a close connection and affinity with their river for its recreation and amenity value, even by sitting there to look at it.  Often when we pour high concrete walls, we block off that connection.  As part of the design of the Arklow scheme, it has been requested that glass panelling be installed that would permit views of the river to be maintained down along the South Quay.  It is important to the people who live in that part of the town, having grown up there over the generations, to be able to see the river, to walk by the river, to have visual access and to enjoy the natural amenity.  I appreciate that there are many engineering constraints in designing a flood scheme and that it is complex and difficult, but I ask that some mechanism be incorporated into the Arklow design to maintain people's visual link to the river while protecting the properties.  The people of Arklow appreciate that the project is going ahead.</p> <p>  My second question is on the cost of maintenance.  I understand that the large flood defence scheme on the River Dargle in Bray cost &euro;46 million.  As part of the scheme, there is a need for ongoing maintenance.  Siltation and debris traps, etc., have to be cleared.  Does the cost of that fall fully to the local authority or does the OPW have an ongoing role in meeting the cost of maintaining flood defences over a certain period of time, for example as part of a design-build-maintain approach?</p></speech>

No matter how hard we try, we cannot keep back the sea or every river everywhere.  Rivers will break their banks and flood and we will not be able to keep back everything everywhere.  When I met the Deputy, we spoke about OPW mapping to local authorities as part of the development of local area plans and county development plans.  It will be critical.  I met the environmental pillar as part of my bilateral engagement recently.  Upstream catchments are important in the OPW's development of flood relief schemes if we are to ensure we capture and have full knowledge of where the water is coming from.  They will have to play a major part in the future design of our flood mitigation measures, and people will expect that.  In terms of how the Department will be measured on climate change over the coming years, I have insisted in our strategy that our flood relief schemes must involve a combination of measures.  Hard concrete alone is not something that people will accept anymore.</p><p>There will have to be a combination of measures, and soft engineering as much as hard engineering is something I would expect to see into the future in terms of design.<br/><br/>We spoke about the Arklow issue briefly on a tele-call the day we met.  It is fully designed and has, as members will know, gone to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but there is nothing to stop people from putting in submissions.  Submissions will probably be submitted by councillors.  I am not pre-empting what An Bord Plean&aacute;la decides, but if it were to come back and say as part of its final deliberation that a submission from a public representative was worthwhile and further vistas were to be improved, that is something that the Office of Public Works would take on board with Wicklow County Council.<br/><br/>The Office of Public Works, by the way, is never above criticism.  Public consultation, public engagement, An Bord Plean&aacute;la hearings and local authority engagement always improve a flood relief scheme and the final package, and that has been very evident in any of the flood relief schemes that have been built.  The OPW would be the first to say public consultation has always delivered a good final output.  Therefore, it might be helpful if the Deputy or some of the local authority members made an oral submission.  That might circumvent it because, at the moment, we cannot make a change because the project has gone into the planning process, but if An Bord Plean&aacute;la made the decision, that would be something.<br/><br/>On Bray and silting and things like that, there is an ongoing relationship between OPW and local authorities.  This is something the OPW will have to formalise as we work out CFRAMs - a more structured and formalised relationship.  We spoke about it at the meeting I held with the city and county managers.  Memorandums of understanding and service level agreements will have to be put in place between us and the local authorities as we formally hand over flood relief schemes.  We pay for management and maintenance but the councils inspect the work.  I will supply the Deputy with a written reply specifically on the Bray project.<br/><br/>On the overall contextualised work, we will need a memorandum of understanding between ourselves and the County and City Management Association because the workload will become too big for us to be doing on an <i>ad hoc</i>, one-by-one basis.  We will require proper service level agreements and memorandums of understanding between ourselves and the association.</p></speech>

First, I will comment on the work the OPW does on flooding and flood protection.  In my constituency the OPW has done a very effective job on the Dodder over the years and I know that work continues.</p> <p>  The only question I have is on Dublin Zoo.  I was pleased to hear the Minister of State say that capital grants amounting to &euro;3 million will be provided in the form of &euro;2 million for Dublin Zoo and &euro;1 million for Fota Wildlife Park.  Is he concerned about the future of Dublin Zoo?  Does he think it is safe in light of the very difficult times it is going through at present?</p></speech>

There is scope for a longer term relationship between us and Dublin Zoo rather than a once-off relationship.  There should be a longer term strategic relationship between the Government, Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park through the vehicle of the Office of Public Works.  We are doing this at the moment on a capital basis, but there should be a longer term relationship.</p> <p>  Covid has brought into sharp focus the fact the zoo is essentially a charitable trust.  I am not certain whether that can continue in its current guise into the future.  Obviously it can answer for its own financial situation.  There is an opportunity, however, The OPW has a neighbourly relationship with the zoo in the sense we operate the Phoenix Park.  We have opened the door in terms of dialogue and a financial relationship, so there is a possibility of doing something far more strategic and long-term.</p></speech>

The zoo is a fantastic facility not just for all of the people of Dublin but for the people of the country, as indeed is Fota Wildlife Park.  It is important we preserve the zoo and I commend the Minister of State and the Government on stepping in with some capital to help both places get through this difficult time.</p></speech>

It is being used.  Is this an opportunity to examine how these facilities are now being used and to put in either walkways or cycleways to assist the numbers now in the park?  I am sure other parks are probably the same, such as Jenkinstown Park in County Kilkenny.

There are throngs of people on some days and we are getting complaints about social distancing and other problems, which leads to its own difficulties.  There is a challenge for OPW-associated parks in the main.  We want people to come in and use them during Covid and to enjoy them, but it is leading to issues with social distancing and one-way traffic issues.  The commissioners and park attendants are mindful to see how we will manage this going forward.  If our national monuments reopen, which I hope they will, we will have to manage this.   As well as that, we are conscious that if there is a reopening, we want to give something back to people staycationing with regard to charging admission to such amenities, as we did last year.  If we do that, that too will lead to capacity problems, so the volume of people at Kilkenny Castle this year will increase dramatically on last year, which will lead to its own issues.</p></speech>

I compliment the staff in the park because given the numbers who use it, there are very few issues.  For the few issues that do exist, the individual who might be on duty in the castle park does an excellent job.  There is a new emphasis now on outdoor activities and I think that will remain with us after Covid.  Therefore, we should examine the structure of walks and whether we will accommodate bicycle routes.  Dog-fouling and so on has become a big issue on walks throughout the country.</p></speech>

We might even pilot an initiative in that regard.  We have to pay tribute to the people who use the facilities.  In fairness, our patrons are very respectful to monuments and other patrons.</p> <p>  I have to mention our flood defences, into whose design we are incorporating amenities.  We are considering flood defences in an entirely different light as a result of Covid.  We are incorporating walkways and cycleways and bearing in mind that in the future, our flood defences will need to be more than just a barrier between us and a river.  They have to be a walkway, a cycleway and an amenity for people in the area.  Even in the case of existing barriers, we will incorporate new designs so that towns such as Kilkenny and Clonmel that have pre-existing flood defences will be much more than just a flood defence in future.</p></speech>

The committee agreed to seek submissions from a number of individuals and bodies, including the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the acting Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Secretary General to the Government and the acting Secretary General of the Department of Health.  The committee also sought submissions from the Public Appointments Service and the Top-Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, among others.</p> <p>  The request for submissions was issued on 5 March, following consultation with committee members and with the Committee of Public Accounts, with responses due by 19 March.  To date, only five responses have been received.  They are from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the acting Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Health, the Public Appointments Service and the Commission for Public Service Appointments.  Despite a reminder issued last week, no response has been received from the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and for Transport, the Secretary General to the Government, the Department of the Taoiseach, the acting Secretary General of the Department of Health or TLAC.  At its private meeting earlier, the joint committee noted its disappointment at the lack of engagement on the part of these senior politicians and civil servants and what it considers a lack of respect shown to the work being undertaken by the committee.</p> <p>  The joint committee intends to issue a formal reminder and request that those concerned formally engage with the committee, show some good example, and give the responses they have been asked for.  It is simply not good enough that the work of a committee would be held up by such senior figures in politics and the Civil Service.  I encourage them to reply to the reminder as quickly as possible as we intend to move on in detail with the work we have agreed to undertake with the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to that person's or entity's good name.</p> <p>  I invite Dr. Renwick to make his opening statement on behalf of his colleagues.  If they wish to contribute immediately or prefer to wait for questions, that is fine.</p></speech>

I am deputy director of the constitution unit at University College London, which is a research centre focusing on how best to structure and operate democratic politics.  I am chair of the Working Group on Unification Referendums on the Island of Ireland.  I am joined by three other members of the working group.  We were due to be joined by Professor Brendan O'Leary from the University of Pennsylvania and Queen's University Belfast.  Sadly, he was forced earlier today to drop out.  He sends his apologies and great regrets for having to be absent.</p> <p>  In these opening remarks, I will quickly introduce three matters: why we created the working group, the nature of the working group and the group's interim conclusions.  We created the working group because referendums on the unification question might happen.  If they happen, it is important that they be conducted well, but they can only be conducted well if somebody thinks through what that would involve.  Nobody has done that thinking fully yet.  We wanted to help fill that gap.  We did not create the working group because we thought that referendums are imminent.  The evidence is that a majority in Northern Ireland would currently vote for maintaining the union and against unification, but nobody can know how opinion might evolve over time.</p> <p>  As to the nature of the working group, we are looking at how any future referendums on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland would best be designed and conducted.  We have no collective view on whether such votes would be desirable or what the outcome should be if referendums were to be held.  The group is based at the constitution unit in University College London and comprises 12 experts from Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, Queen's University Belfast, Ulster University, University of Pennsylvania and University College London.  Our expertise spans political science, law, sociology and history.</p> <p>  Turning to the group's interim conclusions, I will outline a few of our key findings.  As a starting point, we assume that any referendums would be conducted within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, so we start by setting out what that entails.  As is well known, unification could not happen without a referendum vote in its favour in Northern Ireland, and we conclude that a referendum would be required in the South as well, either amending or replacing the Constitution.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland must call a referendum if a majority for unification appears likely to him or her.  A referendum in the South would not have to be on the same day.  It could happen later, but the same proposal would have to be put to voters both North and South.  The threshold in each referendum would be a simple majority of 50% plus one.  If that threshold were met in both jurisdictions, unification would have to take place.  The majority principle applies to the decision on sovereignty, but on other matters the 1998 agreement's wider ethos of seeking to proceed by consensus should be upheld as far as possible.</p> <p>  That is the 1998 agreement.  However, there are many other matters that the agreement does not resolve, which our report examines in depth.  I will state three broad conclusions that we reach on these.  First, it would be highly unwise for referendums to be called without a clear plan for the referendums and other associated processes.  These would be complex processes and if poorly designed could lead to problems.  Such a plan would need to be agreed by the governments in close consultation with others.  We do not say when planning should begin.  That is a political matter and we recognise that it is very sensitive.  However, a plan should be agreed by the time any referendum is called.</p> <p>  Second, there are several plausible configurations of referendums, North and South, with referendums coming relatively early in the process before the details of a united Ireland have been worked out or later, when a plan has been developed.  We will be happy to go into further details, but for now I can say that there is no perfect approach.  Each configuration has advantages and disadvantages.</p> <p>  Finally, the conduct rules for any referendums would be crucial.  Existing campaign rules are badly out of date in the digital age in both the UK and Ireland and urgently need to be strengthened.</p> <p>  I hope those headlines give a flavour of the working group's analysis.  So far, we produced an interim report, last November, presenting our draft conclusions.  We are keen to hear the members' reflections and questions.  We plan to release our final report later in 2021.</p></speech>

If his colleagues wish to say anything now, they can do so if he wants to nominate them or they can speak whenever they wish.  I am trying to keep the engagement informal as best I can even though I am wearing a mask.  We have a two-hour time slot so at every meeting we rotate the order of speakers from political parties.  That is how we operate.  I propose that we take ten minutes with Sinn F&eacute;in followed by ten minutes for Fianna F&aacute;il and ten for Fine Gael.  That will be followed by the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, independents, Aont&uacute;, Sinn F&eacute;in again, the Labour Party and the Green Party.  We will rotate them in that order.  I will take that as agreed.  Whatever party indicates has a ten-minute slot to ask questions.  That is to give everybody an opportunity to contribute and then, hopefully, we can have a second round.  I call on Sinn F&eacute;in's first speaker for questions.</p></speech>

The work the group has done on the technical and procedural matters arising from the explicit provision within the Good Friday Agreement is an important component of the global and national discussions which are currently taking place daily.<br/><br/>I understand the work was funded by the British Academy and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.  My first question is in terms of who commissioned the work.  Was it the working group?  Perhaps Dr. Renwick could explain the context of that.  I will ask a couple of questions and perhaps get a couple of answers together.  One of my colleagues may then also wish to come in for part of the ten minutes.<br/><br/>The first very interesting thing addressed by Dr. Renwick was around the democratic threshold.  Since the vote in favour of unity and the vote for maintaining the <i>status quo</i>are equally valid, the only fair and reasonable outworking of that would be a majority of 50% plus 1.  This would then demonstrate a successful outcome for either side.  I take it that 50% plus 1 is now a given because there is some ambiguity around that in some of the discussions which have taken place.  I ask Dr. Renwick to speak to that.<br/><br/>The other thing that really comes through in terms of the working group's substantial interim report is the need for the Irish Government to plan.  The Good Friday Agreement states it is for the people of Ireland to decide without external impediment.  This implies the neutrality of the British Government.  The Irish Government, however, is permitted and, indeed, obliged to pursue the constitutional goal of the reunification in accordance with Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and the Good Friday Agreement as it was.  We have seen the outcomes of the working of a referendum held without proper planning in terms of the Brexit poll.  I believe everybody absolutely agrees with the need to plan.<br/><br/>Dr. Renwick also referred within his report to the need for a constitutional assembly or civic assembly to be able to discuss all the issues he raised pertaining to the unity debate and what the shared island unit could do.  Perhaps, therefore, Dr. Renwick could answer those three questions on who commissioned the report, the democratic threshold and the need to plan and the constitutional obligations on the Irish Government to do so.  How important does he believe a citizens' assembly would be?</p></speech>

I will reply certainly to the first two questions and perhaps also say something about the third.  I am sure my colleagues will also want to come in on that, however.</p> <p>  On the first question about the origins of this work, we were not commissioned by anyone.  This was an independent academic research project in its origins.  We came to the view that it was important to investigate these questions.  At the constitution unit, we have been doing a lot of work for some years now on the appropriate conduct rules for referendums.  We had not applied that work to Northern Ireland.  We recognised that Northern Ireland is a very particular case with its own particular sensitivities.  We wanted to contribute in this important area.  When we reached out to colleagues in Belfast and Dublin, we saw there was agreement on the importance of these questions and the need to approach them in a careful, scholarly way.  That was the origin of the project.</p> <p>  We are very clear in the report that the threshold in each referendum, North and South, would be a simple majority of 50% plus 1.  This is partly because that is what the agreement says and it is important to follow the agreement.  It is also partly because, even in the absence of that existing constraint, to have any other threshold would create an inequality between the two sides.  We believe that in a basic question of sovereignty such as this, it is imperative the two sides be treated equally.  It is very important the 50% plus 1 threshold be applied.</p> <p>  We talk about two kinds of planning.  One is planning of the process of the referendums and another is planning about the form a united Ireland might take.  As I said in my introductory remarks, we recognise that the question of when planning should take place and exactly what planning should be done by whom is a very sensitive matter.  We do not seek to make bold pronouncements on those kinds of details.  We say that by the time any referendum is called, it should be clear what the process will be.  Therefore, a referendum should not be called unless it is clear what the processes and timetable of the referendum will be and what process would follow a vote for or against unification.</p> <p>  With regard to planning of the form of a united Ireland, there are different ways in which these referendums could be configured.  One approach could be taken where the referendums could be held with no prior planning at all.  We believe that is a bad idea, very clearly.  A second approach would be to have a plan for a process that would be followed in the event of a vote for unification for working out the form of a united Ireland.  The form of a united Ireland would, therefore, be worked out after the referendums.  Third, the planning for a united Ireland could be done in advance of the referendums.  We do not take a firm view between those two final ways of running the referendums.  A great deal could be said about the relative merits of those, which we might get into in the course of the questioning.  I will not attempt to go through all that in my reply to this question, however.</p> <p>  Let me quickly say something on citizens' assemblies and then I will perhaps hand over to Dr. Kenny who can comment on the constitutional issues raised by the Deputy.  I am a big fan of citizens' assemblies.  I ran the first UK-wide citizens' assembly and a number of the other members of the working group have been intimately involved with citizens' assemblies in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  We see an important potential role for citizens' assemblies in this process.  At the same time, we urge caution.  To attempt to hold a citizens' assembly too early in this process, when there is not willingness from all parts of the community to engage with these discussions, could be damaging.   It could be damaging to the credibility of citizens' assemblies more broadly, which would be a very unfortunate thing.  Thinking through the sequencing, being careful and not going too fast into a citizens' assembly is an important point that we draw out.  I will hand over to Dr. Kenny.</p></speech>

Article 3 of the Irish Constitution obviously establishes something of a national aim in respect of pursuing unification.  The way it is sometimes phrased is setting a national aim.  The question is how that might instantiate in practical action.  In the interim report, we do not suggest it provides a great deal of specificity.  We suggest it would place a duty on the Irish Government to hold a concurrent referendum under the Good Friday Agreement if the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland decided to call a referendum in the North.  Beyond that, it is slightly challenging to suggest it can place very specific duties on the Irish Government to take any particular steps in respect of planning.  What that constitutional duty might require would have to be carefully worked out as a matter of politics .  It is fair to say there are at least some consequences of that constitutional duty, let us say, an obligation to have a concurrent referendum.</p><p>I would be loath to suggest it could suggest very specific action beyond that as a matter of law, though as a matter of politics certainly that could be persuasively argued.</p></speech>

It is a very interesting perspective.  We need many perspectives in this conversation.  We have had some but not enough and this input is very welcome.  The few scenarios thrown about are interesting with regard to planning before a referendum, having a referendum and planning for afterwards.  I would like to see more beef in the bowl on this and the thinking around it.</p> <p>  There is a train of thought about the possibility of the Secretary of State bouncing the question on us before planning is done or in the middle of the process of planning.  What are the witnesses' views on this?  Is it likely?  Is it possible?  The other issue we have is that the committee is meant to be cross-party but we do not have any unionist party taking part.  We also lack engagement generally in the conversation from the unionist community.  What are the views of the witnesses on this?  How best do we engage with unionism to hear their views on this?  We need to get them to the table.  Is a citizens' assembly the way to get their view?  Should we do more than this?  I would like to get the views of the witnesses on this.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact they laid huge emphasis on the need for proper preparation in advance of a referendum.  This is a theme that has gone through all of our meetings with regard to the need to plan for what those of us who aspire to a united Ireland and are passionate about it want to see.  We want to see referendum preparations done in good time before any question is put to the people.  It would be rather bizarre if the referendum was not held in Northern Ireland on the same day as in our State.  It is important the people on all of the island decide on the same question on the same day.  On 22 May 1998, we were privileged as a generation to vote as one unit on the question regarding adopting the Good Friday Agreement.  We should always remind ourselves it was the first time since 1918 that the people of all of the island voted on the same question on the same day.  I sincerely hope that when a referendum is called and the necessary preparation and processes are in place, all of the electorate in our country will vote on the same day on that particular question.  It would lead to all sorts of problems if one referendum was held with another one to follow.</p> <p>  The witnesses' unit does academic work.  Has it contributed to the new political orders or has it given advice, such as in eastern Europe when those countries, thankfully, from the late 1980s and early 1990s onwards, got their freedom?  They had to set up new governance and new administrations.  Was the constitution unit or were people in the college in any way involved in advising the new administrations there on the political structures that would best suit their newly emerging states?  I thank the witnesses for their work and I hope we will have an opportunity for further engagement with them as we work towards a desired referendum.</p></speech>

On the final point about the constitution unit, it was established in 1995, so alas we were not around in 1989 to advise on those processes.  Perhaps the closest parallel is that we were involved prior to the devolution arrangements being set up in the UK, particularly in Scotland and Wales.  In the late 1990s, the constitution unit did quite a lot of work in this area.  Most of our work has been advising on constitutional reform processes and political reform processes within the UK.  I will turn to Dr. Tannam who might want to pick up some of the other questions.</p></speech>

In my contributions I also emphasise the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and an alternative bilateral institution.  Given that the Good Friday Agreement frames what we are doing and frames the law on this, we really emphasise the need for robust British-Irish co-operation so that ideally there should not be that sort of unexpected bouncing by the British Government.</p> <p>  We have seen from Brexit that some of what we thought would never happen, or at least that I thought would never happen, has happened.  The degree of low trust between the governments seems to go back to the 1980s.  This robustness is needed and the enhancement and revitalisation of the Good Friday Agreement institutions.  This is my response to the specific question.  It should be more co-ordinated informally even though formally it is the Secretary of State's power and only the Secretary of State's power to call the referendum.</p> <p>  I want to clarify, and perhaps Dr. Renwick, Professor McCrudden and Dr. Kenny can correct me if I am wrong, that there is a misconception sometimes that we say we must plan for a referendum, and the question just asked implied this, whereas what we are saying is that if there is a decision to call a referendum there must be planning before the referendum occurs.  This is my impression but I may be wrong about it.  It is slightly more nuanced than saying there must be planning.  I stress that British-Irish co-operation is essential in avoiding the bouncing.</p></speech>

I will add a footnote to Senator Blaney's question on the Secretary of State bouncing a referendum.  Essentially there are two different arrangements.  The Secretary of State must call a referendum where he or she considers there is likely to be a majority in favour of unity.  The scenario Senator Blaney has in mind is where the Secretary of State exercises the second option, which is at his or her discretion, which is apparently unlimited.</p><p>Senator Blaney's concern is that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland might in some way manipulate the calling of a discretionary referendum.  My point is that a case, the McCord case, was heard in the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland and the judgment in that case addresses that issue clearly.  The Court of Appeal, correctly, stated that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in those kinds of circumstances "would not be acting with rigorous impartially if in the face of diminishing support for Northern Ireland remaining in the United Kingdom he directed the holding of a border poll with the sole purpose of achieving a majority to remain and thereby to delay a united Ireland for a period of 7 years".  </p><p> In other words, therefore, the conclusion to be drawn from that judgment is that were the Secretary of State to do as Senator Blayney fears, there would be a judicial review and the Court of Appeal would take a very sceptical approach to it.  </p></speech>

This has been a helpful session with excellent to and fro.  I have three questions.  I refer to what Dr. Kenny said about the referendums being freely and concurrently given and the question of whether they are contemporaneous or otherwise.  Contemporaneous referendums might be desirable as an idea, but what do we do legally and politically if there are different outcomes?</p> <p>  This report reference refers to the 1973 border poll and the boycott of that poll by unionists.  How do we view the legitimacy of a poll in Northern Ireland in similar circumstances now, knowing what we know since the Good Friday Agreement?  Going back to Article 3 of the Constitution, and this is for Dr. Kenny in particular, it seems to me that the obligation has always been for the Irish nation to "unite all the people who share the territory".  Taking into account what we know of the drafting of the Constitution, the wording that legislators used and the choice of wording that could have been used, there is a question in Irish politics at the moment concerning the existence of an obligation to work towards a united Ireland as a territory, as opposed to an equally legitimate aspiration of working towards the unity of people.  How does Dr. Kenny interpret Article 3.1 in respect of priority?  Does he regard one perspective as trumping the other or as elements having equal weight?</p></speech>

I have several questions regarding points 46 to 50 in the executive summary of the report, regarding campaign conduct rules.  This morning we had representatives from Facebook and Twitter before the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to talk about the digital side of campaigning, including political advertisements, etc. There are clearly two different jurisdictions in play here when it comes to finance and acceptable donations.  How do we reconcile that disparity?  Is it a case that we just have to play by the rules of both jurisdictions?  I ask that because there are clearly advantages and disadvantages, depending on which jurisdiction one operates out of.</p> <p>  Turning to point 46, referring to the role of Governments during the campaign, what role is envisaged by the witnesses?  Would the campaigns be left to the political parties to fight or would the Governments have a role to play?  Moving to point 50, which mentions amending the Referendum Acts and the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 in the United Kingdom, what are the big sticking points and major differences between a UK referendum and an Irish referendum?  Are there major differences or sticking points regarding how referendums are carried out in the two jurisdictions?  What is it specifically that should be amended in the UK legislation?</p></speech>

We have two sets of rules on the island when it comes to managing political parties and campaigns.  What are the witnesses' views on that aspect?  We saw how the Brexit campaign went in the UK and how much money was spent on it.  How could that aspect be managed to ensure fairness?</p> <p>  The report states that the same proposal would have to be put to voters North and South.  Does that mean that there would have to be significant co-operation between the two Governments?  Mention was also made of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference as a place to do that.  Will the witnesses elaborate on that suggestion?  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.831" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021033000002#D00800"><p>I thank Dr. Renwick, and the members of the committee for their questions.  Starting with the first point on concurrence, we conclude that it is certainly possible, and it may be considered desirable, to have referendums on the same day.  Concurrence would probably not have to mean precisely contemporaneous referendums if there were seen to be some political advantage in having a vote first in one jurisdiction or the other.  We think it is possible to do that, once the referendums are close in time and there is no material change in between.  Regarding possible political implications of doing that, that should be carefully considered.  It is not something that we specifically address in our report, however.</p> <p>  Turning to the question from Deputy Carroll MacNeill on Article 3 of the Constitution, it is an interesting point that textually the article refers to "uniting all the people who share the territory of the island".  In addition, it also mentions bringing about a united Ireland by peaceful means.  It is fair to suggest therefore that the article is interested in uniting people and territory, and it would be entirely legitimate to conceive of any obligation under Article 3 as existing along both those axes and each one might require different elements.  I stress that is my personal reading of Article 3 as an Irish constitutional scholar and it is not something we addressed in detail in the scope of the report.  I offer that view only as my own perspective.  </p> <p>  I will leave some of commentary on the referendum process to Dr. Renwick, because we are both especially interested in that area.  In the report, however, we highlight various aspects of campaign conduct rules which are perhaps in need of moderation in each jurisdiction in any event in respect of areas such as campaign finance, the role of governments, information and misinformation and social media.  There may be calls for and a need to examine modernisation in that context, even aside from this specific set of referendums.  Dr. Renwick might speak with more precision on this aspect regarding what we recommended in the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.832" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Renwick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021033000002#D00900"><p>I will cite two additional things regarding campaign conduct.  Dr. Kenny referred to the need for the modernisation of rules to be able to cope with the reality of digital campaigning today.  That is certainly very important in the UK.  There is essentially no regulation of online campaigning in the UK now, which is rather problematic.  I will comment on some additional elements.  Dr. Kenny referred to information made available during campaigns.  One difference between referendums in Ireland and the UK is that Ireland has referendum commissions which provide information during referendum campaigns.  There is no equivalent in the UK.</p> <p>  In the 1998 referendums of course all voters in Northern Ireland received a copy of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.  There is, however, no provision in law for something equivalent to that to happen in any future referendums in the UK.  It would seem imperative to us that there be proper information provision during these referendums.  Indeed, we raised the question of whether the approach taken by referendum commissions in Ireland is sufficient for a choice such as this one.  The referendum commissions, as the members of the committee will know much better than I do, have tended to focus specifically on the constitutional implications, that is, the legal change implied by the amendment under consideration, and to not go into the further implications of the change being proposed.  For many voters though, the issues which really matter concern healthcare and education provision, and all these sorts of additional features, which in all probability would not be included in any constitutional amendment.</p><p>In both jurisdictions, the issue of information needs to be thought about carefully.</p><p>  The other point I would make about campaign conduct rules is that there is a huge difference between Ireland and the UK in the principles underpinning the regulation of campaign spending.  The UK has a cap on total spending by campaign groups but not on donations; Ireland has caps on donations but not on total spending.  We have begun to think in our work about the scope for gaming the system that could arise from the difference in rules.  It is an area we have not truly bottomed out in in our thinking.  We need to consider it further.</p><p> Senator McGahon asked about the role of Government during the campaign.  Both the UK and Ireland have rules preventing Government campaigning, so that is one area of consistency between the jurisdictions in the rules.  The details are different but in both jurisdictions it is not possible for taxpayers' money to be spent on campaigning in the course of the campaign.  There is an additional question about whether there are further provisions under the Belfast Good Friday Agreement that would restrict the Governments from being involved in the campaign, in particular the phrase "without external impediment" in the agreement.  There is discussion in the group as to the precise interpretation of that phrase.  Dr. Kenny and Professor McCrudden will correct me if I am wrong but I think our lawyers are in agreement that, at least in law, those words clearly prevent the UK Government from refusing to hold a referendum and prevent any attempt to manipulate or skew the result.  However, those words in themselves do not imply that the UK Government cannot participate or express a view in this process.</p><p> There are other views on that question and if Professor Brendan O'Leary were here he would likely offer a different perspective.  We are keen to hear members' thoughts if anyone here would like to express a view on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.834" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colum Eastwood" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021033000002#E00200"><p>Apologies, I missed the presentation but I have read the report and we have already met about it.  I will offer a couple of thoughts.  On the 50% plus 1, it is good the speakers are clear on that.  We are absolutely clear on that.  There is no way of doing a democratic referendum other than 50% plus 1.  I do not know how it would work.  We had enough years of certain sections of the population's vote not counting for as much as another section and we cannot go back there.</p> <p>  I am interested in what has been said about the external impediment.  The British Government is clearly impeding on this issue now.  It is doing it in Scotland and in the Internal Market Bill it has given itself the power to direct civil servants on every conceivable policy area in the devolved space.  That is, in my view, particularly deliberate around the Scottish referendum question.  If we think it will not do that here, we are being naive.  That is a big concern.</p> <p>  There was discussion on Article 3 in terms of unity of people versus unity of territory.  I think they can be the same thing.  It will be hard to do the territory without the people.  This is Hume-speak but it is not that John Hume thought it was one over the other.</p> <p>  Around the criteria for calling a Border poll, we need to focus on the fact that the power rests with the British Secretary of State.  That area was under-negotiated in the Good Friday Agreement and people who were there would say that at that stage they just wanted to get out the door and not enough consideration was given to that.  It has left us in a fairly dangerous position.  Professor McCrudden's points are well made around the legal position of this but I am concerned, given who is in that position.  The current British Government and the Secretary of State have openly stated they are happy to break international law to suit their political purposes.  We would struggle to rely on them to do the right thing.</p> <p>  Article 3 may not place a specific legal requirement on the Irish Government to prepare but there is a political requirement, if we accept that at some point the British Government could call a referendum.  That should, as Dr. Tannam said, be done in co-operation and conjunction with the Irish Government, which should insist on that.  It comes out of the Good Friday Agreement and that is based on the principle that the two Governments are guarantors of that process and they convene all the incidents around it.  That needs to be nailed down early but it also means the Irish Government has a political responsibility to work towards thrashing out all the difficult issues thrown up as part of this report and every other discussion we have been involved in and roll the pitch for a referendum whenever it comes.  The Brexit experience tells us it is not a good idea to stay off the pitch and not prepare.</p> <p>  I am grateful for the presentation and the work the other witnesses continue to do.  The issue around the criteria of the Border poll will be key.  More work will need to be done by all of us on that but I firmly believe the Irish Government needs to insist that is not left to the wording in the Good Friday Agreement.  Politically speaking, it is clear that was not fully thought through or thrashed out in the Good Friday Agreement negotiations.</p></speech>

He is absolutely right that the Good Friday Agreement does not really specify the criteria beyond requiring the Secretary of State to call a referendum where he or she considers a majority in favour of reunification would result.  The case I mentioned earlier in the Court of Appeal goes into this in some detail because Mr. McCord tried to pin down the Secretary of State as to the criteria.  My colleague at Queen's University Belfast, Colin Harvey, has written to the Secretary of State in pretty much the same terms asking what the criteria would be.  There was a document disclosed as a result of a request from a senatorial colleague of members for information from the Secretary of State that seems to indicate the thinking at the moment.</p> <p>  Boiled down, Mr. Eastwood is right that the Secretary of State has to take into account all relevant considerations and exclude all irrelevant considerations.  In the report, we have set out four or five different elements the Secretary of State could draw on, including opinion polls, assembly recommendations, the number of seats particular parties have and so on.  We are unable, given the way section 1 of the Northern Ireland Act is framed, to pin down any further what the weighting would be for any particular criterion.  If Mr. Eastwood is looking for criteria of weighting between the different considerations, that would be difficult to construct.</p><p>One thing we say should not be weighted is what we have called the demographic issue, that is, crudely, the number of Catholics and Protestants who will be identified in the census.  We have said that anybody who knows Northern Ireland knows it would be risky for the Secretary of State to rely simply on the demographics because, of course, we know that some Catholics will vote for continued unity with the rest of the UK and <i>vice versa</i>.  Beyond that, I think the difficulty of weighting the different criteria remains.</p></speech>

As for his point as to whether the Irish Government should insist that it be involved - and, as I have explained, it is the case that our involvement is essential, as is robust co-operation - there are so many trade-offs and question marks, as he knows and as he has pointed to, around unification of territory versus people, which he said should happen together, that each decision that is made and each insistence causes another effect.  This goes back to Senator Blaney's point, which I did not answer, on unionist engagement and the delicacy of all this.  It is very difficult.  I just found the language of "must insist" difficult.  It is my personal opinion, which is not in the report as such, but that is what stood out when reference was made to the delicacy of this.  Getting to that stage, according to the Hume framework, would be very gradual, although the 51% criterion is necessary.  The language just rings a lot of alarm bells for me because of the diplomatic nature that is required, which has diminished so much.</p></speech>

This meeting is very welcome.  There is no doubt that we can all agree we have had in recent weeks very stimulating, productive and measured conversations about Irish unity.  It is very important to build on this momentum.  I agree with Mr. Eastwood big time.  My concern has always been the criteria.  Planning and preparing is absolutely vital.  It was said that the Secretary of State can be challenged if he decides to bounce a referendum.  I agree with Mr. Eastwood that one just never knows.  If the British Government is willing to break an international agreement, God only knows what could happen.  We do not know what the criteria are for calling a referendum, and it is vital we find out what the criteria are somehow.  Whether that involves an onus on the Irish Government to try to work with and talk to the Secretary of State, I do not know, but it is absolutely vital.  Is there some way we can find out from the Secretary of State about the criteria and what his deciding to call a referendum would be based on, or do the witnesses have any suggestions as to how we can do so?</p> <p>  I have a couple of other questions.  Do they agree that a unified Ireland will be a member of the EU and that the European Convention on Human Rights would protect minorities and safeguard civil and political rights in a unified Ireland?  In addition, more recently, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan published a paper with detailed proposals.  What do the witnesses think of his idea of a new constitution for a united Ireland?</p> <p>  Finally, I know Dr. Renwick mentioned that he does not believe referendums to be imminent, but what is his definition of "imminent", and what is his belief based on, given that the Secretary of State refuses to outline the exact criteria for the calling of a referendum?</p> <p>  I have given the witnesses a lot of questions.  I hope that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.844" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Renwick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021033000002#F00700"><p>Perhaps I will say a little more in addition to what Professor McCrudden said a moment ago about the criteria.  Perhaps I should respond also on the definition of "imminent".  I think Professor McCrudden dropped out of the meeting for a moment so may not have heard the question about protection of rights under the ECHR.  Perhaps we should ask Dr. Kenny to come in first on that and Professor McCrudden can pick up from him.</p> <p>  The question of a new constitution is an issue on which we do not take a view as a working group.  We set out the various possibilities but we do not take a view on the form a united Ireland should take.  I agree entirely with everything Professor McCrudden said about the criteria the Secretary of State might use.  One additional point we made is that we envisage that, at least in some scenarios, the Secretary of State might see that it may be the case that a majority would vote for unification, so it may be the case that that criterion is met.  In that circumstance, ideally the Secretary of State would announce a formal process to review whether in fact that criterion is met.  Ideally, we suggest that the Secretary of State, perhaps with the Irish Government, set up an independent review process to look properly at what exactly the criteria should be and what exactly the weight attached to different criteria should be; that that review process come up with a judgment; and that it might take a year - it would depend on exactly what evidence were available - to come to a view as to whether in fact that criterion had been met.  Of course, however, it is also the case that in law it is for the Secretary of State to make that decision, so the Secretary of State cannot in law make his or her judgment dependent on the view of an independent panel or indeed the Irish Government.</p> <p>  As for the definition of "imminent", at the moment it is I think fairly unproblematic to say it does not appear that a majority would vote for unification because none of the plausible criteria point in that direction.  There is no polling evidence that suggests that a majority would vote for unification.  There are different types of polls and surveys and, as the committee will know very well, they produce very different answers, but at the moment none of them suggests there is currently a majority for unification.  Similarly, neither the composition of the Northern Ireland Assembly nor votes cast in recent elections give evidence that there would be a majority at present for unification.  We, therefore, define "imminence" in terms of what we can see from the evidence at present.  Of course, the evidence can change, and we do not take a view as to how quickly opinion could change, but "imminent" we see in terms of the current state of the evidence.</p> <p>  I shall hand over to Dr. Kenny on the human rights question.</p></speech>

There is, therefore, no doubt but that that would have to happen.  In addition, an unrealised possibility of a bill of rights for Northern Ireland, if it should come about, could provide additional safeguards and standards over those that would potentially pose an obligation on Ireland to respond in kind.  Any of those measures will have to form a core basis of human rights protection, and I do not think there is any question about that.</p><p> I will comment briefly on the ides of a new constitution.  As Dr. Renwick has said, it is outside the scope of our report and I limit myself to saying that in the report we are very much considering the possibility of either very significant amendments to the Constitution, a small number of amendments to the Constitution or an entirely new Irish constitution in the event of these referendums taking place and being successful.  It would be impossible to suggest that a new constitution would not be something to be considered in that process.  We are not taking a view on whether that is more desirable than the alternatives at this juncture.</p></speech>

A point was made by Dr. Renwick on the imminence of a Border poll and he suggested evidence could change.  They key point is that the evidence is changing.  The witness made an earlier point about the need to prepare and stressed its importance strongly.  Looking at a series of elections we can see the end of unionism's political majority and the political and societal fallout from Brexit.  There is also the ever-growing series of polls pointing to a particular trend.  The salient point is that the evidence is changing, and that is why there is such a strong argument for the necessary preparatory work to begin.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Brendan Smith on the very clear need, rationale and logic to holding votes on the same day North and South in a similar way to the process for ratifying the Good Friday Agreement.  It is really important and welcome to hear it stressed again today with such energy the question of 50% plus one being sufficient.  After all, that is democracy and it is in the Good Friday Agreement.  We are, after all, the committee dealing with the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  The question of a citizens' assembly has been touched on but do the witnesses have a view on the matter of the institutions on these islands and those institutions that flow from the Good Friday Agreement playing a role in, assisting and enabling the work of preparing for constitutional change?  As a Member of the Seanad, I am always encouraged by the fact that we can be nationally representative as an institution, as we have been in the past.  We have that same potential over the next number of terms to represent a broad range of communities, including those that are traditionally under-represented.  Separate to what the Irish and British Governments will do, do the witnesses believe there are roles for parliamentary institutions in facilitating, assisting and enabling the work advocated by the witnesses in the form of proper planning and engagement?</p></speech>

Two polls were carried out by LucidTalk on behalf of <i>The Sunday Times</i>in recent years.  One had support for Irish unity at 45.4% and the other had it at 42.3%.  There is clearly very substantial support and it is a credible polling company that is respected politically.  In the past few local or European elections, and specifically elections for Westminster or the Northern Ireland Assembly, there was not a unionist majority of MLAs or MPs elected.  There is no electoral or polling evidence that would justify any lengthy delay in a secretary of state's deliberations.  This again points to the problem of only a secretary of state, as part of an avowedly unionist British Government, making this decision with no wider consultation about criteria.</p><p>I ask the witnesses to take us through the approach that would lead to a second referendum on Scottish independence.  Will they speak about the process that led to the first one and what they anticipate will be the process leading to a second referendum, including how that will inform us on how to proceed in Ireland?</p></speech>

They urged caution earlier and spoke about not having a citizens' assembly too early when there is not willingness from all participants.  We have seen in the recent past the unwillingness from political unionism to engage but that is not to say that civic unionism would not want to be part of this conversation.  The work done by groups like Ireland's Future in bringing forward and enabling that unionist voice to be heard within the debate has been useful and helpful.  Do the witnesses have a view that if political unionism believed it could stall this process, the vetoing of the citizens' assembly would be a vehicle for it to do so?</p></speech>

Dr. Tannam might speak to some of the other points.  Dr. Kenny set out earlier our thinking that in law, concurrence is not the same as simultaneity, so in law there is no requirement for the votes to be on the same day.  We do not take a strong view on whether they should be on the same day and we float various possibilities.</p> <p>  We highlight a couple of reasons for thinking it might be preferable to consider holding the vote in the North first and the South a little later.  If the vote in the North goes against unification, it would save the holding of a referendum in the South that would be a bit of a null vote, in effect.  If the North voted against the idea, unification would not happen.  A second consideration is that if we think there is a requirement for the votes to be simultaneous and acknowledging that some have seen it as problematic that the Good Friday Agreement stipulates that it is for the secretary of state to call the vote, essentially a power is being given to a secretary of state in the UK Government to decide a referendum on a particular day in the Republic of Ireland.  That might raise some questions or concerns.</p></speech>

On the question of institutional engagement, our focus was very much within the Good Friday Agreement forms of co-operation, including intergovernmental processes.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly is another institution under strand 3 that has not been used very widely.  That was the focus and my colleagues might correct me if I am wrong but we did not give huge attention to other forms of institutional co-operation east-west or across borders in the context of a referendum.</p><p>That is apart from examining the citizens' assembly idea.</p><p> Second, on the issue of the citizens' assembly going ahead without unionist engagement but with civic unionist engagement and not being cautious because, as Ms Gildernew argued, this would more or less be a unionist veto, my colleagues will agree that we grapple with that issue a lot in terms of the balance.  The interim report sets out the criteria for a referendum and inclusivity and stability are the two criteria that came to my mind the most.  The balance is to be struck between being inclusive and having open debate, but also maintaining stability.  Regardless of whether a group is a minority, we know that instability can occur if the timing is not correct or the processes are not done in such a way whereby there is a sense of a voice being given.  I agree it is a conundrum but my understanding, and the feeling in the report, was that the timing of a citizens' assembly is crucial to maintain stability and also allow inclusivity.</p></speech>

Ahead of the 2014 referendum the UK Government recognised that with the SNP having won a majority in the Scottish Parliament on the basis of a manifesto commitment to hold a referendum, it was appropriate that there should be a referendum.  It did not explicitly say that it acknowledged the right of self-determination of Scotland but, in effect, that appears to be what it was doing in that case.  As the Deputy will know very well, the current UK Government takes a rather different view on that.  It has not explicitly argued against the principle that Scotland has a right of self-determination but it has indicated that it will say "not yet".  Boris Johnson has suggested that it might be appropriate to have a gap of 40 years between referendums.</p> <p>  The situation in Northern Ireland is different because of the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement.  The Agreement is clear in stating a minimum gap of seven years between referendums, which is a minimum gap.  It is not that there must be a referendum after seven years but, presumably, if a referendum were narrowly defeated and it appeared again that there was majority support for unification after seven years, the criterion would again be met and it would be necessary for the Secretary of State to call a referendum.</p></speech>

I have only one point to ask a question on so I will probably not take up the ten minutes.  It is along the lines of what a previous witness, Colum Eastwood, said and relates to the suitability of the mechanisms we currently have to hand to call a referendum.  The executive summary states: "The form of consent in the South is not specified, but our conclusion is that a referendum would be needed."  In the Republic there are two types of referendums allowed for in the Constitution.  One refers to an amendment of the Constitution and another which would take place if the President received a joint petition from both Houses of the Oireachtas, that is, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  The petition would set out that a proposed Bill would be of such national importance that the will of the people of Ireland should be found out before it became law.  This is slightly blue-sky thinking because I suppose we would have to have a referendum to change it but is Dr. Renwick of the opinion that these options are a satisfactory mechanism through which to hold a referendum in the South on Irish unity?  Does the Oireachtas need to consider how we would fulfil that mandate?  Dr. Renwick discussed the Secretary of State and the issues around how that referendum would be called in other jurisdictions.  I am interested in the actual process of doing it.  Do we have the facilities to do that in a way that would bring people with us?  I am sorry for what may be a meandering question and ask Dr. Renwick to bear with me.</p></speech>

We consider in the report the sort of referendum that should be held.  Our conclusion is that at least some category of constitutional change is necessary anyway.  It can be effected as a constitutional referendum if that were chosen.  Outside of that, referendums would have to be a consultative or non-binding exercise.  In the report we consider the possibility that there could be a binding non-constitutional referendum because of the particular provisions related to the Good Friday Agreement.  However, the likelihood is that given that some constitutional change will be happening, and perhaps a great deal, and given that otherwise the mechanisms for an Irish constitutional change referendum will function, such as a 50% plus one majority required to pass it and so on, that would be a satisfactory mechanism for the most part.</p> <p>  It would be possible to legislate for another type of referendum to be held but it probably could not be binding in the same way as a constitutional referendum would be.  It could not bind the Legislature to act in the same way so I believe there would be some issues with that.</p></speech>

The rotation will be as we had at the start of the meeting.  If it is fair I ask members to keep their contributions to five minutes.  We will have Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, SDLP, Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, Independents, Aont&uacute;, Senator Frances Black, Sinn F&eacute;in again, the Labour Party and the Green Party.</p> <p>  I have only one question, which is more rhetorical.  I accept and acknowledge the tremendous research and thought that has gone into this report.  From a political perspective I know where I stand if and when a referendum is held.  I will be voting "Yes".  My problem is that all our debates here and all our inputs are based on the perceptions of nationalists, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland or Independents.  What is missing is the unionist position on all of this.  I accept that is in the Good Friday Agreement, and I am all for it, but unless we get the unionists to engage with this process and with the Good Friday Agreement as it stands and unless all of us iron out all the existing difficulties, the proposal for a referendum could lead to instability and deep resentment from one community towards another.  In some respects the debate is missing the unionists' strong input on this issue.  I do not expect the witnesses to comment on that because they are talking about the nuts and bolts of the referendum but my view is that there are increasing signs that some unionists, even moderate unionists, are looking the other way and that their willingness to engage, even under the Good Friday Agreement, is being affected.  We need new leadership and a new view from the Irish Government, and the British Government also, to try to put this process into a clear space while allowing time for change and understanding.  Do any of the witnesses have a view on that?</p></speech>

That is a very good point.  It relates to the question about a citizens' assembly.  We have seen even moderate unionists, as the Chairman said, having very intense preferences.</p><p>It is where British-Irish co-operation has been essential in framing decisions and incentivising having a strategy.  That kind of coherence has been missing for various reasons, including the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference meeting.  I know that it is not popular with unionists.  We do stress the necessity of that co-operation in creating more engagement, a kind of strategic approach and security umbrella.  We are very aware of the issue.  My personal research would be very much on the need for the British-Irish strength of that relationship to encourage unionist engagement.</p></speech>

We should not mistake the DUP as being the monolith of all unionism.  The DUP might not be engaged on this issue at this point in time.  It must be remembered, however, that it said many things would not happen.  It would never be in government with Sinn F&eacute;in.  There would never be a devolution of police and justice powers.  We have heard never, never for a long time.  That is not to say the DUP will not be saying it in the future.</p> <p>  We have seen civic unionism engage on platforms provided by organisations such as Ireland's Future and F&eacute;ile an Phobail.  We have seen energetic and enthusiastic discussions about this issue.  We have seen even articles from people like Peter Robinson about the issue where he has referred to people not being referendum deniers.</p> <p>  The other issue we need to be careful with and conscious of is that, while this committee is important with a key role to play and at which I want unionist representation, we are not the forum for which we are advocating.  We need to understand when that forum is created and that space is provided, of course, unionists and people from a civic unionist background will gravitate towards it because they have a key stake and role to play.</p> <p>  I wish our colleagues in the DUP were on this committee.  We should not misunderstand their abstentionism from this committee as unionism's abstention from this debate.  That is not an accurate reflection of what is happening.  Going forward on this issue, we need to engage more with civic unionism and the people who are advocating around this issue.  We need to help provide a platform for those who want to be part of the debate.  We should not say that, because the DUP will not engage with this committee, therefore unionism will not engage with whatever mechanism or forum is established for this issue going forward.</p></speech>

If both Governments are at opposites and there is no agreement on putting that question to the people, then we are in a difficult place.  We want to see that everybody will be comfortable with a referendum being held at that time.  As a practising politician, I believe it would be ludicrous not to have the question put to the people on all of this island on the same day.</p> <p>  The two words "stability" and "inclusivity" were mentioned by Dr. Tannam, which is extremely important.  She also made the point that leading up to a referendum, we need the Irish and British Governments to work more closely through the different institutional arrangements in place.  The political architecture is there for this, along with more North-South co-operation.</p> <p>  I have often argued that a necessary component in preparing for a referendum would be maximising the existing potential of the Good Friday Agreement which has not been done at the present time.  For the benefit of all the people on this island, using all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement is an essential preparation for the holding of a referendum.</p></speech>

I also concur with Colum Eastwood's point about the Irish Government having a plan.</p> <p>  It must not be forgotten that all political sides and parties need to put their shoulder to the wheel, particularly in Northern Ireland.  We are talking about preparing.  The English Government is or is not going to prepare the ground and everything is going to be hunky-dory.  This is much bigger and wider than that.  We all need to play our part.  There is an air that 50% plus 1 is good enough.  It is not good enough.  The Good Friday Agreement was passed by over 70% in Northern Ireland.  We need to aim at that, even beyond that.  That is attainable if we all approach this in the same way we approached the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  Professor Colin Harvey has taken a report with the committee over two sessions.  There was no reference to the unionist community.  Going back to my first question, there is a minority in Northern Ireland who are not at the table.  What process would give us a fair view of the unionist position on a united Ireland and moving forward on our shared future?</p></speech>

I cannot.  Members should not in any way think of me as a substitute for actually talking with unionists.</p> <p>  The point made by Senator Blaney is absolutely critical.  Indeed, it has been made by several other speakers today.  Of course there needs to be unionist engagement.  The question he is putting is how to ensure it will happen.  We had a little bit of a taste of it when we were genuinely and extensively engaging with unionist opinion in preparing this report.  There was engagement with what might loosely be called civic unionism.  It was an uphill struggle, however.  We need to be clear about that.</p> <p>  From a unionist point of view, there is a sensible and strategic decision being made not to engage because there is nothing from the unionist point of view to be gained from it.  One may like it or not but it is a strategic decision which is not unreasonable from the unionist point of view.  It seems to me unlikely that unionists, certainly as a political group, are going to engage if there is going to be a referendum that will succeed in establishing unity.  I am not sure why it might be in their interests to do that at the moment.</p> <p>  Theoretically, I see and agree with the point being made that any sensible community will want to anticipate potential development and try to structure it in a way that would be beneficial for it.</p><p>A sensible community is going to want to anticipate a potential development and try to structure it in a way that is going to be beneficial for them.  At the moment, that does not seem a likely thing to happen so we come back to the question about planning and who is going to plan.  One of the other themes of today's discussion is the need for engagement beyond governments as well as by governments.  We know, in the run up to the Good Friday Agreement that there was a lot of proxy discussions going on in various different forums, discussions that took place that could not have happened between governments, at least formally.  So there is an opportunity, it seems to me, for a much more expansive civic engagement where the discussions actually take place in communities, organisations and institutions right across the island, and, indeed, to be honest, between east and west as well because the absence of discussion in the rest of the United Kingdom is as worrying as the absence of unionist discussion.  I say that because the opinion formers in the rest of the United Kingdom are going to be critical to this as well.</p><p> Coming back to a point made earlier by a Senator about the role of parliamentary institutions, yes, of course, but parliamentary institutions as well as every other institution that has an interest in this should be engaging at the moment.  It seems to me that governments do not have to lead on this.  The point that we made quite firmly in the report is that a lot of discussion has to take place well before governments are going to be formally involved or formally planning.  That can happen today and does not need a government lead.   </p></speech>

It is a point that relates to his first set of questions that we failed to answer.  Senator Blaney asked us to flesh out what we had said about the alternative ways of running the referendums.  We see two ways of doing so.  Either one holds the referendums late in the process once a plan for a united Ireland has been developed or holds the referendum earlier in the process when one has an agreed process by which a united Ireland would be designed but on which that work has not been done yet.</p> <p>  The first of those options, having the referendum late in the process, is in one sense clearly preferable in that it allows voters to make more of an informed choice.  It allows voters to know exactly what they are getting if they vote for a united Ireland.  On the other hand, as Professor McCrudden suggested, we find it difficult to see a scenario in which at least political unionism would engage on a large scale in the process of developing those plans for a united Ireland before a referendum took place while it was still possible to stop unification, in their eyes.  So that is, potentially, an advantage of having the alternative approach.  Then one has a process for working out the form of a united Ireland.  We see two ways in which one could do that.  Either one has the referendum and then one has unification on an interim arrangement and then one has a detailed process of constitutional design, or one has a referendum and then a process of constitutional design before the transfer of sovereignty, which takes place later.  These options become complex because in either scenario one would need to have some kind of interim version of a united Ireland, or one would need a default arrangement for a united Ireland if one fails to agree a new constitutional settlement.  They are complex but are, potentially, a mechanism for getting greater unionist engagement in the process of designing a united Ireland.</p></speech>

During the run up to any further discussion about a referendum on unity, someone is going to have to discuss what a unionist offer would be in the referendum.  Clearly, there is going to be a nationalist offer at some point of what a united Ireland would look like.  Equally, and this is going back to the experience in Scotland that Dr. Renwick knows more about than anyone else on the call, at one point in the Scottish referendum there was a sustained attempt at constructing the unionist offer.  I am sure that the same thing will happen in the context of a unity referendum in Ireland.  There is certainly the opportunity, therefore, for unionist engagement, as it were, indirectly trying to formulate what a unionist offer would look like.  I suspect that that sort of discussion may already be taking place indirectly and among unionism in the rest of the United Kingdom, apart from Ulster unionists.

What came up conclusively in our discussions, if not exclusively, and it came up from Mary C. Murphy last week as well was whether reconciliation can happen simultaneously, preceding or not at all.  There are views that we cannot make judgments on in our report about that.</p> <p>  Professor McCrudden has said that if local people or groups on the ground want to go ahead then there is nothing stopping that and does not need governments.  I would think again that the whole human framework, which may not be in the report, would be that the intergovernmental aspect would provide that.  Engagement and reconciliation would be driven at that level.  We could not answer that question but there is a core divide between those who say that reconciliation can happen and we should first bring everyone along or it cannot happen until a referendum is held.</p></speech>

Their project is really beneficial and is already producing good and thought-provoking results.  Sometimes the practical questions are framed as being those typically asked by a party pooper, but in fact they are helping people to work through the details.  It is like that old thing of it being one thing for a candidate to knock a person's door and ask them whether they are going to vote, but when the candidate asks them how they will get to the polling station, it causes them to think into the future, which is worth doing.<br/><br/>I do not have many specific questions on the mechanics, because it is the third meeting in three or four weeks where we have discussed the mechanics.  The point has been well-made by other members in respect of the insufficient parallel engagement on the hearts and minds piece.  I am also in agreement with others who say that Northern political unionism is probably not going to engage practically at this point.  I disagree with that approach, in that I think that there is always something to be gained by engaging and shaping the future.  However, it is a perfectly rational political decision on its part not to engage.  I often say to people that if I was invited to take part in a convention on shaping the union in the 21st century, I would be lying if I said I would be first in the queue to attend.<br/><br/>I wish to pick up on the latest couple of points raised.  Dr. Renwick raised the issue of political unionism not engaging.  I am wondering to what extent the conversation that is happening more widely in the UK about the union is thinking about Northern Ireland.  By that, I mean that the issue of the union is no longer really even in our hands.  Gordon Brown is doing his report on a potential federal UK and Scottish independence is at least an each-way bet or is as likely as not to happen.  It is very possible that the<i>status quo </i>is not even going to be on the table for much longer in respect of changes that are happening and-or should happen within the union.  Do the witnesses have any sense or hint that Northern Irish unionism is engaging in that, or that some of that big thinking that is being done by people like Gordon Brown is considering how things could work in Northern Ireland?  Do the witnesses feel that it has somewhat written off Northern Ireland or is just not engaging in the detail of how some sort of new, modernised, federal UK could better accommodate the diversity and the specific circumstances of Northern Ireland?</p></speech>

It is not an issue that we cover in the report.  My impression is that on the whole, when politicians in Great Britain are thinking about the union, they are not thinking terribly much about Northern Ireland.  Primarily, they are thinking about how to keep Scotland in the union.  Certainly, Gordon Brown, who is a unionist Scot, cares deeply about Scotland remaining in the UK.  That is the conversation that is happening.  I do not get the sense that there is terribly much thought going into Northern Ireland's future within the union.  I do not know if any of my colleagues want to disagree with that or embellish it.</p></speech>

I will not comment overly because I did not hear what was said previously.  However, I wish to make two points.</p> <p>  First, I wish to commend all the academics who are with us today on their work.  I have had the pleasure of engaging with them in the preparation of the report.  It is a most worthy addition to the debate.  Beyond that, I want to stress something to which Ms Hanna also alluded.  Between last week's presentation by Professor Colin Harvey and Mr. Mark Bassett, BL, and this evening, we have largely scoped out the options at least in terms of the mechanics of how this can be taken forward.  The choices have not necessarily been made as to exactly what options are pursued, but they are fairly well scoped out.  The most important aspect now is for people to talk through the issues involved so that we have informed debate on the "what", not necessarily the "how" anything could be done, if that is where indeed people choose to go.  Obviously, it is a fluid situation with very different perspectives.  </p> <p>  Leading back towards our academic friends, I am conscious of the dilemma as to how they can get unionist engagement.  I am very much of the opinion that if there ever is to be a Border poll, the proposition needs to be clearly articulated at the time of that poll and not left hanging.  To do so would lead to a terrible state of affairs.  That then begs the question as to how to get unionism engaged on the proposition of a question.  There is a real onus or opportunity for academia and others to provide neutral forums for discussion of the issues, where there is no clear perceived biased outcome from those who are hosting the event.  It is more likely that at least civic unionists will gradually join that conversation if they can see that is a safe and neutral space for those discussions to happen.  I encourage UCL and others to consider how they can facilitate type of discussion, on a without-prejudice basis.</p></speech>

We are very clear that we do not have a view on whether there should be a referendum or what the outcome should be if there is a referendum.  We are certainly enthusiastic about continuing as participants in this conversation.  I am sure that my colleagues would say that same.</p></speech>

He will hardly get any disagreement with us on the necessity for academics to provide a helping hand at least in this kind of area.  One of the strengths of Northern Irish academic life is the engagement that academics have had in very practical problem-solving as well as more esoteric discussions.</p></speech>

Deputy Carroll MacNeill has written her question down, so I will read it.  After that, Senator Black can make her contribution, then I will leave it up to the witnesses to summarise.</p> <p>  Deputy Carroll MacNeill's question concerns nation building and state building.  Knowing what we know now after many failed and some successful examples of developing new polities around the world, incorporating minorities and other groups with representative disparities, how do we do that well?  Our concern is that we are failing to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is well-implemented, and that in addition, these unity discussions getting louder and louder risk pushing that further away as a possible outcome.</p></speech>

Somewhere, something has gone wrong in terms of unionists not engaging.  There is a sense that the word "alienation" is coming up a lot, which may have come up in the past.  It is key that the Good Friday Agreement is seen to work for everyone and to work robustly.</p><p>I emphasised intergovernmental relations but all strands of it working together are key.  We do not make that statement to make a distinction between me and the report, but our report is within the framework of the Good Friday Agreement.  There is a strong connection between it being seen to work for everyone and engaging with any constitutional issues.  I emphasise and echo the points made by some members of the committee.</p></speech>

This is where I probably will be extremely unpopular with members of the committee, particularly those from the South.  From the point of view of someone sitting in the North at least, there needs to be a real, serious discussion in the Republic about what changes the Republic is willing to contemplate were there to be unification.  We all know there will have to be some kinds of changes.  The question is what kinds of changes can be contemplated.  Should the flag or the national anthem be changed?  What is the status of Irish?  We have already seen discussion on how far should there be guaranteed unionist representation in a new Irish Cabinet etc.  All the kinds of issues that arose in the context of the Good Friday Agreement with regard to Northern Ireland will essentially have to be replicated in the southern context.  Speaking as somebody who is sitting in the North and comes to the South quite often, that discussion seems to be very rudimentary at the moment in the Republic.</p> <p>  The question of how to organise that discussion in a way which will be respectful of the different traditions in the island really remains to be thought about much more seriously than it is at the moment.  The Royal Irish Academy's Analysing and Researching Ireland North and South, ARINS, initiative, is a start in thinking about these things.  Taking up Mr. Farry's point, there are academic forums in which these discussions can take place, but they remain pretty rudimentary at the moment.</p></speech>

I hear and understand the concerns about the lack of unionist voices, especially in this committee.  I understand, politically, why that is, but I am also very aware that I have spoken to many unionists, particularly from civic society, who want to have this conversation.  Mr. Ian Marshall was a Member of the last Seanad and is a wonderful spokesperson for unionism.  I again nominated him for the Seanad election and he will, it is hoped, get elected.</p> <p>  I have spoken to many unionists.  I remember attending the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in Belfast at which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, spoke, and a unionist sitting on a panel at that event said nobody had talked to him about what a new Ireland would look like even though he was open to the conversation.  I know there are unionists, all from civic society, who want to come in and talk to this committee.  Since I work in another area, I have worked with unionists from civic society in Belfast as part of my charity work.  Unionists want to have a conversation.  They want to know what health, education and housing will look like in a new Ireland.  These are the questions they want to know about.</p> <p>  I know many of the voices the witnesses have talked about are from political unionism, but it would be great if we could bring in more unionists from civic society to talk about what it is like for them.  Ian Marshall is one of those people.  He is a wonderful man and I have heard him speak many times on behalf of the unionist voice.  I wanted to make that comment.  I agree we need to bring more unionist voices to our committee, in particular.  However, maybe we could look at bringing in more unionists from civic society just to hear what their thinking is and, particularly, what their fears are.  That is very important.</p></speech>

Indeed, when we have spoken to people from the unionist community, we have often heard it said that talk of unionism not engaging is rather offensive.  A judgement is being made on unionists for not participating in a particular conversation defined by some parts of the community, whereas there are other forms of conversation in which, perhaps, many members of the unionist community would be very happy to participate.</p> <p>  It goes back to the point made by Senator Blaney and others in the course of this conversation that finding ways of having conversations about the constitutional future that are not necessarily teleological in supposing a particular outcome might assist in the process of bringing in all voices.  In this particular project, we have focused on the process involved in referendums on the unification question and, in a sense, on a particular possible constitutional future for Northern Ireland and Ireland as a whole.  Clearly, there are other possible constitutional futures as well and in doing this project we have not sought to make any judgement among those different possible constitutional futures.</p> <p>  The key point we want to reiterate in this project is that the process involved in referendums on this question will be complex.  There is no perfect process that does not create problems of some kind along the way.  Understanding that process and thinking very clearly about how to do it in the best possible way that allows people to make an informed choice, allows an inclusive discussion and maintains stability is a fundamentally important thing.  We are very grateful to the committee for engaging with us for two whole hours on exactly those questions.  We look forward to continuing these conversations in the future.</p></speech>

I give notice to members of that and I wish them good luck.  We have one matter of business to address before I call the witnesses to present to the committee.  Apologies have been received from Senator Annie Hoey.  Can I take it that the draft minutes of the meetings, public and private, of Tuesday, 23 March are agreed and that there are no matters arising?  Agreed.</p></speech>

They will provide us with a briefing on the operation of the medical card scheme.  From the Department of Health we have Ms Celeste O'Callaghan, director of model of care policy, primary care policy and eligibility policy, Ms Emma-Jane Morgan, principal officer, eligibility policy unit, Mr. David Noonan, principal officer, GP services and General Medical Services, GMS, contract unit, Mr. Finian Judge, principal officer, community pharmacy, dental, optical and aural policy unit, and Dr. Dympna Kavanagh, chief dental officer; and from the HSE, Mr. Joe Ryan, national director of national services, Mr. Shaun Flanagan, assistant national director, primary care reimbursement service, Dr. Joe Green, national oral health lead in the operations unit, and Ms Kate Halliwell, head of eligibility, national medical card unit.</p> <p>  Before we hear the opening statements, I point out to the witnesses there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege applies to evidence given from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  If, therefore, witnesses are directed by me to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  I invite Ms O'Callaghan to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.919" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Celeste O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021033000002#A00500"><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to update the committee on the medical card scheme.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Emma-Jane Morgan, principal officer, eligibility policy unit, Mr. David Noonan, principal officer, GP services, Mr. Finian Judge, principal officer, community pharmacy, dental, optical and aural policy unit, and Dr. Dympna Kavanagh, chief dental officer.</p> <p>  Eligibility for health services is determined in accordance with the 1970 Health Act.  The Act provides that if an individual who is ordinarily resident in Ireland is deemed unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP medical and surgical services for him or herself and his or her dependants, that individual is considered to have full eligibility and receives a medical card as evidence of that.  Guidelines are in place relating to the income level at which undue hardship would be expected to arise.  People whose income is assessed by the HSE as being at or below the thresholds receive a medical card.  This system of financial means assessment is considered to offer an objective and equitable approach to determining eligibility, ensuring those with the lowest level of means in society can access healthcare when needed.  More than 1.5 million people currently hold medical cards and the vast majority of these are awarded on the basis of a financial means assessment.  However, it is recognised that only looking at a person's income level might not provide a full picture of hardship, so where a person's income might be above the thresholds, if there is a significant cost or burden associated with his or her illness, that person may be awarded a discretionary medical card on the basis of undue hardship.</p> <p>  The provision of medical cards for those who are at the end of life is a particular situation where cards are provided on a discretionary basis.  Until recently, these cards were provided for individuals who were considered to have a prognosis of up to a year.  A clinical advisory group was established by the HSE in 2019 at the request of the Minister to consider the issues arising in extending medical cards for those with a terminal illness.  The report was published in November last year.  The group included both clinicians and patient representatives, and its report made a number of findings and recommendations.  In particular it affirmed that patients in the last 12 months of life are likely to have significant medical needs and to face undue hardship if they do not have a medical card.  It also found that patients with a longer prognosis may have medical needs, but those needs might not be at a level that would satisfy the legal test of undue hardship.  It identified that estimating a prognosis is challenging and becomes more accurate when an individual's expected timeframe is, sadly, shorter.  The report also recommended that if the current prognosis timeframe were to be extended, it should be undertaken on the basis of legislative change rather than via the current discretionary process, but it also found, however, that developing a definition for that purpose would be challenging.  Following on from the report and related Government decisions, the Department is working on the development of legislation to underpin that extension but in the interim an administrative extension to award medical cards to people with a prognosis of 24 months or less has been implemented this month.</p> <p>  Legislation was enacted in 2020 to extend free GP care to children up to the age of 12.  In terms of considering a date for commencement of the measure, it is important as always to ensure that an expansion of free GP care does not limit the capacity of general practice to meet the needs of all patients in the community.  That is particularly important at this time given the impact of the pandemic in terms of increased demand on GPs.  For that reason, a suitable commencement date remains under consideration.</p> <p>  The Health Act 1970 requires the HSE to make dental treatment and dental appliances available for medical cardholders.  These services are provided under the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, by independent private dentists contracted by the HSE.  The Minister has acknowledged that the DTSS has not kept pace with today's preventative approach to dental intervention and he is committed to a root-and-branch review of the scheme.  A new national oral health policy was launched in 2019 and provides the policy context within which a review of the DTSS would be undertaken.  However, the pandemic and the immense disruption it caused to the work of the health services and of the Department of Health has caused the roll-out of that policy to be delayed and the proposed contract review to be deferred.  The Minister has acknowledged the challenges that contracted dentists have faced during the pandemic and the efforts of the dental community in continuing to provide services in a challenging environment.</p><p>He accepts that the profession has concerns about the current contract and is keen to ensure the sustainability and viability of contractual arrangements in order that all eligible persons can continue to receive the services to which they are entitled from their local dentists.</p><p> In conclusion, overall, the range of measures in place, including those that have been introduced in recent years to expand access to medical cards and GP care, means that today, 2.1 million people, or just over 42% of the population, have access to free GP care.  While every effort is made to ensure the medical card system is responsive to those who need it most, as challenges arise, and they do, the Department will continue to work in collaboration with the HSE to address these.</p><p> I thank the committee.  I am happy to address any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I call Mr. Ryan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.922" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021033000002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to discuss the operation of the medical card scheme.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Shaun Flanagan, assistant national director of the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, Dr. Joseph Green, assistant national director and national oral health lead in HSE operations, and Ms Kate Halliwell, head of our national medical card unit in PCRS.</p> <p>  The PCRS is responsible for ensuring that eligibility is in place for qualifying persons for primary care schemes such as the general medical services scheme, the drugs payment scheme, the long-term illness scheme, the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, and other schemes and arrangements.  These schemes and reimbursement arrangements are essential to the operation of the health service.</p> <p>  PCRS is also responsible for making payments to primary care contractors, suppliers of essential high-tech medicines and acute hospitals and others across a range of schemes and arrangements.  The proportion of the HSE&rsquo;s budget for 2021 that PCRS is responsible for amounts to &euro;3.269 billion.  We constantly focus on patient and service user experience in using the services of PCRS.  It works hard to make the best use of its resources, and as a result, its administration costs represent less than 1.5% of all costs over the past decade.</p> <p>  The past 12 months have been unprecedented and Covid-19 has had major impacts across all sectors of society.  It is important to reference the challenges that Covid-19 has presented to the primary care reimbursement service and the efforts made to address those challenges.</p> <p>  Throughout the pandemic, PCRS has ensured that all necessary eligibility and reimbursement systems to underpin the arrangements for existing health services are in place and has sustained its performance in meeting key performance indicators.  Important new Covid-19 services, negotiated with and provided by our primary care contractors, have been put in place in a timely manner to enable key elements of the overall HSE Covid-19 response.</p> <p>  The staff of HSE PCRS have responded admirably throughout the pandemic to new needs and new work streams.  PCRS staff were called upon and responded to multiple other Covid-19 initiatives in support of colleagues.  This included the national ambulance service testing of patients and staff in nursing homes, co-ordinating the booking of Covid-19 vaccinations for GPs and their staff and providing pharmacy support to mass vaccination clinics.</p> <p>  Over the past 12 months, applications for new medical cards or new GP visit cards have remained reasonably consistent with historical patterns, with on average between 3,000 and 4,000 new applications being handled weekly.  In the early phases of the pandemic, while new applications continued to be processed, the HSE suspended reviews of existing cards.  This was because, first, PCRS staff were required to support multiple Covid-19 responses; second, PCRS wanted to reduce requests for GPs to complete the relevant sections of application forms; third, PCRS needed to be in a position to process the then expected large numbers of applications, which did not develop due to the significant economic supports put in place by Government, for new medical cards; and, fourth, PCRS staff needed to support new reimbursement systems such as the GP Covid-19 supports.</p> <p>  Reviews of medical and GP visit cards recommenced for cards that were due to expire from 31 August 2020 onwards.  Of those cards, up to 80% of expiring cards have been automatically extended without requiring individuals to engage with the application process.  Cards which are reviewed are those which are risk-assessed as more likely to not meet eligibility criteria.</p> <p>  As at 28 February 2021, 1,579,589 individuals held medical cards.  This has increased from 1,544,374 medical cards on 1 January 2020.  Some 531,121 individuals hold GP visit cards now compared to 524,494 individuals on 1 January 2020.</p> <p>  The PCRS is responsible for making payments to healthcare professionals such as general practitioners, dentists and pharmacists, for free or reduced cost services provided to the public.  In 2020, PCRS received in excess of 80 million reimbursement claims from more than 7,000 contractors.</p> <p>  With regard to terminal illness cards, on 9 February, the Government decided to extend provision of medical cards to individuals with a terminal illness who have a prognosis of 24 months or less and have been certified by their treating consultant.  It asked that the HSE put this in place as soon as possible.  The card will be awarded to the individual for his or her lifetime and will not require a means assessment, nor will the card be reviewed.</p> <p>  Adult medical card holders have access to dental services under the DTSS through care provided by private dentists that hold DTSS contracts with the HSE.  Medical card holders can choose which dentist they wish to attend.  In a typical year, just over 30% of the eligible population receive treatment through the DTSS.  In 2020, this level dropped to 22.4%, mostly due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Some 1,084,321 claims were received under the scheme in 2019, resulting in expenditure of more than &euro;56 million.  In 2020, 789,940 claims were received at a cost of &euro;40.57 million.</p> <p>  An electronic claims system was introduced in late 2017.  Currently, 67% of contractors claim online, with 74% of treatment items under the DTSS now claimed electronically.  The HSE is aware that some medical card holders have experienced difficulties in accessing treatment under the DTSS.  Wherever this is made known to the HSE, each inquiry and representation is followed up by local community services which seek to assist medical card holders.  As well as assisting medical card holders, the executive is working closely with the Department of Health on the operation of the scheme and difficulty faced by some patients.  The executive liaises with the Department on a regular basis.  This concludes my opening statement.</p></speech>

I welcome all our witnesses this morning.  In the first instance, I thank them for the work they have done during Covid-19, but also the work they do in general and for their response to our representations, which I find to be very efficient.  My team also finds that the staff on the Oireachtas hotline are very helpful.  I want to put that on the record.</p> <p>  As a starting point, do the witnesses have information on the 1.5 million plus medical cards?  How many of those medical cards are active and how many are inactive?  They might only be used perhaps once or twice a year compared to others that are used on a regular basis.  Do the witnesses have any percentage breakdown on the activity within that cohort of medical card holders?</p></speech>

I have had a concern for a long time that a percentage of people have medical cards in their possession simply because they are used as a criterion for accessing other services such as school bus transport.</p><p>I have been concerned that the number of medical cards is inflated to some degree because of that requirement.  I think that a medical card should specifically be for medical purposes.  I will move on because I have made that point.  Will the witnesses make those figures available, because we would be interested in developing that body of work?</p><p> I have spoken to John Wall about end-of-life care, as I am sure have many of my colleagues, on many occasions.  I welcome that the process in that area has begun.  We are talking about 24 months.  How many of those end-of-life medical cards have been issued to date?</p></speech>

We have received less than ten applications at this point but the system has only been in place since 12 March.  We would all have to be aware that hospitals have been especially busy over the last quarter with Covid activity.  As the hospital system is trying to catch up with that, I expect that number will grow significantly over the next while.</p></speech>

We had previously done an exercise in 2020 about the number of cards that had been issued.  At the end of 2020, 1,883 cards were in existence.  There were an additional 1,683 individuals who had unfortunately died with an end-of-life card.  Our estimate is that approximately 3,500 cards were issued during 2020.  The average time for which a person holds one of those cards is 7.7 months.</p></speech>

We have commenced work on the legislation.  That followed on from the publication of the report in November and the decision by the Government to proceed with this approach.  We are currently in the preliminary analysis phase.  We are doing a couple of strands of analysis to underpin the development of options relating to the legislation.  The clinical advisory group report set out some of the challenges that are likely to arise when we are trying to legislate for something like this.  In particular, there are challenges around defining what a terminal illness is.  That is one area that we are examining in order to do the preliminary analysis.  We are at that stage with the legislation.</p></speech>

The Senator might allow us to be imprecise about that, given there will be other challenges across other Departments and with the Office of the Attorney General with regard to developing legislation, a schedule into which we will have to fit somewhere.  If we had to estimate, however, we would say it will happen in the autumn legislative session.  We do not anticipate that we will have heads before the summer recess.</p></speech>

I do not think that we have had a situation like that yet.  One aspect of this of which we are conscious is that it is a new scheme and works on an administrative basis.  There are challenges around areas such as making a prognosis.  It was flagged clearly in the report of the clinical advisory group that it is not a precise science and it is a clinical judgment at a point in time.  What we would expect is that over the coming months, while the new administrative scheme is in place, there will be lessons about some of those issues and these can be examined and incorporated into the work we are doing to develop the legislation.</p></speech>

I am only looking for data and do not want three or four people to answer the same question.  The expansion of eligibility for a terminal illness card to where there is a prognosis of 24 months or less has commenced on an administrative basis.  We will have to wait for the legislation in the autumn.  If it is in place, what is the anticipated number of additional cards expected on a full-year basis as a consequence of the change?</p></speech>

It was work that the clinical advisory group tried to do but it was not able to provide a robust estimate.  This comes down to the challenge of prognostication: the longer the period of life that one is trying to estimate, the wider the confidence intervals.  For the 12 months we award some 3,500 cards in respect of that cohort, so one must assume it would be 3,500 when it gets up to full speed.  This is a plus, and it would probably be a bit more than that due to the wider confidence intervals.</p></speech>

The problem I have with Mr. Ryan's opening statement and the response I have received so far is that it puts it back onto the individual medical card holder.  What the Irish Dental Association has said is a world apart from what Mr. Ryan stated earlier.  The association has said the treatment scheme for medical card holders is in an unprecedented crisis and a full-blown resourcing crisis.  It used the words "complete chaos" and described it as a service on "the brink of collapse".  This is what the Irish Dental Association has stated.  Record numbers of dentists are dropping out of the scheme.  Is this Dr. Green's experience with regard to what the Irish Dental Association is saying?

That reduction was significant.  The Irish Dental Association also said that some of the contracts are what it would call "inactive".  I have received many representations from patients who are medical card holders and who have had difficulties in this area.  It was characterised in the opening statement as some patients experiencing difficulties, and then put it back on the patients themselves to contact the HSE.  That is not the problem.  The problem is systemic and it goes back to the resourcing of the contract.  That is the problem.  It needs to be dealt with.  The Irish Dental Association is saying that we are facing an unprecedented crisis - a full-blown resourcing crisis - and that there is a real difficulty with this scheme.</p></speech>

We have been working with the Department to try to address the difficulties patients are experiencing.

The issues with this scheme are long-standing.  The crises that I have been hearing about in respect of public dentistry, orthodontic waiting lists, medical card holders' access to the scheme and the resourcing of the scheme are long-standing.  A recognition by the Minister in the Department's opening statement does not cut it.  We need a resolution in the same way that we need a resolution on the engagement with the IMO on expanding medical card eligibility, for which we democratically voted in the Oireachtas.  There does not seem to be an urgency around reviewing this scheme.   I ask again, through the Chair, that we write to the Minister for Health and state that we need urgent negotiation with the Irish Dental Association in order to resolve this issue.  It is unacceptable that public patients are not getting treatment they need or access to a service because the scheme is not fit for purpose.  I do not hear an urgency coming from the HSE or the Department.  I ask again that the members present at this meeting agree - we can discuss the matter later in private session - to write to the Minister to express concern for the operation of this scheme.</p></speech>

We can deal with that in private session.</p> <p>  It is the early stages of this medical card and I acknowledge we are early in the process of formulating the legislation but cards have been given on that basis.

If a treating consultant certifies that it is 24 months, we will accept that is his or her expert opinion.</p></speech>

Individuals can receive second opinions but it is not a part of the system as it has been built.  Against that, in terms of a treating consultant, whether it is a first or second opinion, the HSE will not get into a dispute with consultants on that basis.</p></speech>

There is a five-page form, and there is one section where he or she certifies that the person has a prognosis of 24 months or less.  The consultant provides very brief information to the HSE on the diagnosis and the disease.  That is more so that we can understand the groups who are accessing, and are able to access, the terminal card, in case we are missing a group.  We do not take detailed clinical information from the consultant.</p></speech>

I refer to medical cards for life-limiting conditions.  It is very welcome that the clinical advisory group recommended that those with 24 months or less would have access to medical cards.  I also commend John Wall who has campaigned on this tirelessly for years.  He has done amazing work for those who find themselves in this situation.  I spoke to John yesterday about any questions I should ask today.  He said that when anyone gets a prognosis, it is very traumatic.  He said the process is very good to get access to the card.  He said it usually takes less than 36 hours, so that is good.  The last two programmes for Government stipulated that those who have a terminal illness should have access to a medical card, without a time limit on their prognosis, without a means test as it is a very arduous process.  Is there any scope to expand it without a time limit in future?</p></speech>

At the moment, that is the basis on which we are working to develop the legislation.  On the difficulties of making a prognosis, the clinical advisory group was clear that as one moves further out and as a person is likely to live longer, making a prognosis becomes more challenging.  I am not a clinician but we are mindful that there is a crossover space between terminal illness and chronic disease which needs to be thought about.  As we are developing the legislation, we will look at all those issues to try to come up with a definition and an implementable model.  Within that context, we will inevitably acquire more information about what issues or challenges might arise if a decision was made by government in the future to go beyond the 24 months.</p></speech>

I am not sure if anybody can answer it, but hopefully somebody can.  It relates to those who have been granted a ministerial licence for medical cannabis products.  My experience from working with families trying to reimburse under ministerial licences has been extremely arbitrary and bureaucratic.  This has put families in a very difficult position in which some of them could not access reimbursements and, in one case, the family had to look at selling their home.  The situation is far from ideal.  The news that the medical cannabis programme will be up and running in the summer is welcome.  My experience and that of other families of getting reimbursement under the primary care reimbursement service has been haphazard.  Will the witnesses clarify why, in some cases, it takes up to nine months to get reimbursement for a medicine that works for children and why it is so difficult?  Meeting the criteria places a financial burden on families.</p></speech>

We will look to have that finalised and in place.  Regarding products sourced under licence, it is a slightly more complex arrangement and I ask Mr. Flanagan to describe that.</p></speech>

On that basis, the system fits in with the treatment abroad scheme.  As I understand it, applications have to be made by the clinician responsible for the care and, once received, the HSE tries to process them in as timely a fashion as possible.  There may be occasions where individual pieces of information are missing, which delays a decision.  There have been parliamentary queries on this which have been responded to in the last week or two.  As it is in the treatment abroad scheme, I am not 100% up to date on the licensing part of it.  The medical cannabis access programme will be run by the primary care reimbursement service.  That is what we are busy planning at the moment.</p></speech>

A couple of issues come to mind which I have had to deal with recently.  The first relates to discretionary medical cards and the medical cards issued on the basis of life-threatening illness.  I would have thought that, during the course of Covid, those who were about to lose their medical card or have it reviewed and who had obtained the card based on a diagnosis would have had a medical card reissued to them almost automatically because of the danger of causing stress and anxiety to them and their families at a critical time.  I have had some difficulty in that area.  We managed to resolve it but it took some time.  Is it possible, at this stage, to devise a system that is more conscious of the needs of the families affected by such a serious illness, including spouses and siblings, and to ask those who have the means of doing so if they can in some way alleviate the impact on those people at a vulnerable time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1009" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021033000002#F00700"><p>End-of-life medical cards are not reviewed for the lifetime of the patient once they are issued.  Under the existing 12-month arrangement for emergency cards, where those are issued to people with terminal conditions, they are not reviewed either.  We suspended reviews of medical card at the start of the pandemic, which was around this time last year.  They were resumed at the end of August but in any month between 65% and 80% of cards would not require any further application process and would be automatically extended.  We risk-assess cards where they are unlikely to meet that threshold and we have to go through an application process with people in that regard.  To be clear, end-of-life cards are provided on the basis of end of life.  In relation to medical cards, they are provided on the basis of the person's means and residential status.</p></speech>

Where we are aware that a medical diagnosis has driven the award of a medical card, we have not reviewed those cards.  On occasion, people can have a diagnosis but may have secured a medical card on the basis of means and maybe it is in such scenarios that this issue has emerged.  We only know when a person has a particular diagnosis if that formed part of a previous application.  There may be scenarios where someone got the card on the basis of means but then-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1011" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021033000002#F00900"><p>The problem I am concerned with is the emphasis on a number of occasions on the reference to end of life.  My response to that is that people who have a life-threatening diagnosis have enough to be worried about without trying to determine whether they can get a letter from somebody to say they have two or three months to live, or whatever the case may be.  They are suffering enough already.  I presume the services would be sufficiently sympathetic to their position to take on board what has been said to them in good faith, knowing there will be some other time for review in any event.  I would like much more emphasis placed on that part, in other words, on sympathy with the patient who has a serious problem on his or her hands.</p><p> Another issue that has come up on a few occasions recently concerns an application for a medical card from a person whose income is over the limit but who has a serious diagnosis.  A letter from the GP is not sufficient.  It has to be a letter from the consultant.  Due to the general data protection regulation, GDPR, the consultant will not send the letter to the advocate.  Incidentally, all public representatives are advocates and we should not forget that.  Our job is advocating on behalf of our communities, and we are not always wrong.  The point at issue is that after much toing and froing, with a lot of stress on the patient, the spouse had to go to the consultant to get the letter.  Otherwise, it was going to go into the mix and might not come out of the system for five or six weeks.  Five or six weeks is a long time to somebody who is in pain and concerned about their health and their financial position.  I would like to see more sympathetic processing of medical cards in those particular instances.</p><p> Regarding the points raised by a number of speakers, generally speaking, the health services are supposed to respond to the needs of the people as and when the needs arise.  Ninety per cent of the time members of the public do not have to rely on the health services but when they do, they anticipate a sympathetic response.  I repeat the words "sympathetic response" again and again.  If they do not get that they feel ignored.  To be ignored at any time is a serious issue.  To be ignored at a time of health-related stress and pain is a very serious issue.</p><p> Deputy Cullinane raised a question about orthodontic treatment.  The position has not changed one bit in the past 20 years.  The system has avoided the issue when it should have been simple to refer children for treatment at an early age.  Instead of creating two or three categories, in one of which they will never receive treatment, and pushing as many people as possible into that particular category, we should be doing it in a different way.  We should deal with the cases on the basis of their necessity and severity and not presume that they will be all right in any event.</p><p> The new reimbursement system and the authorisation of new and orphan drugs has been an issue for a long time, continues to be an issue and will remain an issue.  I appreciate the fact that drug companies should not be allowed to charge what they wish.  That has to be dealt with at a different level but we need to be mindful of the need to respond to the particular drugs that are required by the patients and prescribed by a medical doctor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1013" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021033000002#G00200"><p>I might respond to a couple of those points.  With regard to the diagnosis and the consultant not sharing the data with an advocate, the Deputy referred to public representatives.  As Deputies and Senators are covered under the GDPR and the Data Protection Act, a consultant should be in a position to seek those data once the permission of the patient has been given to that particular person.  We would be more than happy to deal with any specific incidents on a case-by-case basis as they arise.</p> <p>  In terms of responding sympathetically, we try to be sympathetic with everybody.  That is part of the way in which we are trying to drive the culture of the HSE.  Part of the transformation of the health services is about ensuring that we have a caring and considerate approach to everybody.  When we fail in that, we are particularly keen to know about that and to try to address it.  Everybody in the HSE goes to work every day with the best of intentions to give the best service they possibly can to the patients and citizens of the country.</p> <p>  In terms of new and orphan drugs, in the letter of determination in the service plan this year we have &euro;50 million allocated for new drugs.  So far this year, in the order of 25 to 28 new drugs have been approved and there are more to be considered.  There is a long list of new drugs that are always coming up and we have to assess them rigorously for all the elements of value in terms of their efficacy and the cost.  We have to strike that balance.  We have processes in place and we have our drugs group, as well as Dr. Barry and his team, who assist us in assessing all new drugs.</p> <p>  With regard to the orthodontic treatment, I ask Dr. Green to give a short response on that.</p></speech>

With regard to the orthodontic question, I think the Deputy referred to the assessment system indirectly.  The type of cases that are up for treatment by the HSE are very complex cases.  The system we use, which is known as the modified index of treatment need, is an international grading system.  The two categories within that system that are offered treatment in the HSE are grade 4 and grade 5.  Typically, those cases would take at least two to three years to treat.  Orthodontic treatment is not a single episode of care.  As well as the active treatment, which as I said could take approximately two years, there would be at least another year in retention where the patient will be wearing retainers.  The patient is within the system for a lengthy period, usually during the teens.  There is huge demand on our services and the need that is being expressed has exceeded the capacity that has been available.</p> <p>  Over the past four years we have had a procurement arrangement in place where we have managed to place just under 2,000 patients with private service providers.  That recently expired and currently there is an invitation to tender in place through eTenders.  That will close in the next couple of weeks and we hope that the successful arrangement will start to allocate patients who are the longest waiting from the end of the second quarter or early in the third quarter.  Currently, the capacity of that system is uncertain because it will have to await the outcome of the tender response process.</p></speech>

Many of the questions being asked by members are questions that require political answers and it is unfair to take it out on some of the people today who are administering the schemes.  The decisions with regard to who gets a medical card or a GP visit card are essentially political ones and it is important to bear that in mind.  We are told that 42% of people have free GP care.  That leaves a very large number of people who do not have access to subsidised or free GP care.  It is important to bear in mind that we are very much an outlier in European terms in that the majority of people in the country have to pay to see a GP.  That does not make any sense from a health perspective, an equality perspective or anything like that.</p><p>We have a very long way to go in providing access to primary care.  It is also worth pointing out that if Sl&aacute;intecare had been implemented in the timescale it was supposed to be, there would now be access for the population to free or subsidised GP care.  We have a very long way to go and we must always keep that in mind.</p><p> What is the position with the increase in medical cards for people who are unemployed, given the huge increase in the unemployment rate over the past 15 months or so?  What number of people have come into the scheme?  There was a proposal where if people were unemployed for six months or more, they would retain their medical card when going back to employment.  Not many people have gone back to employment but is that still operating?  When is the review of the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, likely to take place?</p><p> I note what Ms O'Callaghan has said about the legislation with respect to the extension of medical cards to more children but my understanding is agreement had been reached with GPs in the context of an overall agreement with them last year taking in the reinstatement of pay by unwinding financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation and so on, as well as various practice supports.  Part of that agreement was that GP visit cards would be extended to children.  What is the exact problem with doing that and why have we not seen it happen?  What is the timeline for the permanent scheme to provide medical cards to people with terminal illnesses?  Has there been movement on the question of people who are over 70 having means assessed on the basis of gross income rather than net income, as it applies to people under 70?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the timing of legislation for providing medical cards to people with a terminal illness.  The administrative scheme has been put in place for an initial 12 months to allow time for the legislation to be developed.  We want to do a fairly robust analysis at the policy end as we develop the heads because it is a tricky area.  We do not anticipate producing the heads before the summer but we anticipate having them for the autumn session.  I suppose the period to allow this to pass through the Oireachtas depends on other factors, including the overall legislative schedule.</p></speech>

As she might recall, we launched a new Government-approved national oral health policy, Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte in 2019.  That policy was meant to provide the context for the review of the dental treatment services scheme.  It was always the intention that the scheme would be aligned with the policies, principles and goals outlined in that new policy approved by the Government.  As members know, the roll-out of that policy has, unfortunately, been delayed because of Covid-19.  The review of the scheme has also been postponed because particular personnel resources have been assigned elsewhere.</p> <p>  The Deputy would know from responses given to the House by the Minister that he is fully committed to the review and our intention is to commence it as soon as resources can be freed from Covid-19 work to allow us do significant preparatory work before we even sit down with the representative organisation about the review.  It is a scheme that goes back to the 1990s and we all accept it is very much out of date with the principles contained in the new policy.  There is much work to be done there and our intention is that as soon as resources are freed, we can begin that work.</p></speech>

A national clinical guideline group has been established and a chairperson has been appointed to look in particular at background to ensure when we are ready to do the review, we know what the packages will contain.  We will look at all the infrastructure and the appropriate management and guidelines for clinicians.  That time will not be wasted in future.  There are other aspects relating to the Dental Act etc. and they are ongoing in the background.</p></speech>

The back-to-work scheme is still in place.  The Deputy referenced the numbers and we expected when the Covid-19 pandemic started that there would be a massive increase in new applications for medical cards but that did not emerge.  One of the reasons we suspended reviews in the first few months of the pandemic was that we thought we would get a major influx of new applications for medical cards.  That has not emerged and I presume that must be down to the pandemic unemployment payments and maybe the age of the cohorts that are unemployed.  Perhaps they are not pulling on the health service.  The Deputy asked about assessment of means for those over 70.  There is a gross system for those over 70 but if an individual makes a net application, we will also look at that.</p></speech>

It did not have any detailed proposals or there certainly was not a specific agreement on how anything would be rolled out.  It was always the intention that whereas the 2019 agreement included a general commitment to move in that direction, implementing such a provision would require much detailed negotiation on how the service would be structured, the costings and so on.  What is in the agreement, as such, is not sufficient to deliver a service.</p></speech>

Regarding the review of medical cards, a letter is sent and in certain cases I have come across the individual does not respond.  The people involved might be elderly and if they do not have family or a carer keeping an eye out for post sometimes these letters go unanswered.  They are quite simple, asking whether the person's circumstances have changed and if the details correct.  Are these followed up with phone calls?  Very often in the cases I have dealt with, these people do not know they have lost their medical cards until they go to the pharmacist to get a prescription.</p><p> Why do those aged over 70 who want to be considered for a full medical card based on a medical, and who have already been granted a GP card, have to submit their financial details again even though they have already been submitted?  It is very stressful.</p><p> When we know someone is going to fail the financial test and is looking to get a discretionary card based on a medical is there a way to bypass the financial test when going through the process?</p><p> With regard to dental services, I am led to believe there has been a reduction of assessments in school settings over the past decade.  I am dealing with the case of an individual who has a rather severe underbite that was not picked up in primary school.  The person is now over 16 and does not qualify for care.  This means the parents will have to go private, which will place a huge strain on them.  Is there any way these cases can be looked at where issues were not picked up in earlier assessments?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1046" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Halliwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021033000002#J00300"><p>Generally speaking, what usually happens is we correspond with the individual during the review period.  We allow for a three month period prior to the card expiring.  At the end of the second month, the individuals receive a second piece of correspondence advising them the cards are due to expire and asking them to engage with us.  At present, we do not correspond over the phone with these individuals due to volume, as Mr. Ryan has said.  Generally, we review up to 15,000 cards a month so the capacity to undertake that role would be huge.  We could pull the figures on non-response rates for the committee because it seems quite low at present.  People are engaging with us.  We can provide a written submission if that would help.</p></speech>

Ms Halliwell said that non-response rate is quite low.  Could these individuals be followed up before the card is finally pulled to ask them whether they received the correspondence and if they need help in answering the questions?  Very often it is quite simple because circumstances have not changed and neither have the details, and it is just a case of signing the form and returning it.</p></speech>

We review a minority of the people whose cards expire and we are progressively trying to make it more and more sensitive.  We have tried to put in place a team that reaches out in difficult cases where people are not engaging or where there a lot of calls to our contact centre.  We have tried to put in place a team that reaches out to people, almost like a case manager if we want to put it like that.  We are always open to seeing whether we can improve.  We can look again at the phone calls to see whether there is a possibility of doing something if we are down to a very small number of non-responders.</p> <p>  I may not have fully understood the question with regard to those aged over 70 who apply for a full medical card when they already have a GP visit card.  If somebody gets a GP visit card because they are aged over 70 it is without a means test.  It is automatic eligibility.  We would probably not have a means test in this circumstance.  If somebody has been through a means test in the past it may be out of date if it had taken place a good number of months previously.  I may have misunderstood the question.</p></speech>

If there was a change in circumstance obviously the means test would recommence.  If there is a specific case where the Senator feels we have been awkward or inappropriate we would be quite happy to look at it to try to learn from any mistake we might make.  Generally we do not try to put people through multiple means tests if we can avoid it.  We try to be as efficient as we can.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about discretionary medical cards.  We must remember that the discretion relates to how we apply the means and financial thresholds.  It is not that we decide that individuals get a medical card purely on the basis of a disease.  The system is based on means.  We manage the means and look at people's expenses.  Then we look at their medical expenses.  As part of this process we use a burden of illness questionnaire to try to maximise or capture medical costs.  This is what the discretion relates to.  It relates to how we apply the financial thresholds, taking into account the costs of the disease and the challenges for the individual of paying for the treatment that arises out of it.  I hope this answers the question.</p></speech>

I want to deal with an aspect I am concerned about, which is orthodontic treatment for people aged under 18 in Cork.  We have a four to five year waiting list.  In fact, the most recent letter I received from the HSE was to the effect that the people being treated at present have been on the list since 2016.  Can someone give me an explanation as to why people who require orthodontic treatment in Kerry are referred to private practitioners under a scheme, and I am not sure which one, but in Cork we just leave people on a list?  Can people apply under the National Treatment Purchase Fund for orthodontic treatment?  If not, why not, particularly with this waiting time period?  Perhaps someone might clarify this issue for me please.</p></speech>

We do not have enough orthodontists employed in the public service to deal with it but there are people working in the private sector who could provide the service.

As I said, the plan is to start to allocate patients within three months.  It is the end of March now and we expect to begin allocating soon.  It will involve the longest-waiting patients, including those the Deputy mentioned who are waiting up to five years.  They will be the first to be allocated to service providers.  We need the tender response to go to plan and to have sufficient capacity available to allocate the patients to a service provider in their own locality, if possible.</p></speech>

One is that we have pulled all the hospitals together under a common procurement framework that allows them to work together to put the best possible arrangement in place nationally.  They still have the capacity to do things locally where they have their own local requirements.  Second, there has been excellent work delivered, even throughout the pandemic, by consultants in a number of hospitals in replacing some of the originator high-tech drugs with biosimilar drugs.  They are slightly different from generic drugs but the same principle applies that they tend to be less expensive.  That has driven much more competition in the market for those very complex drugs and significant savings have been made in this regard.  That is helping us to contribute to the cost of new drugs.</p></speech>

A large number of people travel to the North to access orthodontic treatment through that scheme.  It requires payment upfront before being reimbursed by the HSE.  Information on the scheme is available from the HSE's treatment abroad scheme, TAS, office.  I hope that is of use to the Deputy.</p></speech>

It is directing people to the treatment abroad scheme when this service could easily be provided under the NTPF.  I do not accept that we should be requiring people to travel long distances to access treatment.  This is especially the case with orthodontics, which usually does not involve once-off treatment but, rather, a series of treatments over a period of time.  I am absolutely appalled by the suggestion that people from Cork should travel to Northern Ireland for treatment.</p></speech>

A total of &euro;110 million has been released to the HSE for waiting list initiatives.  Our HSE colleagues can bid into that funding for such initiatives.  Separately, Sl&aacute;intecare, working with our colleagues, is looking at a considered approach with the NTPF, not just for acute services but also for community services, which would include the 17,000 people on the orthodontic waiting list.</p> <p>  A number of key points have emerged from the initiative so far.  Fifteen acute specialties have been looked at to date and the evidence that has emerged shows the numbers on the waiting list can be reduced by as much as 20%.  It is proposed that a very specific clinical assessment should be taken of cases to see what would give the most value.  That effort has just commenced and it involves a three-week, intensive approach.  A plan has to be produced at the end of it to provide clear guidelines for both acute and community services, including dental services, to bid in for that waiting list initiative.</p> <p>  The Department is liaising with the NTPF specifically around dental provision because there is concern that some of those services are not being considered by the NTPF, notwithstanding the services, such as dental extractions, that are taking place in public hospitals.  Thus far, the information the NTPF holds on dental services is that there are 3,363 surgery cases being dealt with under the fund.</p><p>There are 352 that have not been clarified<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>their condition but the Department is liaising with the NTPF to look at those figures and to expand on what is being recorded in the future.  As I said, that waiting list initiative is intended to extend to community services and &euro;110 million has been released for waiting list initiatives.</p></speech>

What we are looking for in Cork is  action.  We do not have orthodontists employed by the HSE so the HSE must consider alternatives but the response is not fast enough.  It is not good enough that I would have to go back to a parent today and say that I do not have any further information and there is a chance his or her child will still be on the waiting list in four years time.  That seems to be the answer I am getting today.</p></speech>

As with any public service, if a large proportion of people submitted applications as Gaeilge, we would probably be somewhat challenged but would do our best to respond.  Currently, the vast majority of people make their applications in English and on the basis of current patterns, we can manage and have sufficient capacity.  I do not have the exact number of Irish-language applications that we would have received in the last year.</p></speech>

A lot of Irish speakers who have the right to deal with the State in the Irish language are opting to fill out applications and have them processed in English because they fear that the capacity does not exist to process them quickly in Irish and that they will be held up.  I ask the witnesses to provide data on the numbers employed currently who would be able to process applications in Irish if so demanded.  If everybody who requested an application form in Irish went ahead and submitted their application in Irish, what kind of delays would we see?</p></speech>

Our intention would be that our key performance indicators would not change or would not be different for one scenario versus the other.  I absolutely accept that we should respond to that 100%.</p></speech>

Several members have expressed frustration this morning regarding access to services for medical card holders.  Earlier we heard about a crisis with regard to the number of dentists in the GMS.  Do we know exactly how many dentists have left the scheme?  What do patients of dentists who have left the scheme do?  Do they move to another dentist or do they contact the Department to alert them to the fact that their dentist is not operating under the scheme?  Do the witnesses have any advice for people who are in that situation who may be listening this morning?  A similar situation pertains with chiropodists, apparently.   We have been told that a lot of chiropodists are leaving the scheme.  Do we have exact numbers in that regard?</p> <p>  A number of years ago ease of access to medical cards depended on geographical location, for historic reasons.  Has that changed?  In 2014 an expert panel conducted a review of medical card eligibility under the GMS and made several recommendations.  Were those recommendations fully implemented?  </p> <p>  Another area of concern relates to medical cards for those who are terminally ill.  Thankfully, the number of such people making applications is low but is there a red-flag process or any way within the system of fast-tracking those applications?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021033000002#M00200"><p>I will answer the questions I am best placed to address.  On access to medical cards based on where one is in the country, we have put significant work into centralising the medical card process.  Equity is crucial and we do not want postcode lotteries to apply to access to healthcare.  All the applications are now handled centrally and supported by a proper appeals process.  We have taken away the notion, which was a reality some years ago, that where one was in the country determined how difficult it was to get a medical card.  When someone is entitled and eligible for a card, we make sure he or she gets it as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  A specific team is in place to handle applications for end of life and terminal illness cards in order that they do not get caught up.  We realise how important it is for somebody in that position not to be put through any unnecessary or undue stress.</p> <p>  I am not sure about the 2014 report.  I will refer to Mr. Flanagan on the implementation and recommendations of the report, as the PCRS predates me. </p></speech>

Crohn's disease, coeliac disease and asthma were referred to, as were older people and persons with mental health issues such as schizophrenia, and it was stated that medical card eligibility should be based on medical need rather than specific medical conditions.</p></speech>

The group came up with three reports on identifying and being more responsive to need.  One report assisted the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in designing a burden of illness questionnaire to maximise the capture of cost and challenges in relation to medicines.  The findings were addressed.</p> <p>  The Keane report also flagged that the means assessment worked grossly for many people but the need base had to be better managed.  The burden of illness questionnaire was a key change suggested but the clinical advisory group reported other changes to the HSE and the PCRS implemented most of the recommendations.  Some of the report was made up of commentary rather than recommendations.</p> <p>  I flag the emergency application system which the Chair is probably aware of.  It has a separate application form and is designed to fast-track individuals who urgently need a medical card and may not be in a position to submit a means test application.  In the scenario in which there is a clear, medically defined requirement for an urgent medical card, a healthcare professional makes the application on his or her behalf which sets out the need and provides a medical report.  We suspend the means test for six months.  The system is for documented issues in which there is a medical need for a card but the person cannot engage with the process.</p></speech>

One of the members quoted some figures on the number of active contracts.  In late 2017, there was an exercise to deal with inactive contracts and we are going through a similar exercise, with three CEOs yet to complete it.  There are approximately 100 additional inactive contracts which happens when a dentist moves on from a practice without letting the HSE know.  We are therefore not in a position to put an exit date against the contract.</p> <p>  We share the Chair's concern about frustration experienced by patients.  We do not want anyone to be left without an essential service and dental treatment is one such service.  We follow through on each concern made or representation raised with us.  If a patient makes a complaint about not being able to access a dentist, we follow through on that as well.  We assist medical card holders, when we can, with lists of available contractors.  Sometimes we must go beyond that and assist a vulnerable person with making contact with the dentist.</p> <p>  We operate the scheme within the parameters set out in the legislation and regulation that governs the scheme.  As I said, we work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Health on the operation of the scheme.  We are bringing the difficulties some medical card holders experience to their attention.</p> <p>  As our Department colleagues said, we expect to see a shift from a diagnosis and treatment approach to a preventative approach in a revised scheme.  We look forward to that.</p></speech>

On the GMS scheme and the contracts in place with GPs, as I am sure the HSE staff here are aware, due to the huge demands on GPs in rolling out Covid-19 vaccinations, many levels of healthcare cannot be provided for.  Most people understand and accept that.  That is a reality as mass vaccination is rolled out but I am concerned by a few scenarios I would consider essential.  Recently, the GP of a young man who had been accepted, in principle, to the Air Corps could not do the required final assessments as he or she was too busy.  Are the witnesses aware, as the administrative body for the GMS, of shortcomings during Covid-19 vaccination roll-out in terms of the level provided by GPs?</p></speech>

The way GPs operate has had to change for reasons such as the need to use PPE and separate patients to avoid them having to queue.  This has affected their overall capacity.</p><p>There is a return to services plan.  Obviously, it is completely contingent on what the virus does, which is contingent to some degree on how we quickly we can roll out vaccines.  I do not know the specific case but we are aware that across our system, be it with regard to GPs, hospitals or our primary care or social care side, we are challenged in terms of being able to deliver all of the services we had been delivering.  There is a plan to get us back to a level of service.  </p></speech>

As a Deputy, I am aware of a significant number of people behind the scenes who are crisscrossing by phoning GPs asking whether they can take them in because they cannot get to their local GP.  We appreciate there is significant strain but as the administrative body for the GMS, I want the HSE to get that picture as well, namely, that it is not all just essential healthcare and that people are losing out on some employment opportunities because their local GP is unable to take them.</p> <p>  In general terms, I always was of the view that someone who had a medical card would, by and large, receive a free hospital stay or that it would be largely subvented.  However, it has come to my attention that in St. Camillus's hospital, Limerick, to where many people from the southern part of my home county of Clare occasionally have to go as patients, medical cardholders are being charged a weekly stay rate of &euro;179.  That might not sound too high compared to other hospitals but it is rather high when one factors in other things.  One constituent with whom I am dealing had to stay there for three or four months following a stroke.  This person is on a low income and has a medical card but he left hospital facing a mammoth bill that he and his family do not know how to pay.  Are there many cases like that where there is still a payment for hospital stays, regardless of whether or not the person has a medical card?  </p></speech>

It is of key importance to people in the mid west that some clarity is brought to bear on this because it is quite a hefty fee to face after a hospital stay in St. Camillus's hospital, which has been there for over two centuries.  It took a lot of us by surprise to hear that a charge has been set for people when they are discharged.</p> <p>  I know that earlier in the meeting, Mr. Ryan outlined the review of medical cards.  Is there an algorithm for the sample of medical cards - the 20% or so that the HSE reviews each year?  Some cases merit review because people's health situations or incomes may change but is there an algorithm or trigger that initiates a review?  For many people, it is fine but for others, certainly people of a certain age category, it can be a huge stressor to find out that the medical card upon which they lean so heavily is under review and is under threat of being taken from them.  What are the criteria or what is the algorithm used to select the 20% of cards that are reviewed each year?  </p></speech>

We do not review cards <i>per se</i>.  It is a very small random sample of cards of the order of 100 per month.  We review cases where there have been protected disclosures in the same way as would the Department of Social Protection when information is sent to us as a protected disclosure.  Other than that, when cards are due to expire, we go through them.  We have data sharing agreements and legislative underpinning for the sharing of information with the Department of Social Protection and Revenue and we try to identify from those systems people who will clearly hold their cards.  We also try to identify all the individuals who got a discretionary card and we try to exclude them from reviews.  I would say that we select out 80% of what we are left with, rather than selecting 20%.  That will obviously vary month on month.  Between 64% and 80% would be selected out depending on the month of the cards.  We try to avoid reviewing people who are over 80 because we do not want to upset that cohort and most of those individuals will have had their medical cards for a long time so we age stream it as well.</p></speech>

It might be in the review correspondence people receive but it needs to be explained a bit better.  In normal times when politicians are holding clinics, people appear saying that they have received a letter from the HSE telling them that their medical card is under review, telling us that their situation had not changed income or health-wise and asking how on earth it could be up for review.  It needs to be a lot clearer.</p></speech>

Ms Halliwell and I have a small team working on our communications.  There was a time when the vast majority of reviews were actually reviews.  As time has moved on, we only review a small proportion so we are planning to change the communications we send to take some of the threat component out of it.  They should be more along the lines of telling people their medical card is due to expire and to prevent their medical card from expiring, they should please make sure they have submitted the following information.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for all their contributions.  They were really helpful.  The witnesses heard many members express their concerns regarding backlogs, waiting lists and the frustration of many people with a medical card due to the difficulties they have in accessing services.  The message from the committee would be that if at all possible, we should take steps to reduce waiting lists, address some of the concerns that medical card holders have and look at those who feel let down by the system and that they are outside or in the grey area where they are not eligible to apply.  I thank the witnesses and all their staff for all the work they have done, particularly during this difficult time.</p></speech>

We have been used to seeing each other on screens for a long time, so it is great to have the opportunity to meet face to face in public.</p> <p>  Today, we are continuing our pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Electoral Reform Bill 2020.  After this meeting we will suspend for 15 minutes for our private meeting on correspondence.  Apologies for his absence have been received from Deputy Duffy.</p> <p>  We are joined remotely by the witnesses, Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin, head of public policy in Facebook Ireland Limited, and Mr. Ronan Costello, senior manager of public policy in Twitter.  Their opening statements have been circulated to members.  I will invite our witnesses to make their opening statements and then members will be invited to ask questions.  Members' questions and answers will be limited to five minutes.</p> <p>  On privilege, members attending from their Oireachtas offices are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their participation in this meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines or place at which Parliament has chosen to sit, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  Witnesses and members are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. &Oacute; Broin to make his opening statement on behalf of Facebook Ireland Limited.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1140" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021033000002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting Facebook to contribute to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Electoral Reform Bill 2020.  I am head of public policy for Facebook Ireland Limited.  I will start by saying that Facebook very much welcomes the Government&rsquo;s intention to establish an electoral commission and its objectives of modernising electoral law and safeguarding election integrity.  As members may be aware, Facebook has made significant changes to its services to increase transparency, to prevent interference and to remove misinformation in the context of elections.  In addition, Facebook continues to collaborate with organisations worldwide that are working to strengthen democracy, good governance and election integrity.</p> <p>  We recognise that the desire to introduce greater regulation and transparency in online political advertising has been a focus in Ireland for several years.  The introduction of the Private Members&rsquo; Bill on the subject in 2017 led to the Open Policy Forum on Political Advertising in 2018, in which we were very pleased to be invited to participate, in addition to the consultation at the time.  It is also important to highlight the role which Irish parliamentarians have played on the International Grand Committee on Fake News and Disinformation, working for the past few years with colleagues in parliaments across the world to identify solutions.  From an Irish perspective we were particularly pleased that our vice president of content, Monika Bickert, was invited to attend the session held in the Seanad in November 2019.</p> <p>  Facebook has reviewed and analysed the general scheme with great interest but also, at times, with some concerns.  Our detailed written submission was provided to the committee on 23 February.  In that submission, we summarised Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to protect democracy and election integrity, before noting our views on the draft provisions concerning online political advertising.  In this statement, as requested, I will focus only on the regulation of online political advertising, which is dealt with in Part 4 of the Bill.  For ease of reference, we have included a summary table of our position on the heads in Part 4 in annex 1 to this document.  In addition, as it is likely to be of interest to the members, we have included the executive summary of our submission to the media committee on the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2020 as annex 2.  Given the amount of engagement that has taken place on the issue in Ireland, we would be interested to see the regulatory impact assessment which was prepared on this aspect of the Bill and, in particular, the reasons the approach outlined in Part 4 of the general scheme was deemed optimal.</p> <p>  As an overarching point, it is Facebook&rsquo;s belief that online political advertising rules and standards should be harmonised across the EU to the extent possible.  We are concerned that enacting these provisions at this time will lead to a lack of alignment between the requirements which exist during electoral periods in Ireland and the year-round EU wide rules for political advertising which the European Commission intends to introduce via the European democracy action plan and the Digital Services Act.  We understand that the Commission intends to publish a legislative proposal for political advertising in the next six months.  There is, therefore, a real possibility that online platforms could find themselves under two inconsistent regulatory regimes and placed in the undesirable, and avoidable, situation where they would have to choose between violating Irish law or violating EU law.</p> <p>  Second, if the committee is of the view that this part of the general scheme should rapidly progress, despite the concerns expressed by Facebook and others, we strongly recommend that a principles-based approach is adopted.  This would give the electoral commission the power to engage with companies and other stakeholders to promote ongoing innovation and improvements, while at the same time delivering on the Government&rsquo;s stated objective of achieving transparency in online political advertising.</p> <p>  Regarding the specific wording of the proposed legislation, it seems appropriate to start with the definition of a political advertisement.  Facebook recommends a more objective definition of online political advertising.  At a minimum, the legislation should take account of what online intermediaries such as Facebook can and cannot do.  In  short, we can identify whether an advertisement contains certain content, but we cannot divine the intention that an individual has in placing an advertisement.  The reference to "political purpose" should be replaced with a far more objective test.</p> <p>  Moving to the actions required of online platforms, we have a broad range of concerns with the requirements set out in respect of the transparency notice.  These include privacy concerns about the scope of information regarding an individual which is intended to be shared and the impact of disclosing specific micro-targeting criteria.  We also have practical concerns about the appropriateness of online platforms collecting information about the amount spent on content creation and the requirements for advertisers to provide an end date for a campaign.  Finally, we have concerns about the reporting obligations set out in this head and question whether they are proportionate or indeed necessary in all circumstances.</p> <p>  The appointment of a responsible person deserves significant attention.  The general scheme provides for a complex system of oversight to be overseen in the first instance by a responsible person appointed by the online platform.  The appointment of the responsible person moves the responsibility and onus of providing accurate and complete information away from the buyer, who holds the information, and onto the online platform.</p><p>Our concerns in this regard are far-reaching.  It seems far more straightforward for the relevant regulatory body to have the power to simply engage with the online platforms and directly investigate any and all of the issues which these heads appear to be attempting to resolve.</p><p> As a final point, I know that a broad range of issues which are not currently captured by the general scheme, such as misinformation and cybersecurity, have been discussed during the deliberations of the committee.  In light of the volume of regulation for online services which is emerging at EU level and the existing and new Irish regulatory bodies which may be required to implement these measures, it may be of benefit to consider how the proposed electoral commission would interact and engage with some of these, including the digital services coordinator which will be required under the digital services Act, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s existing cybersecurity agency.</p><p>I again thank the Chair and members for inviting me to speak.  I look forward to the discussion and hope to be able to answer as many questions as possible from members.</p></speech>

I am a senior public policy manager for Twitter in Europe.  I will first provide our observations on the general scheme of the Bill and then outline some key elements of our election integrity work.</p> <p>  Twitter is an open and public platform.  Our singular mission is to serve the public conversation.  The public conversation on Twitter is never more important than during elections.  We are a global service and we strive to think globally, so every year is an election year.  We take what we learn from each election cycle and use it to improve our election integrity work worldwide.  Policies that were developed prior to the European Parliament elections in 2019 were improved for the US Presidential election in 2020, and on it will go through 2021 and beyond.  We daily build on our efforts to protect the public conversation and enforce our policies against deliberate attempts to mislead people and manipulate our platform.  Partnerships with industry peers and civil society, as well as political parties and government officials, are critical to our success and it is in this context that we welcome today&rsquo;s dialogue.</p> <p>  Twitter shares the fundamental objective of the Bill.  We want to make elections more transparent, encourage accountability and promote an honest and informative civic conversation.  We welcome the proposed establishment of an electoral commission.  In countries where we have worked with such a commission, such as the UK, our experiences have been very positive.  Having a single point of contact is helpful for everyone involved.  During the European Parliament elections, we channelled our engagement through a dedicated election team.  When the process concluded, the director-general of the directorate for communications in the European Parliament reached out to express appreciation of this work.  </p> <p>  As regards the definition of "political purpose" currently provided in the Bill, there is a remote chance that the day-to-day campaigning of non-profit organisations and NGOs may be captured in the scope of the legislation.  Additionally, this definition may capture apolitical voter education and engagement campaigns that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the newly-established electoral commission would seek to run.  We respectfully submit that such categories of promotion should not be subject to the requirements set out in the draft legislation.  This would likely bring unforeseen and unintended consequences.</p> <p>  In October 2019, Twitter decided to prohibit political advertising outright.  We took this step based on a belief that political reach should be earned, not bought.  We cautioned that the effects of algorithm-optimised and micro-targeted political messaging present new challenges to civic discourse which are not yet fully understood.</p> <p>  As regards Twitter and elections generally, prior to an election the public policy team co-ordinates a period of preparation.  We connect with political parties to provide an overview of our policies.  We work around civic integrity, as well as sharing practical tips with them for staying safe on Twitter.  We also engage with parties and the relevant electoral authorities to ensure the right support channels are in place to escalate concerns and report any perceived violations of our rules.  This external outreach is complemented by the gathering of a cross-functional internal team of experts who work on elections.  </p> <p>  Our civic integrity policy is a recognition of the responsibility to protect election conversations from interference and manipulation.  Under the policy, we prohibit attempts to use our service to manipulate or disrupt civic processes, including through the distribution of false or misleading information about the procedures around voting.  Core to our work around civic integrity are our efforts to strengthen Twitter against attempted manipulation, including malicious automated accounts and spam.  The fight against malicious activity and abuse has been significantly augmented by our continuously improved capacity to leverage machine learning to recognise these harmful practices.  Through machine learning, we can detect behaviour-based signals that help to scale our moderation efforts.  Our capacity to deploy these techniques now means that more than one of every two Tweets that is removed for violating our rules has been proactively identified without requiring user reports. </p> <p>  We also recognise that addressing harms associated with misinformation requires innovative solutions.  Content moderation in isolation is not particularly scalable.  This is why we have sought to be creative in pioneering new approaches to labelling harmful content and experimenting with community moderation.  Labels help us to clarify that a claim may be disputed and then we can link to more authoritative sources. </p> <p>  Finally, Twitter supports regional and global regulatory alignment around technology legislation.  We urge consideration of existing initiatives that have provided a structure for regional standard-setting and co-operation, including the EU code of conduct on disinformation, the upcoming democracy action plan and the digital services Act.   As debate around the world focuses on how to solve public policy challenges related to our online environment, the approach of Twitter to regulation and public policy issues is centred on protecting the open Internet and we welcome any dialogue with policymakers that advances this goal.</p></speech>

The Bill seeks to regulate political activity during election periods.  My first question is for Mr. &Oacute; Broin in particular as Facebook permits political advertising.  Does it believe that a year-round system would be more appropriate?  I ask Mr. &Oacute; Broin to address the creation of custom audiences and the SIPO requirement to apportion costs spent during the year in terms of being reused during a campaign.</p></speech>

The rules we have in place apply all year round.  We try to provide as much transparency as possible.  A related point regards a far broader category of issues than what seem to be captured by the definition in the Bill.  On the point around SIPO, I am not entirely sure what the question is, but we provide-----</p></speech>

Through micro-targeting and spending on advertising pre-election, it is possible to create custom audiences within Facebook which then can be used during the election period.  As such, in reality, unlike other media such as print advertising or radio advertising which have their benefits immediately during the campaign, online advertising offers a different opportunity to create audiences that then can be used during a campaign.</p></speech>

It is the case that one is able to create a category of interest that one would use to target specific advertising.  However, coming back to the point around spend, etc., what we show on the ads library is the amount that is spent on the ad in delivery, that is, when it is being seen by people on the platform.  We do have a point around the whole issue of content creation which seems very difficult to capture for us as a platform.  That may be something that individuals or political parties could report directly to SIPO.</p></speech>

My argument is that it would strengthen the Bill if the regulation were year-round because of the nature of it.</p> <p>   Mr. &Oacute; Broin raised concerns regarding privacy, the collection of data and the engagement of the commission with Facebook rather than it being transparent.  I would argue that a voter has not just the right, but the responsibility to see what is happening during an election, and that it would not be enough for the commission to be able to engage with Facebook.  It needs to be something that is visible.  If I see a leaflet with which I disagree, I should have the right to see the source of the leaflet.  Equally, the same should apply for Facebook.</p><p>Does Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin agree that the personal details of anyone participating in an election campaign should be displayed?  </p></speech>

That is why we have built the ads library that applies year-round.  In respect of the detail about an individual, it raises privacy concerns.  I know that the deputy commissioner appeared before the committee last week and he said it would be possible to build a system that was safeguarded and put processes in place to mitigate the risk.  That work on the data impact assessments required may be ongoing in the Department.  Based on what we can see in the general scheme, it raises privacy concerns.  We believe there is a more straightforward way of going about this which would not necessarily have the same level of privacy concerns.  One, for example, would be that an individual-----</p></speech>

We are saying there is a more straightforward way of doing it.  We will provide the name of the person and all the details regarding the ad, but it may be more appropriate to provide an individual's home address directly to the regulator.  We have seen examples in recent referendums where there have been highly emotionally charged debates where it might not always be in the public interest to have an individual's home address available online.  It is just a question of balance and we are just saying that the home address issue raises privacy concerns.  It obviously it will be a matter for the legislators to decide where the balance is in that instance.</p></speech>

This Bill permits providing online political advertising to a content provider, which clearly states it is not in the news space, yet we ban political advertising on radio stations, which are often very good-quality local and authoritative sources of news.  I believe there is a discrepancy there.  Following what Twitter has told the committee, does Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin believe there is an argument to ban online political advertising?</p></speech>

We do not believe that banning political ads is the answer.  We believe that greater transparency in political advertising is the answer.  Can an argument be made regarding radio and television?  They are different types of media and perhaps the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland would have a view on that.</p></speech>

Facebook's submission to the committee is very disappointing.  The proposition in the legislation is incredibly modest.  All it is proposing is that for the three or four weeks of a general election campaign, election ads or ads that are designed to have an impact on the electoral outcome should be designated as such; information about the way in which those ads are being targeted and funded should be made public; and there should be an onus on the platform that publishes these ads to take responsibility and ensure that the advertiser is compliant with the law.  Those are basic propositions.  I am concerned that Facebook is proposing to the committee watering down what is already a very weak proposal.  I want to put that on the record.</p> <p>  I agree that we need to get the definition of political advertising right, as NGOs and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties have highlighted.  I do not see how Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin's definition addresses any of those issues.  In fact, subsection 3 includes most of the areas about which NGOs and human rights organisations would seek to be able to advertise.  Why does he believe his definition, as outlined in annex A, is better than the Government's?  In other words, what could the Government's definition capture that his does not?  </p> <p>  At no point in the general scheme are data protection concerns mentioned, nor does it mention anybody's home address.  It refers to a name and postal address, but election agents and election posters often use an office address.  Some of us might have used our county council addresses when we were elected councillors.  In the same way that candidates' and-or election agents' information is made public, I do not see why it should not be the case here.  </p> <p>  Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin made a spurious argument by stating that the regulations on postering are different and less onerous than microtargeting.  However, when a candidate spends five times more money on posters than anybody else, we see the posters on the streets and the lampposts whereas there is not public visibility on microtargeting.  Therefore, I do not see how that is a valid concern.  I ask him to give a bit more detail on that.  </p> <p>  My biggest concern relates to Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin's comments about head 122.  He seems to suggest that rather than Facebook having a responsibility to ensure that people, who place ads on its platform and from whom it profits, comply with the law, it should be the responsibility of the electoral commission.  Only when there is - I quote the Facebook submission - "persistent refusal or non-compliance with warnings" would it reach an escalation.  That suggests that people would be able to break the law and persistently be non-compliant.  Facebook would profit from it but at some point, because of its warnings, it would escalate to the electoral commission.  That seems to absolve Facebook of any responsibility for the content on its platform.  I do not see how having a person responsible is anything other than a natural safeguard.</p> <p>  Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin keeps describing Facebook as an intermediary, but ultimately his company is profiting from the ads that any of us places.  Like Deputy McAuliffe, I place ads on Facebook.  As Facebook is profiting from the ads we place, there should be an obligation.  I ask Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin to address some of those concerns and I may come back in the next round if there is time.  </p></speech>

I think we are arguing that the provisions should be more effective and should give the regulator the appropriate tools with which to engage with companies such as ours to establish the practices that are in place and also to be able to react and adapt to any new threats coming down the road.</p> <p>  Regarding our approach to the definition of social issues and electoral political ads, I had a quick look at the ads library this morning.  It contains ads from NGOs and from companies dealing with sustainability, sustainable energy etc.  We believe all that influences the democratic process here and that is why we require those individuals and organisations to go through those steps and measures to put it into the ads library so that everyone can see what the ad is, who is paying for it, the categories of targeting that were used, what the spend range is and other details on the ad.  </p> <p>  That is the point on definition.  How that is different from what the Government is suggesting?  It is not clear to us what a political purpose ad is.  It is one thing to say it contains content about social issues, electoral issues or political issues and that is a far more objective test than trying to figure out what the intention of somebody behind the advertisement is.  That is the point we are making.  It is moving from the subjective to a more objective test. </p> <p>  On the point of microtargeting, the releasing of the targeting criteria is the main thing academics have been calling for since 2016 or 2017.  We have real privacy concerns over releasing the targeting criteria within the EU.  However, we are not saying that we have privacy concerns, and that we are just throwing our hands up and saying we can do nothing about it.</p><p>We have been engaging with the European Commission in recent years and with academics at a European level to figure out what would work-----</p></speech>

At a high level, that is what the concern is.  We are working with the European Digital Media Observatory, which was set up by the European Commission as part of its efforts regarding the code of conduct on disinformation, to figure out what a code of conduct would look like under the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  To return to what the deputy data protection commissioner, Dale Sunderland, asked last week, what are the frameworks, protections, risk mitigation measures and processes that need to be in place to release this information?  That work is ongoing.  We are not averse to doing it.  We have released the data in the US and I can share the link for that, but we have a concern about privacy.</p></speech>

I have read with interest, as I am sure all members have, the points made by the witnesses in their submissions and there are some good ones in respect of harmonising EU and Irish law in this area.  While that should certainly be considered, it is not a reason not to have more transparency in regard to online advertising and to where the money for that advertising comes from.  In an earlier response, Mr. &Oacute; Broin stated that greater transparency is the answer.  I compliment Facebook on its ad library because it introduces an element of transparency to political advertising in this country by identifying where individuals or organisations that run adverts on behalf of parties or politicians are located.  Although we know the location of these administrators, however, we have no idea who they are, how much they spend on behalf of parties or politicians or where the money comes from.  As we heard at last week's committee meeting, the Facebook ad library was designed for the US, where it is okay for individuals or organisations to spend unlimited sums on behalf of politicians or parties, but that is not okay in our jurisdiction.  I do not believe that spend is being captured on the ad library.</p> <p>  I have a few short questions on which I would appreciate yes-no answers.  Will the representative from Facebook confirm that if I approve an individual or organisation to place adverts on Facebook on my behalf, this ad spend is not accounted for on my ad library but only on the ad library of the person I have approved?</p></speech>

This is perhaps one of our most important meetings because we are talking about electoral reform and the importance of election integrity, confidence and trust.</p><p>This is the cornerstone of democracy, locally, regionally, nationally and internationally.  We know that these platforms are in demand.  I will not share too much detail with the committee, but I took the time to check out the Twitter and Facebook accounts of all Oireachtas Members.  What I found is very interesting.  Many members will be familiar with the type of engagement that happens and many people will have been impacted upon negatively by that engagement.  It is significant that representatives of Facebook and Twitter are with us this morning.</p><p> The public conversation regarding Twitter and Facebook, particularly in the context of elections, is fundamental.  Content influences decisions, be they good, bad or indifferent, based on misinformation, false news or wrong motives.  That is the reality.  While Facebook and Twitter are unique and powerful, they are also potentially very powerful instruments to be used to abuse people and the political process.  That has to be a concern for anyone who represents the democratic parliament.  Every day, we are having these conversations, but particularly in an election, they determine the outcomes.  That is a really important point.</p><p> I would like to ask two questions because I want to hear more from Facebook and Twitter.  They arise on foot of the opening statements.  My first question is to Mr. &Oacute; Broin.  He mentioned the danger of online platforms such as Facebook finding themselves under two inconsistent regulatory regimes in terms of EU and Irish law and stated that Facebook has been dealing with this issue in the context of Brexit.  I am familiar with Brexit and the challenges it poses for the North, the South and the Border area.  Surely, Facebook has found itself in a similar situation in the past.  If so, how did it handle it?</p><p> My next question is to Mr. Costello.  He rightly stated that we have not fully realised the dangers of the algorithm-optimised and the micro-targeted political messaging on social media platforms, as referenced by previous speakers.  In Mr. Costello's opinion, what steps could a body such as the proposed electoral commission take to offset some of these negative affects and the phenomenon in an Irish context?  I would appreciate it if the witnesses could give me relatively concise responses.</p></speech>

Given that it is only six months away, it seems more prudent to us to hold off to see what the requirements at EU level will be.  At that point, the electoral commission or the Houses of the Oireachtas could decide whether they go far enough.  Electoral law will always be a member state competence.  It is that question of alignment, particularly in view of the fact that the European Commission has said it proposes to provide for transparency in political advertising across the EU.</p></speech>

Part of it is to counter the proliferation of disinformation with respect to the electoral process.  If the electoral commission is the entity for Ireland that verifies results, counts and so on, Twitter would, for example, take its lead from the commission if someone were to tweet that a count had gone one way when it had actually gone the other or that a result had been declared in favour of one candidate, whereas the electoral commission had declared in favour of another.  Based on the electoral commission's determination, we could then take it as an authoritative source in considering whether to label tweets and, through that labelling, whether to direct our users to more authoritative sources such as the electoral commission or a credible news platform.  That is one way we could foresee Twitter working with the electoral commission.  Another parallel might be the work we are doing with health organisations around Covid-19, where we have escalation routes for them to send us links to content that they believe is violating Twitter policy on harmful misinformation with respect to Covid-19.  An electoral commission could have a similar relationship with Twitter, where it would have an escalation route to us and could share with us what it believes to be violations of Twitter civic integrity policy around information that is misleading people in the context of how they engage with the electoral process and the outcome of electoral votes.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions arising out of submission from Facebook, in particular annex 1.  Mr. &Oacute; Broin said Facebook has difficulty with the definition of "political advertisement" and it is seeking a stricter definition to be applied to it.  I note from the Twitter submission that it has a comprehensive definition of "political content". Would a tightening up of the definition of "political advertisement" satisfy the concerns of Facebook in that regard?</p></speech>

Facebook could apply that same objectivity based on the definition applied by Twitter and inclusive of the suggested definitions of what it should include, as set out by Mr. &Oacute; Broin.  It is an issue that can be overcome in the context of this Bill.</p></speech>

As an overarching point, we believe the Bill should progress and the electoral commission should be established.  I do not think there is anything insurmountable in the concerns we have in regard to online political advertising.  We can come to a solution on it.</p></speech>

We will now move to head 122 and the concerns regarding the appointment of a responsible person.  The term "responsible person" as set out in the in the heads of the Bill is a term already provided for in the Electoral Act as being a person in authority within either a third party or the accounting unit of a political party.  Its inclusion in this Bill may be considered necessary to ensure consistency with the existing electoral code.  As I said, the term "responsible person" already exists in the Electoral Act.  The concern of Facebook appears to be that there are substantial privacy and commercial confidentiality issues with the appointment of that responsible person if it is a third party.  It could be included in the contract advertisement that the responsible person will be appointed and it may be a third party?  It is possible to overcome this issue as well.</p></speech>

Where an advertiser provides information to us, we can provide that to the regulator, and if there is any question or cause for concern on the part of the regulator it can follow-up and investigate with the advertiser.</p></speech>

If we were to go with Mr. &Oacute; Broin's suggestion that a responsible person should be just a point of contact, namely, a mere conduit that bears no responsibility.  There has to be a responsible person appointed.  Mr.&Oacute; Broin spoke about developing a reporting mechanism where persistent refusal or non-compliance would trigger greater enforcement.  He must be aware of the timeframes involved here.  Surely, we would be outside of the electoral cycle if we were to go with what is suggested by Facebook.</p></speech>

We have touched on that already.  It comes back to the question of providing the transparency and putting the material into the ads library such that not only the regulator but all stakeholders can engage with it and see what is taking place.  We are happy to report to the regulator as required.  When it comes to any question on inconsistencies or, as mentioned by others, sources of funds and so on, we see that as a role for the regulator to play, not the platforms.</p></speech>

He is concerned about what happens if he already has a business relationship.  If there is an existing business relationship, which then tries to submit political advertising, that would trigger this aspect of the Bill.  There can be an existing relationship but if it gets into political advertising, as defined, then it would trigger that aspect of the Bill.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Broin think that is a way of dealing with this issue?</p></speech>

For example, the legislation provides for transparency in online political advertising.  Many of the issues that arise in heads 121 to 125, inclusive, are then avoided, but two things are still ensured.  The objectives of the State are met because one is ensuring there is regulatory oversight of the transparency of online political advertising but also that the regulator can evolve its approach, and can require companies to evolve their approach, in the face of emerging threats.</p></speech>

Like other committee members, I read the book by Christopher Wylie, who was a whistleblower for Cambridge Analytica, <i>Mindf*ck</i>, a couple of years ago.  He clearly detailed his experience working for Cambridge Analytica in respect of misinformation, voter turnout suppression, campaigns and the targeting of sections of society already under-represented because of voter suppression campaigns, which is a terrible use of technology and social media to target people who are already disempowered.  The end result of that misuse of technology and social media platforms is that people were less empowered again following the electoral process.  Mr. Wylie was doing this work in 2013 and 2014, so it is not particularly new.  He went through the detail of how micro-targeting was used to build audiences and heighten their fears, anxieties and prejudices over time.  I recommend that anyone who has not read the book read through it or even read <i>The Guardian</i>articles he wrote about it.</p><p>My question is specifically for Facebook.  Given there have been terrible consequences from the misuse and abuse of micro-targeting, which has been done through social media platforms, is the cleanest, safest way to deal with safeguarding electoral processes, and safeguarding against manipulation and voter suppression campaigns, to simply ban micro-targeting during political debates, campaigns and elections?  What is Mr. &Oacute; Broin's view on that?</p></speech>

We do not agree that banning micro-targeting is the correct approach.  We agree that ensuring there is transparency in what is happening in spending on political advertising and, in our case, social, electoral and political issues, is the correct approach to take.  As I mentioned in a previous response, we are committed to finding a way to work with academics to release more of that data once a framework has been established to do so within the EU.</p> <p>  Much of the discussion on targeting is on the negative side.  I ask that consideration be given to the upsides of targeting in political campaigning.  We have seen incredibly positive uses of our tools and services across the world through ensuring that all players have access to tools to spread their messages to interested audiences.</p></speech>

Some of the very sinister practices that have occurred over previous years have been around micro-targeting.  Mr. &Oacute; Broin referred to the positives of micro-targeting in identifying specific audiences and giving them specific information and messages that other audiences cannot see.  He might elaborate on why he feels there are positives in micro-targeting and why transparency alone is enough to deal with that.  Can he give some positive examples of micro-targeting because I have outlined some of the negatives around it?</p></speech>

At a geographic level in Ireland, we have constituency boundaries.  It is obviously of benefit for candidates to be able put a message into a particular constituency.  That is just one example.</p></speech>

If I take out a targeted advertisement in my local newspaper, it can be seen by anyone, from a small child starting to read up to the oldest voter.  It is targeted but it is not micro-targeted.  I am not picking people out based specifically on age, demographics, class, different interests and so on.  There is a difference.  I have no issue with targeting.  Of course, it makes sense for people to get an advertisement in the Dublin region, or in a Dublin or Waterford constituency, but there are concerns about the picking out of particular segments, and the manipulation and lack of transparency around that.</p></speech>

If one takes the health messaging at the moment, different messages are appropriate to the over-75s compared to the under-25s when it comes to Government messaging on the health measures currently in place.  There are positive, totally appropriate ways of using targeting based on demographics.</p></speech>

From the perspective of the social media companies, Liz Carolan, who was in front of the committee last week, and academics such as Dr. Jane Suiter, the one issue that comes across is that the Bill is, perhaps, too limited and too prescriptive.  We need a dynamic electoral commission, involved and able to keep up with technology and the different methods more nefarious actors involved in online advertising will be able to exploit going forward.  In that respect, the heads of Bill are perhaps too limited.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin stated, it is quite a conservative change.  I am not sure it will be able to keep up with the changing face of online political advertising.</p> <p>  I agree with Facebook when it states the Bill is not fit for purpose, but perhaps not for the same reasons.</p><p> Within the longer submission supplied, there was talk of privacy concerns about identifying natural persons.  Last week, we questioned the deputy Data Protection Commissioner who said he considers that the definitions involved in that do not give rise to any privacy concerns.  Perhaps Mr. &Oacute; Broin can outline why he thinks that is the case.  I am not sure if he saw the representatives from the Data Protection Commission.</p><p> In terms of aligning this legislation with the European Commission's regulations that are coming down the road, what parts do the witnesses think we should include in the Bill?  Can they suggest a type of electoral commission that is outside the terms of this Bill?  What principles would they prescribe in the Bill for an electoral commission?   I ask because people across the board have identified the necessity for the electoral commission to evolve as opposed to how it is in this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1212" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021033000002#G00200"><p>On the privacy point, yes, I had the opportunity to see the session last week, and we both have had the opportunity to see previous sessions as well.  As a general point, I thank the members for the amount of time that they are giving to the pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation.  To come back to privacy concerns, we are looking at a general scheme which we believe requires identification.  We said there are privacy concerns in terms of that, and we outline that it is not, in our view, appropriate to legislate in this space until all of these issues have been taken into account.  I refer to the evidence from the Data Protection Commission last week.  The witness phrased it as &quot;not <i>per se</i>&quot; and that it would be possible if one put all of the appropriate safeguards, data protection impact assessments and all of the requirements around those provisions.  That is fine but what we are saying is that there would seem to be a more straightforward way that would not figure the privacy concerns on that particular point in terms of the address.<br/><br/>Overall, the first point is to make sure the office of the regulator is appropriately staffed and resourced.  I think that is very important and should not be lost sight of.  It is possible to set down in legislation that the role of the regulator in this space will be to ensure transparency in online political advertising and not, as I said previously, go into the level of detail that is currently provided for in the general scheme.  For example, one could have a statutory code, in that once there has been engagement with online platforms, academics, etc., the electoral commission would codify it in statutory code, which sets down the requirements that online platforms should meet.  That would allow the online platforms to build, and to continue to build and innovate, the products and services that we have, and that are different, right across our own platforms and the other platforms that would be involved in the space.<br/><br/>In terms of the point made about what the European Commission is doing, it may be that what is announced by the European Commission in six months is not satisfactory to the legislators here or to Government.  That is okay as Ireland, as a member state, has the power and competence to legislate for electoral law.  Is it just a case of asking, given that that is only six months away, would it be more prudent to wait to see what is in that legislation before progressing with these measures as they are?  There are a number of things in there.  Ultimately, what we want in this space is an effective regulator to engage with and to continue to innovate and improve our services and provide transparency.  That is the objective here.</p></speech>

I know that it is not easy, especially when doing things virtually but such is the world.  The witnesses are probably more used to interacting online than we are.</p><p>I share the concerns as expressed by most members and witnesses here today about the online political advertising element of the electoral reform Bill being just limited to the election period.  The media commission and EU laws will regulator year-round content.  I also appreciate that, from the perspective of the witnesses, it would be an awful lot easier if there was seamless alignment between what we propose here, through the electoral reform Bill, and the media commission and EU regulations.  From our perspective, what we are tasked with is what is in the interest of the common good and not what is necessarily easiest.</p><p>As both Facebook and Twitter have their European headquarters in Dublin, there is a huge opportunity for us to be the leaders on this issue.  I wish to acknowledge the leadership shown by Facebook when it comes to transparency through its own public ad library.</p><p>I have a question for both of the witnesses.  From a Twitter perspective, I ask Mr. Costello to talk us through Twitter's engagement with the EU electoral commission during its election cycle and perhaps, in part, any learnings that he thinks Ireland could benefit from.</p><p>I seek an assurance from Facebook that it will be able to respond to this legislation from a workforce management perspective.  Last week, the vice-president of integrity at Facebook said on his blog:</p> <blockquote> 	To address this challenge, we&rsquo;ve built a global network of more than 80 independent fact-checkers ... When they rate something as false, we reduce its distribution so fewer people see it. </blockquote> <p>That is 80 out of 52,000 employees worldwide or 0.15% of the workforce who are currently tasked with fact checking.  I am quite concerned that this law will place additional responsibility on Facebook to monitor political advertising.  That is money being spent by political parties and politicians to shape and influence democracy so this is extremely serious.  I seek an assurance from Facebook that it will be able to respond appropriately and that it will be able to flex its workforce management plans so that it not just reduces content that is illegal but removes it.</p><p>I would like to pick up on a question asked by my colleague, Senator John Cummins.  Perhaps Mr. &Oacute; Broin might shed some light on the matter.  The Senator asked about Facebook page managers.  The example was given of a page with 11 Irish managers, seven managers from the UK, two from Serbia and one from Germany.  It would be helpful if Mr. &Oacute; Broin indicated what Facebook managers can do with political pages.  Can they administrate discussions on the forum?  Can they post on behalf of people or are they in control of advertising?</p></speech>

The elections in 2019 were in late May and we started talking to the Parliament team in September of the previous year.  The team is apolitical.  It is tasked with ensuring that the elections go off without a hitch, that the process is constructive, and that the dialogue is as informative as it can be.  The benefit is that it is one project team speaking to another project team.  Each of us has a single point of contact.  We both know who to contact so there is an escalation route.  In September, we began a conversation.  Around November, a cohort from Dublin, including myself, went to Brussels to join our colleagues who work in Brussels full-time, and we gave a training session to all available MEPs and their staff on Twitter safety, trust and safety expectations that they could have, and our rules, policies and escalation routes, etc.</p><p>That work continued from there, right through from November 2018 until the election concluded on 26 May 2019.  As I said, the benefit of that throughout was that there was no ambiguity as to who to reach out to in the event of X.  That would be the constructive advantage of an electoral commission in Ireland.  </p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for her questions.  We agree that Ireland has an opportunity to show global leadership in effective regulation, not just of online political advertising, but of a whole range of other issues.  Harmful online content is also central to that.</p> <p>  I want to make a few points.  Our strategy on misinformation is threefold: remove, reduce and inform.  What the Deputy has referred to concerns the reduce piece.  Those 80 she referred to are not Facebook employees.  They are 80 employees of third-party organisations that we work with to whom we refer content that has been flagged as possibly being false.  Those organisations carry out checks on whether the content is true.  In Ireland, Journal.ie is the third-party fact checker.  That is where that figure of 80 comes from.</p> <p>  Ensuring the integrity of democratic processes and elections involves a much broader group of people right across the company.  I believe there are around 40 teams involved in this work.  To give the committee a sense of the amount of content we remove, between October and December 2020, we removed 12 million pieces of content from Facebook that were misinformation which could lead to physical harm.  In that same period, of the content, 167 million pieces of content that was rated as false by fact checkers was reduced in its circulation. </p> <p>  On the issue of page administration, the central point is the person who is running ads in Ireland must be in Ireland.  There are other activities such as moderating discussions and using the safety tools we put in place for page administrators to moderate discussions on pages themselves.  The Deputy also mentioned commenting.  That is all possible as a page administrator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021033000002#H00300"><p>I will direct my questions to Mr. &Oacute; Broin.  It is important for committee members to be very clear.  The Digital Services Act does not deal with elections.  Elections are the exclusive preserve of member states.  Therefore, if I understand it correctly, the Digital Services Act provides the basic set of rules that should operate around digital transparency and accountability across the EU.  However, because each electoral process is different, every member state is absolutely within its rights if it wants to set a different, higher or specific set of requirements during elections.  I agree with Deputies Higgins and McAuliffe.  I would much prefer it if it was more than just the four weeks when it comes to the financing.  We agree on that.</p><p>Rather than, as Mr. &Oacute; Broin's statement disingenuously suggests, people having to choose between violating Irish law or violating EU law, because I would hope Facebook never chooses to violate any law, there would be compliance with both sets of laws - the general Digital Services Act as it applies in ordinary times and, in any individual member state, any specific additional requirements the legislators in that jurisdiction feel are necessary to protect the integrity of their state.  Just so we are clear, it is important for people to understand that the Digital Services Act does not actually deal with elections.</p><p>On the issue of microtargeting, the issue is not geographical targeting, just to go back to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's point.  It is data mining and the use of it without the knowledge of the people who are being targeted with the advertising.  For example, when I get microtargeted by Amazon, it is on the basis of the data it has mined from whatever books I have viewed and browsed on Amazon.  I have never knowingly consented to that data mining or indeed Facebook's use of that.  Obviously, when I signed the 75-page consent document when I signed up to Facebook, there was implied consent, but there are all sorts of problems with that.  That is why, for example, the European Data Protection Supervisor has argued for action on this and therefore greater scrutiny and possible banning.  I would be interested in Mr. &Oacute; Broin's view on that bit of it because I do not think anybody is talking about the geographical targeting of ads.</p><p>In Mr. &Oacute; Broin's comments on page three of annexe 8, my reading of what he is proposing in terms of the suggested change to head 122 is that Facebook would have no responsibility for ensuring those who are advertising during an election, and from which Facebook is profiting, are legally compliant.  All it would have is the responsibility, through a point of contact, to share information with the regulator and its job would be to enforce compliance.  Will Mr. &Oacute; Broin confirm that that is his position.</p><p>Some important points were made in our previous session about changes to the way in which online operators operate and the kinds of tools that are at their disposal.  There was an interesting article in <i>The New York Times</i>in December of last year that mentioned Facebook withdrawing what was referred to as its &quot;news ecosystem quality&quot;, or NEQ, which is an algorithm for prioritising more informed and reliable sources rather than less informed and reliable sources, which was in train during the election and withdrawn afterwards.  One of the big issues here is how we all will know if new tools are introduced or withdrawn and how they are captured.  They are also particularly relevant to electoral integrity.  What transparency mechanisms does Mr. &Oacute; Broin propose in respect of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021033000002#H00400"><p>I will take each of the issues in turn.  The Deputy is correct to state that the Digital Services Act, DSA, does not, as far as I know, seek to provide for transparency in political advertising.  What it will do is provide an EU-wide baseline for all advertising.  The European Commission has also said, however, that through the European democracy action plan, EDAP, it intends to introduce a separate legislative instrument which will provide for transparency in political advertising on an EU-wide basis.  We expect that to appear in the next six months.  The DSA provides the baseline for all advertising, but the EDAP will be a legislative instrument which introduces requirements for transparency in political advertising across the EU.</p> <p>  I accept the point that electoral law is a member state competence and the organising of elections falls under electoral law.  It would seem to us, however, given this instrument is just on the horizon, that we should at least wait to see what it is or what its scope is going to be before bringing in these detailed provisions at this time.  I do not want to suggest to the committee and I know it has spent a long time on this already, but it may be helpful - I do not know - to hear from the European Commission as to what its plans are in this space.</p> <p>  On responsibility and compliance, there is no issue with taking responsibility for getting details from an individual and putting them in the ads library.  It is once it gets beyond that into the sources of funds and all of the other matters which are considered beyond that that we will take information from the individual who is looking to run the ad and, if there are investigations etc. beyond that, that we see it as a role for the regulator to play.</p> <p>  On the point of tools and changes, we make announcements where there are changes to any of our tools which require notifications to the appropriate regulator  Obviously, we engage with the Data Protection Commission on an ongoing basis in respect of any changes we make to products and services, as appropriate in the EU.</p></speech>

Is Mr. &Oacute; Broin saying the platform should or should not have that responsibility?  The regulator obviously has its parallel responsibility, but should there not be some responsibility on Facebook to endeavour to ensure that an advertisement is legally compliant with the provisions of the Act?</p></speech>

I am saying there is a more effective and efficient way of doing that to ensure we take on our correct responsibility.  However, we also see that there is a crucial role for the regulator to play here rather than this third party model.</p></speech>

Facebook would have no responsibility to ensure compliance in the case of, for example, a politician placing a non-compliant advertisement on its platform.</p></speech>

If the law or the code requires us to check the identification or passport of an individual, we are obviously responsible for doing that.  It is the model of oversight that I am trying to make a point about.  I am not sure this third party model is fit for the online world.  It would seem far more appropriate to set down what our roles, responsibilities and obligations are under the law and that this third party would be replaced by more direct involvement by the regulator.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. Costello.  I appreciate that Twitter's has fewer users in Ireland than Facebook.  I understand the figure is less than 1 million people.  I also understand that in recent times Twitter has taken more direct action to remove bots and trolls.  How many accounts is Twitter removing in Ireland every month?</p></speech>

That would include all violations of Twitter rules and the information is broken down by rules.  If we were talking about platform manipulation and spam, for example, which would be co-ordinated inauthentic activity, bots if one likes, those kinds of figures could be found there every six months, depending on the nature of the report.<br/><br/>This figure is not up to date but as an example, around 18 or 24 months ago, we were challenging between 8 million and 10 million accounts globally each week.  Challenging means that something about the sign-up process with particular accounts was setting off flags.  I mentioned earlier that we are leveraging machine learning to be better at detecting behaviour-based signals.  Machine learning flags were tripped and an account would be challenged.  It is based on the suspicion that it is an inauthentic or spam account, which is likely therefore to engage in inauthentic behaviour on the platform, perhaps in co-ordination with other accounts and-or as part of a network.  If the challenge is not met by an account and it does not prove that it is being operated by a real individual and that person has not had accounts suspended previously, the account in question will be automatically suspended.  There was a significant volume of such actions globally around 18 or 24 months ago.  There is still a significant volume weekly but it is not as high as it was.  I suggest that is evidence of our enhanced capacity to deploy those machine learning techniques to address this sort of behaviour.</p></speech>

We believe it is right that political speech should be seen and should be scrutinised more than it already is by placing it in an advertisements library.  It is important to make the distinction, however, that this does not mean anything can be said by a politician in a political advertisement.  Hate speech, for example, is not allowed, nor is suppression of voting, election turnout or that type of behaviour.  A whole range of content is not allowed.  As a general point, we do not fact-check and we do not send political speech material to the network of fact-checking organisations I spoke of earlier.</p></speech>

It oversees the decisions made and it is the final arbiter of the decisions we are making regarding content.  The board is also going into other areas and recommendations, and we are engaging with it on those.  It comes down ultimately to the question of who should be the arbiter of what the truth is when it comes to political speech.</p></speech>

That is for another day, however.  I am going away now more uncomfortable than I was when I came in.  I say that particularly regarding Facebook and its representative.  I have two simple questions.  Whenever we talk about a fact-checking or watchdog-type body, individual or team, we must always ask who will watch the watchmen.  That is a profound question.  Who will watch the watchman?  What mechanisms do Twitter or Facebook have in place for oversight and accountability?</p><p>That is something about which we need to hear.  Have the witnesses individually, or the organisations they represent, in this case Facebook and Twitter, personally, professionally or as a collective in terms of those organisations, been involved in any lobbying in regard to this legislation?  If so, with whom?  They might share that with the committee.  I ask that question because it is important.  There is nothing wrong with lobbying and it is a regulated profession.  However, it is important, as a committee doing pre-legislative scrutiny in regard to this legislation, that we should know.  I would like to hear what views the witnesses have and what their engagement has been with lobbying the political institutions, in particular politicians in Leinster House.  I want to be specific about my questioning because I have thought about it and I have knowledge about it.   Specifically in regard to this Bill, can the witnesses share, either as individuals or on behalf of the organisations they represent, what lobbying they have been involved in?</p></speech>

For example, with regard to our innovations around labelling of harmful and misleading information, one of our motivations for doing that is to give primacy to, and to promote content from, authoritative sources.  For example, when we label content around elections and we say that this claim about the outcome of an election is disputed, we are basing that on the outcomes and the statements of the electoral commissions.  In the recent presidential election in the United States, for example, it could be a state or county board, or something like that.  One of the reasons we are doing that is not only to make the users&rsquo; experience on Twitter better or more reliable, so they are getting good quality information rather than poor quality information, but also because we would hope that it buttresses and reaffirms faith in those institutions that have oversight of these processes.  We are relying on their determinations and want to give them primacy on our platform.</p> <p>  With respect to our own oversight and accountability, I will give an example.  The policies we develop, be they around misleading information, abuse, harassment or hateful conduct, are developed in collaboration with our global trust and safety council, which is a collection of non-profit organisations, typically NGOs, expert groups and sometimes individuals who are experts in their respective areas.  They say to us, for example, that we do not have a policy on something and we should have a policy on it, or that our policy on it is lacking and it is not taking account of trends in this particular area, and that we need to do some development work on it.  That is an external body.  All of those engage with us independently and their feedback is very candid.</p></speech>

In addition, we realise that external oversight of our systems is incredibly important in establishing and building trust.  This year, an independent third party has responded to a request for tender to carry out an audit of our systems and services right across the world, the systems and services we have in place to protect and keep users as safe as possible on our platforms.  It is the first time it is being done. That might feed into the approach that is going to be taken under the digital services Act to establish whether, at the systems level, the company is doing what it should do.<br/><br/>In respect of lobbying in regard to this legislation, the first we heard of it was in<i>The Irish Times</i>article in early January.  We held a meeting with officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We had not established our position at that time and wanted to understand what was the timeframe.  We have since put together the written submission of 23 February, which all committee members have.  We sought to engage with members of the committee and to have individual meetings with members of the committee in the run-up to this.  We were not aware this hearing would happen but, obviously, the committee has our opening statements and all of the details.  That will all be reflected in the lobbying register the next time the reporting is due.</p></speech>

I have one remaining question.  European regulation of online political advertising would provide harmonisation, and I can see why multinational companies would rather have that framework than a different framework in each country, for operational reasons alone.  The difficulty is that different countries allow different levels of donations.  For example, on this island we have two different jurisdictions, one with almost an uncapped donations system and the other, in the South, which, to be fair, bans corporate donations above &euro;100 and caps personal donations.  When one limits the amount of money in politics, the exploitation of the tools becomes less serious but when there are uncapped resources, that is a difficulty.  I would argue that while European regulations are important, we need to specify for each particular country and each democracy.  Our voting system is unique, with the exception of Malta.</p> <p>  My question is for Twitter.  We have talked about paid political advertising.  I believe the allowing of anonymous accounts on Twitter also prevents transparency around the spending of money in politics.  Yes, that can happen on Facebook but it is far more obvious on Facebook when an account is fake.  I believe the anonymous accounts on Twitter allow a disgusting and horrible culture of trolling on Twitter, and I do not understand why Twitter would allow that to continue.  I have continuously called for anonymised accounts to be banned, and I do not know why Twitter allows it.</p> <p>  It would also prevent paid political operatives operating multiple anonymous accounts, which prevents transparency as well.  If I am paying for election posters to be erected or leaflets to be delivered, people can see that.  However, if I am paying people to troll other people on an account, that cannot be seen.  I am not saying that is happening but that it is very possible under the current system.  Anonymised accounts facilitate that, and I cannot understand why Twitter allows those anonymised accounts on its platform.</p></speech>

One of the reasons that has not changed is that the policy was developed and has evolved in consultation with human rights groups.  For example, groups like Civil Rights Defenders, Access Now and Front Line Defenders are based in Dublin and all of them represent human rights activists across the globe.  One of the reasons we allow the pseudonymous accounts, and one of the reasons I mention the human rights groups, is that that particular feature of the platform is vital in environments, contexts and countries where it is dangerous for that kind of activity to be carried under one&rsquo;s real name because one can be identified and may be apprehended, and so on.  We see this context and we see this use case arising more and more as the political situation in countries across the world deteriorates and regresses into a form of a illiberalism.</p><p>Pseudonymity on Twitter is one way for folks who oppose that developing illiberalism to push back on it and to do so not altogether with safety but perhaps in safer conditions than they would be able to otherwise.</p></speech>

I will look at the link that Mr. Costello referred me to by way of an answer to my first question, but I am concerned that it will not give me the answer I am looking for.  I will come back to Mr. Costello, if that is okay, because I would like specific answers on that.</p> <p>  My thanks to the Facebook representative for participating today and for making the submissions.  We need to recognise the big divergence between how Facebook is approaching this issue and how we are approaching it in terms of trying to protect the fairness and freedom of our electoral process.  Facebook has 2.4 million users in Ireland and the company is saying there is no fact checking.  The submission suggested Facebook did not want any responsibility in terms of compliance with advertising and regulatory standards for political advertising.  Facebook has the tools to demonstrate and contribute to making our democracy stronger.  I urge Facebook to work with us in the coming months to try to ensure that we can get the maximum out of the tools it has to enhance our democracy.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

Last week we heard a good deal about the precautionary principle.  When it comes to this, I believe the horse has bolted with regard to the use of social media.  Advertising is no longer what influences political discourse.  Rather, it is the posts and the use of social media.  Where we increasingly regulate paid advertising, what we will see is an increase in the non-paid activities and activities that are encouraged by the platforms represented here today and other platforms.  The more outrageous content is and the more eyeballs the companies get on screen, the easier it is for them to make sellable advertising for micro-targeting, even outside of the political arena.  There is a business model at the back of all of this.  We have heard all the platitudes and the niceties about political discourse but behind all of this is a business model that drives as many eyeballs on screen as possible to sell advertising.  I believe that this section of the Bill is fiddling while Rome burns, to be honest.</p> <p>  Professor Nathanial Persily of Standard University has written extensively on the idea of the dangers posed by social media and the things valued by the companies.  Velocity, that is to say, the speed of communication is one.  This has a tension with democracy.  A well-timed lie immediately in advance of an election can gain a national audience long before it can have the opportunity to be rebutted.</p> <p>  The second is the idea of things going viral.  The primacy of what goes viral is what is emotive and outrageous.  Consequently, democratic discourse is not well served where there is a chase for the outrageous.  The outrageous is less well regulated, and positively encouraged in some instances by suggesting that people join other groups or join groups of similar interest.  We have incentivised eyeballs on screen and what we have overall is a coarsening of public discourse as a consequence.</p> <p>  Anonymity is another point.  It is some years since I set up my Twitter account so I had forgotten the process.  Last night, for the craic and to see how easy it was, I set up a Twitter account under a different name.  All that was necessary was a mobile telephone.  In doing that there is no accountability in place.  There is no obligation for me to identify who I am.  There is an opportunity to spread lies, misinformation and disinformation from within and without the jurisdiction and, consequently, influence political discourse in advance of an election.  The professor goes on to speak about the monopoly held by platforms and the challenge to the circumstances where social media posts are made worldwide.  We have seen that in social media being managed from other countries.  That is a problem for sovereignty and a problem of oversight and of governance.  In light of this, Twitter says it is encouraging civic participation and dialogue.  Facebook is a flag-waver for free speech.  To be fair, Facebook is taking positive steps.  However, cyber-scientists have shown maps of trolling and pile-on activity and have confirmed that there are instances where this is co-ordinated or orchestrated for political purposes with a view to suppressing content, silencing people and influencing discourse.  Both platforms represented before the committee promote that or sit by and allow it to happen.  How do the companies expect us to regulate that?  What are the comments of the company representatives in response to that?  The provision in this Bill is absolutely not fit for purpose.  It is too narrow and does not protect our democracy.</p></speech>

It is the case that a person can have a pseudonymous account.  A user need not use a real name on Twitter for the reasons I outlined in my first answer.  The second point is that, regardless of the name or handle of the account, the enforcement actions that we take against accounts is the same no matter what.  If a person is abusing or harassing someone under a pseudonym or engaging in a spam operation where a person is trying to develop momentum around a particular hashtag or topic such that it gains inorganic primacy on the platform, then we will enforce our rules in the same way against that pseudonymous activity as we would if the person was operating under a real name.  The enforcement outcome is the same no matter what.  I hope that it clarifies our approach on this.</p></speech>

The fact is that anonymous parties with no accountability or transparency in respect of who they are, their political leaning, where they are or otherwise get to influence the discourse.  We can look at anything that is trending in Ireland on any evening.  If we follow in through it, there are accounts and the promoting of particular hashtags that put out information that is false, that misrepresent how people are elected in Ireland and what is valued in people being elected or that misrepresent the proportional representation system.  There are people behind this who do not put up their names and who promote misinformation and disinformation about Irish politicians.</p></speech>

One of the benefits of Twitter being a public platform is that rebuttal can be done as publicly as the sharing of disinformation.  Someone can quote-Tweet in respect of a piece of disinformation that the person believes to be disinformation and say it is entirely wrong and include a link to the correct source, whether the Electoral Commission or a news organisation like Reuters or AP.  If that rebuttal is done using an account of a journalist who is verified and who has 20,000 followers, it will have a larger impact on correcting the record than an pseudonymous account that is part of a low-scale co-ordination network that may only have 50 or 100 followers.</p></speech>

It makes reference to watching social media companies talk about their content management and how they are so quick at removing posts while the person is constantly told that an anonymous troll account, which routinely calls the person a terrorist, has not broken any rules.  That same experience has been encountered by journalists and female politicians in particular.  I have had queries come back to me stating that the company will not remove the content or take action because it does not correspond with the values of the company.  All the while the misrepresenting of democracy in Ireland is continuing on the platform and the coarsening of public discourse is being facilitated.</p></speech>

The reason I am here today is that I have taken a great interest in transparency on these platforms since my election to the Oireachtas.  I wish to follow up on what my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, said.  With all due respect to Mr. Costello, under no circumstances do I accept the accept the excuse that Twitter is somehow liberating oppressed people in different parts of the world and that is why it is necessary to have anonymous accounts.  That is total and utter BS.  It is a nice, fluffy answer.  Instead, the anonymous accounts are dishing out some of the most horrific abuse on the platform.  Every time I pick up my telephone and see Twitter notifications I get pangs of fright and fear about what is next.  It is the same for every politician.  I would not be on Twitter if I did not need to be for work and politics reasons.  It has reached the stage where I believe it is beginning to undermine our democracy.</p> <p>  Twitter is 15 years old and I do not buy the case that this is how Twitter started 15 years ago.  Political discourse on Twitter has changed.  Ten years ago, Twitter was a wonderful platform where one could engage with people who had different viewpoints.  One could engage in and have respectful debates.  That is gone out the window now.  It makes zero sense to have anonymous accounts that can be set up with five different emails for five different accounts to target politicians, journalists such as Aoife Moore or members of civic society.  That is how pile-ons are orchestrated.  The point is that there are only so many times one can be called every word under the sun before it rolls off one's back.  It is different for some of us because we are used to it.  However, if social media companies are allowed to continue with this type of political discourse, we are going to lose some potentially really good young people from politics in Ireland.  An amount of people ask me why I even got into politics given the abuse I receive online.  They say they would run a million miles from it.</p> <p>  That is the problem with this, and it is why I believe platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are undermining democracies.  I do not buy their reasoning that they maintain anonymous accounts because they can unveil corrupt places in far-flung parts of the world.  I am referring to anonymous accounts in this country.</p> <p>  As regards Facebook, my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, is quite correct.  By the time disinformation spreads on Facebook, the horse has bolted and it is too late to rebut it.  If one tries to rebut something, there is the Streisand effect whereby one is making a bigger story of it by trying to rebut it.  When one of us rebuts something that could be completely false, that is then in the newspaper.  It is the Streisand effect, so it is not in our interests to try to rebut fake news about us as individuals or the like.</p> <p>  The other point is that there has been much discussion today about what we are doing to fact-check politicians and political parties, but what are we doing to try to fact-check the public?  What is becoming a thing now in elections is that in the seven days before an election, which could be a crucial or tight election, people are going on Facebook, Twitter and other online sites to undermine candidates.  The new form of online political campaigning is to try to smear candidates.  A former Deputy is now suing Facebook and Twitter for damages because of completely unfounded lies that were put forward about him in the lead up to the last general election.  Fair play to him for taking it to the High Court.  I commend him on that.  The point is, however, that the damage was done.  The issue is that people see it online and believe it, due to the age-old concept that there is no smoke without fire.  There should be a direct link whereby somebody can go to Facebook.  The person should not have to go through a lengthy court process, only for somebody to say that he or she put it up as a lie and did not mean it.</p></speech>

I agree with Senator Seery Kearney, but the responsibility to legislate is here.  If people want, for example, anonymised accounts or micro targeting ended and better regulation of these platforms, we legislate for it here.  There is no use in Government Deputies coming here and complaining that there have been 15 years of failure in self-regulation by the industry when we know self-regulation in many other areas has failed.  The challenge I put to the Deputies and Senators, and I accept their sincerity because I share many of their concerns, is to regulate.  If they will not do that, people will question their sincerity when they come here to rail at platforms for not regulating when that is our job.  Beyond this Bill, which we all have accepted is very limited in its regulation of online advertising, there is clearly a bigger job of work for this House to do.  I believe members would have willing partners across the Chambers to regulate platforms properly to deal with all these issues.  Let us go and do it.  Then we will not be asking industry to regulate itself because we will have taken our responsibilities as legislators seriously.</p></speech>

There are great positives with social media, but what has happened over time is that social media has been hijacked by bullies and organisations with hidden agendas and that want to attack people.  A party colleague of mine has been attacked constantly by one person on Facebook over a period of years.  She has not been able to do anything to stop these attacks.  As others have said here today, they are not the only people affected by this.</p> <p>  People should have the right to freedom of expression but they cannot be allowed to bully, harass and attack people.  Facebook must use its moral compass to do something to protect people.  Anonymous accounts are unregulated.  Facebook and Twitter are huge companies.  We have seen what has happened in the US.  Surely, they have learned lessons that they can put in place in a country like Ireland, where we have a much stronger democracy and people have the right to be protected. </p></speech>

I believe we are all well aware of that at this stage, but I wanted to reiterate it at the outset.  Unfortunately, the rules do not permit members to participate if they are outside Leinster House according to the advice given to the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will take us through some housekeeping matters.  I ask members to mute themselves when they are not contributing so that we do not have background noise or feedback.  If they use the raise hand button, it will probably be the best approach.  The clerk to the committee and I will try our best to ensure that everyone's hand is noted when it is raised and that we get to everyone.  If we miss members, I am sure they will make themselves known to me anyway.  I remind members to ensure that their mobile phones are either on silent mode or turned off so as not to interfere.</p> <p>  This meeting has been convened to consider the Revised Estimates for public services for the Department of Justice's Votes 20, 21, 22, 24, 41 and 44.  Documents with breakdowns have been circulated.  We will interrogate them further in the course of the meeting.</p> <p>  I am pleased to welcome the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and her officials.  I thank them for the briefing document that was sent to us ahead of the meeting.  As she is present, we will engage with her rather than her officials.  They can advise her and so forth, but they should not speak while we are in public session.  She can speak for all.</p> <p>  Speaking of the Minister speaking, I believe she has a few words to address us with at the outset of the meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2021033000002#A01000"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to this meeting.  I am seeking its approval for the Revised Estimates for the justice sector Vote group to provide for much-needed expenditure across the sector.  The Estimates provide for gross expenditure of approximately &euro;3 billion across six Votes in the justice sector, &euro;2.746 billion of which is current expenditure and &euro;258 million of which is capital expenditure.  In addition, &euro;27 million in unspent capital from 2020 has been carried over to 2021, bringing the total available capital allocation to &euro;285 million.</p> <p>  I will set out the detail of each of the Votes.  Significantly, a number of common themes run across them.  In terms of the modernisation of services, ICT investment and the digitalisation of services are not just aspirations, but essential.  Our experience over the past year has emphasised this and given much-needed momentum to the digital reform of services across all sectors, including justice.  The Garda ICT budget of more than &euro;80 million includes a specific allocation of &euro;7 million for the provision of additional mobile devices and related licensing and maintenance costs under the Garda mobility project.  These devices give garda&iacute; instant access to real-time, secure information on the roadside across a range of apps that enable them to scan registration plates, identify forged or false driver licences and detect disqualified drivers, untaxed cars and stolen vehicles.  The flexibility that this gives garda&iacute; leads to time being saved on dealing with paperwork in the station, more time spent on patrol and the front line, and greater risks being identified.  In addition, &euro;5 million has been provided in the justice Vote for the implementation of an ICT strategy for the Department, building on and enhancing the structures that have been put in place as a result of the Department's transformation programme.</p><p>Significant ICT development is planned over the next three years with the immigration area being a priority for digital reform.  At present, too many operations are still paper-based.  This investment and reform will make it easier for people to engage with the Department and avail of our services, while giving us the tools we need to become more customer-centric and efficient.</p><p> A sum of &euro;8 million has been provided in the Estimates for the new modernisation programme in the Courts Service.  This is central to the reforms I want to drive across the justice system.  We need to keep pace with the changes in society and this involves increasing the use of the tools and technology that will make it easier and quicker for people to resolve disputes and access justice.  We saw how important this was during the last year during the pandemic.  </p><p> I sincerely hope that the spectre of Covid will diminish in future Estimates processes.  However, for now we are still dealing with the impact of the worldwide pandemic and Covid-19 is, therefore, a significant feature of the 2021 Estimates.  It has been necessary to make very specific provision in 2021 for the impact of Covid on expenditure and this includes additional funding in the following areas: &euro;13 million for PPE for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, &euro;5.7 million for increased PPE, cleaning and healthcare costs for the Irish Prison Service, &euro;5.7 million for the Courts Service, including for additional premises in Dublin and regional locations to enable court sittings to take place in a socially distanced and safe environment, and &euro;400,000 extra funding for organisations and groups responding to increased service demands from people impacted by domestic abuse during this period.  This additional funding is providing extra remote counselling services, welfare packs, extended helpline opening and other practical supports for those most vulnerable.  The Government will continue to properly fund our front line services in the justice sector as they serve the public throughout the pandemic. </p><p> I will now turn to the individual Votes.  The gross expenditure estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Vote 20, is &euro;1.952 billion which amounts to 65% of the funding for the entire Vote group.  In addition, &euro;12.75 million is available in unspent capital from 2020 to complete projects started under the Government's stimulus package towards the end of 2020 and to advance the building project to relocate An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from Harcourt Street to Military Road in Dublin. </p><p> In total, the capital budget available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2021 is &euro;127.4 million.  This builds on capital expenditure in 2020 of almost &euro;115 million, including an unprecedented investment in the Garda fleet of &euro;16 million, a proportion of which was related to the Covid response but the benefits to community and other areas of policing will long outlive Covid.  A further &euro;8 million is being provided in 2021 and will be kept under review throughout the year. </p><p> A sum of &euro;46.75 million is being provided for the capital building and refurbishment programme, including the new purpose-built building at Military Road in Dublin.  A sum of &euro;1.615 billion, 83% of the Garda budget, is pay and pensions related.  There are now approximately 14,600 Garda members in the service and 3,100 Garda staff in the organisation.  Notwithstanding the impact of Covid, it is currently expected that in the region of 450 additional Garda recruits will commence training this year over four periods.  Budgetary provision has also been made for the recruitment of an additional 500 Garda staff at all levels.  Progress in this target is expected also but is dependent on the impact of Covid on recruiting and training personnel.  With a permanent workforce now approaching 18,000, it is clear that the Commissioner has increasing options in the deployment of resources.  I am particularly pleased that 746 Garda members have been redeployed to front-line policing duties as of 31 December 2020, including 144 during 2021.  In addition the Revised Estimate makes provision for an increase in supervisory ranks at sergeant and inspector level and an overtime budget of &euro;95 million. </p><p> Before moving on from the Garda Vote, I want to acknowledge and thank An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their exemplary service to communities throughout the country in response to the pandemic.  Garda&iacute; have maintained a front-line, high-visibility presence since the outset of the pandemic and conducted a range of operations and activities to keep people and communities safe in support of public health measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19.  This work has included ongoing support for the most vulnerable and isolated in our society.  The work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is valued and appreciated by people throughout the country and it is important that this is acknowledged. </p><p> The justice Vote, Vote 24, has a gross estimate provision of &euro;476.1 million, broken down into two separate programmes reflecting the new and more streamlined administrative structure of the Department, the criminal and civil justice pillars, comprising almost 50 separate subheads. </p><p> This structure is reflected in the recently published strategy statement 2021 to 2023, which has five key strategic goals, backed up by a detailed action plan for 2021 that maps out in an open and transparent way how we are going to implement measures to support and enhance a justice system which contributes to improvements in society.  The budgetary provision for 2021 has allowed for a number of key priorities to be advanced and additional resources provided to a number of agencies in the civil and criminal justice sector.</p><p> In this regard, the budget of Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, is almost &euro;77 million in 2021 including a capital allocation of &euro;54.8 million for the development of a new state of the art laboratory in Backweston, County Kildare.  Despite the impact of the Covid restrictions, more than &euro;16 million was spent on this project in 2020 and it is expected that the project will be completed in 2022.  FSI completed around 22,000 case reports in 2020 which illustrates the importance of the work the organisation does in the criminal justice area. </p><p> The Inspector of Prisons received additional resources of &euro;750,000 in 2021, bringing the total allocation to &euro;1.95 million.  The Parole Board also received further additional funding of &euro;750,000 bringing its total allocation &euro;1.33 million.  This will enable the commencement of the Parole Act in the course of 2021.  I hope to have that up and running by 1 July.  </p><p> The Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, now has an allocation of almost &euro;10 million, an increase of 10% which reflects the crucial role that CAB carries out in tackling money laundering and targeting the proceeds of crime.  We saw significant work by CAB in the last year.</p><p> I am particularly pleased that additional funding of &euro;2.5 million was provided in the Estimates to tackle sexual, domestic and gender based violence, support victims and reform how vulnerable witnesses are treated as sexual offences are investigated and prosecuted.  This is in addition to the specific funding of &euro;400,000 under the Covid measures for enhanced supports to victims of domestic violence.  Most importantly, it will enable the commencement of the implementation of the recommendations in the O&rsquo;Malley report regarding protections for vulnerable witnesses.</p><p> This funding is reflected in subhead A12 victims of crime including sexual crimes and domestic abuse, which has a total allocation of &euro;4.1 million, and subhead A20, domestic, sexual and gender-based violence- awareness raising and training, which has an allocation of just under &euro;3 million which brings a total of &euro;7.1 million.</p><p> Increased funding of more than &euro;2 million for the Legal Aid Board, a 6% increase, brings the total allocation to &euro;44.6 million and will enable the board to recruit additional staff and meet other costs to enhance delivery of its services across the country. </p><p> It has also been possible in Estimates 2021 to increase the grant payment to the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC,  The Department&rsquo;s allocation has been trebled to a total allocation of &euro;294,000 to support these legal services to the most vulnerable.</p><p> Turning to the Prisons Vote, Vote 21, the gross Estimate in 2021 is &euro;394.5 million plus an additional &euro;5.468 million in unspent capital brought forward from 2020 under the capital carryover provisions.  In addition to an increase of almost &euro;6 million in Covid-related measures, the Prisons Vote has received &euro;1.65 million in additional funding to strengthen corporate governance across the Irish Prison Service.  Further substantial funding has been made available under the compensation subhead to pay for claims related to lack of in-cell sanitation which is being managed by the State Claims Agency.  Further additional funding of &euro;5.7 million has been made available for a range of other services, including security costs, prisoner services and an increased maintenance budget of &euro;2 million for the prison estate.</p><p> While the redevelopment of Limerick prison has been impacted by the Covid restrictions in 2020 and 2021, significant progress is being made.  A total capital allocation has been provided in 2021 of &euro;41.5 million, including capital carryover.  It is expected that in the region of &euro;36 million will be spent on the Limerick project, Covid restrictions allowing. </p><p> Completion of this project is a priority.  It will provide additional capacity for 40 female prisoners as well as a new wing to Limerick male prison, which will have additional capacity for 90 male prisoners.  It will completely upgrade and modernise Limerick Prison, as well as eliminating the practice of slopping out.</p><p> I want to acknowledge also the impact that Covid 19 is having on the operations of the prison service and the collective efforts that have been made by the Irish Prison Service staff, management, prisoners and Red Cross Volunteers to contain and minimise the impact of the virus.</p><p>The infection prevention and control teams in place in all prisons really have made a significant contribution to the handling of the virus, which is particularly challenging in a closed environment such as a prison.  I commend the work done in recognising the difficulties the virus has caused for staff, prisoners and their families.</p><p> We have a total Estimate in gross terms of &euro;158.5 million for the Courts Service under Vote 22.  This is in addition to an amount of &euro;4.895 million in carryover of unspent capital from 2020.  The Estimates include an allocation of &euro;8 million for the new courts modernisation programme as well funding to combat the impact of Covid 19.  The Courts Service continues to maintain vital front-line services for those who need them, including the most vulnerable victims of domestic abuse.  The restrictions have of course impacted on jury trials in the Circuit and Higher Courts but the additional funding will provide for additional venues on a temporary basis to try to deal with the backlogs in certain cases.</p><p> The allocation for court fees income has been reduced in 2021 by &euro;10 million.  This reflects the fall-off in court fees income especially from special exemption orders for the licensing trade and hospitality sector that were agreed last year.</p><p> A gross Estimate of &euro;19.1 million is being provided to the Data Protection Commission under Vote 44.  This includes an increase of &euro;2.2 million, which is a 13% increase compared with the previous year.  The Data Protection Commission budget has increased significantly year-on-year and has increased fivefold since 2015.  This reflects the responsibilities and functions of the office as it has expanded.  It is the lead supervisory authority to the various multinational organisations that have European headquarters in the State.  The largest aspect of the budget relates to staffing costs.  This amounts to approximately &euro;12.8 million with legal expenses accounting for approximately &euro;2 million and the remainder being spent on other services and areas.</p><p> The gross Estimate for the Policing Authority Vote is &euro;3.8 million.  This has been provided for under Vote 41 and includes an increase of &euro;384,000 or 11% on the 2020 allocation.</p><p> I welcome the opportunity to make this presentation and thank colleagues for their patience in discussing the Revised Estimates.</p></speech>

I outlined earlier in the meeting that we would proceed by considering each Vote in sequence.  We will focus on specific subheads before more general questions on other categories.  Again, I am referring to the briefing document prepared and I thank the Minister and the Department for sending it on.  We have another document prepared by the secretariat for consideration.</p> <p>  We will commence on Vote 20.  I call on members to pose their questions under the individual votes rather than jumping to the next one.  We will take each one in turn and deal with the issues that arise on each.</p> <p>  We will commence with Vote 20 on pages C4 and C5 in the secretariat briefing, which has been provided to members.  This covers pages 6 to 19 in the departmental briefing.  There is a good deal in this as we have 13 subheads within Vote 20.  Several members have offered.  I call on members to be specific about which subheads they are referring to in the Vote and to limit questions under one subhead at a time.  I am conscious of time and, as always, I am keen to make the most efficient use of time at the meeting.  If there are several questions we might group them and put them to the Minister as a block.  Otherwise we will take them one by one depending on how the rhythm of the meeting goes.  We will try to accommodate everyone but we will do so in an efficient manner.</p> <p>  Four members are offering in the following order: Deputy Daly, Deputy Martin Kenny, Deputy Niamh Smyth and Deputy Pringle.  If anyone else has been missed, please let us know.</p> <p>  Before I call Deputy Daly I will lead off with some questions under Vote 20.  I want to ask about subheads A1 and A3.  The Minister mentioned at the outset that there was a significant spending figure on pay and pensions.  Do we have a breakdown of the distinction between pay and pensions?  Under the large subhead A1 there is a reference to pay.  To what extent does that refer to serving members who are being paid for being on active service?  To what extent does it pay for pensions?  What is the split?</p> <p>  My next question relates to subhead A3, which covers clothing and accessories.  I had asked the Minister to update us on the tender process for Garda clothing and footwear etc.  How often is that done?  What checks and balances are in place?  Is that process audited?  Has it been awarded to the same tenderer?  Has it varied in recent years?  Perhaps the Minister will answer those questions and then I will bring in the next speaker.</p></speech>

I will need a moment to get this.  I will do the same for the question on clothing and accessories.  I am unsure how often this happens but I know there is a request at the moment for new uniforms.  We are looking at that as part of the overall request later on in the year.  I will come back to the Chairman directly on that in a few minutes.</p></speech>

I have one concern in that there is no increase for youth services.</p> <p>  While I welcome the 746 extra front-line garda&iacute;, town centres and city centres are quieter and larger groups have been more visible.  This leaves people feeling more threatened.  I welcome the increased funding.  I hope an increased presence of garda&iacute; on the front line can be seen as visibility is important.</p> <p>  I have a question on subhead A7.  Am I reading it right?  It seems there has been a large increase in Garda compensation in the past three or four years.  Is there any particular reason for that?</p> <p>  I have a question on the ICT budget.  The Minister mentioned additional mobile devices.  I know most Garda vehicles already have all the facilities to detect and scan registration plates and identify forged driving licences, untaxed cars and stolen vehicles.  What are the extra mobile devices?  Is it for vehicles or is it more to do with maintenance?  Who has the contract that relates to maintenance costs for the extra information technology?</p></speech>

Subhead A2 includes the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Reserve.  The figure was &euro;150,000 last year on top of &euro;4.4 million.  I am keen to get more detail on what the plans are around all of that.</p> <p>  I was interested in the large increase in the allocation under A11, which relates to the witness protection programme.  The figure has gone from &euro;400,000 to &euro;1.2 million approximately.  Funding for the Garda College has also increased considerably.  It is probably due to Covid-19 but the college has been closed for a large part of the year.  Will there be savings in this area?</p> <p>  Reference was made to a target of having cybercrime satellite hubs.  The target was to have three last year and three more this year.  We need to put more resources into this area.  The staff working there can be under considerable stress because often they are dealing with child pornography online and so on.  It is a stressful and difficult work environment for people to be engaged in all the time.</p><p>There is a need for a programme of support for the people working in that category of crime detection and evidence research.  The section is quite understaffed and that needs to be examined in general.  If satellite hubs are being set up, I welcome that and ask for more detail in that regard.</p></speech>

He got all his questions across in a timely fashion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2021033000002#D00300"><p>The Deputy referred to youth services.  I highlight that there is an additional &euro;500,000, which brings the total allocation to &euro;14.5 million for youth justice interventions.  That includes specific funding of &euro;1.426 million through the Dormant Accounts Fund for the Greentown programme, which is specifically looking at protecting younger people from the influence of adult crime.  When the &euro;14.5 million is added to the additional funding through the Dormant Accounts Fund, it brings the total to &euro;16 million.  Obviously, that spans various programmes that are in place.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, last week brought to Cabinet the youth justice strategy which will be launched and feed into some of that.  It will require additional funding and resources in the budget this year.</p> <p>  As regards extra front-line garda&iacute;, obviously there has been a difficulty in that regard in the past year because the Garda College has been closed.  That has led to difficulties in reaching some of the targets we set.  We have a target of 450 for this year.  The current number is 14,600.  Even after taking retirements into account, that will bring us close to the figure of 15,000, not including civilian staff.  Although there have been significant problems in this regard in the past year, the target of 500 additional civilian staff this year, which obviously is Covid-dependent, would allow more front-line garda&iacute; to be out on the beat and on the ground.  As the Deputy stated, it is extremely important that the Garda has a visible presence not just to be able to detect crime, but to make sure people feel and know that they are being kept safe.</p> <p>  On the issue of mobile devices specifically, much of this relates to automatic number plate recognition, ANPR.  There are currently 99 vehicles which are fully equipped with video and ANPR capability.  As the Deputy stated, this is about trying to expand that capacity.  In 2020, 28 vehicles were purchased and equipped.  No additional vehicles have been purchased to date.  That is where we are trying to expand in particular on this issue.  Approximately &euro;7 million extra has been provided in 2021.  Unfortunately, not all of the cars are equipped with this technology.  It is really important that we acquire as many of them as possible and that is where much of this is going.</p> <p>  To come back to the original point made by the Chairman regarding the Garda uniform, it is reviewed every couple of years.  As I stated, we are in the process of delivering a new uniform which it is hoped will be available by the end of this year or in 2022 at the latest.  Other equipment is reviewed much more frequently.  The uniforms are reviewed every few years but other equipment is reviewed much more frequently.</p> <p>  On the issue of the Garda Reserve, I understand that at the end of last year there were 476 reservists nationwide.  At the end of December, there were 407.  Following the attestation of 69 Garda Reserve members on 19 January, this number has gone back up to 476.  The report of the Commission on the Future of Policing, endorsed by the Government in December 2018, suggested the Garda Reserve programme as it stands is not realising its potential, so there is more work that we need to do in this regard.  The Commission recommended that future recruitment should be paused, pending the outcome of a strategic review in order to examine how we can best structure the Garda Reserve to meet the needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and subsequently be included in a policing service for the future.  We are halfway through the four-year implementation plan.  The review started in 2019 and we are awaiting its outcome.  As I stated, there is more work we could do in this space and that has been acknowledged, including by the Garda Commissioner.</p> <p>  On the issue of the Garda College and increased funding, significant funding was needed to ensure it was possible to take in the recruits in a safe manner, with all of the Covid restrictions that were in place being adhered to.  Additional funding was required specifically in that regard.</p> <p>  I have a note regarding three last year and three more this year.</p> <p>  I refer to the point made by Deputy Kenny regarding the commitment we made in respect of the cybersecurity team.  As he stated, it is dealing with very difficult material in some instances.  It is important that we do not have a team or a system where individuals get burnt out.  They should have the full support they need.  We are absolutely committed to continued investment in this space and ensuring those teams can be built on, year on year.</p> <p>  I am sure I have missed something.  My apologies if that is the case.  I will have to revert to Deputy Daly on the issue of the maintenance cost in terms of the holder of that contract.  I do not know that directly.</p></speech>

She referred to modernisation of the Courts Service.  Last week, the committee heard profound accounts relating to sexual assault and rape cases.  We heard from the legal profession that there is training available within the court system, but that training is on a voluntary basis.  The committee did not get the impression that there is a significant emphasis on the training.  Obviously, there has been a significant rise in the number of cases of domestic violence and coercive control and all of that.  Is training in that particular area for legal professionals part of the planning for that increased expenditure on court modernisation?</p></speech>

In my opening statement I referenced the implementation of the O'Malley report.  Although specific funding has not been identified under the &euro;8 million modernisation budget that was allocated to the courts, as part of the implementation of the O'Malley report a significant amount of work is being done in developing a training programme in respect of domestic and sexual assault cases specifically for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, those working in the Courts Service and the Judiciary.  A subgroup set up within the Department is examining this issue.  In addition, a consultant will be carrying out a mapping exercise, looking at the training that is currently being provided and identifying where there are gaps and where we need to further develop it.  That work will be done in conjunction with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the Garda Commissioner and his team, but also through engaging with the Judiciary through the Judicial Council, the Law Society and the Bar Council.  I acknowledge that I am moving into issues that fall under Vote 22.   There is a significant focus on this issue.  Where additional funding is required, it will be provided, either from the funding allocated through the additional O'Malley money or funding that is required through the modernisation budget in the Courts Service.  Although it may not necessarily be specified under these headings, there is work under way to identify what is needed.  If additional funding is required, it will be allocated.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for her breakdown of the Vote.  In her opening statement, she referred to provision in the ICT budget for equipment in vehicles.</p><p>I had the experience - I do not know whether I would call it the pleasure - of being stopped by the PSNI in the North.  The officers were able to check my car on their computer and tell me it was not taxed.  It actually was taxed, which is a separate issue, and it seems the Garda system was not updated.  My point, however, is that the PSNI officers were able to access the Garda system and tell me about my car.  Subsequently, I was stopped three times on the way back to Killybegs by garda&iacute; doing Covid checks, which was very welcome, but they did not have anything to tell me anything about my car.  That is the crux of what I am saying.  A member of An Garda told me that in the area in question in Donegal, there is just one handheld unit on which details of my car or any other can be checked.  Having just one unit between 50 or 60 garda&iacute; in the area seems very remiss.  How many units will &euro;7 million provide?  Obviously, this is the way the Garda should be going and it would be very useful, but it sticks in the craw a wee bit when the PSNI can do as I describe and the Garda cannot in the local area.  When will the programme be rolled out such that all garda&iacute; will be able to check the details of a car?</p><p> On the various budget items, I thank the Department for providing us with the documentation and I thank the committee staff for their work on it.  There are major differences in the allocations.  Under A10, on compensation, there is a 31.7% increase.  Why is that the case?  It seems huge.  Under A11, on the witness security programme, there is an increase of 200%.  By comparison with what was originally budgeted for last year, it would be an increase of 399%.  While the supplementary budget and Covid have had an impact, I am wondering whether the major increase associated with each budget item is normal.  Is there some reason the compensation budget is expected to increase by 32%?  By comparison with the sum originally budgeted for, there is actually an increase of 38.5% year on year.  Could the Minister explain this a little more?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2021033000002#E00200"><p>Regarding the overall investment in Garda ICT, not just relating to the ANPR, the mobility project, &euro;80 million has been allocated to upgrade the mobile devices.  I am referring to cars but also to technology to ensure everything can be interconnected and to reflect the fact that we have now just joined the Schengen Information System, SIS II.  Even though we only joined it on 15 March, there have already been great benefits.  I am getting that response back from An Garda.  On the ANPR, 99 vehicles are currently equipped.  The information is that, because of the technical and design specifications, many of the road policing vehicles cannot accept the technology currently in use.  This will take time to change.</p> <p>  On the mobile devices, which I failed to mention in my previous answer, we have more than 2,200 front-line mobile devices.  I am referring to the mobile stations that have been deployed as part of the overall roll-out.  They have been allocated to a range of operational Garda members, including those in road policing.  The regular units, community police, detectives and drug units are also included.  It is important to the work they are doing.  Three hundred of the devices are being deployed to complete the roll-out of community policing.  That was before the end of last year.  There were 500 additional devices deployed in early 2021.  This is what is being planned for this year.  There is an increase year on year.  Given that we have 2,200 devices, an increase of 500 this year is quite significant.  The scope of overall ICT allocation, of &euro;80 million, extends considerably beyond the mobility project, the ANPR, with a view to the overall restructuring of the policing technologies to make sure they are as interconnected as possible.  As the Deputy mentioned, it is a matter of bringing ourselves up to speed on the technology in other jurisdictions.</p> <p>  On the compensation and witness security programme, the position is like that on any budget in any given year in that sometimes there is significant funding in some areas and sometimes there is not.  The compensation varies from year to year, however, depending on a number of factors, including the quantum of awards given out.  In some of the past few years, compensation budgets have been diverted elsewhere.  If we look at the budget of 2020, we see a figure of &euro;16.6 million for compensation, while &euro;12 million was spent.  In budget 2021, we have allocated &euro;16.6 million.  We will have to see what will be spent.  It really varies depending on the compensation awarded or what is required for witness security at the time in question.  As we know, we do not always get exactly what we asked for in a budget request but it is very positive when we do and when see a significant increase of the type in question.</p></speech>

May I return to the previous Vote for a moment to make one small point?  On the question I asked on the Garda Reserve, I am a little confused.  Perhaps I could get clarity in writing later.  The Minister seemed to indicate there will be fewer Garda reserves or that the matter is under review, yet the departmental briefing refers to &euro;150,000 for last year and &euro;1.395 million, or almost &euro;1.4 million, for this year.  There is a trebling of the funding for the Garda Reserve at a time the Minister is basically saying it is being frozen.  Perhaps there is a mistake or some clarity is needed on that.  She can respond later in writing.  There is no need to worry about it at the moment.</p> <p>  On the prisons budget, we need to use to our advantage what Covid has given us.  I am referring, in particular, to how video technology has assisted in not requiring prisoners to travel so much between prison and court.  Perhaps some of these developments can be kept as we move on.  They do not have to end when Covid ends because considerable efficiencies have evolved that allow for smoother management.  We should consider where the technology has worked well and whether it can be extended to other parts of the prison service.  </p> <p>  With regard to the additional funding to do more work on the prisons, provide more buildings and space and improve quality, I am particularly interested in the move of the Central Mental Hospital to Portrane.  I suppose we need to have some clarity on it.  There has been some talk by the Central Mental Hospital about how it can achieve clarity on all this because it is, in effect, taking into its care people who are committed by the courts, yet it is a hospital providing a health service.  Some work needs to be done on that.  I am also concerned that very many of the people who end up on the relevant programme are people who have had psychotic episodes because of drug abuse and drug addiction.  They can end up in the hospital under those circumstances.</p><p>I have heard from garda&iacute; on the beat that very often, when they have people they know are a danger to themselves and the public - often times, they are underage - and they want to find somewhere to put them, there is nowhere they can go with them.  The spaces are all full.  I know the new facility will have additional spaces, which is welcome, but I am hearing is that the additional spaces in Portrane will not be adequate to deal with the extent of this problem.  The impact of crack cocaine on young people in these circumstances in recent months, particularly in Dublin, will put more pressure on that service.  I do not have a specific question about the budget but I feel that we need an emphasis to ensure our Prison Service meets those challenges because they are real challenges that will hit us very hard if we cannot cope with them in the future.  Sometimes people who should be in a safe space are not and can go out and harm themselves or other people.  We have seen the consequences of that recently.  I do not want to get into any specific cases but it is certainly having a real impact on people and the families of those individuals, who feel they should be put away somewhere because they are a danger to themselves, their families and the public.  This needs urgent attention.</p></speech>

Some of the changes brought about by Covid-19, be they in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service or the Courts Service, have been made out of necessity but, hopefully, they will remain and ensure the smoother and better running of the Irish Prison Service and other services.  Regarding additional funding to support the development of services to include additional ICT to allow for visits, using technology to invest in the Courts Service and going back to our previous Vote, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the increased use of technology is beneficial not just in saving time and resources such as prison staff or garda&iacute; not being required to travel to courts or different hearings, it is also beneficial for prisoners as it prevents taking people in and out when it is not necessary.  There are a lot of advantages to some of the changes that have been made.  In dealing with the Irish Prison Service specifically on this question, its intention is that any of these improvements would continue irrespective of whether we are still in the midst of Covid.</p> <p>  The Central Mental Hospital is not part of the prisons Vote but I am very conscious that there is a significant problem in that there are people in prison who have significant mental health problems and require significant help and have a dual diagnosis where they have mental health problems and drug or alcohol addiction.  I brought a memorandum to Cabinet today to establish a mental health task force to examine prisons, the care provided, follow-on care when people enter the community and how we can prevent that cycle from continuing where people do not get the support they need and find themselves back in prison.  Some of the consultation we will undertake involves identifying people with mental health challenges or a dual diagnosis of mental health difficulties and drug or alcohol addition challenges so it will cover much of what the Deputy raised.  Our former colleague, Kathleen Lynch, will chair the group, which between the Departments of Justice and Health will consider many recommendations that have been set out in a number of reports published in the past few years and build on other work that has been done between our community health teams, within the Irish Prison Service and working with the Central Mental Hospital.  Significant work has been done there but there is a lot of work still to do, particularly given the lack of bed capacity or spaces and the fact that the Irish Prison Service is dealing with prisoners with severe mental issues or other diagnoses.  We need to make sure we have the capacity to support them but that they are supported in the most appropriate way while at the same time, acknowledging that some of these people have committed crimes and are in prison because of that.  I hope to progress that work having brought that memorandum to Cabinet today.  I will support the work of the committee in respect of any recommendations it makes.</p></speech>

Does the Department have any plans for a redress scheme for slopping out cases and will the State compensate those who suffered that violation of their human rights over many years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2021033000002#F00500"><p>That scheme exists.  The plan is to make sure we eliminate this practice.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, significant funding is being allocated to Limerick Prison, where this practice remains in existence.  Once that work is complete, we will eliminate this practice.  I do not have the exact figure in terms of what has been allocated to date under this scheme but as soon as we can eliminate it, the need for any type of redress scheme or financial redress will be eliminated as well so the intention is for that to happen as soon as possible.  To date, &euro;130 million has been spent on capital projects aimed at eliminating slopping out with the target for eliminating it at about 99% so about 1% is left.  I will endeavour to get the overall compensation that has been provided to date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2021033000002#F00600"><p>My question relates to A7, compensation.  There is a 14.5% increase on what was budgeted.  From the Minister's response to the last question, I take it that this can be budgeted but whether that will all be used depends on the outturn at different stages.  This means that the 2020 Estimate on this item is &euro;9.5 million.  Does this mean that basically this is not an outturn figure either so we are not really looking at like for like?  I notice that the 2019 outturn figure was &euro;3.85 million.  How accurate is this?  If we take it that the 14.5% increase is not used, is it reallocated within the subheads or does it just go back into a black hole in the Department of Finance?</p> <p>  My other question concerns A4, prisoner services, and A6, educational services.  There is a 9.6% reduction in educational services and a 5% reduction in prisoner services.  What will be the impact of this, particularly on educational services for prisoners and their ability to be rehabilitated and educated?  What will be the impact if the full budget is used at &euro;1.265 million?  The other line in A7 has not been achieved.  Can the money be reallocated to that?  Is that likely to happen?  </p></speech>

As is often the case, in some years, one will get more than one thinks or less than one asked for.  For this year in particular, there was additional funding for in-cell sanitation cases going back to my answer to the question from Deputy Smyth so there was an additional &euro;6 million for that.  It varies very much and depends on the year.</p><p>On education and prisoner services, there was an increased allocation in last year's supplies.  Again, this depends on the requirement that is in place.  There was an increase last year so while there was a slight reduction this year, what was allocated is sufficient to deal with what is required for this year.  It depends on the request and the ask that is there and on the fact that last year we saw a significant increase in the allocation.  That, in itself, is positive but it is based on the requirement that is there.  I am not sure if there will be a significant negative impact this year because of that reduction.</p></speech>

The Minister says that will not have an impact because the allocation was increased in the previous year.  These Estimates do not mean anything so if that is the case.  I cannot get my head around that.  Are we saying the Minister does not expect that the &euro;1.4 million will be spent so therefore the &euro;1.2 million will be more than enough?  If that is the case, why was &euro;1.4 million spent this year?  It is strange.</p></speech>

It is also based on the request from the Irish Prison Service to us and then us making that request and the allocation being either granted or not.  Last year's spend was &euro;1.4 million but the allocation is &euro;1.2 million.  That is not to say that will not cover the requirements for this year or that it will not cover the supports that are required, be they educational supports or other services.  There seems to be a slight decrease this year but that is based on the requirements, the requests and the ask through the Irish Prison Service.</p></speech>

We have taken and dealt with enough queries under the previous Vote.  Vote 22 has four subheads, A1 to A4, and it is on page C7 of the secretariat briefing documents and on pages 31 to 45 of the Department's briefing notes.  Deputy Daly is indicating on this Vote and if other members wish to indicate they should make themselves known.  I will start with a few questions of my own before I move to Deputy Daly.</p> <p>  I note the Courts Service spend.  Capital works are inevitably down because of Covid etc. because it has not been possible to perform capital works.  There is an allocation for the Courts Service and it is up in every other regard.  I have a couple of questions on that, primarily with regard to the Covid experience.  Others have already referred to the adoption of IT in order to keep the courts meeting, moving and hearing cases and different matters.  There has been some allocation of funding to the Courts Service to enable that remote adoption.  The feedback is that it has been inconsistent and has been dependent from one court to the next, not even necessarily at the same level.  For example, one District Court might be hearing remote hearings while another circuit court up the road is not and so on.  It might depend on individual judges or perhaps it is a Courts Service decision but I am not sure.  It would be beneficial if a more uniform approach could be adopted because there are issues with access to justice arising whereby one county could be carrying out remote hearings whereas the county next door is on halt for six or 12 months or whatever.</p> <p>  In a similar vein, there is feedback from the Bar Council and others that the Covid safety standards, which should be paramount in the supports given to the Courts Service, are not always being met.  Again, there is a lack of uniformity in that certain court buildings and courthouses are leading the way in how safety measures and social distancing are carried out.  Those that are meeting physically are leading the way in how they are laid out and managed, whereas others leave something to be desired to put it mildly.  I do not know if any inspections or reports have been conducted by the Courts Service in that regard.  I suggest it might be useful if there were.  The Minister might comment on those matters.</p> <p>  This point came in under the Garda but I left this question under the Courts Service because it relates to courts.  The witness allocation under Vote 20 was level.  I would have thought witness expenses would be significantly down considering that there have been so few physical hearings.  I was surprised by that.</p> <p>  The Minister might comment on the capital works programme, which is down for obvious reasons.  She might tell us where that is and where it is expected to pick up when matters resume.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2021033000002#G00500"><p>We have two different figures.  The &euro;8.5 million was allocated for the overall modernisation programme and that is something that is being developed by the Courts Service, led by Angela Denning.  This is looking at the national plan but the &euro;5 million specific Covid funding that had been allocated was feeding into that as well in supporting various courts in developing their own ICT and technology.  I accept and the Courts Service would accept that it has not been rolled out uniformly across every court to date.  There have been challenges with the age of some of the buildings, the ability to access broadband and certain things like that and that moves into another space with the roll-out of the national broadband plan, which is in full swing.  Work is continuing and there is a plan that has been clearly put in place by the Courts Service, not just taking Covid-19 on board but looking at the long-term picture.  ICT plays a huge part in that.</p> <p>  We had the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 last year.  While that Act was introduced to deal with the Covid restrictions, it is also something that will benefit us in the long run in enabling people to partake in court sittings remotely and we have seen huge benefits, particularly in the area of domestic violence and in other areas where people have been able to access the various different sittings remotely.  Part of the &euro;5 million allocated under "other funding" has been used to try to make sure that our courts are safe and that we do not have people arriving in the same way they would have done previously.  In particular, courts might have been sitting in a way whereby everybody might be arriving at the same time in the morning and waiting to see when they will be heard.  There have been particular times given to people so that they arrive at an allocated time, which is another practice that I hope will continue and that is hugely beneficial, not just for those who are working there but more particularly, for those who are potentially having their cases heard on that relevant day.</p> <p>  On the capital works programmes, we are somewhat behind but at the same time work is continuing.  We have provisions for further new or refurbished courthouses in provincial cities and towns where facilities are substandard.  This includes Galway city, Wicklow town, Portlaoise, Tralee and Roscommon.  We have other locations such as Dungloe to cater for the Gaeltacht region.  We are developing a family law and children's court complex at Hammond Lane, which was allocated significant funding and we hope that work can proceed next year.  There is still some work to be done in finalising the plans for that.  We will have the modernisation and redevelopment of the Four Courts following the completion of the Hammond Lane project.  Then there is the construction of standard county facilities.  There are a number of locations included in this such as Dublin, north Kildare, Bray and Navan.  I mention the regional family law centre as well.</p> <p>  Due to Covid-19, it is hard to explain the precise allocation and timing of additional funding, when these projects will be completed or when some of them will be started.  Many of these projects are continuing and much of the work behind the scenes is continuing before the building is required to start.  Once we start to ease restrictions, further construction work can continue.  There have been some delays but at the same time there is a huge amount of work continuing in the background to make sure that these projects are progressing and that when time allows, they can have feet on the ground and sods can be turned.</p></speech>

It was interesting to hear about the development of the Hammond Lane project.  It is very important that there will be a new family court there.  If the committee will forgive me being parochial for a moment, I am glad to hear that north Kildare is on the list.  Kilcock courthouse closed a year or two ago and has not been replaced, and Naas courthouse is currently serving the entire county and parts of west County Wicklow.  It is great to see that issue is getting attention because it is badly needed.  I thank the Minister for that.</p></speech>

Many court hearings will be quicker and easier, with fewer prisoners and more video links and staggered times.  We have been calling for staggered hearings in Kerry for a long time to prevent the congregation of defendants and in order that prisoners would not all have to be put into prison vans at 6.30 a.m. or 7 a.m. to be taken together to the courthouse.  There would also be more flexibility regarding adjournments.</p> <p>  I am not going to pull any rabbit out of the hat for the Minister but rather raise the opportunities that these issues present.  There may be a new way of thinking about rural courthouses in particular.  While a decision was taken by the building section of the Courts Service in respect of Tralee courthouse, there is a new emphasis on town centres and a rural plan in the programme for Government.  Perhaps the Minister could examine the matter some day when she is on her way back to County Meath.  The heritage section of the OPW is located in Trim.  Could somebody from that section or an architect in the OPW take a fresh look at Tralee courthouse and consider, in light of all the changes, being more flexible about keeping it in the current location as opposed to moving it somewhere?  I acknowledge that the Minister gave me time on this issue a few weeks ago and I thank her for that.  Perhaps she could ask somebody to take a fresh look at the issue to see whether the courthouse, which has been there for 180 years, could be kept in the same place.</p></speech>

They examined the possibility of the courthouse remaining where it is, as well as other options including the Island of Geese site, which appears to be the site that has been selected for many reasons, not least that the development of the courthouse will allow for the expansion of its uses, which would be very beneficial.</p> <p>  While the introduction of additional ICT and capacity in that sense, and a move towards more remote working, is very beneficial, it will not apply in every instance.  There will be a significant number of cases where sittings have to happen in person, in particular for jury trials.  I fully accept where the Deputy is coming from and I think it is important that if the courthouse does not remain where it currently is, the building should be put to good use so that the community will not see an empty building.  Work needs to be done with the local council to identify what that potential use could be.  My understanding is this decision needs to be taken by the local council in conjunction with the Courts Service, but I am happy to revert to the Deputy on the matter as it progresses and to ensure all options are being explored.</p> <p>  Selecting the most appropriate site to ensure that the courthouse can be used in the best possible way, expand its services and benefit people not just in Tralee but also in the surrounding areas has to be everybody's over-riding objective, and I acknowledge it is the Deputy's.  At the same time, we must ensure that a gap will not be left in the middle of the town such that it cannot continue to support local businesses, shops and cafes and those who have benefited from the courthouse being there.  I will continue to engage with the Deputy on this.</p></speech>

I noticed a couple of issues under the heading A1, on capital works.  It is understandable that this year there has been a huge reduction in the level of funding, from almost &euro;20 million last year to just under &euro;5 million this year.  I assume that Covid and the restrictions on construction are having an impact, and we would expect that to be the case.  Nevertheless, I am interested in Hammond Lane, the family court project.  Does the Minister have an indication as to when that will be finished and operational?  I accept that Covid has messed up everything but I would like to have a timeframe for when she expects, all things being equal, the project to be finished.</p> <p>  The Legal Services Regulatory Authority was set up recently and funding has been given to it.  Some of the authority is operational and some of it is not.  It is an area on which I have received complaints from members of the public and others to say they are not getting the response, turnaround or engagement they would like.  I draw the Minister's attention to that.  Perhaps something could be done about it.</p> <p>  The next issue I raise crosses over all the budgets and I am not sure where it falls.  It relates to the joint agency response to crime project.  When people are being released from prison and return to the community, there are liaison officers who work with them.  The Probation Service, the Garda and the Prison Service work together and ensure that the pattern of people from deprived communities coming out of prison and going back in before long, a life cycle that unfortunately many people have experienced, can be broken if the proper intervention is made.  The joint agency response project has proven to be reasonably impactful in that regard.  What plans are there to expand and extend it and to make it the norm in those circumstances?  How much additional funding is being provided for it and how much will it take to make it the norm in all cases?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2021033000002#H00500"><p>On the capital works, we have had significant carryover in this Vote and in the Votes for the Garda, the Prison Service and all the other agencies.  There is an allowance for 10% carryover, so where that has been possible, that has been carried over and work is continuing where possible.</p> <p>  On the Hammond Lane question, I am hopeful that once we conclude our engagement with the Courts Service on the overall project, including the design, the scope and everything else, work and building could start towards the end of next year into the following year, that is, at the end of 2022 and the start of 2023.  I accept that seems a long time away but there remains significant work to do in regard to going through the tender process.  The hope is it will be completed and up and running by 2025.  The build will take two or two and a half years, given its size and scale.  While that may seem a long way away, we are talking about a significant project.</p> <p>  I take on board the Deputy's point about the Legal Services Regulatory Authority having received additional funding.  This is a new public complaints and professional conduct regime.  Last year alone, 1,800 files were opened, so a significant volume of work is happening.  The authority has also been asked to complete a number of statutory reports, two of which are under section 34 of the Legal Services Regulation Act and which I have laid before the Houses.  They deal, respectively, with the possibility of unification of the legal professions and the reform of the provision of legal profession training and education.  I have also asked the authority to explore the conditions of apprenticeships and devilling undergone by aspiring lawyers.  It is, therefore, undertaking a number of bodies of work, some of which has been directed by me and the Department.</p><p>At the same time, they have dealt with a significant number of files in the short space of time since commencing operations in 2019.  I take on board the comments made and I will respond to that issue.  </p><p> On the joint agency response project, JARP, this comes under the Garda Vote.  Earlier, I mentioned a figure of &euro;16 million in regard to youth justice.  There are plans for that, which will be published in the next week or two, along with youth justice strategy, to expand this further.  That will require additional funding.  We will have to examine that in the upcoming budget, but it currently fits under the Garda budget in regard, in particular, to youth justice, youth intervention and youth diversion supports.  As I said, taking into account the Dormant Accounts Fund funding, that budget is approximately &euro;16 million, made up of &euro;14.5 million and additional dormant accounts funding for this year.  The overall budget will need to increase in light of the recommendations of the new youth justice strategy.</p></speech>

That concludes our scrutiny of Vote 22 - Courts Service.  </p> <p>  We move now to Vote 24 - Justice, which is divided into a number of subheads but comprises two broad pillars, one being the criminal pillar and the other the civil pillar.  I remind the committee that this is a two-hour session and it is now 7.50 p.m..  If we are to get through all of the work we need to move promptly.  Are there any questions on Vote 24, pillar A - criminal justice?  If not, we will move to Vote 24, pillar B - civic justice.  Are there any questions arising?  As there are no queries arising, we will move to Vote 41 - Policing Authority.  As no member has indicated on this Vote, we will move to Vote 44 - the Data Protection Commission.  I wish to ask a question on this Vote.  If there are members who would like to come in when I have finished, I ask them to raise a hand and I will get to them.  There is a 21% increase in pay under this Vote.  Does that relate to additional staff or additional resources?  There is also reference to a 0% increase in non-pay administration, about which I have a concern.  As part of its work programme, the committee will undertake work in regard to the Data Protection Commission.  The Minister and the committee will be aware that the Data Protection Commission has been criticised in Europe recently in respect of its alleged slowness in reaching decisions.  There is a risk now that particular member states will begin implementing their own data protection regimes, which would be potentially detrimental to us not only in reputational terms but also economically if foreign direct investment, FDI, multinationals follow the regulations in the different member states.  That is of some concern.  The issue, in part, is the resourcing of the Data Protection Commission in terms of human resources, IT and other equipment.  It was reported in the media recently that staff in the agency use Lotus Notes and that it has failed to migrate to more modern technologies.  Given the Data Protection Commission is key to our economic offering and it is the regulator for all of the EU, for the time being at least, and in light of the threat posed by the alleged delays owing to undue bureaucracy in Ireland and within the offices of the Data Protection Commission - I await the response from the Data Protection Commissioner and her officials on this when we meet them - I am concerned about the lack of increase in its budget.</p></speech>

A significant portion of that increase has been directed towards additional staff, with the commission moving from a staff of 110 in 2018 to 150 to date.  Recruitment to fill many of those posts is still under way.  It is a competitive environment but I would expect that an additional 30 posts will be filled in the first quarter of 2021.</p> <p>  I mentioned earlier in my speech that &euro;12.8 million is for staffing costs, with a further &euro;2 million being spent on legal expenses.  Additional funding of almost &euro;5 million is provided for expansion of ICT and other types of measures that are required.  We are conscious of our commitment to deliver an effective data regulation and protection of data privacy rights of EU citizens, acknowledging that we have a large number of multinationals and corporations in Ireland.  The Data Protection Commissioner, DPC, and the organisation recently submitted a request for further engagement with me, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, to try to put in place a fit-for-purpose management and organisation structure not only for the next year but out to 2025.  We are working with the commissioner and her office in terms of their proposals.  Their submission for appropriate sanction and approval by DPER will have to be examined in due course.  Work is ongoing through engagement with the Data Protection Commission on what additional resources it needs.  Staffing is a huge part of that need.  I am confident that the funding that has been allocated, in particular the significant increase over the last three years, will provide for that additional need.  </p> <p>  In terms of the overall work, as I mentioned the DPC has submitted a request to engage further to map out how we can have a structure in place that will bring us out to 2025.  On the ICT budget, that is included as part of the increase for this year.</p></speech>

The Minister has committed to responding in writing to a number of questions raised by members on particular Votes.  I note that under the Courts Service heading, Tralee, north Kildare and Hammond Lane courthouses were discussed.  If the Minister could also provide a note on the status of each of those courthouses that would be useful.  She might also provide a note on any other matters outstanding, including the tender process for Garda uniforms.</p></speech>

My understanding is that pensions come under a different subhead, but I can send the committee the breakdown on that as well.  I will also send a note providing greater clarity in terms of the allocations around the training and services within the Prison Service.  In terms of the allocation increasing and decreasing, I will try to provide a better explanation to Deputy Pringle.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  On the pay and pensions issue, I note superannuation comes under a separate subhead.  I missed that.  The concern that arises is in regard to the defined benefit schemes and the other types of schemes we have in the private sector.  General Motors was a successful, profitable company yet its pension bill outweighed its profits and active workforce.  There is always a concern in regard to large organisations and whether their pension bills are sustainable and where they sit <i>vis-a-vis</i>the workforce.  I am curious as to how those figures compare, but there appears to be a healthy balance.</p><p>I thank the Minister and her officials and all members for attending.</p><p>The justice committee is very well served by our clerk, researchers and other officials.  It is Mr. Gavin Curry's last meeting today.  He is not with us in the room but has been a diligent member of the team.  The justice committee served him well and he has been promoted to the Journal Office, so I wish him all the best.  Our researcher, Ms Claudia Zelli, is moving to another committee in rotation and Ms Emer Hannon will run the team.  I welcome Ms Hannon and wish Ms Zelli and Mr. Curry every success in their new roles as they move on to the Journal Office and other committees, respectively.  I thank them for their service over recent months.</p></speech>

Can I take it that the draft minutes of our last public and private committee meetings of 23 March are formally agreed and that there are no matters arising?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Before we get into our discussion and debate, I want to pay tribute to an important and special lady in our committee.  Members will all know Pauline O'Neill, who is sadly leaving us today.  I have worked with Pauline in the previous D&aacute;il and in this D&aacute;il.  She is a lady and we will be lost without her in this committee in how she keeps the technical aspect and other aspects of the committee going.  She is leaving us today to go to another section of the House, namely, the Debates Office.  It will be very lucky to get her and we are very sad to lose her.  I congratulate her and wish her the best of luck on her move.  We hope we will still see her around Leinster House.</p></speech>

This meeting has been convened with members of the Irish Music Rights Organisation, IMRO, Give Us The Night and the Event Production Industry Covid-19 Working Group, EPIC, for a discussion on the impact of Covid-19 on the entertainment sector.  I welcome the witnesses to the meeting, who will be joining us remotely via Microsoft Teams due to the restrictions.  With us from the Irish Music Rights Organisation we have Mr. Victor Finn, chief executive officer and Mr. Keith Johnson, director of marketing and membership.  We also have Mr. Sunil Sharpe, founder of Give Us The Night and his fellow Give Us The Night spokesperson, Mr. Robbie Kitt.  I also welcome the members from Event Production Industry Covid-19 Working Group, namely, Mr. Liam Fitzgerald, chairperson of the Association of Irish Stage Technicians; and Ms Kim O'Callaghan, project manager and deputy event controller with MCD.  The format of the meeting is such that I will invite witnesses to make opening statements, which will be followed by questions from the members of the committee.  I am sure members have the speaking slots sitting in front of them so they know when and where to come in.  I ask them to speak to their time slots in order to give as much time to their guests to contribute as possible.  I will call each organisation to deliver their opening statements in the following order.  IMRO will go first, followed by Give Us The Night and then the EPIC working group.</p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I want to advise them of the following in regard to parliamentary privilege.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  If witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in the context of the identification of a person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  As our witnesses today are attending from outside the precincts of the Leinster House campus, they should please note that there are some limitations on parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.</p> <p>  I remind members again of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House to participate in this public meeting.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I ask members and witnesses to identify themselves when contributing to the debate for the benefit of the Debates Office staff who are preparing the Official Report.  I ask members and witnesses to mute their microphones when not contributing in order to reduce background noise and feedback.  I ask that they use their raise hand buttons when they wish to make a contribution.  I also remind them to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  With all that housekeeping out of the way, I am delighted to get to the most important aspect of today's meeting, namely, the contributions from our witnesses.  I ask Mr. Finn, CEO of IMRO, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

We license and collect royalties from radio, TV, online platforms, streaming services, cinema and a host of entertainment venues and we distribute this remuneration to our members monthly.  The vast majority of our members are small, self-employed SMEs and sole traders, enriching Irish society and culture with their music but who earn, at the best of times, an uncertain livelihood.</p> <p>  At the outset, it is important to acknowledge the significant support measures established by the Government across the wider business community, including the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  Music industry-specific measures announced by the Minister include: the live performance support scheme; the music industry stimulus package; increased funding for the Arts Council; and the increases in mental health supports.  All these supports are much needed and welcomed by the entire sector.</p> <p>  The creative sector has taken the brunt of the effects of the pandemic.  The full closure of indoor and outdoor events has severely impacted the arts, culture, live entertainment and events sectors.  We know that ongoing social distancing measures will mean severe restrictions for some time to come.  The livelihoods of many artists and creative workers are threatened.  The October 2020 EY report for the Arts Council indicates that of the 55,000 workers in the sector, 58% are currently wholly reliant on the PUP or EWSS.  The non-funded events sector accounts for 90% of the 5 million tickets sold in Ireland each year, contributing over &euro;3.5 billion to the national economy.  It is estimated that for every &euro;1 spent on a ticket, an additional &euro;6 is spent in the wider tourism economy.  However, many companies are now in grave danger of not reopening.</p> <p>  The sector fully understands the measures are necessary to protect public health and fully supports public policy in this area.  However, the effect on the entertainment sector will be much more prolonged than in any other area of economic activity.  The projected decrease in jobs in the arts is 15.5%, much higher than the 9.7% projected for the rest of the economy.  Workers in the cultural sector need to be supported if it is to avoid enormous long-term damage through a depletion of skills and talent caused by migration away from cultural work and towards more stable sources of income.  Therefore, measures are needed to address income insecurity in the sector.</p> <p>  IMRO has identified three key policy initiatives that should be prioritised.  First, there should be a roadmap for the reopening of live entertainment spaces.  It is widely acknowledged that the live events industry will be among the last to open up.  However, it is imperative that we use this intervening period to fully prepare for its safe reopening.  We need to plan now in order to have a safe return to live events once the pandemic has passed.  This means detailed planning with all the interested stakeholders in good time in order that the public can have confidence that indoor and outdoor venues are safe and suitable spaces to host live music and entertainment events again.  A representative stakeholder group encompassing all available expertise across public and private participants should be established in order that cultural providers can engage with public health experts and other stakeholders to design guidance and support mechanisms for the reintroduction of safe public engagement in cultural activity, including examining the potential of vaccination passports for attending live entertainment events.</p> <p>  Second, we are calling for the implementation of the EU copyright directive.  The move to online performances during the pandemic has further heightened the importance of copyright protection in the digital economy.  In 2019, the European Parliament approved the EU directive on copyright in the Single Market.  This directive seeks to close several loopholes in existing copyright legislation.  Contrary to their intended purpose, the so called safe harbour provisions of existing laws create an unfair advantage for large global online platforms when negotiating with music creators.  The tech platforms either do not pay at all for creative content or pay much less than the market rate in some instances.</p><p>Online content-sharing platforms obtain unreasonable value by enabling their users to share copyright content without ensuring that underlying rights holders receive a fair share of these revenues.</p><p> The EU directive's aim is to create a well-functioning marketplace for authors and performers.  A key goal of the directive is reducing the "value gap" by ensuring the profits made by Internet platforms, on the one hand, and by content creators, on the other, are fairly shared, encouraging collaboration between these two groups.  Artists&rsquo; earnings from digital performance would be maximised if the Government introduces the copyright directive without adjustment or dilution.  This would ensure rights holders receive a fair and proportionate income linked to the economic success of their work, providing them with alternative and badly-needed income streams.</p></speech>

There will be another opportunity for him to express his thoughts and views.  If he does not mind, I will move on to the next group.  I thank Mr. Finn for the presentation.  I call Mr. Sunil Sharpe from Give Us the Night.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1377" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sunil Sharpe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021033000002#B00300"><p>The impact of Covid-19 has been swift and brutal on our industry.  Jobs have been lost, businesses shut down and a way of life frozen until further notice.  This is in marked contrast to many other industries that have continued on without too much disruption.  To complicate this further, our venues are now under threat, as business owners and landlords consider more financially viable uses for these spaces, which may lead to changes of use and redevelopment.</p> <p>  In the absence of a clear roadmap, the Government is causing uncertainty for all types of venues and events, and the associated workforce.  Next month, trial events take place in Liverpool, with a full return for all venues and nightclubs in the UK scheduled by June, and this follows a host of similar trial events around Europe and beyond.  In Barcelona, a 5,000 capacity rock concert with no social distancing has just taken place, and that followed a successful 500 capacity club event in the city last December.  We have been advocating since last summer that Ireland plans trial events, starts small, learns from the experience, and builds up to being ready for a workable reopening.  A specific plan, including pre-event testing and the use of vaccine passports, now needs to be laid out.</p> <p>  We acknowledge that a full reopening cannot happen until a significant amount of the population is vaccinated, but we find it hard to understand why no specific targets, dates or guidelines have been published by the Government to indicate to the whole industry what reopening may look like.  Instead, we have a roadmap from last September that even at level 1 would not be sufficient to allow most entertainment spaces to reopen and stay in business.  Given the amount of international best practice information that is at our fingertips, and the knowledge that exists within our domestic entertainment industry, it is frustrating that Ireland is lagging so far behind in terms of an actual plan.</p> <p>  While some of the recently-announced supports will benefit the entertainment and cultural sectors, it likely will not be enough to cover everyone.  The live performance support scheme, LPSS, looks like it could be oversubscribed with applications, with many deserving venues and promoters that may miss out.  Given the financial burden that is being imposed on the national Exchequer due to supports like this, it is vital that Ireland develops a safe but realistic reopening plan that will remove the need for much of the financial support required by the industry.</p> <p>  It is imperative that we see investment come back into the industry and that existing operators do not leave entirely.  Community spirit has been crushed in the night-time industry in recent years and, needless to say, crippling insurance costs have been a big factor in this.  Insurance for music venues and nightclubs is prohibitively expensive, far more than other industries, and some owners have described the role of running venues as feeling like they are &ldquo;working for the insurance companies&rdquo;.</p> <p>  While we value the role of festivals and large-scale events, we also measure the health of our entertainment and night-life sector by the regular weekly offering in our cities and towns, and, in particular, our venues and cultural spaces.  These are the incubation spaces for communities to grow and for independent spirit to thrive, and, crucially, where performers and workers of all types can learn their trade, as well as earn a living.  These venues have been mandated shut for over a year now and will struggle to get back on their feet or to return at all.  All of them will need specific improvements to meet the new safety demands of Covid-19 and will quite likely have to prepare for a period of restricted numbers and small profits, if any at all.  Rent arrears is a big issue for many businesses, and without sufficient reopening grants that take this into account, we may not see venues last long enough to give a return on the State&rsquo;s support.</p> <p>  We need the Government and local authorities to recognise that without places to socialise and dance, we are removing opportunities for people to connect and further creating division in society.  We also need to get serious.  As our population increases and the country becomes more built-up, it is becoming more and more difficult to run events and entertainment venues for fear of local resident objections.  A fresh approach to noise management, sound-proofing and mediation needs to be developed as soon as possible.</p> <p>  We also need to acknowledge the impact this has had on people&rsquo;s social lives and mental health, and create daytime and night-time activities they can partake in.  The finger-pointing needs to stop.  People need to live and businesses need to reopen.  There needs to be a more strategic approach to reopening this time, unlike last year.  Large gatherings of people in a city or town centre will require a different level of planning, akin to large-scale event management, that could involve industry professionals working alongside local authorities and the Garda.</p> <p>  In addition, stakeholder forums should be set up within every local authority and should be inclusive towards all parts of the entertainment, cultural and hospitality sectors.  We also believe there should be plans for staggered closing times to alleviate on-street crowding.  It is a good opportunity for on-trade businesses to continue to sell food and non-alcoholic offerings, if such demand is there.  There has been a general feeling since the shutdown of the industry that now is the best time to introduce a new way of experiencing our cities and towns that is less restrictive and more diverse.  Given the recent announcement regarding licensing law reform, which will include extensions to trading hours, we believe these extensions should be introduced in the short term in advance of the long-term legislative changes that will take some time to be enacted.  We also believe that special exemption order costs should be reduced by 75% with immediate effect and be payable online rather than in court.  This would be with a view to abolishing this archaic system in the long term, and rolling out an online system for all licences and permits in the coming months.</p> <p>  In conclusion, we pay tribute to the young population of this country who have been among the most well-behaved of any country throughout this pandemic.  We believe that local authorities should work with young cultural communities to help design and re-imagine outdoor public spaces as we enter the summer months.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and committee members for listening.  Mr. Robbie Kitt and I will be happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1379" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021033000002#B00500"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to give evidence today regarding the plight of our industry.  EPIC is a working group of independently elected representatives from the live production sector and is a foundation member of the wider industry grouping, the Event Industry Alliance.  EPIC includes representatives from the Association of Irish Stage Technicians and the Live Venue Collective.  Hence, we speak here today for a very wide range of organisations, companies and individuals throughout all facets of the live event and entertainment industry.</p> <p>  As the pandemic enters its second year, venues, promoters and businesses have spent their cash reserves surviving 2020, topping up salaries and meeting fixed business costs such as rent, insurance, building maintenance, security and utilities, all against a backdrop of having little or no turnover to fund such expenditure.  We have seen some successes from supports, such as the LPSS, and with the extension of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, helping to maintain as many of our workers as possible.  However, there have also been large parts of our sector left behind, such as our supplier SMEs, of which only 4% are eligible to access the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  We are at present engaging with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and hope to swiftly bring forward supports for those who have been neglected so far.</p> <p>  In addition to the financial effects of the past year, it has been very challenging mentally for those working in the industry.  The lack of clarity about the road out of this crisis is compounding those effects on the mental health and well-being of the workers in our industry.  We are grateful for the support shown to Minding Creative Minds and hope it will be long-lived.</p> <p>  Looking forward, there are many hurdles still to navigate as we contemplate the reopening of live events over the coming months.  One of the most important concepts for us to convey is the potential for lag in our industry reopening.  Over the cycle of planning, marketing, selling tickets, rehearsing and building, the time from the proverbial gates opening for our industry to meaningful income for our workers and SMEs will be between six months and year.  It is vital that the planning starts in earnest as soon as possible.</p> <p>  It is of the highest urgency and importance to swiftly form an expert working group, as put forward in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media task force recommendations, with key experienced stakeholders around the table, to develop the criteria, mechanisms, supports and timeframe in parallel with Government policy and the roll-out of the vaccination programme.  Advancing a sector-specific, strategic roadmap, developed in partnership with the various Departments, the HSE and relevant authorities to ensure the safe reopening and operation of venues and events, will enable us to put thousands of people back to work across all levels of the sector, but we need to start the months of planning now.</p> <p>  We know that no one has a crystal ball and that no one can tell us right now the exact date we will be reopening again.  However, we need a series of mile markers from health experts showing us, for example, that when X% of adults are vaccinated, we can do such a scale of an event, and when Y% are vaccinated, the events can advance up to another level.</p><p>To be clear, we are not looking, and never will try, to open when it is not safe to do so.  Our industry's fundamental core value is taking care of our audiences and staff.  Every decision we make every day when we are planning and executing an event is about safety, welfare and enjoyment of our attendees.  We are looking to open when it is safe to do so but we need mile markers to allow us to build towards this so that the lag between it being possible to open and being actually able to open is as short as possible.</p><p> We are an integral part of the cultural fabric of society.  The live entertainment industry is an ecosystem and all of its aspects are needed for it to survive: the talent of the artists, the venue for the promoter, and the contractors and crew to pull it all together.  For every &euro;1 spent on a ticket in Ireland, &euro;6 is spent as a result in the wider hospitality and tourism sector.  It is vital to the economy.  Live events were responsible for &euro;3.2 million bed nights in one year recently.</p><p> Without the assurance of sufficient supports until the sector fully recovers, and with the delay in activating the expert working group, some of Ireland's most iconic and live entertainment venues and promoters will be forced to implement plans to shut down entirely or for the foreseeable, long-term future, and to implement extensive lay-offs.  This is an industry of entrepreneurs and businesses who have forged their own path. They are highly skilled and dedicated people who have invested their own time and money to create events and experiences to allow others to make memories that will last a lifetime.  This was a thriving industry prior to Covid and it will be again.  We need a hand up now, not a handout, until it is safe for the industry to open at full capacity.  We need some help now so that, in turn, we can drive the rebirth of our economy by recovering the spirit and optimism of the nation.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

I will ask all of the groups to reply and to split the time among themselves.</p> <p>  I welcome all of the witnesses.  I will open the discussion by asking all the groups about the night economy.  Do they all agree that reform of trading hours is an essential part of the stimulus needed for the hospitality and entertainment sector when it reopens?  If so, why does each organisation support this?  Would our guests also acknowledge that there is a demand among people who attend the gigs created by the sector, for the kind of nightlife that our European neighbours enjoy, be it 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. opening hours?</p></speech>

The public are demanding greater flexibility in what is open, when it is open and how they can socialise and enjoy our urban spaces.  We would absolutely support that.  It should also be a lot simpler to obtain extension licences for such premises.  It is a very expensive process at the moment and this is an ideal opportunity to simplify that procedure.  We would fully support that.</p></speech>

It is one of the main things we are pushing for with our campaign.  Now, as the dust settles after Covid-19, there has been a lot of talk about the Roaring Twenties.  Everybody probably expects that when nightlife resumes there will be a new level of engagement in the night-time economy that perhaps was not there a couple of years ago.  I am not sure, however, how long that roar will last.  It could die down very quickly within a couple of months.  At that point we will need to allow people to decide what they want from night-time events rather than having very restrictive times imposed on them.  Being able to add more flexibility to what they do and offer will be crucial for businesses.</p> <p>  There is a lot of talk about multipurpose spaces.  We can see this in yesterday's report on rural Ireland and some of the policies that may come in there.  If we are considering multipurpose spaces and different businesses sharing spaces it will be vital to have flexibility, part of which will involve the opening hours.  We would absolutely be behind this, but in different parts of the State and various cities it would depend on whether there was more demand.  All types of spaces should be able to operate as far as customer demand is there.</p> <p>  It does not all have to revolve around the sale of alcohol.  There has been much discussion on alcohol and how people may react to alcohol during Covid times, which is one of the reasons we are likely to have restrictive times in the short term.  Over time, however, we need to be ready to lift those restrictions and be ready to move into the future with a more open and flexible approach.</p></speech>

The Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, has also made public comments about it.  It remains to be seen what comes before the Houses.  I agree with Mr. Fitzgerald that for this to work we need to bring everyone around the table.  We cannot delay this forever.  Ireland does not enjoy nearly the flexibility that exists in other European cities.  There is certainly a demand from young people for real change in this area.</p></speech>

I have three questions but I will leave most of my time for the witnesses to respond.   I thank the group representatives for their work in the live music and events industry.</p> <p>  Mr. Fitzgerald referred to the contractors, the crew and the support industry, which are not spoken about enough.  He also touched on the support network with the hospitality sector.  The committee heard from the Irish Hotels Federation last week that 17% of the sector's trade in Dublin depends on concerts and events, which is gone at the moment.  Mr. Noel Anderson of Lemon and Duke also appeared, representing the Licensed Vintners Association.  He spoke of losing a number of his employees, including head chefs, who have become hauliers and carpenters and who have left the industry.  Has Mr. Fitzgerald any sense of contract and support staff in the events industry who are just simply leaving?  Have they communicated this to the event production industry working group?  Where do we stand on this?</p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Finn on live music events.  In my home town of Navan, our music and theatre venue, the Solstice Arts Centre, is closed.  It is only when one walks by one realises how much it is being missed by people in the town.  On the issue of artists selling tickets now, events are being marketed for September, October and November.  Is IMRO liaising with the management companies in how they are selling those full-capacity events, when it is possible that this is not how these events will transpire and they could suddenly be deferred until next year?  Does IMRO agree with this policy of selling full-capacity events right now with the potential that this will not be the case?</p><p>Mr. Sharpe's contribution was extremely engaging.  It will exercise the minds of many people around the country.  Navan is one of the few towns in the country that proudly flies the purple flag for our night-time economy.  We have done so consistently over the past number of years by engaging with our local nightclubs, The Palace and Fortyone, our live music venues and our food and drink and entertainment sectors.  We have brought all of them together to make sure we have a safe environment.</p><p> This is an important debate and Mr. Sharpe touched on it in regard to the plan launched yesterday.  Two forces are coming together.  We are trying to get people to move back into town centres again and, at the same time, balance that by having a vibrant night economy.  Now is the time to engage with local authorities to make sure the planning laws are addressed.  I served on a local authority for many years.  There is no point getting to a scenario where live music event managers find themselves in court trying to promote events if we can now get the planning laws right.  </p><p> We have development plans in progress across the country at the moment.  As the representative bodies and its members are now engaging with the consultation and development plans, we can address this matter.  It crosses so many issues, including planning laws and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which will communicate information to us about the influx of thousands of people, because venues outside Dublin will have thousands of people piling onto the streets at 3 a.m.  We also have to consider how to make sure people get home safely by liaising with the taxi industry and public transport in all the various cities and towns across the country.  I ask the representatives about their engagement with the planning authorities at this moment as we go forward and, hopefully, build that economy.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we have received quite an amount of information about substantial numbers of people leaving the industry.  There is quite a specialist group of people we use to climb high places and hang structures in entertainment venues.  Many of them have gone to work in steel construction and on building sites and so on.  We do not know whether we will get these people back.  There is a terrible risk that skills retention will become a major issue in the industry.</p></speech>

The Senator's question is more for the promoters and venue owners.  However, throughout the pandemic, the entire industry has been extremely careful in ensuring that it constantly follows public health guidelines.  Everyone in the industry is fully mindful of that.  I have no doubt no events will be held that will contravene public health guidelines in any way.  We totally support our colleagues in the industry on those measures.</p></speech>

It is great to hear that there are even a few nightclubs left in Navan.  It is a testament to the local area, which has been really looking after its night-time economy and nightlife.  I am with the Senator on all his points.  We have had some input into the Dublin City Council development plan.  We have given our feedback and we are hopeful about what it might soon publish, although it will still take some time.</p> <p>  On planning, I will not say let us rip up the rule book but let us see more real time decision-making, particularly when it comes to the use of outdoor space.  Many businesses can take control of the space near them because we will move outdoors more.  The preservation of space is another matter for development plans, which is another conversation again.  We need to preserve our spaces so they do not get knocked down and become something else, particularly our entertainment spaces.  However, we also need to empower existing businesses now so that they can return to the industry without fear of being put under extra difficulties they should not be put under at this point.</p></speech>

I agree that when a certain percentage of our population is vaccinated, we should be in a position to start reopening events.  I concur that the groups before us need to know the plan in advance, so that as we hit certain percentages we will look at opening areas, within regulation.</p> <p>  From the point of view of IMRO, Mr. Finn spoke about fee percentages and the advent of online platforms.  What percentage reduction has there been on fees collected for members?  How much does IMRO feel it is not able to access because of the current regulations relating to music on the various online platforms?</p> <p>  Mr. Fitzgerald mentioned there was a certain percentage not accessing funding from schemes.  What areas within the industry have not been able to access any funding, payments or supports?  This question may be for Mr. Fitzgerald or Mr. Sharpe: has the funding put in place for hosting online events been successful?  How much participation has there been from the public in those online events?</p></speech>

Our total revenue is down in excess of 30%.  In the public performance area, which includes live events, cinema and general entertainment events, our public performance revenues are down almost 70%.  It is absolutely devastating for our members' earnings from royalties.</p> <p>  In the online space, we want to see a rebalancing of the revenues under the copyright directive.  The giant tech platforms have built global businesses on the back of creative content without fair sharing of that online revenue.  That is what the copyright directive seeks to redress and it is why we need to implement it before the 7 June deadline this year.  We want it to be implemented without any dilution whatsoever.  It is really a critical juncture for us and our members in that regard.</p></speech>

They have been a success, but the next question is how we make improvements to the venues.  It does seem the venues where many of these live streams take place are under a lot of pressure and need long-term infrastructural support.  One of the more positive recent supports announced was the &euro;5 million for live-streaming set-ups within all these venues.  That is very positive.  More grants coming down the line, such as soundproofing grants, will also be very useful for venues.</p> <p>  Some people argue that a lot of work goes in to putting a live stream together and they are not always sure the feedback they get has worked all the time.  Maybe that money could be just given to them.  However, the online events have been useful and it is great to have had State support for them.  Let us see how long they will last.  I would say that, overall, they have been successful, but some people say they could be getting on with other projects if they had that money in their back pockets and did not have to do an online event. </p></speech>

A sound or an audiovisual supplier, the people who supply the fences, barriers, the queueing systems, the ticket checking or scanning systems and all manner of suppliers of stewarding security such as that do not have premises, and in particular, do not have public-facing premises in many cases.  These are the people who have been hardest hit so far in not being able to access supports.  One is talking about warehouses with millions of euros worth of lights and sound equipment, for example, and miles and miles of fencing that should normally be surrounding fields at this time of year, and it is instead gathering dust in warehouses.  Clearly, rent still has to paid on those warehouses and on the insurance for that equipment.  They also still have leases and loans in many cases on that equipment.  We are working very hard on this at the moment, in co-operation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to try to come up with a scheme that specifically targets these businesses because there have been schemes that specifically targeted certain parts of the tourism industry but the supplier SMEs have been left behind somewhat at this stage.  They have been shut for 12 months now because without venues being open they cannot earn a living.</p></speech>

I have three themed areas and I will run through them; our guests can come back to me with questions or answers on any of them.</p> <p>  Proposals have been made over the years on having a night mayor for Dublin.  Said quickly this sounds like nightmare as in dreams, but I am talking of a night mayor.  Do our guests believe that this would be of value to their sector and that it would be feasible to have one in smaller cities?</p> <p>  Second, our guests have referred to the number of people who have lost their jobs due to Covid-19&rsquo;s impact on the sector and the reality of how many will possibly continue to not have a job in the future.  Do our guests believe that the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, or the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, helped their employers as much as they would have liked?  Are there any discussions in their sector around the need to formalise employment practices so as to protect workers?  I understand the nature of the sector and how it works but there were many people who found themselves falling between the stools of being able to access supports.</p> <p>  Finally, there are opinions and discussions around the introduction of universal basic income, UBI, for the arts sector.  Do our guests believe that something like this should be extended to skilled workers in the entertainment industry who are essential for the delivery of arts events?  I understand that within the sector, having worked in it, employment is not as regular as in other sectors which is one of the reasons there is discussion around UBI.  Do our guests consider that something like this should be considered or extended for skilled workers in the entertainment industry?</p></speech>

I would need to see the job description or terms of reference.  I do not know what our views would be on this or what the intention is there.</p> <p>  PUP and EWSS have helped significantly to protect some existing employment.  We have welcomed that and it has been very beneficial to our industry.</p> <p>  Universal basic income, UBI, was a recommendation of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce and was also in the programme for Government.  Yes, we think it is worth examining further by extending it to a pilot scheme for a period of three years and would like to have it as inclusive as possible to allow us to look at the results of the pilot scheme in light of other international comparators in order to see how it works.  It has merit and was one of the main recommendations of the task force.</p></speech>

I am always trying to subtly change that term because it does have different meanings.  I will agree with the idea and we pushed for it.  The way it is going now, that role is looking like it might be something similar to a night-time economy adviser.  My concern there would be that it would all be based around economy rather than culture as well.  That raises the question about whether we may need a number of people involved in that or whether it is going to be a role for just one person.  We have seen one person take on that role in other large cities and it has been nearly too much work for one person.  One could have committees in smaller cities, towns and areas, or a commission within a city like Dublin.  It has yet to be worked out.  I understand that there will be pilots of this idea in different parts of the country and it is likely that an individual or some kind of group will also come together in Dublin.</p> <p>  The next question is who is going to pay for it and this would be a big question for many people.  It should be trialled and somebody should be looking after and overseeing our economy at night.</p> <p>  The PUP payment has definitely helped a great deal.  As to the UBI payment proposal I definitely agree with it and to ensuring that it extends out to all types of creative workers and not just to a narrow range or number of people involved in the arts.</p></speech>

The only issue upon which we are getting feedback from our members at the moment is that we are approaching the point whereby they cannot afford to pay out the wages in the first place in order to claim them back through the EWSS.  That is due to the level of fixed costs they have been dealing with without support.  That has been one problem.</p> <p>  As to the freelance staff, the PUP has been successful in retaining as many as possible in the sector.  </p> <p>  On UBI, it was a recommendation of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce from the Department that one of our members, Mr. Pearse Doherty, sat on.  He was a member of it so we would wholeheartedly support all of the recommendations in that recovery plan.</p></speech>

It has been very interesting to listen to our guests&rsquo; contributions and I congratulate all of them as a group for the &ldquo;noise&rdquo;, for want of a better term, they have made.  It has been very cohesive and constructive, they have achieved a great deal and have had many wins particularly in respect of the support schemes.  I was delighted to see the &euro;25 million that was allocated for the live performance support scheme because I saw some of the beautifully produced and very creative work that was done in some of our most famous live venues.  They were able to do this with &euro;5 million so I cannot wait to see what they will do with &euro;25 million.</p> <p>  Turning to Mr. Fitzgerald first and to EPIC, I am aware that the challenges that are being faced by some of the sound and light suppliers has been touched upon already.  I understand that there are up to approximately 300 businesses potentially caught in that bracket where they cannot avail of the CRSS because they are not front-facing or deal with the public and because of that they cannot get Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SPCI, loans.  This has already been touched upon by him and although I do not have a particular question I express my 100% support to him on this point and I hope that discussions with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment go well and that he gets a resolution to that issue.</p> <p>  I have a question that I would ask him to deal with at the end on the talent loss.  There was a situation where many of our most talented events professionals went to the UK because that was where the work was.  We were then able to create a situation where the work was actually here in Ireland.  Is there a fear now that that will flip back and we will lose all of that talent to the UK?</p><p> I thank Mr. Finn for his comments.  We have spoken before about the implementation of the copyright directive and I am 100% behind him in that regard.  It is galling to see the social media giants profiteering from the incredibly hard work and talent of our artists.</p><p> I wish to raise a concern expressed by some venue owners in my constituency regarding the talk of a flat-rate charge by IMRO for live streaming.  I understand a public consultation process is ongoing on that issue.  Can the witnesses from IMRO update us on where that consultation stands?</p><p> Will Mr. Sharpe elaborate on how a reopening might look?  All the business owners, artists, engineers and others in the sector crave the certainty that is not there at the moment.  Has Mr. Sharpe had any consultation with public health advisers as to what percentage of the population must be vaccinated before we can see scenes here such as those we saw in Barcelona?  We are very far away from the scenes we saw in New Zealand but what is happening there and elsewhere must give us some hope and positivity that there is a future for these types of events.</p><p> I am aware that in talking to each other here today, we are, in effect, preaching to the converted.  I would love to have the people here who have the answers and could potentially put the provisions in place that would help the witnesses.  I would be grateful to have answers to my questions, starting with the one to Mr. Fitzgerald about talent loss.</p></speech>

Talent loss is a big concern to us.  One of our main concerns centres around the lack of the clarity and certainty that would be generated by having what we would call a roadmap with mile markers on it.  Our fear at the moment is that we might see both staff and artists being offered work abroad.  If technicians, sound engineers and others do not have certainty in this country about when we are going to see movement towards reopening, they might hedge their bets by moving abroad and we may not get them back, as has been the case many times in the past.</p></speech>

We are currently engaged in a consultation process, which we kicked off ten days ago, on the live-streaming tariff.  We are consulting with venues, promoters, members, artists and writers to elicit their views, with the intention of drafting a tariff proposal that we will send out to the industry for further discussion.  The consultation is open for a further three weeks and we will give ample time to discuss the tariff with the industry.  That is how we deal with all tariff proposals.</p></speech>

I speak to others in the events industry for whom that conversation would be more of an ongoing, everyday engagement in an effort to open up - I will not say it is a case of applying pressure - a dialogue on reopening.  I do not want to say that they have not been successful but the engagement has not really got to the level or stage they would like it to have reached.</p> <p>  A task force is to be established to deal with the reopening of venues and events and I hope it will be inclusive.  There was no mention in the reopening plan of music, late-night venues and nightclubs.  They were left out of the plan.  It is imperative that the proposals are inclusive and do not apply just to seated venues and places with very small capacities.  We need to be inclusive and get it right in planning for what the full reopening will look like.  It will involve amplified music venues and lots of people coming close together.  We must get the process right and it must involve everybody.</p></speech>

The entertainment sector has taken the brunt of the effect of the pandemic and it is hugely important to listen to those involved and examine their experience of how the State has responded to meet the challenges.  My first question is for Mr. Sharpe.  What ideas does Give Us The Night have around the type of stakeholder forum that could be set up within every local authority and how that might contribute to a more inclusive approach to entertainment culture and the hospitality sector?  I come from a town in the west, Castlebar, with a population of less than 10,000.  In the past, we had three nightclubs and a very vibrant night-time economy, but that has shifted somewhat.  I would like Mr. Sharpe's views on how large gatherings in towns like Castlebar could be put together around different scales of events based on good planning and the involvement of local industry and professionals working together.</p> <p>  I compliment Mr. Fitzgerald and his colleagues on EPIC's ongoing work and campaigns to date.  He mentioned in his opening statement that only 4% of supplier SMEs are eligible to access the Covid restrictions support scheme.  As public representatives, we have had a great deal of engagement with audiovisual event business owners who are finding the situation really frustrating.  These SMEs keep rural Ireland alive and the people involved are important professionals with a particular skill set.  Will Mr. Fitzgerald comment on the experience of his members in this regard and his interaction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment?</p> <p>  My final question is for Mr. Finn.  He mentioned that the live performance support scheme may be oversubscribed.  What would he like to see included in that scheme and how should it be administered?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1422" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sunil Sharpe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021033000002#F00800"><p>I thank Deputy Dillon for his question.  An issue I have noticed, certainly since we joined the conversation on the night-time economy and nightlife industry with local authorities, is that many of the stakeholder groups are not involved from the start.  Owners of restaurants, pubs and venues are not in the conversation and they should be, instead of being seen as just another business that is taxed to the hilt.  They are treated almost like an enemy and sometimes there is not the level of alliance that there should be.  In fairness to local authorities, they have reacted well in terms of waiving rates and whatnot, but the alliance needs to be strengthened as we move forward.  We need to have local stakeholder forums that involve others who should be in the conversations, including residents and business groups.  Health officials and the Garda also need to be involved.</p> <p>  Local authorities are, by default, the bodies that will host these engagements and they need to step up their game in terms of their role in promoting arts, culture, hospitality and so on.  Some are good and some need to step up a little more and widen the remit of what they do in the area of culture and hospitality.  We all saw a lot of scenes, many of them on social media, of what was happening on certain streets and in particular locations around the country.  Nobody seemed to be taking responsibility for what was happening and, invariably, it was the pubs or venues involved that got the blame for everything.  We need to ensure we do not go back to that kind of situation where everyone is gone AWOL and no one is taking responsibility.  Ultimately, some of those particular stakeholders got the blame for everything.  Everybody needs to work together and form these types of groups sooner rather than later.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I will give a sprinkling of statistics that might explain the position of many of our SMEs.  About a month ago, we contacted a number of the SMEs that supply infrastructure to the industry.  A total of 285 different companies responded to us.  Two thirds of them were businesses and one third work sole traders.  More than 50% of them do not pay their rates directly.  They either pay via a rate-rent bundle with their landlord or they use premises that are shared tenancies.  As a result, their names are not listed as ratepayers which is preventing them from getting certain local authority supports.</p></speech>

They have taken on board that particular topic.  To give an idea of the hole that some of these people are in, the average fixed costs for those 285 companies were &euro;3,500 per week.  They have been paying that for the past 52 weeks without support.</p></speech>

It should be fair and transparent.  It should be available to the widest possible genres of music and entertainment.  The application process should be as simple as possible.  Those are our comments on that.</p></speech>

I do not pretend to be an entertainer because I cannot sing and I cannot dance.  It has been 12 months since live entertainment shut down.  I have spoken to many artists from Dundalk and throughout County Louth, and the big disappointment is that there is no roadmap.  They need clarity and I do not believe the Government helped recently by stating there is no sign of any hospitality opening until at least the middle of summer.</p> <p>  As someone who comes from the Border area, I am very concerned about this.  The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has stated the UK will open up and lift all Covid-19 restrictions from 21 June, which includes festivals and large events.  I just hope there will not be an epidemic of people going across the Border.  I have recently spoken to people in the area, including sports people who play a bit of golf and everything else, and they have already arranged to play golf in the North.  It is very important for us all to work together.</p> <p>  Last November, there was talk of a cross-departmental stakeholders forum.  It seems to be all just talk.  I was hoping the Minister and all the groups would get together.  Is there any update on that situation?  I am very concerned.  I know the Government keeps claiming the vaccine is coming.  It is something we will need to look at.</p> <p>  I want to talk about the grant money that was recently announced.  In November 2020, there was a &euro;5 million allocation for live performance supports.  Two weeks ago, the Government gave a further &euro;50 million.  I have spoken to many artists.  Is that money being distributed fairly?  I know there is a very high criterion to qualify for that.  Is the person on the street who is doing the hard grafting getting any of that &euro;50 million?  Having spoken to a few of them, I do not believe they are.  That is one of my major concerns.</p> <p>  I know many commercial companies are getting the wage subsidy and individuals qualify for the pandemic unemployment payment.  However, I am really concerned about the artists.  I have spoken to some of them who are doing online courses and are going away from the game.  Ireland has a great name for entertainment and especially live entertainment.  I would hate to see our people going.  I believe the buzzword in future will be outdoor because I cannot see much happening indoors.  Are there any plans for live entertainment in the summer?  I know tickets are being sold for concerts.</p> <p>  My main concerns relate to the North reopening on 21 June and whether the money the Government is giving is going to the right people.</p></speech>

Regarding the distribution, I believe the Deputy is mainly talking about the LPSS.  We certainly felt the LPSS was a very successful scheme.  In fairness, the previous scheme was a pilot with limited resources.  The new scheme is ten times bigger.  Some people did not get to apply the last time which was due to its size and scale.  We felt that what was given out was very effectively used.  Hundreds of hours of work were given to technical staff and artists.  We expect that to be ten times bigger this time.</p></speech>

I repeat what I said already.  It is important it is perceived to be fair and that everybody who is entitled to receive support from the scheme has a fair chance of getting it.  That perception needs to be reflected in practice.  It also needs to be available across the board to all genres.  I reiterate what I said that it needs to involve a simple application process without undue bureaucracy.</p></speech>

I had some technical difficulties the last time I was called.  I want to respond to the concerns about people travelling to the North.  I believe that is a very valid concern and it emphasises why we need this roadmap for reopening as another part of mitigating the effect of the virus.  It should be regarded as a priority because things are starting to happen up North.  From our conversations with operators up there, there are plans to have full festivals operating by September of this year.  Tickets are already on sale for those types of events.  This is a concern.</p> <p>  As the Deputy has said, outdoor events are the priority here.  Sports and outdoor exercise activities are already seen as necessary for people's mental health.  In the same way, it could be said that entertainment and cultural activity outdoors that are properly organised could be just as safe.  I agree with the Deputy on that.  Regarding the concern about people travelling up North, people are desperate to socialise.  This is something that is coming down the tracks and needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

I also wish Pauline O'Neill all the best in her future position.</p> <p>  Most of the questions have already been asked.  What needs to happen now on the copyright legislation?  The opening statement indicated that IMRO supports educational workshops.  Do people in the sector have any specific training needs as we come out of the pandemic?  Is consideration being given to drive-in concerts and drive-in cinemas?  How do the witnesses feel that pre-event testing would work here?  I agree with some of my colleagues' suggestions.  We have a bit of a problem with the British opening up in June, which means that highly skilled workers who need to feed their families will just go.  That is a major problem.</p> <p>  I have a question for the representative of Give Us The Night.  Should there be a central insurance regulator?  How should local authorities engage with cultural communities regarding outdoor spaces and, obviously, trading hours?</p></speech>

It is imperative, therefore, that we get legislation in place by 7 June and that, as I said, it does not dilute in any way the spirit and text of the directive as it stands.  I will hand over to Mr. Johnson, my colleague, on education initiatives he may have on the future.</p><p> EPIC is probably in a better position to comment on the point on pre-event testing, but it sounds to me that pre-event testing could be problematic in terms of the time it would take to do pre-tests.  However, I think that is better left to the health authorities and the concert organisers and should be an item that is dealt with by a stakeholder group, as I said in my opening statement.</p></speech>

It is my view that we should try to nationalise insurance.  Having a central insurance regulator has to be the way forward.  We talk a lot about entertainment spaces.  I refer to anywhere that will open at night and involve dancing.  I mentioned this earlier, and even Noel Anderson mentioned it last week.  The reason he got out of the late-night game was that his premium went from &euro;7,000 to &euro;49,000 or something like that in a very short number of years.  We argue a lot about the licensing costs, but the insurance costs are an even bigger issue for a lot of venues.  That has to be sorted out and venues have to be part of that conversation.</p> <p>  As for pre-event testing, we have seen a number of examples from abroad that have been forensic in their analysis, including their post-event analysis.  We can learn from those experiences and be ready to make a couple of mistakes here and there as well.  It is not all going to run perfectly at the first attempt.  One thing about pre-event testing is that it is not the most pleasant of experiences for people.  Also, the price for it would need to be worked out.  It might work for larger events, but how will that work for our weekly venue circuit, regular events or even venues one does not pay into?  Who will pay for it?  Can it be subsidised in some way?  Will we need to put in very large orders in order to bring the price of that down around the country?  These are all questions to be asked, but I hope that conversation will start and gather momentum soon.</p></speech>

There were a lot of them.  The key point to get across is that the health and safety of the public is always at the forefront of everything we do.  A major issue for us, which has already been raised, has been the requirement to implement a working group with experienced personnel within the industry who can sit down and look clearly at what the requirements are in working with the HSE and all the relevant authorities.  The HSE and the Garda will need to work with all the stakeholders that will look internationally at what is happening and look at all the experience we have.  We have some of the top-level people worldwide within the industry in Ireland, and we need to take that into account.  From where we are sitting, we have no mile markers or roadmap.  If we could urgently get this working group in place, we could sit down and start addressing all the ideas that have been raised and all the topics and options.  We will always keep the health and safety of the public at the forefront of everything we do.</p></speech>

I was struck, when my colleague, Senator Cassells, started talking about the vibrant nightlife in Navan, by how fortunate I am to be from Gorey, where we have a great night-time economy.  It is exactly as the Senator said: it is only when we lose it and do not see it that we appreciate how much we have missed.</p> <p>  Many of the issues have been touched on, but one point, on which some of the witnesses might respond, is that when we recover from all this we will have to look at brand Ireland.  We really appreciate how important our cultural identity is, and I think our nightlife and music will play a big part in that.  What should we be doing to build that brand?  We talked about the licensing laws.  How can we be seen as the global venue for the night-time economy?  Do the witnesses have specific thoughts on that?  I am conscious that the skills shortage issue was mentioned.  Are there specific areas in our education and training systems where we need to address the skills shortages and look at specific programmes as to where the industry is developing?</p> <p>  I have a very specific question for Mr. Finn.  I agree with him on the copyright directive.  As to how musicians and artists can generate income, has he given much thought to the growth area of non-fungible tokens, NFTs, and does he feel that will be a way for musicians and artists to generate more income?</p> <p>  I was struck by what Mr. Sharpe said about learning from experiences and we will make mistakes and so on.  Given the outdoor and indoor events that have taken place in Barcelona and Israel, what are the lessons from those for us?</p></speech>

NFTs are a really interesting development in the digital delivery of any creative assets.  We are examining internally how NFTs could be extended to the IMRO membership and how we could facilitate that for members who want to use this really new technology to deliver value.  Initially, it looks like it could have potential for protecting creative works in the online environment and could be a very seamless and transparent way of receiving payment.  As the Senator will be aware, it is a very hot topic at the moment and still very new, but we are looking at it.  I thank the Senator for the question.</p></speech>

As to how we change brand Ireland, we just need to get more of our creative communities properly involved, allow promoters and collectives to become more involved, give them access to spaces, give them venues and make them part of the team.  They cannot always be on the outside.  Of course, when they are a success we look to claim them as successful artists and musicians, quite often when they have left the country.  In addition, we need to empower younger people, particularly the working classes.  There is more and more of a divide and it is widening all the time.  What we saw a lot last year was that the blame was levelled at many younger people, whether at house parties or congregating outdoors.  Rather than trying to help them, we try to blame them.  The thing is that many of those people are the creative future of our country.  We really need to be serious about that and recognise it, rather than try to brush problems under the carpet.  We need to involve everyone.  A lot of the cultural richness of so many countries, including our own, comes from the working classes and from areas where many people live in poverty.  They tell it how it is from the streets, from their areas.  We really need to be serious about that and not push perhaps just one or two success stories but really get serious on a local level and ask them what they want and what kinds of spaces they want and not just supply what suits us.  When I say "us", I mean those in authority, whether local authorities or older generations.  We need to listen.  Finally, on that, it is one thing being a little older and being young-minded as well.  Older generations need to remember what it was like to be young to help support our younger communities and our creative forces of the future.</p></speech>

We have done such a phenomenal job to date with brand Ireland.  Recent statistics from prior to Covid show that over 500,000 people have travelled into Ireland for events.  It is huge internationally to be getting those people coming into the country.  It is essential to maintain that going forward with a view to improvements.  More can obviously be done but, again, it comes back to the point that we need to move forward now.  It has been over 12 months.  There is no roadmap and no milestones.  We need to start planning so that, internationally, people can start planning to come to Ireland to see the phenomenal events we put on.</p></speech>

I thank each of the witnesses for the work they do every day to support our cultural and creative economy and I thank them for joining us today.</p> <p>  I agree with expanding the night-time economy and with every word of what Mr. Sharpe said five minutes ago.  We urgently need to look at this.  Thankfully, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and others in Cabinet are now taking this challenge very seriously.  We promote ourselves worldwide, quite rightly, as one of the world's leading lights and as a beacon of cultural creativity and fun due to our famous - or infamous, whichever way one looks at it - craic.  All of that stops at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., 365 days of the year.  That has never made sense to me.  In European cities such as Brussels, Barcelona, Madrid, Rome and so on, people are allowed the liberty and freedom of engaging in cultural creativity and cultural activity 24-7, which is the way it should be.  Let us make that happen to ensure we can see the kind of new ideas and new innovation emerging from people whose function it is to create new ideas and innovation.</p> <p>  Mr. Fitzgerald referred to supplier SMEs.  I have consistently made the case to the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy English, that there is one final cohort of people within this sector that has not been supported.  I have been advised very well by the Music &amp;amp; Entertainment Association of Ireland, which has been an excellent advocate for those people, including our musicians and suppliers, who are yet to receive some sort of compensation for their accumulating costs and lack of income.  Hopefully, we will see something emerging on that issue quite soon.</p> <p>  I have a few quick questions for IMRO.  Again, this is an issue we could discuss for hours.  In a world where content creators have a direct line to content consumers and record labels are no longer a necessary intermediary between the two, has any country successfully created an independent streaming platform for its own content creators that effectively channels revenue and income directly to the songwriters who create the content?  Has anybody done that successfully and if so, is that something we can emulate?  What are the most pressing and necessary reforms of Ireland's copyright legislation that would yield direct and immediate benefits for our songwriters right now?  How IMRO charges venues must be examined.  The Valuation Office recently re-examined how it approaches the valuation proposition for venues up and down the country.  Rather than basing the valuation on a very primitive and, frankly, inaccurate measure of square metres or square footage, it will now base it on the income or turnover of each venue, which is much more fair and sustainable.  Those are my questions for IMRO.</p> <p>  I have one question for EPIC.  The entertainment sector is now receiving significant funding.  How do we ensure that a very large part of that funding trickles down to the content creators, including the musicians and actors who grace the stage and the playwrights who make amazing things happen?  How do we ensure that all the supports that have been put in place by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, who has done an excellent job, trickle down eventually to the people who make things happen in the first place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1454" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Victor Finn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021033000002#J00300"><p>First, streaming platforms tend, in the main, to be private or public companies.  They do not tend to be run on a national basis.  However, if the Deputy is talking about streaming and audiovisual video on demand services, one of the most successful global services is the BBC iPlayer.  We should be providing RT&Eacute; with the investment to develop its own online presence to a much greater degree, including a global presence.  It could be a portal for Irish culture and creative content.  We are missing a huge opportunity, although in fairness to RT&Eacute; it needs funding to do that.  That would be a real window to the world for Irish creativity and it is an opportunity we are currently missing.</p> <p>  I am very interested in the valuation proposition.  We are always looking for simpler ways to apply our licensing.  Believe me, we want the simplest way possible to apply a reasonable and fair tariff to all our customers who use music in whatever way they do.  We would be very interested if the valuation proposal were published or made available to interested parties in order that we could rely on that valuation.  I thank the Deputy for bringing that to our attention.</p> <p>  The most pressing copyright reform needed is in the context of the copyright directive.  We need to get real value from the online environment and from the very large tech companies that have built huge global businesses on the back of creativity.  The creative sector simply has not shared in that large revenue stream.</p></speech>

With regard to the LPSS, as I said, the pilot seemed to have a lot of success before Christmas and quite a few hundred artists were involved in the various types.  Hopefully there will be more rounds of the scheme but the way this particular round of it can be best implemented in terms of spreading the love, so to speak, is to embrace as many different types of entertainment as possible within it.  Many sectors managed to move quite quickly the last time.  Live music was quite well represented but other sectors of entertainment and art did not get off the mark quite as quickly and areas like electronic dance music and so on were not represented the last time.  We will probably see more submissions on the likes of that this time.  Opening it to as many different facets of the industry as possible will be the key to getting as much of the funding to trickle down to as wide a footprint as possible.</p></speech>

I do not want Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Finn or Mr. Sharpe to take what I am going to say as criticism because it is not.  As the Chairman said, I have much experience from radio, some TV work and promoting artists in the past.  I have a fair bit of experience.  It is sometimes interesting to sit back and listen to a debate and the one thing I felt was coming through today was talk of revitalising the businesses, theatres and outdoor venues.  However, the reality for the majority of musicians is that their working environment is in pubs and function rooms.  While that was briefly mentioned, little was said about it.  That is the backbone of much of the revenue that comes out of this business.  Mr. Finn and others have made very important points but IMRO collects royalties and I would like to see more input from musicians and bands.</p> <p>  Deputy Cannon and others have mentioned that the money is not trickling down to some of our smaller artists.  Many performers, engineers and musicians are not in a good situation financially.  Those people do not really get anything out of royalties because royalties go to composers and arrangers.  Roosky is a small village not far from where I live.  If a local singer in Roosky performs "Sweet Caroline", for example, and submits his live playlist, it will be Neil Diamond who gets the royalty and not the performer.</p><p>Perhaps today is not the day to discuss it, but some day I would like to hear Mr. Finn explain the royalty process for both recorded and live performances because we have to look at all of these issues now due to what Covid has done.  We must look at things completely differently.</p><p> I do not wish to take from the good contributions that have been made here and the good work that has been done.  In many respects the Minister has given support.  Mr. Finn was involved in distributing a grant for IMRO previously.  First Music Contact, FMC, distributed the grant.  Is there any intention to deliver another form of that grant?  Is that possible?  I would welcome his comments on that.</p><p> In general, it has been a good debate and discussion.  I would like to see more engagement with the musicians on the ground.  Let us not forget that while it is important to talk about theatres, it is also important to talk about live music, which will be very important because of Covid.  I believe Covid will be here for a long time.  We must address the issue of where the bulk of the musicians are coming from and their work environment, which is the pub and other places such as ballrooms.  It is a huge factor financially on all of those.</p></speech>

I want to be clear: IMRO only represents songwriters and the owners of the underlying copyright.  We do not represent artists unless it is in their capacity as a songwriter.  Anything IMRO collects relates to the royalties from writing and composing the song.  That is the first thing.  There are other organisations which manage artists' royalties such as Recording Artists Actors Performers, RAAP, and artists also receive income from record labels.  If they have a record label, they receive artists' royalties from it also.</p> <p>  We announced an emergency fund for the music industry that we funded in partnership with the record industry and Spotify also contributed.  It was open to other contributions as well.  It was administered by FMC at the time.  Unfortunately, we only had a limited amount of funds available to put into that.  It was limited to &euro;750 at the time.  As I explained earlier, our income has suffered hugely.  We have had to be very careful in terms of what we spend on members' royalties going forward also.  I hope I have answered the questions.</p></speech>

It is a subject very close to my heart and to our campaign.  In terms of pubs and ballrooms, pubs are the long-term home of music of any existing industry that we have at the moment so they must be part of this conversation.  The next conversation that needs to open is how we develop a new strategy for music, recognising traditional music, modern music, and everything in between.  We have a rich musical heritage in Ireland, and we need to celebrate it, from the past into the future.  In our campaign we look back to the dance hall era.  We are inspired by the showband era because it shows what one can do by opening up a whole country to musicians.  We should have a venue circuit with a register because we do not have enough.  So many venues have shut, but we have many existing spaces, including pubs.  As Senator Murphy said, there are function rooms.  We know that many spaces are now being used for weddings and there are many spaces we would love to get our hands on for events but we must look at what we have.  We have arts centres, theatres, and pubs, and many of them do not have enough business and they need to be used as music spaces.  Music is mentioned less and less.  It is part of the arts, but it needs its own recognition.  It falls through the cracks.  I do not know if Senator Murphy looked at the rural report yesterday.  Did he see how many times music was mentioned in that?  It was mentioned once in 128 pages.  The only time it was mentioned was in terms of the tourism strategy.  I am with Senator Murphy on that.  We need more spaces and we need to put the spaces that we have to better use, and we need to reimagine other spaces.  Hopefully, one day we might even build venues again.  I am with Senator Murphy on all of that.  Music has to be part of culture.</p></speech>

I assure him that all levels of artist are always at the forefront of everything we are looking at as well.  We completely understand and appreciate the importance of small clubs in fostering the next generation of talent.  My own sister is a musician and I am very aware of what is involved as I watch her create her career.  I have very close friends who are musicians.  We are by no means just looking at a certain area of the industry.  We are very conscious across the board.</p> <p>  In EPIC we have included within our working group members of the live venue collective.  They are on the committee with us and we get feedback from them on trying to address the lack of venues across the entire country.

That draws the slot to a conclusion.  I thank Senator Murphy.  We can certainly feel his passion and experience in his contribution.</p> <p>  I also have Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh online.  He wants to speak with the witnesses and hear from them today.  I am sorry.  We thought we had Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, but we do not.</p> <p>  The final speaking slot falls to me.  I begin by thanking all of our contributors here today.  Their passion for what they do and who they represent is palpable.  Having listened to the debate and discussion, I acknowledge that many pubs, ballrooms at the back of hotels and nightclubs seemed to come to the end of their era before Covid ever happened.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, recently made a major announcement on the regeneration of towns, villages and city centres around the country through the urban regeneration and development fund.  That money is going directly to local authorities.  Cavan County Council, for example, has received more than &euro;14 million for the Abbeylands project and Monaghan County Council has received more than &euro;30 million for its Dublin Street project.  From what I have heard today and from what I know, the music industry and the night-time economy should be playing a big part in regeneration, opening up the main streets and reimagining and repurposing towns and cities right across the country.  Perhaps I am overstating it, but I get a sense from what Mr. Sharpe said today that there is a further opportunity and platform for an input from the night-time economy and businesses in the entertainment sector to make to local authorities in reimagining town cores.</p> <p>  I invite all the organisations - Ms O'Callaghan, Mr. Kitt and Mr. Johnson - to wrap up and sum up everything we have discussed today.  I call on the witnesses to focus their ask into three tangible measures that the committee could recommend to the Government in its report to reignite, reimagine and repurpose towns and villages to bring about the reopening of pubs and clubs, many of which have really gone out on a limb in terms of the massive mortgages they have taken out to keep them open.  I know from business people that it takes constant reinvestment to do that, to keep young people on the streets and to open up the night-time economy.  I seek three tangible measures that we could ask of the Government to ensure the reopening of the country and of towns and cities post Covid.  I really want to get to the crux of the matter in terms of the responsibility of local authorities in all of this.  I feel there is an element of them and us in the discussion and perhaps that has been the case traditionally.  We must have a collective, cohesive response to all of this.  From what has been said today, I think there is a real opportunity to do that.  What more can we do with the investment that is being made in local authorities?</p><p>What are the three asks of each of the organisations in terms of what needs to be brought forward by Government to ensure the most positive reopening of the night-time economy, artists, musicians, pubs and clubs?  I invite Mr. Finn to respond first.</p></speech>

The second ask is more resources for local authorities to develop public spaces that they own as safe locations for entertainment to take place.

Development is going to happen very quickly and we are going to lose many more spaces.  We need a cultural clause to guide developers.  We need to ensure that within all of the development currently under way there will be cultural spaces.  It is not good enough to allow developers to do what they like with these spaces.  They are privileged to be given the opportunity to take over vast swathes of our cities and towns and they must provided something in the way of cultural amenities.  That is top of the list.</p> <p>  Second, we need flexibility in terms of regulations.  There needs to be a transparent online system for licensing and permits that is quicker and ensures everybody knows what is going on.  Ultimately, that will be cheaper as well.  </p> <p>  Third, we need to be inclusive of all creative communities and provide the necessary supports.  As I said earlier, it is important that all in the sector, including those in entertainment, culture and hospitality, are listened to.</p></speech>

We need SME supports and we need event insurance guarantee schemes such as those coming across the line in Holland and Denmark.  If I could sneak in a fourth ask, there is need for support from local authorities and State agencies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE in terms of developing, with the expert group, the protocols and making the planning processes as efficient as possible for the next year at least, if not longer.</p></speech>

We need long-term support for music education in general.  Professional development is critical for us longer term.  The issues around brain drain and professionals going overseas were mentioned earlier.  We want to avoid that.  We want to ensure that the next round of professionals coming through are world-class.</p></speech>

It is all about building up the sector.  The small incubator venues are important to the health system of the entertainment industry.  As mentioned in terms of the damage that has been done and compounded by the pandemic, historically social activity has been categorised in the past by its anti-social qualities.  It is important that into the future its importance in terms of our psychological lives is recognised.  As important as lockdown measures have been in terms of controlling the virus, I do not think anybody has experienced as much anti-social experience as we all have over the last few years.  Going forward, we need to re-frame out entertainment activity in more positive terms.</p></speech>

We need to be forward-looking in rebuilding the sector.  That is our objective.  As an industry, we work extremely well and we are very creative.  We want to continue to do that going forward.  We are seeing shining lights of hope internationally as events are starting to happen.  In terms of the industry as a whole and the public, everybody wants to get back out there and to have the events that we have all come to know and love so well.</p></speech>

We are waiting with bated breath on the announcements of Cabinet today.  She can give us a heads up and run it by us to see if we are happy with them or not.</p> <p>  The D&aacute;il ordered the following Revised Estimates be referred to the committee for its consideration: Vote 31 - Department of Transport; and programme A of Vote - 29 Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  I remind members that the committee has no role in actually approving the Estimates.  It is an ongoing opportunity for the committee to examine departmental expenditure, to make the process more transparent and to engage in a meaningful way on relevant performance issues.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, I welcome Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, and her Department officials to the meeting this afternoon.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the statements of a witness are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks. It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus should note there is some limitation on parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present.  Witnesses participating in this meeting from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind them of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the places in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members participating via Teams, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, to make her opening statement.  We are conscious of time and I note she had made reference to an abridged version of her statement.  I thank the Minister of State for that.  Within the confines, we have to be out of here by 6 p.m.</p></speech>

I will proceed with my opening statement.  I thank committee members for the opportunity to present the 2021 Estimate for the Department of Transport and for programme A of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The set of transport Estimates before members provides an overall gross allocation to the Department of Transport of &euro;3.556 billion, which constitutes &euro;1.029 billion in current and &euro;2.527 billion in capital.  In addition, &euro;151.48 million in capital carryover from 2020 will be invested in 2021.  We are using the funding to provide ongoing services, protect services which are impacted by the Covid-19 emergency and to continue to invest in maintaining existing infrastructure, as well as continuing to develop new infrastructure with a focus on climate change.  This funding for 2020 represents a &euro;500 million or 16.4% increase on our investment levels for 2020.</p> <p>  In line with the Exchequer guidance in advance of the 2021 budget, the Department has stayed largely within its existing level of expenditure for current expenditure which excludes emergency supports.</p><p>In total, &euro;443.1 million in additional emergency funding has been provided in 2021.  This constitutes &euro;426.6 million in current and &euro;16.5 million in capital.  My budgetary focus for 2021 is threefold.  First, I want to ensure that where non-Covid current expenditure is concerned, the Department remains within budget.  Second, I want to monitor Covid expenditure closely in order to identify pressures as early as possible.  Finally, I want to ensure that the capital budget is fully invested and that existing capital programmes are progressed as quickly as possible under the circumstances to deliver the infrastructure planned under Project Ireland 2040 and the programme for Government ambitions.</p><p> I will turn now to aviation.  The core non-Covid investment in the regional airports during 2020 will be approximately &euro;31.5 million.  This includes ongoing public service obligation, PSO, support to the regional airports via the regional airports programme.  The sum of &euro;10.15 million is allocated to cover costs associated with our membership of international organisations such as Eurocontrol, and recurring costs such as air accident investigation insurance.  The Covid crisis has severely impacted the aviation sector.  To mitigate the impact in aviation, an additional &euro;41.6 million has been provided.  The purpose of this funding is to provide additional supports to the regional airports and to Cork and Shannon airports.  The sum of &euro;16.5 million in capital supports has also been provided for investment in Cork and Shannon airports.  In 2020 the Government sanctioned &euro;15 million to meet the costs of repatriating or refunding customers affected by the collapse of tour operator businesses.  A total of &euro;1.9 million of this contingency was required in 2020.  The sum of &euro;15 million has again been provided in 2021 and the situation concerning travel and tour operators will continue to be monitored.</p><p> The land transport programme, programme B, which is the largest programme by far in my Department's Vote, representing approximately 94% of our overall budget, will increase this year by &euro;459 million to &euro;3.339 billion.  Most of that increase is a step up in investment in roads and mass transit services.  The main components of the programme are in the longer submission I have supplied to Members.</p><p> The most significant current expenditure allocation is &euro;674 million to public transport PSO funding.  We will continue to support strongly the delivery of socially necessary but financially unviable services throughout the country.  This constitutes &euro;304 million in existing level of service funding for 2020 and &euro;370 million in emergency funding.  The &euro;340 million was provided in the budget to provide additional support to PSO services.  The outlook was uncertain at budget time and continues to be uncertain, with ongoing level 5 restrictions since Christmas meaning that public transport has been running at 25% of total capacity since then.  The crisis also continues to have an impact on commercial bus services.  A sum of &euro;30 million has been provided to continue to support temporary PSO contracts entered into in late 2020.</p><p> Sustainable mobility investment continues apace.  There is a significant ramping up of investment in active travel measures in order to meet the &euro;360 million average investment agreed in the programme for Government.  In 2021 funding is being provided to support 468 different cycling and walking projects.</p><p> In relation to the existing rail networks, &euro;623 million will be invested in heavy rail, light rail and bus maintenance and development.  Of this, &euro;203 million will be invested in the infrastructure manager multi-annual contract, IMMAC, rail maintenance and renewal programme.  Investment in 2021 will progress rail fleet renewal and expansion, in particular the transition away from a reliance on fossil fuels towards low-emission vehicles, LEVs.</p><p> Improvements in bus services also continue, with more than &euro;130 million in funding provided for the transition away from diesel to hybrid and LEV fleets.  The BusConnects programme in Dublin continues to progress and plans are being developed to progress BusConnects in regional cities.</p><p> We continue to target new and innovative ideas to help to decarbonise the transport sector.  We have provided &euro;36.5 million for the electric vehicle, EV, grant scheme as the EV market continues to grow steadily.</p><p> Approximately &euro;1.413 billion is available for the roads improvement and maintenance programme.  With this, we will continue to provide grant support for the national, regional and local road networks.</p><p> Road safety is of paramount importance and our support for the operations of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety will continue.  There are ongoing significant backlogs in driver theory testing and driver testing at the Road Safety Authority due to the public health measures in place.  We are continuing to monitor the situation in conjunction with the RSA.  The RSA is primarily self-financed and is continuing to meet its statutory obligations without Exchequer assistance.</p><p> Funding for the maritime programme in 2020 is at &euro;108.15 million or 3% of the Vote.  Most of that funding is directed to the Irish Coast Guard and the main cost here relates to the search and rescue helicopter contract.  The programme also funds the Commissioners for Irish Lights, which operates buoys and lighthouses to keep seafarers and their cargoes safe while in Irish waters.  We also cover various administrative costs associated with the Irish maritime administration.  We will continue the Coast Guard building programme to ensure the volunteers have adequate facilities for their operations and equipment and we are investing in IT infrastructure to enable the teams to further enhance how they work together.  The sum of &euro;1 million has also been provided to Wexford County Council to assist in the cost of environmental remediation works in Rosslare Port as part of the transfer of the port to management by the local authority.</p><p> Programme A concerns the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Overall, almost &euro;248.5 million is being allocated to the communications programme in 2021.  This consists of &euro;14.98 million current and &euro;233.5 million capital, including &euro;15.247 million capital carried over from 2020.  The biggest item of investment within this programme is the national broadband plan at &euro;225 million including capital carry-over of &euro;15.2 million.  High-speed broadband has the capability of completely transforming how people live and work.  I do not need to expand on that, as Members will be aware of it.  The national broadband plan contract is the largest infrastructural project in rural Ireland since rural electrification.</p><p> The Estimate for Eircode postcodes is &euro;1.5 million.  Eircode postcode usage continues to grow and is used widely among the public, businesses and public sector.  In March 2020, the daily lookup limit on the free Eircode postcode finder website was increased from 15 to 50 in response to the Covid-19 crisis for members of the public and businesses locating addresses.  As a result, the ten-month total for March to December 2020 was 24.3 million lookups, a 46% increase on the same period in the previous year.  The Estimate also includes &euro;5.1 million operational funding for the National Cyber Security Centre and &euro;3.5 million for the National Digital Research Centre.  I will stop there.  I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I wish to raise supports for taxi drivers with her.  I will refer to a number of the measures taken.  There was &euro;150 for the suitability test.  There was a one-year extension, not a rollover.  If taxi drivers were at nine years last year, they got an extra year, but they are faced with a significant cost this year.  Why was that not rolled over as opposed to reintroduced?  Taxi drivers cannot avail of many of the Government supports that exist.  They cannot get loans.  The restart grant plus the &euro;1,000 is gone since the end of October.  These are front-line workers, who work very closely with people who do emergency work for the State in many cases and they transport people and products to and from hospitals.  As I see it, the big intervention from the Department was a scheme directly related to EVs that has had a very poor uptake.  The sum of &euro;36.5 million was provided in the form of supports for EVs.  When I compare that to other Departments where similar workers were badly affected, for example, in the live performance sector, &euro;50 million was injected into the sector.  The money went right to the front line.  Some &euro;45 million is in current spending and &euro;5 million is in capital spending.  Why was this approach taken?  Will the Minister of State review the approach to ensure that the Department's effort is directed where the money is needed, as opposed to a scheme that while it is necessary might not be needed in this shape and form at this time?</p><p>Taxi drivers have said they are struggling to make ends meet.  I am not saying this for dramatic effect; taxi drivers and their representatives are in regular contact with me.  They are really struggling and the response from the Department does not come anywhere close to providing anything real and meaningful for them.  I ask the Minister of State to address that.  Will she take stock of and reflect on the take-up of these schemes?  Will she review how the lump sums are being injected into the sector?</p></speech>

I will refer that matter to the Minister.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's points on the uptake of electric vehicles, I agree that we need to make it more attractive for taxi drivers who are providing public transport services across the country and private car users.  If we want to reduce emissions, electric vehicles will be a significant contributor to reaching our targets out to 2030.  It is critical that we invest in them and encourage and put in place policies to support private car users and taxi drivers to be able to use electric vehicles, and put in place the supports around that.</p> <p>  I will pass on the Deputy's concerns about taxi drivers to the Minister.  I will revert to him with a more detailed response.</p></speech>

We appreciate that funding is an issue, but my concern is how the limited budget available is directed.  At this point in time I emphasise in the strongest terms that funding should be directed towards survival and recovery in the first instance.</p> <p> A related issue is aviation sector workers, and cabin crew in particular.  The Irish Aviation Students' Association, IASA, guidance issued in the past number of days reflected the WHO vaccine prioritisation list for transport workers and stated that they should be prioritised, recognising the work they do.  When will cabin crew be vaccinated?  I am conscious that we are all probably getting push notifications from media outlets telling us that the Irish vaccination priority list is to be reviewed and moved to an age-based roll-out after those aged over 70, vulnerable groups and those with underlying health conditions have been vaccinated.  </p> <p>  Very many transport workers, including cabin crew, will not fit into those categories and will feel today that they are further away that ever from a vaccine.  Can the Minister of State give any indication as to when cabin crew, in particular, and transport workers more generally will be vaccinated?</p></speech>

We are all very conscious in the Department and in any agencies under our remit that everyone should be vaccinated as quickly as possible.  It is important that we are led by public health advice and politicians do not make decisions about who get vaccinated but are instead guided by NPHET and the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC.</p> <p>  We are all concerned about the speed of the roll-out of the vaccination process.  We need to ensure that flows.  We know that from April, May and June almost 1 million vaccines per month will come into the country.  It is about accelerating that process.  I will be guided by public health advice, as all of my ministerial colleagues at Cabinet have to be.  </p> <p>  I would love to be able to give the Deputy a date, but from a Government point of view we want the most efficient vaccine roll-out over the next few weeks and months, targeting the most vulnerable and those aged over 70.  I am getting into an area that is not my remit, but we all know we need to target the most vulnerable first, which includes those aged over 70 and those at high risk.  The Taoiseach will speak about this later.</p></speech>

Many of them are struggling to make ends meet and are dependent on the school bus transport scheme.  Many operate outside of the State Bus &Eacute;ireann scheme and are essentially unsupported, outside of the general schemes that are available in fairness to the Government.  They are unsupported by the likes of the Bus &Eacute;ireann subsidy and are struggling to make ends meet.  They are in a precarious position because schools have been closed for so many weeks.</p> <p>  They have specifically asked that the scheme whereby they can remain in receipt of PUP and work and earn at the same time be extended to allow them to get their buses back on the road until such time as schools are fully reopened so that they can tax their buses and ensure they are in a roadworthy condition.  Buses have been laid up and no income has been coming in.  As soon as the schools return there will be demand for their services.  </p> <p>  I am referring specifically to non-State, non-Bus &Eacute;ireann services.  I estimate that such services carry approximately 60,000 children to school on a daily basis.  Is this something that the Minister of State is aware of?  Will she consider addressing this situation?</p></speech>

I am very aware that there are a lot of pressures in a lot of different sectors within the public sector.  School transport comes under the Department of Education; it does not come under this Department.</p></speech>

I raised this with the senior Minister, in fairness, and he made the same point.  Bus operators the length and breadth of the country asked me how he does not understand the difference in what we are saying.</p> <p>  The Department of Education, with Bus &Eacute;ireann, operates the State school bus transport system.  I am talking about school bus operators who operate outside of that system and carry in the region of 60,000 children a day to school.  They are falling between the cracks.  I know I am out of time, but I ask the Minister of State to take that information on board, bring it back to the Department and give it some real consideration.</p></speech>

We appreciate her attendance.</p> <p>  Yesterday I was one of a number of Deputies and Senators in the mid-west who met the chambers of commerce from Shannon, Ennis and Limerick and the Irish Hotels Federation.  They held a very informative meeting, including a lengthy PowerPoint presentation, on how they envisage a safe return to international flying.  I want to put some points to Minister of State based on that meeting.</p> <p>  There is a commonality of purpose within the sectors and those of us who represent this part of the country politically.  There is a real need for a multi-annual capital expenditure programme for regional airports.  What happened last autumn was very welcome, in terms of support for Shannon, Cork and other airports, but it could take five or six years for there to be a recovery in aviation to 2019 levels.  Has the Department examined further funding for 2021 and a continuation of that in terms of a multi-annual programme for the years that follow?</p></speech>

We are constantly engaging with the aviation industry, which has a direct effect on the issue he mentioned, namely, the Irish Hotels Federation, international travel and the reliance on tourism in the mid-west region and across the country.  He outlined the supports that have been, and will continue to be, provided by Government.</p> <p>  I reiterate that the Government has put in place supports worth more than &euro;200 million for the aviation sector.  There was a revised support package last year totalling &euro;80 million to specifically target the sector and ensure our airports would be in a position to recover and rebound when the time is right.</p><p>That commitment remains and we are constantly watching and assessing the whole industry.  </p></speech>

That work is ongoing.  It is important that I mention that I am meeting with industry.  I am having a second meeting tomorrow of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, on which ICTU is represented.  The Minister and I held a meeting of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, which contains the CEOs of the main airlines and the airports.  A subgroup of that forum is looking at a roadmap for what we need to do now and what we need to do over the next few weeks and months because we are coming out of this and there is hope and light at the end of the tunnel as vaccines are rolled out and we need a plan and roadmap in place.  This is why I and my officials am engaging on a weekly basis with the aviation industry with regard to what this recovery will look like.  It is very important that we are planning and engaging with ICTU and the airlines with regard to what this recovery will look like.</p></speech>

It must be backed with funding and I am sure this will be forthcoming from Government.  Another key issue is route development and retention.  I know that across Europe, there was an easing of the rules that typically applied to the holding of landing slots at hub airports but from midsummer onwards, we need funds to attract new routes and retain existing ones.  It is essential.  We will need to see PSO routes out of airports like Shannon.  It will be all the more essential now with Brexit.  Shannon and the west of Ireland, and the Minister of State is from the west, are all the more peripheral geographically since the UK crashed out of the EU.  We have the onslaught of Covid.  It is a perfect storm and unless we have key connectivity into hubs guaranteed once international air travel gets under way again, we are kidding ourselves.  I hope the Department will do everything it can in terms of route retention.</p> <p>  What has been well debated at our committee over the past 12 months is a real feeling that there is a need for a new policy for Irish aviation to rebalance what has become a very dominant position for Dublin Airport at the expense of others.  Is the Department working on new proposals and has it looked at the joint chambers of commerce proposal in terms of divvying out that share of aviation more equally to the regions?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1513" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021033000002#H00500"><p>In respect of connectivity, the &euro;26 million fund to which I referred earlier is compensation for businesses that have suffered damages due to Covid-19.  This will enable airports to be able to work directly with airlines to attract them, to put route incentives in place, to charge rebates and work with the airlines on their needs because, obviously, they must respond to the market and market demand.  What I wanted to do, as Minister of State with responsibility for this area, was to enable our airports because they are commercial entities and know their business very well.  Covid-19 was not their fault.  Many of them, Shannon included, were working very well in advance of this pandemic hitting.  That is part of this process regarding that roadmap and enabling them.</p> <p>  Like many airports, Shannon Airport is going through a very difficult time.  We have put in place &euro;32.1 million for Shannon and Cork Airports.  The European Commission has approved the &euro;26 million.  It is important to mention, and I know the Deputy has met with that group, that there is really strong stakeholder engagement with chambers of commerce in that region.  There is a huge tourism stakeholder group there.  I know marketing funds are available as well.  It is stakeholder groups like the ones mentioned by the Deputy that can help to draw on marketing funds to attract airlines to the mid-west region.  That is part of it as well.  There will be a number of approaches relating to the recovery and that balance.  We can certainly approach airlines to ask them to fly to Shannon and Cork Airports but, ultimately, it is a commercial decision for them.  There are other avenues with regard to tourism marketing funds, which is what we do very well.  </p></speech>

Everything the Minister of State said is very positive but it needs to happen at pace.  A lead-in period is always needed for aviation to recover and airlines to schedule flights for their coming season.</p> <p>  I have one final question on post offices.  I know a review is under way.  It concerns me that the review may not perfectly align with the June deadline for those postmasters who might face closure.  The answer to my next question is "Yes" or "No" and I hope the Minister of State answers "Yes".  Approximately 14 or 15 post offices closed during the Covid period.  They include Broadford in my constituency of Clare.  We do not live in magic wand territory where the Minister of State can go around reopening every post office that closed over the past number of decades but I ask that in their engagement with An Post, the Minister of State and her Department would commit to retendering those that closed during the Covid period because many of them closed in stealth.  Could she give that commitment?  </p></speech>

It is in the programme for Government that we need to ensure we have a sustainable and viable post office network.  Postmasters have a contract with An Post and this is a matter between postmasters and An Post.  They are commercial decisions with An Post.  That said, I have received Government approval to set up a high-level governmental group led by my Department but also involving the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to work with other Departments with regard to identifying offline services.  This work was done previously but this group must come back by the end of July.  I hear what the Deputy said in respect of the June deadline and the concerns relating to the post office network across the country and I assure him that everything is being considered and that we want to work with An Post and my colleagues in Government to ensure the post office network has a long-term future in terms of providing more services and to look at what we can do in the interim.</p></speech>

These are decisions that An Post must make.  An Post gave a commitment that there will be a post office in every community of more than 500 people and within 15 km of 95% of the rural population and 3 km of the urban population.  For example, all island post offices are being retained.  Where a post office in a Gaeltacht area closes, An Post will ensure that services through Irish are available at a neighbouring post office.  An Post has put in place commitments around the sustainability of and access to the post office network throughout the country.</p></speech>

I also attended the meeting yesterday with the chambers of commerce from Shannon, Limerick, Ennis and Galway along with the Irish Hotels Federation.  They are looking for engagement with the Minister and Minister of State.  I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment that she will sit down with this grouping to discuss the importance of the airport to the regions.  They are articulating a view that is based on fact.  We need supports for the airports not just now but in the future.</p><p>We will potentially need supports up to 2024 and possibly 2029.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, have included Shannon in the capital expenditure programme.  Operational moneys have been made available.  Some &euro;32.1 million has been made available to both Cork Airport and Shannon Airport.  It is of great importance that Shannon be retained within that programme in future and that multi-annual expenditure be injected into Shannon.  The airport is in competition with the airports in Kerry, Knock and Donegal.  While these airports have always received that type of support, Shannon has not.  We need a level playing field.  I strongly agree with the stakeholder group that this needs to happen.</p><p> With regard to the &euro;26 million connectivity fund agreed with Europe, how does the Minister of State intend for this money to be spent?  Has a decision been made in that regard?  Is it up to different airports to bid for it?  Will Shannon Airport get a particular proportion of that &euro;26 million fund?</p></speech>

Some &euro;6 million of the &euro;26 million fund is allocated to the regional airports in Knock, Kerry and Donegal.  The remaining &euro;20 million is allocated to the other airports.  It is up to the individual airports to assess their needs as regards required funding and to make applications to the Department.  I understand that work is under way and that engagement has commenced.  It is absolutely critical that we ensure our airports are protected, and I include Shannon Airport and the mid-west region in that.  The Deputy can be assured of my commitment to ensuring that protection.  That is why we have put in place significant funding for all of our airports, so that they can negotiate directly with airlines and ensure that their operational and capital costs are covered.  They know best what their needs are.  That is the way it should be.  They are commercial entities and were thriving before the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is important that we enable them to thrive again.</p> <p>  We are constantly reviewing the situation and we are in constant contact with the aviation sector.  My officials in the Department are in contact with the sector every week.  I met representatives of the chambers of commerce in the region and I share their concerns about tourism.  We are very reliant on international travel and what happens internationally affects us greatly, in addition to what happens here domestically.  That is why we are looking at what our European partners are doing with regard to the roll-out of the vaccine and the potential for digital certificates.  We are also looking at what the UK is doing, which includes the roadmap to be published on 21 April.  </p> <p>  I assure the Deputy that my door is always open.  I am constantly working and engaging with the industry, including through my work with that national civil aviation forum and the labour-employer economic forum, LEEF.  It is through that engagement and by working through a roadmap to recovery for the aviation sector that we will be able to come out of this safely.  That is the key message.  We are on the way out of the pandemic.  I am optimistic about that in light of the roll-out of the vaccine programme over the coming months.  There will be almost 1 million vaccinations a month in April, May and June.  I hope we will be in that place and we have to plan for that now, which is what we are doing.  Everything is under review.  We want to support our aviation sector while we get through this.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Minister of State has said she is working on a recovery plan for aviation.

I would love for them to return tomorrow.  As he will be aware, we are in putting in place mandatory hotel quarantine.  The Taoiseach will announce the Cabinet decision as to the new level of restrictions within the country at 6 p.m.</p> <p>  With regard to engagement with the sector, the national civil aviation development forum includes the CEOs of the main airlines.  I have met them.  The CEO of Shannon Group is also a member and our airports are represented.  This roadmap will be developed by those who work within the industry itself and who know how it works.  They will be able to shape the exit plan.  Of course, wider stakeholder engagement is absolutely critical.  The Deputy should be assured of my engagement with that sector and of that of my Department.  As regards the excellent work of this committee in respect of the task force, many of the recommendations the committee has made have been implemented by Government.  We are coming into a new phase now and a number of measures are being implemented immediately, in the medium term and during the longer-term recovery to ensure that we can move passengers safely through our airports.  An example of this is the digital green pass being considered at European level.  Each member state will now have to consider that.  The Government will have to do that and is doing so at the level of a senior officials group.  That engagement with industry will be key.  We cannot make decision on our own.  We have to engage with stakeholders and with the aviation industry, which we are doing.</p></speech>

Will the Minister of State raise that matter with him and ask him to set up that appointment with the group and to have that engagement?  He has agreed to do it.

At this very late stage in the process, when a date is looming, it seems that would be the most practical way to safeguard the network of post offices up and down the country and to prevent a large number of them from closing.  Does she support that initiative?  Will she provide the necessary &euro;17 million in annual funding to An Post to ensure the post office network is safeguarded?</p></speech>

I have, however, done extensive work in setting up a high-level group to look at offline potential for An Post.  There is a great deal of untapped potential for the post office network to take advantage of.  That is one project on which the Government is working.  We need to ensure An Post has a viable and sustainable future.  That work is evolving.  In the meantime, we are also considering what further measures we can put in place to support the network.  There is a lot of work under way in that regard.  Everything is being considered but no decisions have been made.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1528" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021033000002#K00100"><p>I cannot give a timeline in that regard as yet.  All I can say is that a significant volume of work is being done on this issue.  The importance of the post office network is a high priority for the Government and for me, as Minister of State with responsibility for this area.  I want to have a sustainable and viable post office network that can have a long-term future.  It has significant potential.  An Post has done significant work in respect of providing e-services and financial services but there is far more potential and post offices can provide many more public services.  We need to earmark that and work towards it, including by getting every Department that has a potential offline service to offer to examine how doing so through the post office network would work operationally.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021033000002#K00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming before the committee.  I welcome the commentary that everything that needs to be done in the context of post offices will be done.  Obviously, it makes sense for as many offline services as possible to be operated through the post office network  If that adds to their viability, it is sound business.  I add my voice to the previous commentary that time is of the essence in the context of the transformation that will go out of commission at the end of June.  There is serious worry in that regard, particularly in light of what the Irish Postmasters Union told the committee about 200 possible closures.  Obviously, that would leave us with a network that is not fit for purpose and we cannot allow that to happen.</p> <p>  The national broadband plan, NBP, is the most significant work for the Department, particularly in the area of communications.  Both the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Transport have engaged in conversations with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, regarding a possible acceleration of the plan.  There is an acceptance that there was a slight slowdown due to Covid-19 and at the end of the year which delayed progress slightly.  I spoke to NBI officials, who brought up possible difficulties relating to planning permission in the context of dealing with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the local authorities.  I spoke to the Minister and his officials on this issue.  Does the Minister of State have any update regarding possibilities for acceleration of the roll-out of the NBP?  Beyond that, is she aware whether any of the difficulties in respect of planning permission and giving NBI the capacity to do business as quickly as possible have been dealt with?  Is she aware of conversations the Minister or others have had with other vendors, that is, private operators, regarding possible short-term and interim solutions for people who may have to wait four, five or more years for the roll-out of the plan?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1530" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021033000002#K00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I think all present are in agreement on the importance of the NBP.  I have a vivid recollection of chairing a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment not too long ago, at which I and others were trying to convince certain people of the importance of the plan.  It is great that members of all parties and none are advocating for the plan and its acceleration.  There has been significant engagement on it.  It is at the forefront of all our minds now, with Covid-19 and many people working from home.  There has been significant engagement with the Department, local authorities and the CEOs in respect of issues being resolved there and the urgency around that.  It is important.  If the Deputy is aware of particular issues, I ask him to please also raise them with the Minister.  The Department is aware of the issues and we are working with the local authorities to try to unlock any of those challenges and do whatever we can to accelerate the roll-out.  The Government and the Minister will be writing to NBI with regard to that acceleration process and will continuously applying pressure to ensure we get that delivery.</p> <p>  NBI expects that 60,000 premises will be passed in 2021, across 17 deployment areas, including premises in counties Cork, Galway, Cavan, Limerick, Kerry, Wexford, Wicklow, Monaghan, Roscommon, Carlow, Tipperary, Louth, Mayo and Sligo.  All present are acutely aware of the need to accelerate this process but Covid has had an impact on it.  Of course, that does not negate the fact that we need to ensure we do everything we can to unlock any challenges or blockages within local authorities and put in place whatever assistance is necessary.</p></speech>

When the Minister gets further information regarding an updated distribution timeline, I ask for that information to be made available to the committee because it is vital.  Does the Minster of State have any information regarding whether the Minister or the T&aacute;naiste, in their conversations with private operators, have considered or discussed interim solutions that could get people who are in the intervention area through the gap, for want of a better term, in the sense that they may otherwise have to wait several years for the roll-out of the NBP?</p></speech>

I am sure all present are acutely aware of the importance of the acceleration process.  We all wish to hear any updates in that regard.  I have just received confirmation that discussions are ongoing with NBI regarding other operators trying to fill in the gap.</p></speech>

It is the holistic solution.  Some people will need a short-term solution which, obviously, we should endeavour to provide.</p> <p>  In fairness to Deputy O'Rourke, he referred to some of the supports that are necessary, whether that is for taxi drivers, driving instructors or others.  Sinn F&eacute;in dealt with the issue of driving instructors not too long ago.  Some of these support-type projects do not necessarily relate to the Department but it is a conversation that needs to be followed up.  Sinn F&eacute;in sent in a submission regarding driving instructors.  Many of them are falling between the gaps in the context of supports, as are taxi drivers and certain others.  That conversation needs to be had with the T&aacute;naiste and his Department.  Obviously, the Department of Transport should add its weight on the matter.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State and the Department are consistently and constantly reviewing supports for airlines.  Will supports being considered by the Government include supports for workers and ensure that workers' rights and employment are maintained where necessary?  We wish to keep the whole system going.  It is about supports for families and all the workforce such that we maintain society through Covid and have something that is fit for operation both in terms of society overall and these parts of our economy.</p></speech>

One is with the national civil aviation development forum, which I referenced earlier.  The CEOs of the airlines and the airports are represented on that body.  The second group is the LEEF, which I chair and which is attended by delegations from ICTU and IBEC.  Several issues were raised at the LEEF regarding employees.  Departmental officials also attend those meetings.  There is also engagement between the Departments of Social Protection and Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the matter.  The Deputy can rest assured that there is ongoing engagement on several levels from the point of view of employees as well as the airlines.</p></speech>

It might be possible to get the answer to my next question in writing.  I am seeking an update with regard to the issues the committee dealt with previously in respect of Brexit and some of the difficulties that existed for hauliers, etc., in dealing with Revenue, the interoperability of systems and so on and accepting that a significant issue was caused by many British firms not having prepared for Brexit.</p></speech>

Briefly, there is significant engagement with Revenue.  What we were trying to do before 1 January was to send the message to businesses, including exporters and importers, that they should engage with Revenue.  Those that do so will get assistance and be held by the hand and brought through the online system for getting their goods through customs, HSE checks or whatever the issues were.  Those services and offers are still available.</p><p>I will get the Deputy an update on how that is going.  I commend the officials in all the Departments.  It was not easy and we never said it was.  Brexit was always going to be difficult, deal or no deal, and I commend the work that is happening behind the scenes.  I know it has not been plain sailing for many companies but there has been considerable work done and preparation put in place on this matter.  It could have been a bigger issue.  I am not saying it is over because it is never over but the supports and help are there for businesses that engage.</p></speech>

That amount appears to have gone up by two and a half times.  It has increased by &euro;738,000 from &euro;507,000 to &euro;1.245 million while the numbers of staff have dropped by 20% from 2,187 to 1,753.  Why is that the case?</p></speech>

There are no target outputs for either 2020 or 2021.  The main point I am trying to make is that within such a fast-moving area, the Department does not appear to have any plans to publish.  This is a national cybersecurity strategy that is now two years old and we have not seen it.  It was supposed to apply from 2019 to 2024.  Where does that strategy stand?

They are working with Department officials on that matter.  There will be ongoing engagement between the airports and officials within the Department about their needs.  That also informs us as to the sustainability of the airports and suggests what further supports may be required.  As I said to colleagues earlier, this ongoing engagement with Department officials is critical and has always been done.  We are into a new phase of Covid-19 now and there will be a prolonged recovery within the aviation sector, as we are all aware.  Every analyst is saying that.</p></speech>

Aer Lingus is due to get financial support from the State.  I am a representative of Limerick city and we, in the mid-west region, believe that support must be conditional on providing connectivity outside of Dublin.  Aer Lingus's Heathrow and transatlantic connections are hugely important to us in the mid-west and right along the western seaboard, up to Galway and down to Kerry.  Is that issue the subject of discussion?</p></speech>

I can say that ISIF funding is available to all airports and airlines.  That is open to them to avail of.  The Chairman is correct about the transatlantic connectivity.

The Minister of State might take that on board.  If Aer Lingus, or any airline, is getting significant State supports, there has to be a commitment to the regions.  That is the key point.</p> <p>  A review of Shannon Airport and Shannon Group was to be carried out by the Department.  Where does that stand at the moment?

We have held public hearings about the driving test and a couple of issues came up on which I would like to get the Minister of State's view.</p><p>Essential workers who have not been able to complete their 12 hours of approved driving instruction are unable to sit the driving test, yet some test centres are not using all the driving testers available.  Will the Minister of State consider ensuring that, under the current round, these essential workers can complete their 12 hours of approved driving instruction?  Second, will she ensure those whose jobs are not deemed essential but who require a car for work and who have completed the required 12 hours of approved driving instruction can apply for a test at the driving test centres that have spare capacity?  Can the RSA be assisted to allow it to expedite the rolling out of online driver theory tests?  Will the Minister of State give me her perspective on that?  We will be writing to the RSA and Department about it.  What does the Minister of State envisage enfolding over the coming short period?</p></speech>

The RSA is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints, and it is working in close consultation with my Department on the matter.  It needs to be understood, however, that there are no easy solutions, unfortunately.  I have been trying to find easy solutions but, unfortunately, it is just not possible with the restrictions.  The RSA is looking at increasing the number of tests per day to seven, and it is in discussions with testers on this.  It will be possible only if the safety of testers and candidates can be ensured.  The RSA is also considering longer opening hours, additional time on weekdays, Saturday openings and an increase in the number of testers.  As the Chairman will probably know, I gave sanction to hire 40 additional driving testers along with the 36 approved for retention-----</p></speech>

There appears to be spare capacity in some test centres because an insufficient number of essential workers have completed the 12 hours of instruction.  Therefore, could there be latitude to allow the approved driving instructors to work so essential workers can complete the required number of hours?  Second, where there is spare capacity in a test centre and there is not the requisite number of essential workers in a position to apply for the driving test, could others who have completed 12 hours of approved driver instruction apply for a driving test?  Could this be examined?  Will the Minister of State consider that?  When does she expect a decision will be made on driving tests?</p></speech>

I am sure they are doing everything possible to try to reduce the delay and accommodate the people affected.</p> <p>  On the funding the Minister of State announced recently, I very much welcome the funding for Safe Routes to School and cycling infrastructure for schools.  It is important.  Much of the congestion in our towns in the mornings is associated with the school run.  It is generally created because there are no safe cycling and walking routes to school.  Parents, including me, are very apprehensive about letting a child out on a bicycle to cycle the last kilometre or 1,500 m to the school gate because the route is so congested with traffic.  The funding is critical and much needed.</p> <p>  Let me also refer to the funding announced this week for infrastructure in rural parts.  We cannot have a divide whereby we are focusing on urban infrastructure and not rural infrastructure.  We will have to play our part in this.  Rural towns and villages also suffer from congestion in the morning.  Safety issues arise when so many cars try to crowd into spaces.  When I get an opportunity to walk my children to school in the morning, I see children and parents on scooters and bicycles.  They are all on the footpath.  All the space is given over to cars parked along the roadside.  We need to flip the focus so it is on the more vulnerable people, not the people sitting in the metal boxes.  The funding is really important.  I hope it will be rolled out over the next couple of years.  I hope there is a repeat roll-out of the funding because where people see examples of it working, they will ask why they cannot have it for their town.  Surety of funding and of its being rolled out affords an opportunity to show the arrangement works.  That is very welcome.  I thank the Minister of State for the funding.</p> <p>  Yesterday, the Minister for Rural and Community Development launched a rural strategy.  Part of it involves a focus on and an increase for the Local Link rural buses.  Rural buses will be critical to rural towns and villages.  Those who live in them should have an opportunity to leave the car behind and to have a reliable, frequent bus service.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Climate Action last week, one of the witnesses, a UK consultant, stated the UK considered both the possibility of rural towns with a population under a certain size having an hourly bus service and the cost.  It was really costly but it is the type of ambition we need to have.  There cannot just be a bus service every three or four hours.  A service has to be practical so people can use it to go to and come home from work and to access recreation and education.  We really need to have a high ambition for rural bus services.  What is the Minister of State's view on this?  What is her position on rural bus links and their importance in reducing carbon emissions, which is our primary objective, but also in providing the connectivity needed in rural areas so people can live in them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-30a.1588" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021033000002#M01500"><p>I thank the Deputy.  He raised several really good programmes.  I am delighted he did because it is important that I get a chance to discuss them.  A lot of the funding is for rural areas.  Just yesterday, the &euro;72 million active travel budget for rural towns and villages was announced.  When people hear of walking and cycling strategies and active travel, they immediately think of urban centres.  It is critical to service rural areas.  The Government is committed to ensuring we roll out safe cycling and walking infrastructure, and it is committed to spending almost &euro;1 million per day on it.  Our rural towns and villages are key to that.  Part of the process involves what the Deputy mentioned, namely the Safe Routes to School programme.  That can work with the wider active travel program, filling in the gaps in the footpath to the town or village and perhaps connecting it with the local greenway.  The infrastructure is not just for schoolchildren; it will be used by entire communities.  It is a matter of determining how to keep the school gateway safe and working with the schools.</p> <p>  What we are asking through the Safe Routes to School programme, and this is an important message to get out, is that the schools lead on this.  That is why the Minister for Education and I wrote to every secondary and primary school in the country asking them to go online and fill out a form expressing their interest in working with An Taisce Green-Schools on solutions for them.  Just because one is in a rural area does not mean there are no solutions; there are.  It is by being innovative and working with the local authority, through An Taisce Green-Schools, that we could have what I would like to see after the first round of funding for Safe Routes to School.</p><p> The Deputy asked if this would be provided every year.  That is what we want, namely, a rolling fund for this every year.  In this context, I want to see examples of rural, suburban and city centre schools and to have models we can replicate throughout the country.  Perhaps a school where the authorities believe they could not do anything in this respect as the school is in a difficult area in terms of dealing with traffic issues would see another leader, example or model where it worked well.  This will be the start of an exciting roll-out of walking and cycling infrastructure throughout the country.</p><p> Regarding Local Link, it is tapped into that whole rural agenda around which the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, launched a new rural strategy yesterday.  It is absolutely critical.  The NTA is also planning a two-phrased approach to consultation on connecting Ireland, of which the members may have heard.  The consultation is with stakeholder engagement.  The first is local and regional authorities.  It started in October 2020 on the main concepts of connecting Ireland.  The NTA has identified a requirement to undertake a study of public transport services in non-urban markets - this links in to what the Deputy said about rural Ireland - to inform its approach to rolling out improved public transport across the country, ultimately enabling the NTA to present its vision for a countrywide-connected, low-carbon, public transport network.  This is an important and exciting programme that taps into what the Deputy said.  It is important all of us and our local councillors engage with the local authorities.  We are providing the funding and the resources to do it, but the big challenge will be the implementation and the roll-out of all these projects.</p></speech>

I note the continued funding for the Road Safety Authority.  When its representatives appeared before the committee, we raised the issue that parking on footpaths blocks them and creates difficulties for people with mobility issues, children or people pushing buggies etc.  Another safety issue I would like the Road Safety Authority to address is the idling of cars outside schools - I am pleased there is funding for the authority.  That may allow the authority to pursue an education campaign on this and the difficulty it creates in air quality and particulate matter, especially for the vulnerable young lungs of our children as they go into school.  It would be an education campaign to let motorists know of the danger created when car engines are left idling outside a school.</p></speech>
